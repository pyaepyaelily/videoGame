2017-12-02,0,0,1044,False,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS or PUBG or Plunkbat (as one of those gaming news sites keeps calling it) is my game of the year 2017.I'm aware there are many issues not just with the gameplay (garbage optimization servers crashing hackers broken vehicle physics buggy parachutes weird gunplay broken terrain server tick rate problems) but outside of the gameplay aswell (the whole advertisements in china the stream sniping issues and the early lootboxes thing). But the thing is THE BASE GAME IS JUST SO MUCH FUN.I'm not going to write much more here as you can read other peoples reviews to get more details of the game. All i want you to know is that for me pubg is a multiplayer gaming experience i have NEVER had before and it's amazing. So far i've put in nearly 300 hours and with the big 1.0 update coming out this month i expect to easily triple that time in 2018. I absolutely recommend this amazing game.20th of December 2018 EDIT So I posted this review over a year ago now and I want to give it a small update to reflect some of the changes the game has gone through.Firstly the buggy vehicle and parachute physics and weird gunplay issues that I mentioned previously are in my opinion no longer a part of the game and have been fixed. I would also argue that the game is much more optimized than it was a year ago.There's also been a bunch of content added and all the new guns and vehicles are great and really do add to the game overall. The added crates and event passes are really hit or miss but they've never bothered me as it's always just been cosmetics.The last thing I'm gonna talk about in this short review edit is the four maps (Yep 4 we only had 1 map when I originally reviewed PUBG) that are currently playable in game.Erangel The classic still really good but compared to some of the other maps it can feel a bit dated. I would absolutely love if Bluehole decided to pull Erangel out of rotation for a few months to give it a much needed overhaul and a new coat of paint but if they never do thats alright as it's still super fun.Miramar Not gonna lie out of the 970 hours I've put into PUBG I'm certain that Miramar claims at least 1/3 of that time. It's really good and the final circles can be insane. It was easily the best map for a pretty long time.Sanhok Yeah so Sanhok isn't bad by any means but man I just cannot find myself getting the enjoyment out of this map that I get from the other 3 maps. The design is GOOD but I don't enjoy the whole ""Mini Royale"" thing it has going on. It's fun but only when I (rarely) feel like it.Vikendi wow. Just wow. I am blown away by the quality of this map. When I heard it was 6x6 I thought it wasn't going to be my thing just like Sanhok but boy was I wrong. On the first day alone it has easily become my favourite map out of the four and I can't wait to play more of it.So yeah like I stated in my original review I did end up over tripling my play time in PUBG and with the way the game is going now? I wouldn't be surprised if I was in the 1600 hour range this time next year. It's still an absolute recommendation from me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-23,0,0,748,False,Recommended,September 2017 Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is the best multiplayer game out right now even though it is still in Early Access. It has good balancing and it's a lot of fun with friends in duo or squad. Solo is also a fun mode and challenging at the same time. the only problems at the moment are with the servers but im sure they will be fixed when the game proceides out of Early Access.June 2018 This game is not what it used to be they are adding bad patches that are supposed to make the game better but they just take away all the fun. The game is almost unplayable and it is still optimized very badly.If they start focusing on important stuff and maybe don't add throwable apples to the lobbys the game will be playable again one day.September 2018 It is getting better.Playing is sometimes fun again. It is kind of annoying that they are adding new weapons all the time (QBZ QBU Berryl etc.) and the new map choice thing (Battle Mini Royale) is trash.If the game stays like this I'll be okay with it eventhough it is still far from good. I'm just scared Bluehole is going to add millions of horrible patches that destroy the game again.Sanhok is probably the only playable map because it's the most fast paste but you still don't have midgame at all and the rounds get boring pretty quickly.December 2018 The new snow map is on the Test Servers right now and I've got to say it's really good.It has the perfect size (6x6) and they left the zone moving times from Sanhok which were to slow for Sanhok but just right for Vikendi.I FINALLY HAVE MIDGAME ALMOST EVERY ROUND!And I'm fine with the G36C but only because It got added with a new map in an huge update.The only things that suck is that you can't play it in Duos yet.I wonder how the map is going to play on the live servers.The map is now available on the live servers.The problem is Due to more players playing the game right now the servers are kind of overloaded.And the challenges in the battlepass often don't refresh correctly and it says that you haven't finished a challenge yet etc.The items in the Vikendi pass are pretty alright although I'm slightly regretting to buy the pass.(Reviewing this game feels like a very weird unpleasent rollercoaster ride.),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-04,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,I started playing PUBG way after the hype train that carried this game to the top charts at the beginning of 2018.By then I expected that all the bugs desync lag netcode problems (and so on...) were sorted out by the devs.That didn't happen...and still appears not to be happening...and probably will not happen in a near future...The game is very fun playing solo or with squads but the sheer quantity abundance or proliferance (whatever you may want to call it...) of bugs issues and lack of optimization ruins the game in its core.Desync makes you being killed time after time way after you have disappeared from the enemies' line of sight...Lag is constant in the servers probably because there is no region selection in the main menu...WELL DONE DEVS...wanna catch a weapon in the floor by pressing F in front of it...? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!!!!Also the shooting mechanics are strange and unreliable even considering that these mechanics are better than many other FPS games. Sometimes you aim your crosshair directly in front of an enemy and the bullet goes way up...I really don't get it and I have a hard time trying to figure it out....Is it me? Is it the game?...I don t know....Even so the sheer quantity and diversity of guns as well as all their characteristics are very well developed like the different recoil patterns and behaviours for each gun the importance of attachments (that you pick on the map) for upgrading your weapons making it more reliable and most likely allowing for an advantage over your enemy's weapons and so on...With all these issues ( and I am only pointing out a few...) how can you expect to fully enjoy and experience this game when all these issues MAKE THE CORE OF THIS GAME...?The game needs serious and urgent optimization not updates with new weapons or maps. Why have MORE and MORE when you can't even play the game in its basic level of optimization?Either way the game is a lot of fun and is the one of the most well ballanced shooters I have ever played!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The new snow map has givin me a reason to play this game more and more. I also went ahead and bought the new battle pass they have the challenges aren't very interesting and they are sometimes boring but it gives you something more to do it gives you more of a reason to get those challenges done and progress further. Overall PUBG is a decent game they need to reimplement server lock I've always have had bad experiences with other countries (ASIA ESPECIALLY) being toxic and cheating like crazy.

Shame on me I can t believe I wasted so much time with this garbage disguised as a game. I did play PUBG for about 10 hours and I already was convinced that is one of the best games I ve ever played. I don t care what all the people say about the chinese hackers (Chinah Numbah Won) or the laggy servers it s about the gameplay and that is pretty good. The much more needed skill combined with the more realistisc mechanics (let s just forget about the physics of the vehicles) make this game actually damn hard if you re not a pro gamer with high aiming skils. On the other hand that s the reason why it s always special for me when I get into the top 10 or even win a game. Take that Epic Games! Your game is so easy that I got bored of getting to the top 10 after a week. Not to mention the terrible cartoon everything is not brutal graphics and the 20$ autism skins that look worse than Sonic fanart on DeviantArt.

2017-12-01,0,0,568,False,Not Recommended,In Early Access Great game needs a lot of work but for early access it's great. If you get killed behind walls it's server lag.after 1.0 Game is broken beyond comprehension. If you like getting shot from behind walls and cover play this game. If you want to play against cheaters who shoot you in the head from across the map in 3rd person play this game. Playerunknowns is dying no one wants to play this garbage of a game because the devs can't fix anything or balance it. they cant fix the servers they cant stop cheaters. overall wonderful game. i love it. highly recommend if you enjoy the things above.I tried playing this again because I heard they made a lot of changes. Nope barely any changes. Dropping mechanic still better but over all game mechanic still sucks. Consistenly get killed behind a wall because of server latency.

When I play Blackout I actually feel like I can be aggressive and play how I'd like. In PUBG you are awarded far too high for passive play. Also the graphics are awful in this game (but that hardly affects my decision not to suggest this garbage). I've wasted too many hours getting better at a game that has a very low skill ceiling.

2018-10-20,0,0,299,False,Not Recommended,I love this game. I love the gameplay and the maps. I absolutely love the rush that comes with a win. Why the non recommend? It's going nowhere. This game was so much at first until you saw all that it had to offer. It gets you invested. It takes away your fun when all you want is a win. After awhile the game just starts to feel lacking. The bugs and glitches aren't the problem (Well main problem). It's the stagnant form of the game. The devs aren't listening to feedback and FIX pubg pretty much did nothing. The new events almost filled the void of varitey other games have. Adding new skins and hats doesn't help. It seems like smokes and mirrors of a dying game. Even after all of this and I still loved it poured hours into it. I feel I can say the most postive things about this game but the drawbacks are to much even for me.

The gameplay can be good but it depends on the RNG and your luck. Good variety of maps which all provide a good experience all around. The game isn't as well optimized yet but it's becoming easier to run the game on slower machines such as mine although I still suffer FPS issues in certain areas of each map but that's just due to my CPU not being good enough.

2017-11-13,0,0,246,False,Not Recommended,I had to buy a second account on another Steam profile as I was banned for hacking. The only reason I did this is because my friends love the game and kept playing.My Steam account now has a VAC cheater warning on my profile that I cannot hide. Very unhappy about this! I've never hacked or cheated in any online game and no idea why this happened. I contacted the support team who seem to think I was running a 3rd party app or something in the background. Fair enough that's what your system thinks BUT you cannot tell me exactly what I was doing/running.I suspect one of two things happened Either Voice Attack or Sandboxie apps I run on my PC triggered the anti cheat OR I used my Steam account at a LAN centre on a PC that was infected with a virus or running something dodgy. Voice Attack is used for Elite Dangerous to activate ship functions with voice commands and Sandboxie is used so I can run two Steam accounts on one PC. Neither software would aid me in PUBG.I have tried talking to devs/using support just get standard responses. I had a chat with a developer via the main forums but wasn't willing to help once I couldn't prove either way. They did investigate at the lan centre I went to as they live local but basically no proof either way!If you ban my 2nd account I'll never touch another product by your company again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It runs fine now for me so I guess they finally optimized it. Also the new maps are really fun and feel pretty balanced. At it's state right now I would definitely recommend this game again.////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// POST 1.0+/FULL RELEASE NON RECOMMENDATION I wrote my previous positive review in early access with around 350 hours in the game after the game entered 1.0 I had high hopes however those hopes were crushed. I want to love PUBG now like I did then but I don't. I could deal with bugs bad netcode and poor optimization. I have had this game since 2 weeks after its release on steam and can after 500+ hours say that I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME... anymore. Game breaking bugs and crashes have not been fixed good updates are non existent netcode and hit registration hasn't been fixed the game is still poorly optimized and it's still filled with hackers. These things were acceptable to me on release and through early access I accepted what I was buyinng but they did not fully release a finished polished game which breaks my heart. Please Bluehole make PUBG great again or is it better or finally great. I don't know at this point but if you get anything from this review forget about PUBG don't buy it don't care about it move on (unless they do something amazing and completely turn this of a dev process around).////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// EARLY ACCESS RECOMMENDATION REVIEW I absolutely love this game. I really like the direction it's going in terms of gameplay. I love the fact that it get more optimized with every patch. I hate campers and bridge trolls.

The vehicles handle like they should. No other game has a gun feel this good. This is hands down my favorite game.Old Review I love this game and I hate it so much. The concept is great and I enjoy most of the gameplay. But seriously I have no idea what the devs are thinking 95% of the time. The optimization is trash. Hot steaming trash. There are bugs... oh my god are there bugs. I'll parachute out of the sky and land on flat tar but somehow take falling damage. You'll be driving down the road on a motorcycle and then instantly get shot 100 feet into the air doing flips until you land on your head. Instead of fixing these blatant issues the devs are more concerned with implementing gun skins and game modes that are for third person perspective. A turd is still a turd no matter how much you shine it. Fix the game then add the fancy crap. I would quit this game so fast if it wasn't so fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-02-09,0,0,753,False,Recommended,Overall it's a fun game that will keep you wanting to play more purely because of the small chance of winning. Early on the game was plagued with bugs and issues which have been slowly but surely worked on by the devs. Yes the game is not perfect and still has its issues but it is MUCH better than when it first started. Performance is ok if you have a reasonable system but don't even bother if you own a potato as it will ruin the enjoyment of the game for you.There is a reason this game gained such popularity and that is the adrenaline rush you get in the final moments of the match trying to get that chicken dinner.

(while descending there is no opponent around you but after landing there is at least one) After almost a month rest on 2019.02.07 the game have a new feature for me with unchanged hardware configuration &gt During the loading screen after a game round it is not responding and have to bee killed from task manager. Changing review recommendation and adding some update information on 2019 01 14 see details in CONS. REVIEW IN A NUTSHELLPurchached last year and from that time I this game played on various system configurations (on bare metal PC Laptop Virtualization CPU i5 4/0 core i7 4/8 core r7 8/16 core RAM 8 32GB with ONBOARD dedicated graphics Q1000M and with gtx560ti 1GB gtx1060 3GB gtx1070ti 8GB as DEDICATED and/or EXTERNAL graphics through exp GDC Beast platform. Gameplay with the the gtx560ti 1GB was like reading a comic book it was funny but it worked. Later when I changed my card to gtx1060 the joy was way better more fluid but with the gtx1070ti was the best for me (despite of random smaller lags). Under VM with i7 4/8 core and 12GB RAM and 1060 and some optimalized settings the game worked well.My hardware related impression based on the above better hardver better results. However they released some optimalizations since so the step from 1060 to 1070ti was not really necessary for 1080p the 1060 should be enough.My opinion according to the gameplay it is OK for solo play as a training to your reflexes hiding players always causing some freak and pulse rate peak but it is better with friends especially whom talking and listening to each other as a TEAM.Not bad for the first game.PROS fun to play solo or duo/squad with mates guaranteed long lasting game experience even it has been released still not completed &gt see the roadmap caring regular fixes and improvements from time to time most of major bugs have been fixed today slow but continuous evolving occasional events the implemented in game echelon initiation is good steam achievementsCONS UPDATE 2019 01 14 BANNED for griefing in Miramar reported by a squad team ""mate"" (ranked way below me in the ladder) who left the team before the other three player could landed. He left the plane at 0 27 and was visible till 0 30 in the replay. The remaining team played further more 7 8 minutes together until finished in a fight with other two teams. In that round I made 3 frags with a total of 314 damage (rank B+) while the reporter played 18 58 minutes (rank C) without any assistance for the team leaving them behind (THIS is griefing and UNFAIR play). Yes I know this is battle royale but TEAM battle royale. Meanwhile he cannot be reported properly (1 minute before and after the case sent for investigation from the replay but the guy is not even visible in my circle at the time when he betrayed us). According to the replay video I cannot see any missbehavior against the game rules from my side. ""Nice"" time eater ) violent annoying desync causing losing situation in a fight still not complete despite of it was already released still has issues which can be frustrating sometimes still needs some optimisation which is better over time cheaters / griefers graphics is OK but needs an updateA pack of some annoying/missing features/bugs as known today when the review was written On foot cannot step automatically on to a little bit higher surface. eg crashed plane wing piece you have to jump / vault or go around slow vaulting not enough predictive vaulting not really working every time (eg when trying to get out from water near to Impala between the hill and the north island) randomly falling from half meter above ground can causing damage (eg falling from a mound in the foot of the mountain on the east side of Pecado) jumping down from extreme high in certain points does not do any damage (eg jumping down to a tree anywhere in Sanhok)In vehicle random collision with non visible surface elements causing damage to player(s)Other even when preloading the map there is no instantly visible weapons after entering the play area (room or warehouse or rooftop) weird in game ui no detailed on screen information about the apparel instead there are annoying tutorial titles about key combinations by default (of course you can turn it off somewhere in the settings) even after 400 hours of play time weird weapon behavior eg AR/AMG when picking up not automatic by default or eg gun sticks in the wall which makes aiming harder guns are way too loud even with supressor targeting enemy still not perfect it would be nice like in RoE statistical settings not saved every time it has to be set again missing weapon statistics and documentations (of course it can be found online) lack of detailed player statistics in menu (eg charts) or in game (eg about teammates) lack of detailed reporting feature in game team management still not complete and buggy (eg despite of muting a specific player I still can hear it and the only solution is to mute team under sound settings) lack of multi monitor support eg tripple monitor support or monitor separation like the following portion middle fight screen left inventory right map would be really nice",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Review will be from the first perspective.Being quite familiar with the first game my partner and I were super excited for more cooking chaos but ultimately we didn't feel the game is worth the money. The first three/four worlds we 3 starred everything on our first try just from familiarity with the game the throwing mechanic has a lot of potential and the Kevin levels were a lot of fun but in the end it feels like we only got about 12 levels of actual difficulty.Overcooked 2 was the time to add in a level editor not switches on the world map (what are those even for anyway?). Make the game replayable maybe a new game+ that you can select at the start if you're familiar with OC already/unlocked at the end of story that changes up the base game. OC2 isn't a sequel it's just the definitive version of OC1.,Overcooked! 2

2018-08-13,3,44,59,False,Recommended,I loved the first one. My friends and I had so much fun playing the first Overcooked!. And I couldn't hide my excitement when I first heard THIS would come to bless us. It was really hard to play only locally together. So we were really really excited. The anticipation has been killing me.However I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed after playing the game. Given that all I wanted was the online coop feature I should be happy. Happy that they at least gave me that.When playing there are so many things going on on the screen that it's hard for me to focus on the order. I don't exactly know why. Maybe it's because the map design is now more complicated or something. Maybe the devs wanted us to feel like that. I don't know. But it's whatever. I'll get used to it. No big deal.But the thing is the difficulty has been significantly reduced. We make all the mistakes and still get 3 stars with unbelievable scores. With like 4 5 fails and I still get a 3 star. Did I mention it was hard to focus and read the orders? It doesn't matter whether I read orders correctly or not. It doesn't even matter if I don't read the orders at all. I still get the damn 3 stars every single time.When I played the first one with my stupid unorganized but still happy like idiots friends we retried so many times just to get one level done with 3 stars. Now it's too easy peasy lemon squeasy. TOO EASY. There's no accomplishment there's no joy after (finally) beating one stupid level. Getting 3 star in this game gives me no feelings because it's so freaking easy. Oh the emptiness. No point to retry or replay.It seriously needs a fix. At least it can be fixed relatively easily right? Please please please fix the scoring system. I can't be more grateful that the devs decided to make a sequel. I'm really happy and thankful for it.Just please fix the scoring system. Make it harder for us to achieve the stars!,Overcooked! 2

2019-01-31,5,199,27,False,Recommended,This game has me emotional in a way I can t explain. I ve loved the Resident Evil series with a fiery passion ever since I played my very first entry with Code Veronica X on the PS2. After I finished playing the hell out of that game I devoured every Resident Evil title I could get my hands on and was a dedicated fan (even wrote my share of fan fiction) all the way up until Resident Evil 6 which thoroughly ripped my heart to shreds with what the series had become. While RE7 was something of a return to form despite the first person perspective it was missing the one thing I loved so much about these games the characters. I didn't realize until now how badly I missed my time with them but stepping into Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield s shoes again felt like coming home.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1639405393That said I was terrified that like so many overly hyped high profile titles these days that Resident Evil 2 would stumble and miss the mark. But let me tell you they nailed it. THEY NAILED IT! Granted the story has been somewhat simplified and the B scenarios feel rushed and a bit tacked on (likely a result of the devs not wanting to disappoint the fans when word leaked that they wouldn t be included) but those are miniscule grievances when the rest of the game is so supremely satisfying. Everything that I loved about the series is back and it all looks sounds and feels so good that I m literally getting choked up right now just typing this.Even the swap to over the shoulder camera feels fitting and natural and I ve long been a champion of fixed camera angles. But the way the action is framed the long dark endless corridors the creatures that lurk in the shadows the terrifying sounds they make it all makes up for the loss. Fortunately the characters don t move with quite as much agility as they do in post RE4 titles either. There s no dodge button no quick time events no counterattacks. If you re grabbed by a zombie you either shove a grenade down its throat or suffer the consequences. This heightens the suspense tremendously. No matter how heinous the foe you need to tread carefully and wisely.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1640404534And that's not even mentioning how much better the writing and acting is. The dialogue actually sounds somewhat believable albeit cliche at times and the interactions between characters are so much more organic than they used to be (thank goodness there s no I love you moment ) All of this is elevated by the voice actors giving great performances which really help bring these characters to life. We already know who bad super agent Leon S. Kennedy is but it s refreshing watching the rookie cop become the man we all know and love.I honestly could continue gushing about the game for several more paragraphs but there s already thousands of reviews that ll say the exact same thing. So I ll just say this if you re an old school Resident Evil fan and you can get past the modernization of a classic then you need to play this game. YOU NEED IT! This is old school survival horror in a gorgeous new wrapping and every bit as good as the original.Curated by Chudah's Corner,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-31,0,0,24,False,Recommended,Been Playing RE2 since launch night and by far this is one of the best remakes Capcom has done and IMO they have completely revived the RE franchise and added a few suprises at it. I am currently being chased by Mr. X/Tyrant and yes it can get frustrating at times but I think he hads an uplift to thje game and keeps you on your toes trying to figure out how to avoid/get around him and knowing he is never in the same place twice if you restore from a safe game. I also like that capcom cleaned up the story some without altering it and actually may have expanded the overall story (I haven't played Claire's campaign yet and if memory is correct Ada was never a playable storyline until now). I would like to see RE3 Nemisis be done in the same fashion or as a DLC add on maybe? (The story arcs do take place in roughly the same time lines afterall.) I would also like to see RE Code Veronica (True RE3) be remade in the same fashion. This is how Resident Evil 8 should be too and bring back Albert Wesker lol.

Their interactions with the environment and set pieces make them unpredictable and more terrifying. The mystery of if you actually killed the ers after unloading clips into their heads and the tension filled close encounters made me open up images of puppies on my second monitor. More so when fedora man showed up.Graphically speaking this game is jaw dropping. Playing maxed out with correctly calibrated brightness settings makes it the most immersive horror game I've played to date. The textures are extremely detailed (if 12.3GB vram is anything to say about that). Animation across all the characters and monsters is excellent facial animations especially. There were a few unnatural visual effects on shiny surfaces later in the game but it didn't take from the experience at all. Best of all the game is very optimized. It runs great!Gameplay is spot on. The survival elements tailored by the gloomy atmosphere truly had me on my toes. I was always worried about running out of ammo during boss fights and when facing zombies in tight corridors. Challenging harder enemies felt like something you really had to prepare for both resourcefully and emotionally. Exploring the environments and investigating the cause behind the whole mess was intriguing. As for controls and menus screens I can see them being a slight nuisance to some but for someone as myself that has played the majority of the games in the franchise they felt great.The story behind this game as it was in 1998 is well crafted and intriguing. It made me invested in the series wanting to play the rest of the games in the series that I haven't played to learn more about this universe.Overall 10/10 Highly recommendAnother thing If you are playing using headphones enable binaural audio to make those lunging zombie shrieks give you the stuff of nightmares,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-01-31,0,0,17,False,Recommended,I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy and this remake is more than worthy. It's super fun and scary as a good Resident Evil game should be.What makes it even better as modern game is that graphics are top notch since release day there are no perfomance issues or bugs at least in my experience. Even better there are no DLCs that you have to buy to extend the game. Capcom delivered a full game. The only DLCs are custometic and you have to put effort to unlock weapons (like the original) instead of buying them seperatly as a DLC like every other AAA game today.

This is what enjoyed for the first playthrough with Leon (route A so to say) on hardcore as you have to be preserving those ink ribbons and ammo.Then I played Claire (route B) on hardcore and it was so easy sadly it was slightly dissapointing. Felt so overpowered with the weapons and you had so many ink ribbons it was insane. It kinda broke the feeling I had when playing through with Leon on the first playthrough as then you had to be sparse with the saving plus the weapons were a lot weaker.Graphically it is good looking and the atmosphere is spot on with the music and sounds.I did enjoy playing through the game and exploring every part of it and can easily recommend it.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-03,0,0,8,False,Recommended,I was never a fan of the old Resident Evil game's tank controls and fixed camera. So this remake makes this much more fun to play. This is a decent game and if you don't buy it now then get it when it hits a sale or find it a key site with a good price.So is it perfect? NOPE. But that does not make it bad. It's just a few dislikes with the design and gameplay. The AA is the weakest in the game settings and I hope it improves in the RE3 remake. Lighting is not the best and for some reason the game is very grey in its darker parts instead of being black. This is VERY obvious on an OLED TV. How many bullets a Zombie needs to die is also inconsistent. Some needs 2 other needs 6 7 headshots. The Tyrant/Mr. X is more annoying than scary. Combat Knife breaks WAY too easyI know it sounds like a lot of negative. But would still recommend the game if you wish to play a horror game.RE2 is an 8/10 for me.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-03,0,0,62,False,Recommended,**This review contains one minor spoiler re Mr. X gameplay in the middle of the campaign. It's nothing much but for sensitive people avoid**Incredibly well designed and satisfying game to play. This was one of the few games that was actually better the second playthrough (2 with Leon 1 with Claire so far) and more playthroughs to come. Came the closest to RE4's balance of action and horror. 4 is still my favorite in the series but this is a close second. This certainly surpasses all the others in the series graphically. It also did a better job than 7 (which was still a respectable game) at keeping that adrenaline/tension. At first I thought Mr. X would be annoying but as it turns out Capcom figured out how to insert him just enough during a couple lull periods to increase the tension without having him get too much in the way of completing puzzles. For example he stays out of the clock tower while you're completing the short gear puzzle which I thought was nice touch.Capcom really paid attention to the small details. Shotgun blasts to the head (1 hit kills) were more satisfying than ever with the upgraded shotgun parts due to the new gore system and animations. All the weapons had their own strengths and I found myself switching between them pretty evenly. Capcom made the zombies a bit harder to dodge than in some of the other games which required me to use a single pistol headshot to evade a zombie down a tight corridor (rather than simply evade). The first playthrough on standard was reasonably challenging but not overbearing. In a game like this atmosphere is a closest second to gameplay and Capcom nailed this as well. The story was also good and it delivered a big helping of action and drama with a moderate helping of cheesiness to balance it out like the B Movie series it aims to be. Sign me up for a RE3 and RE4 remake please!,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-04,0,0,68,False,Recommended,"I'm old enough to remember playing the original Resident Evil 2 for the PlayStation as a kid which I had fond memories of so I was a bit sceptical as to how the remake would turn out and bought the game on the basis of ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" Steam user reviews (at the time of writing) and a lot of positive critical acclaim. As it happens my scepticism was unfounded Capcom have remade and modernised Resident Evil 2 in a grand fashion.Highly polished graphics which run at a solid 60fps on my current hardware configuration (listed below) even on maxed settings excluding the rendering scale which I keep at 1920 1080 (100%). The options usually throws up a red warning for memory usage warning of serious bugs but I've never encountered any.The viewpoint isn't the same as the original in that you're no longer stuck with sometimes awkward fixed camera angles looking down onto a pre rendered scene it's all free moving full game engine 3D giving you the ability for over the shoulder precise manual aiming and really gives a modernised perspective on often old familiar surroundings from the original. The map has been modernised and redesigned in many ways. It isn't exactly identical to the original and items are placed in different locations to give a degree of fresh exploration since those of us who played the original would already know the map inside &amp out.The moment the game really got me was when Tyrant (AKA Mr. X) first showed up towering in that trench coat and hat which was ridiculous and simultaneously terrifying and it was done brilliantly (you can always shoot the hat off his head if you feel it doesn't suit him). Unlike the original where he always shows up at the same pre scripted places making it predictable in this he appears and actively hunts for you relentlessly throughout the whole police station and its the thumping of his footsteps as he looks for you which really puts you on edge so I reckon they really nailed it when it came to Tyrant a terrifying yet stylish villain. He'll also occasionally just casually punch zombies if they get in his way just to add to how hilariously cool he is.My only minor critique is the DLC which mostly just consists of cosmetic changes to your main protagonists in the form of costumes and one weapon as well as the original RE2 audio for the nostalgists. Ideally I feel these should have been part of the game possibly in game unlockables for clearing the game or otherwise since that's what the original did before paid DLC was even a thing. However that's a criticism more of the business practices of the AAA games industry than the actual game itself and is by no means a deal breaker.To conclude this game sets a benchmark for how remakes of old classic games should be done and serves as reminder of what Resident Evil is which is survival horror not gun blazing action something Capcom would do well to remember. A truly brilliant remake of an old classic that recaptures the old RE2 feel and modernises it brilliantly.System Specs Intel I7 3.5GHz8GB RAMNvidia Geforce GTX 1080TI 11GB VRAM",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-03,0,0,44,False,Recommended,After the release of Resident Evil 1 remake in 2002 (colloquially called REmake) a lot of the series fans expected to see the same treatment to the second and third game in the series on GameCube. But it was not to be and GC releases of RE2 and RE3 were slightly updated ports of the Playstation versions of the game which left a lot of people requesting Capcom for more remakes in the following years. In 2015 after asking the community if they are still interested in seeing Resident Evil 2 remade Capcom announced their decision with the We do it .Three years have passed since that surprise announcement https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1643863278For the first time in almost 15 years I feel like I m playing a Real Survival Horror game. What Survival Horror used to mean back then it s an action adventure with heavy focus on limited resource (ammo and healing) management puzzle solving exploration in an interconnected world (aka metroidvania design) and extremely smart enemy design to work against and for your limitations. In fact new RE2 is even more interconnected than the original with only one distinct point of no return and otherwise a proper ability to return to the main police station hallway at any point.The switch to over the shoulder does affect how the game feels and plays of course. While it s still important where you stand during an encounter with enemies and which weapon you use during the situation your aim and quick fingers play bigger role. Which meant a change to the enemy design as well. They are all slightly faster all slightly harder to aim at due to somewhat unpredictable movement and almost all have increased damage resistance. Bodies do not despawn as well. In fact some enemies will do the ragdoll animation upon being knocked out not killed only to spring back to life when you least expect it unless you hit them again to double check.Players get some helpful new and updated features as well the concept of defense items that you can use to avoid being hit previously exclusive to REmake returns now in an even more interesting format. These items can now be used as you d normally use knives and grenades. Which adds a new layer of resource management since knives can break upon use and grenades obviously cannot be reused. Another important feature that returns to the series after years of absence is the full zombie dismemberment which if you don t have enough ammo to kill a zombie can be a lifesaver since you can at least make a zombie less mobile by shooting their legs off.Unfortunatelly Scenario wise new RE2 is a huge downgrade to the original. While each character does have completely unique story elements unique locations unique encounters and final boss fights independently of the order you play them in it seems that Capcom simply ran out of allocated time budget to make this vision consistent. Meaning that after 70% of the game being not particularly contradictory the last stretch plays exactly the same for both characters (up until the very end where different boss fights happen). Meaning that you see same characters die 2 different ways fight the same bosses in the same rooms for the same reasons and solve the same problems. Which makes the final section of the game mechanically exciting but exactly same for both characters short and story wise disappointing. Oh and the 2nd Run mode that positions itself as the other side of the story only starts as such but later follows the storyline found in the usual New Game mode. In the end it works more like a fun Arrange mode with new challenges and updated puzzles rather than the distinct story.As a huge fan of the series I feel like if this kind of remake would ve been released in 2004 or 2005 hot on REmake heels it would ve been met with love but less excitement due to those downgrades mentioned. But with absolutely not a single game like this released in the last 15 years with close but not quite examples being Alien Isolation and RE7 this is the return of survival horror long overdue.Abstracting myself from my experience with the series I can definitively say that Resident Evil 2 (2019) is an amazing game to play. If you like tense exploration horror themes light puzzles and inventory management if you played and loved other metroidvania type world design games and love the feeling of discovering new paths to familiar places Resident Evil 2 both classic and new one will be a delicious treat for you. With its 3 difficulty modes it s welcoming even to those who have not experienced this type of gameplay or over the shoulder aiming action before. If you re a longtime fan of the series prepare for some disappointments and things that you probably would ve liked Capcom to do differently. Those shouldn t be encountered often but are simply unavoidable if you have a lot of emotional attachment to the original. But also prepare to spend a lot of time playing and replaying this and making very excited noises.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

While 7 is a good return to form I feel that 2 is the true return to what I loved about 4. This game had a number of scares that got me good. I don't regret going through that for one second.

The visuals are just another level especially the environment and it truly feels like the original gameplay with of course dynamic camera angles this time around. The cutscenes are Hollywood worthy and immersive just like the old ones and well... it's Resident Evil 2 with all the modern touch. THE GAME IS ABSOLUTELY SCARY ! It is not for the faint hearted. I found myself reloading a saved game a few times before I could even witness my own death as it was just too stressful to watch. Regular breaks were needed.There are however a few complaints. The bosses are way too easy to kill compared to some well placed zombies and lickers and they feel a little ""lousy"" with limited mobility . On ""standard"" difficulty I ended up with way too much ammunition in the end as I was trying to save as much as I could thinking I'll need them all later in the game. If only I knew I could spare some extra rounds I would have gladly shot some more zombies. When you are interacting with certain static objective based objects there are no character expressed thoughts. In the original Resident Evil 1 through 3 whenever you would interact with an object there would be in written the thoughts of the character which would often reveal clues about it. In this one you kind of have to figure it out a little bit on your own for most part. Of course you will find the occasional journal note and email containing clues but there's really not that much.

2019-01-31,0,0,25,False,Recommended,First time I've pre ordered a game and I'm glad I did. This is a very good remake and it made me feel so nostalgic. The game is very similar to the original with slight changes made to keep it fresh. I found most of the changes good I didn't like all of the changes but they did not bother too much me either. I'd give it a 9.8/10 and I really hope to see RE3 remake since it's my favorite game in the series.Some pros/cons (kinda)+ The gameplay is good and works smoothly+ The inventory system is a polished version of the one used in RE7 I liked it alot+The game run smoothly even on a less powerful PC (my setup GTX960/AMD FX8350/8GB RAM played on high settings)+Even on non ultra settings the game looks very good and the atmosphere is great+Unlockable original costumes (I liked Claire's original a lot in this one while I prefered Leon's new costume)+ I found the new soundtrack less creepy than the original so I switched to the original for my second run+ One of the changes is the Tyrant which now appears in both A and B scenarios. I did not have too much of a problem with this but I do understand that he is annoying to have around for players who like to explore. He was more of a constant nuisance especially on hardcore mode.+ I was a little disappointed with the B scenario I hoped that Leon and Claire's stories would've completed each other more+ Spongy zombies but more of a problem on hardcore mode+ Puzzles were fun but lacked variety since both characters do the same puzzles in every scenario,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-31,0,0,71,False,Recommended,I have completed the game to 100% I've got every possible item unlocked all tofus and got the best rankings in the game. My only advice is for people who are worried about not having enough content there is definitely enough to enjoy the game many many times. You cannot compare the scale of this to an online shooter or a sandbox RPG because it's nothing like those games. The value of this game is the same as when you play a story driven single player that you binge for a while and if you like it enough (like most fans) you'll go back to the game later simply because you love the game not because theres more to do. Anyone who says the game is too hard or the controls are difficult to master go play minecraft or get better( I died loads of times).,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-01-25,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Great transition to full 3D. Visuals are nice but too reliant on post processing that detracts from the overall texture quality. After playing a while now there's a few gimmicks that make specific areas a bit annoying but it's still fun.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-01-31,0,0,37,False,Recommended,The original RE2 is one of my favorite games of all time. After RE4 came out however Capcom changed the direction of the series to a more mass appeal shooter approach. They tried to walk it back some in later games but never seem to actually reproduce the lost survival horror feel of the original games. I'm glad to say that despite choosing to use the over the shoulder camera style for this game they have finally managed to reproduce the feel the original games created. That perfect blend of horror with dangerous enemies limited ammo and just the right amount of ability to fight back with whatever you can find to survive. All while exploring a large intimidating Gothic style Police Station reading notes left behind and solving puzzles that force you to revisit that hallway full of zombies you really didn't want to have to go back through. And that's all before you even get stalked by a massive unkillable enemy who follows you everywhere.That experience alone is worth the money. But if your a returning fan wanting to know how well it holds up as a remake. The answer is pretty damn well. Almost every location from the original game is revisited in a heavily reimagined way. All the characters return too though many act very differently. It can be very entertaining seeing the story again through this more serious dark tone. The few negative faults I can find with this game is the new soundtrack is very dull and quiet. Making it almost necessary to buy the original OST dlc. And that the games 2nd run feature feels hastily implemented. It does not completely change the story and boss fights like the original game did to make the games narrative make sense from both characters point of view. This gives it a little less replay value but does not ruin the game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-31,0,0,51,False,Recommended,Resident Evil 2 Remake is a very beautiful and awesome rendition of the original. It takes many steps back from the previous action packed Resident Evil games such as 5 &amp 6 and I think it's heading in the right direction doing so. It has that vibe of Resident Evil 4 with its camera and makes good use of the game engine that was used in Resident Evil 7. While it didn't completely stick to the original game its new spin on things were very entertaining. Experiencing Resident Evil 2 with a much better control layout and updated visuals was absolutely amazing.

2019-02-02,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Capcom has really brought everything that gave the original game back in 98 its spark into the remake while still providing some more awesome scares even for the fans of the first that know their way around the map story etc. You're still gonna get scared you're still gonna feel all alone and helpless. Capcom made enough changes to everything to keep you guessing and keep you on the edge of your sit while still maintaining the same atmosphere and feel of the original game. I would like some more variation between the two characters in terms of story and I'm a little bit bummed that they removed some really cool scenes from the original that I was looking forward to see with today's technology but hey...you can't have everything and the game is still top notch as it is. 9/10,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-04,0,0,20,False,Recommended,I love how the game is made overall atmosphere and story. Game looks just great after so many years and TPP is a good decision for it! I love how challenging it even on the standard difficulty when you need to shoot wisely and precisely or save ammo for later. Sometimes the game can terrify you with some sudden jumper or even when you're rounded by zombies and you're really in trouble or you hear the Mr. X steps right after the corner. I love the way of modifying weapons and how they grow in you inventory with modification. They changed some locations but others make me recall that sweet nostalgy of the original.However I'm pretty disappointed that the game didn't make it in the logical side and quests. When you play 2nd run you solve almost the same puzzles and pass through almost the same locations. Game designers even cut quests from the original game. So 2nd run doesn't feel like you play another part of the story you play THE SAME story in a bit other way. They don't explain teleportations of Annette Birkin or why the lab is so incredibly look like an alien spaceship. I think they really could make stories better.Overall I would recommend the game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

They feel a bit rushed to be honest. Overuse of the tyrant. Very tense and scary the first time you see him. On most subsequent appearances it just makes you groan. Weird/Unnecessary DLC practice.

Total Biscuit would be proud.There are far too many frustrating mechanics for me to enjoy this game. Being unable to clear out a room of zombies is my biggest annoyance. It just isn t worth the ammo since it is so scarce. Shooting out their legs works but when you bait a zombie to give chase then have another zombie gnaws at your legs that you de legged earlier makes you wish you just wasted the ammo and killed it in the first place.Wish there was a metal knife instead of all these plastic ones I keep finding.The hulk has the best hearing I have ever seen. It will hear you from the opposite side of the map and bee line a path directly to you but then doesn t hear you when you drop a bell down the bell tower.The machine gun is the most useless gun in the game. A full clip won t even drop a single zombie. After sinking 127 bullets into the head of a zombie it still didn t explode.There is a good game in here but it is buried beneath layers and layers of frustrating design choices.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-03,0,0,12,False,Recommended,"I never actually played a Resident Evil game in my entire life when I heard about this remake. People will probably read this part and get furious but the only real connection I had was through the movies (that of which I've only seen the first and last). I knew about the premise of the story and little tidbits I'd picked up online or from friends but really I didn't know anything. When I saw this was announced at E3 2018 I didn't even really care. Then I found out that the One Shot demo had been released and anyone could play it no pre order needed or anything just download and have a blast for 30 minutes so I thought ""hey why the hell not?"" After playing that demo I was instantly attracted to this game and the entire franchise as a whole. It honestly blew me away and I bought the full game soon after it was released. To put it in short this game is amazing. The dialogue and animations fitted to the characters the aesthetics of the dark hallways and rooms of the places you explore in Raccoon City the awesome gameplay mechanics and the stunning visuals (I mean holy this game is ing beautiful) all astounded me. I'm writing this review towards the end of my second Leon playthrough (because I ran out of ammo on my first run trying to kill every enemy) and without even playing as Claire yet because I couldn't wait to share how I felt about this game. Probably one of my most favorite things about this game is that it doesn't go out of its way to scare you which I had previously thought all Resident Evil games did. It simply gives you a sense of not knowing what to ever expect while also maintaining a really spooky and creepy vibe supported by the incredible lighting and sometimes really eerie quietness. I really don't know what else to say other than this game is unreal. I absolutely love it.

2019-01-28,0,0,27,False,Recommended,This game is phenomenal. It does the orginal game justice and then some. I am not easily scared but this game truly made me feel scared. There were many jump scares from the fact I forgot zombies were in certain hallways may bad. This thing I love the most is how you never feel safe. There is never enough ammo to feel comfortable and there is always an enemy within shooting distance. The game itself is beautiful. The color and lighting is perfect to make you feel helpless. I played the original and this game feels different but also similar. The main story is the same but it is delivered differently. This game has so much replayabilty with the two main characters and side characters. Everything so far about this game is perfect from combact to puzzles. Do not get me started with the Tyrant (Mr. X). He leaves you on your toes and scared $hitle$$. He is always stalking you and won't die. There is also the AI learning which is good. If you are a tank the AI will be deadlier if you are an easy target they are more forgiving. I have been a tank for the whole game so the AI is extremly hard on me which I enjoy.

2019-01-29,0,0,39,False,Recommended,"great recreation of the essence of resident evil 2.not only did this game scare me like I was a kid all over again but the presentation is fantastic in my opinion this game completely captured why resident evil 2 was so special but its not just a recreation its an improvement in many ways.it is a reimaginationthe dialog can still be cheesy at times but it is much more believable and the games engine allows for beautiful real time cutscenes as well as allowing for a very well established atmosphere and seeing these classical places from the PD like the library leons desk the stars office along many other fantastic recreations of places from the original really gave me a nostalgia trip.not only that but this game made me face my fear of mr. XI must admit that I never played any B scenario in the original game because I was terrified of mr. x for mostly the same reason I didnt play re 3. (being pursued by a monster in horror games seems to strike a nerve for me but this game was so good I forced myself to overcome my fear)he will chase you and if you arent ready to deal with it you will just have to deal with it this mechanic of constantly being chased forced me to make plans cant just stumble around when he shows up lickers and zombies become a much bigger threat when just shooting them is enough to get this guy coming for you again.the story is the same from the original games just much more polished and told through a lot of new dialogue new cutscenes new notes to find and some rather good voice acting on even minor characters for a lot of the early game neither campaing has much going on in terms of storytelling in your first playthrough theres some interesting hooks but not much is done with them marvins death is predictable but at least here he is much more fleshed out than the original game the story picks up pace after you find the 3 medallions that unless you use a guide should take you some wandering around before you actually find them all. so expect the story to get interesting anywhere from an hour after you start to 3 to 4 hours of exploring and solving puzzles. thats most of what I can say of the story without getting into spoilers.the gameplay is a mix between resident evil 4 6 over the shoulder camera but unlike those games your options are much more limited even though round house kicking zombies and supplexing mr X down a staircase would have been a lot of fun thats not what this game is about so expect to have full control over your character but just remember these are leon and claire on their first zombie apocalypse so dont expect fancy hand to hand combat and mashing buttons to dodge lasers the game gives you complete control over characters with limited power and resources thats where a lot of this game's fun comes from.be ready to micromanage the out of your inventory and engage in a battle for maintaining your resources zombies are harder to dodge and lickers and dogs will might test your aim if you are playing on a controller but the gameplay feels safe very rarely did i feel like the game was screwing me over without warning or reason and unless you are playing on hardcore just eating a tri herb mix will make you invulnerable to poison and greatly reduce damage taken.theres some boss fights in this game and most of them are pretty good the first one is a tad scary the first time but they know you wont really be scared of fighting once you are half way through and the fights get a bit more straight forward the bosses arent that hard to beat as long as you sort of know what you are doing.the sound design is fantastic and I just wished they used music a bit more often but I can respect the choice of letting ambiance noise take the spotlighttechnically the game is stable and I almost never dipped bellow 60 fps with an avarage of 75 80 on decently high settings on a gtx 1060 6gb only optimization issues i could find happened exclusively when using claires electric weapon and even those dips were not really enough to ruin my experience but 99.9% of the game works silky smooth and in 25 hours played at the time of writing this review i crashed exactly 0 times despite alt tabbing often and even at one point leaving the game on pause while i left for a few hours only to return and have the game run perfectly fine like i was gone a minute.this PC version is impressive to say the least.this is without a doubt one of the best resident evil games if not the best (depends on how it holds up once the ""new"" feeling is off but its definitely among the best)and possibly one of the best horror games we have seen in years.Thank you capcom i hope you keep this hot streak you have found yourselves in these lasts few years.and to anyone reading trying to decide wether or not to buy this game buy it.if horror nostalgia and great graphics are not enough to convince you the gameplay will not let you down either the puzzles are interesting never too hard but they will still make you have that ""aha!"" moment many times in your first playthrough and the exploration is satisfying and rewarding.Quality game and possibly our first conteder for this year's GOTYwould recommend to anyone interested in a horror game or resident evil's history completely worth a full price purchase",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-04,0,0,41,False,Recommended,The game runs smoothly and looks amazing. The same engine used from RE7 was used for this game.For a remake it's everything a fan of the series could ask for.There are 4 main campaigns in the game. Leon A/B (first and second run) and Claire A/B (first and second run). It took me approximately 10 hours to complete Leon A and 6 hours for Claire A. Now I'm on the second run of their campaigns and it's quite different already within the first few minutes it changes what you already know about the game and it takes you out of your comfort zone and forces you to explore again.The controls feel natural. For a horror game its definitely one of the best. I played Leon A on regular difficulty and it worked out to be a bit of a challenge I didn't die once since I'm already familiar with the series and game's mechanics from the demo but that doesn't take away from the experience. I was constantly scared of the next corner or next zombie encounter because I barely had a full clip for my guns. The clues and items you find throughout the game are worth paying attention to as they help you progress further. The puzzles were not too hard as to make you quit as long as you're somewhat patient and pay attention to how the puzzle should be solved. That being said the game is great for fans of the series and horror game enthusiasts. However if you've never played the earlier games such as RE1 2 3 then you may struggle progressing through the game without a guide because the game plays differently to most modern games it doesn't exactly hold your hand or specifically tell you where to go no waypoints nothing. Some tips are to look at the map and see which rooms have been explored or not EXAMINE the key items you collect (keys boxes etc). I'd highly recommend this game it's not for the faint hearted but where's the fun of it your heart pumping and adrenaline rushing. Also it's just a game zombies aren't real D10/10 it's the only good horror game I've played since dead space.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-07,0,0,79,False,Recommended,10 out of 10 Hoping Capcom will keep this quality in any future endeavors. As of right now and this will increase I have over 60+ hours of playtime. Three S ranks and working on my 4th. I plan on going for S+ in the future. Finished 4th Survivor in under 11 mins and will work on lowering that time. I haven't been this excited for a game in years. Resident Evil games are my jam my bread and butter. I'm really happy that they're going back to its survival horror roots and less action oriented but still exciting and intense game play. This is just my opinion and hope it's helpful.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-07,0,0,45,False,Recommended,I've logged 34 hours into the game beating all runs and 1 S+ rank.I have to disagree with you with Mr. X. If you run far away from him he does loses track of you but the sound of you running/bashing doors open combat or zombies near you making noises can attract him closer. On your second or third play though you'll get an idea of what rooms to clear out and which windows to board up so you can go freely in those areas and avoid any noise/combat.On my first run in the game as Leon I didn't really have to worry about ammo or space I actually killed every single enemy I came across except for 1 hall way which had too many broken windows to board up and I only needed to go down that hall 2 times. But if you just have bad luck and can't get them to stay down shooting their legs help a lot to turn them into crawlers shooting their arms off after makes them unable to move at all but at that point you use up as much ammo as it would to kill them.The collectables bonus modes and ranking system gives this game a lot of replay ability. Though I am sad that the zapping system isn't in here. It feels like they had to half on that part to deliver everything else. If that's the case then I'm okay but I really wish that Leon and Clair connected more often like in the original RE2.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-03,0,0,22,False,Recommended,I've mostly never played RE and this was a great game. The chemistry between Leon and Ada was very compelling and the the enemies along with scarcity of resources was terrifying.It's a perfect mixture of terror and power as you scavange for supplies to ensure you survive your next big baddie encounter. The only thing I have against it is just how quickly you can wrap up a campaign. I've played 14 hrs total and just about done with Leon and Claire's campaigns. You have replayability through revisiting the same campaigns on harder difficulty but it's content you've already seen and it's not quite the same as exploring an area for the first time not knowing what's going to jump out at you. Overall great game. It should be in every Steam user's library imo,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-02,0,0,39,False,Recommended,I bought this game within a few minutes of playing the one shot demo because I was genuinely that engrossed. I initially wasn't excited for this game. The movies and the other later titles in the series had made me feel a bit of shame for liking the series and I thought it was all just nostalgia since the RE titles were some of my first games.But no I was wrong. This game genuinely shines in almost every conceivable way. It just feels like a total labor of love project that's brimming with attention to detail and legitimately challenging gameplay that goes back to its roots without flexing the legacy of the previous games at us with fan service like some other games would. This is truly Resident evil 2 for the modern era in the best way possible.An instant classic. In 2019 by Capcom no less. Who would have thought?,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-04,0,0,43,False,Recommended,"As someone who has yet to play the the original RE2 I can't make a comparison between them. However this game on it's own is definitely an enjoyable experience. The gun sounds are great as well as the feel of each weapon. There's a feeling of catharsis when you get that critical headshot and turn that zombie's head into blood pudding. Keep in mind though these aren't your typical Left 4 Dead zombies. These guys can take quite a few shots before they're actually dead which is why you should to keep an eye on your ammunition and pick your targets carefully. Item management and careful planning of what enemies you should kill in a certain area is an important aspect of surviving in this game by careful planning of what zombies you kill I mean that these guys are bullet sponges (like how zombies should be) so you can run out of ammo if you're not careful! However if you feel that the game gets a little too hard for your taste you can always change the difficulty settings to your liking which I think is good for people newer to the Resident Evil series or casual players. The graphics are also really impressive (that HD burger.. jesus..) although you might need a real BEEF y computer if you want to play this game at max settings. Even with lower settings it still looks really nice though. There's two characters you can play as Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield. Both characters stories take place in the same area in the game but there's some slight variations to what areas and items you get depending on the character you choose. There's also (B) scenarios for both characters which add a little more variation to the game but it's really not THAT much different from the (A) scenario. It is recommended though that you do the (B) scenario for the TRUE ending. I'll just leave it at that because I don't want to spoil anything.One criticism I have for this game is that there's an issue with the lighting where the screen gets progressively darker during cutscenes and puzzles and that zombies tend to ""play dead"" a little TOO much. However both of those are minor inconveniences. So is it worth the $60 price tag? My answer is yes! This is one of the few games out there that you can feel safe paying for a full game. I can't wait for Capcom to do a remake for RE3 Nemesis!",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-04,0,0,21,False,Recommended,I cant compare this to the original I never played it. That said this game is cinematic engaging genuinely scary and makes you want more. I have no criticism except for one VERY specific thing during a certain scene requiring the player to run away while dodging danger the autosave happens before a short canned dialog sequence. This means if you screw it up a bunch of times like I did (highly inept I know) you'll soon get sick of sitting through the talking before you get another crack at the game.

2019-02-01,0,0,34,False,Recommended,I was rendered giddy with joy and terro upon booting up and playing the RE2 remake. I played the originals as a kid and I remember absolutely adoring the remake of the original which as a 100% improvement over the first game. The RE2 remake is even more a joy. Id give the game a 9.5/10 but I am a bit baised as a long term Resident Evil fan so maybe its more like a 7 or an 8 for people who arent fans of the genre or series.That being said I was so severely dissapointed after Resident Evil 5 that I stopped buying the games entirely when I saw RE6 I almost considered the purchase but even still to this day have not (I admit I might after getting hyped up after playing this however). I thought the entire classic genre of RE was dead and lost to a bygone era but this remake has inspired me by giving us a Resident Evil that ditches the clunky controls and camera angles of the originals whilst still maintaining the ambient feel and style of the originals. RE2 expands and is faithful to the original gameplay and story whilst adding enough minor changes to keep veterans like me from finding it predictable even the voice acting is pretty decent.We really are back to Survival Horror with this latest remake this is the style of game I was hoping for at the Resident Evil 4 and 5 launches and I had lost hope we would ever get a true Resident Evil game ever again. I am beyond ecstatic to report that I was wrong and if Capcom releases a Resident Evil 3 remake in the same style as this one you can consider me sold.

2019-01-25,0,0,19,False,Recommended,You must be the new guy...Leon.Sorry...but..it looks like your party has been cancelled.The real review As of right now I have only completed the first playthrough with Leon. The game was definintely an amazing experience to start off the year. It felt a bit on the shorter side because there isn't as much backtracking. (You can see what key the door needs on the map) This way you didn't really have to memorize or keep track of the doors needed for the keys. However the game incentivizes you to do the 2nd run in order to see the complete story so theres more replayability to it.Cutscenes along with the voice acting and lip syncing were top notch. There were still some cheesy lines but they actually came off as funny. ALSO the game is beautiful. Overall definitely recommend it.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-01,0,0,23,False,Recommended,"I just finished my first play through of Leon's story and I am absolutely captivated by this beautiful homage to one of my absolute favorite games of all time. To be honest this game was not even on my radar which is strange to me because I usually stay up to speed with game reviews and coming releases especially so for something like this. I don't know if I heard about it once and simply forgot or just wasn't in the loop but either way I was pleasantly surprised to hear about the demo released a bit ago. I immediately downloaded it and played it when it was available. I feel like I was ready to pounce and go into some berserk rage if some irresponsible were to destroy this absolute classic of a game for some half witted cash grab. After playing the demo I immediately ordered the game because if it was even half as good as the demo I would have at least given it a play. Unless it was such an awful port that there was some game breaking problem that ruined the experience and the game would become a stain on my precious library for years to come. Either way it seemed like a good enough risk i bought it on sale and loaded it up and have played it with my allotted 'Dad alone time' from 2300 to 0000 for the last few nights. Wow this game was a total blast. I could not believe how perfect of a remake this game was. Plot and pacing wise the stories are almost all the same as the original but in a much more emotional and mature way similar to how it struck my sixth grade self back in the day when I played the out of the original (and convinced my parents that somehow the game was ok for me to play. I think they were intrigued with the way games had advanced since Nintendo and were kind of amazed at seeing zombies getting shot and just kind of rolled with it.)I think my playtime was 8 hours and I got a B so I didn't do that great like I used to in the old days but good enough and I had a total blast playing the game. I sound like such a loser schlepping some game on a game store but I don't draw an emotional connection to games much anymore this one I did. It brought back so many memories as a kid of playing this game over and over and being so amazed by its complexity and relishing in the gleeful delight of popping zombie heads with cool toy guns.CAPCOM took the original and remade it. Brilliantly. This is literally the game you used to play back in the day but totally RE MOTHER ING MADE. Like they did everything nothing is stale or dated its all beautifully rendered and the game plays like a dream which is saying a lot for a Resident Evil game. This is unfair I know sorry but I was so disgusted with RE6 that I just jumped off the RE series totally. I hated that game. I think it just totally sucks. Anyway I did end up buying 7 recently but I haven't got very far. It's really good and i'm excited about finishing that next). Anyway back to this game. These dudes (devs) got in a huddle in the office one day it must have been like some Oceans 11 squad type assembly story but played out in a Blues Brother kind of way to get these developers together to be like ""Yeah guys we're RE MOTHER ING MAKING this "" Then they all high fived and jumped into their desk chairs. These guys and gals took their time and really did this right. Like yeah you guys just checked a pretty big box of mine in the gaming world when you perfectly remade an amazing game that I love. That my friends is how you make a game all you developers out there that make games take a lesson from the boys and girls at CAPCOM they just owned all of you and you should all be ashamed of yourselves for making crap games that are soulless turds floating in a punch bowl of other turds. These people should get some game award or whatever the equivalent to the Oscar is but for games because they knocked it out of the park with this one. If you don't have the money its ok save up...shes waiting for you to scare the out of you when you think you killed all the monsters and everything's fine then the bad man comes. You will see what i'm talking about buy it full price buy it on sale it doesn't matter. But to cut to the chase just make sure you play this game so you can see how to make a proper game not some bull ass open world micro transaction filled fest that wins GOTY because you can go anywhere and do anything. That doesn t matter anymore because it s been done a million times already and games like that just don t capture the magic like they used to. Go ahead and play your base building game that is in Alpha that costs 40 bucks and will never be released because you just got hosed go right ahead. Eventually you will see this baby on sale and you will not hesitate you will play this ing game and it will stress you out and make you want to turn the lights on in your basement neck beard cave because it scares the out of you. Try rolling into a room full of lickers with only 5 rounds of handgun ammo. You might as well on those ers instead of using your 9mm. You will love this game.

For me this is an 11/10 as I have wanted an RE2 remake for such a long time that being said I also think this is a game that newcomers to the series can enjoy and get their introduction to the series. This was as monumental as the first time those brown clunky pixels jumped through the hallway windows back in 1996 and scared the immortal out of me and my father back in 1996 on PS1 to me.

2019-02-03,0,0,54,False,Recommended,Excellent remake that accomplishes everything it sets out to do. Combines tension atmosphere puzzles navigation and action expertly. After 10 or so playthroughs of the game I can't recommend it enough. The police station area featured in the demo is the best part of the game where navigation item management and route planning are crucial on hardcore and even standard difficulty. I found both of the difficulty levels well balanced and well game tested (excluding adjusted I did not play that one). The rest is well polished and fun but the police station was a fantastic example of complex level design mixed with a cohesive and logical structure. The infinite ammo weapons are also fun to play with to have casual fun playthroughs but the requirement to get the 2 best ones are a bit extreme. Being a fan of the series I really like this game. Overall I highly recommend the game even if you are not a fan. It is now my favorite in the Resident evil series. It feels a lot more challenging than the majority of the games in the series as well (at least the ones from 4 onward).,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-31,0,0,27,False,Recommended,"Resident Evil 2 was initially released for the PlayStation back in 1998 and it was a huge success easily becoming the favorite of the vast majority of the Resident Evil player base this version is a complete remake (not remaster) of the 1998 original game built on the RE Engine that was created by Capcom and used on the also very successful Resident Evil 7 because of that the game has very beautiful graphics which helps to create a perfect terror atmosphere.In Resident Evil 2 you play either as Leon S. Kennedy a rookie cop arriving for his first day on the work as a police officer in the Raccoon City Police Dept. or Claire Redfield a student who recently just arrived in the city to look for her brother Chris Redfield also a cop and one of the main characters in the first Resident Evil game.They arrive in a city taken by chaos because of a viral outbreak that turns people and even animals into flesh eating monsters seeing as the streets are taken by zombies they decide that the best course of action is to head to the police station as it's most likely the safest place however that isn't the case and most of the story goes on in the police station.The game offers the viewpoint from both characters in ""different"" (more on the quotes down in the review) scenarios which in the original game were labeled as scenario A and B which means you have at least 4 different plays in order to see both scenarios on both characters so that paired with extra modes such as the 4th Survivor and Tofu (don't ask) which you unlock by finishing the game means Resident Evil 2 has a significant re playability. This game was remade from scratch using the latest of Capcom's engine RE Engine and has similar graphics to Resident Evil 7 however it's uses the over the shoulder camera similar to Resident Evil 4 instead of first person a change that fit really well with this game.The game is graphically demanding however it's quite well optimized and runs really well even in computers that are not in the recommended requirements range.I've seen very few complaints regarding bugs or performance issues with the game the ones I've seen are actually related to drivers and not with the game itself so the quality of the game is very good.Now the pros and cons Pros Wonderful graphics Fantastic gore system Familiar locations to old school fans New locations that make even the oldest fans surprised Great re playability Very well polished Runs very well Good variety of characters to play as (2 main characters 2 ""4th survivor"" characters and 3 extra characters coming in the free DLC) Free DLC with 3 extra stories Reasonable priced for such a good gameCons ""Different Scenarios"" are actually the same with minor changes so either A or B feels the same just some items and puzzles change Zombies are ridiculously strong depending on difficulty you play on it can take up to 15 head shots to kill one (although it will usually take 5 8 which is still insane) Can get repetitive A lack of coop or ""versus"" mode Capcom tried to improve the story but forgot several important elements that relate Resident Evil 2 to the first game also a lot of interaction between both main characters that happen in the original game was completely left out of the remakeAs you can see I am very impressed with the game not only it looks nice but it also plays nice.The original 1998 Resident Evil 2 was my favorite game in the franchise I've played it a lot not only on my PlayStation but also on my Nintendo 64 so it's no surprise that I was extremely excited and hyped for this game fortunately Capcom did not disappoint the game is absolutely amazing and is probably one of the very best games I've played in a forever heck it's probably the best in the franchise right now it brought the psychological terror back to the Resident Evil franchise in a familiar yet new and exciting way.In my opinion this game is a masterpiece and even if you have not played the original or was never a huge RE nerd like me you should still buy and play this as long as you're a horror game fan you'll enjoy.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-07,0,0,45,False,Recommended,If you are an old school RE player and are unsure on whether to buy this or not i'll tell you now that this game was made first and foremost for you. I played RE2 back in the day and have been very critical of the franchises change in direction over the years and i was particularly fond of fixed camera angles so when it was announced that this game would be similar to the RE4 OTS camera style i was sceptical to say the least. If this sounds familiar then i implore you to try out the game demo if it's still available on Steam. A lot of tender love and care went into making this game and it is evident they wanted to take the best things from all RE games to make the ultimate experience. You'll quickly see why people are already talking about an RE3 in the same vein.Pro Runs well with great optimisation. Very challenging at times with fun boss fights Old school item management Gore system is bloody great Voice acting is a lot better though script is still a bit corny but honestly who cares in a ing RE game? Combat is better than ever Gunpowder so you can craft whatever ammo you feel you need most Mr XCon Autosave on easy and normal difficulty forcing old school players to play hardcore first time (just do it anyway ) Zombies can sometimes take 20 shots to the head and STILL get up. You'll lose health over stupid things Scares are a little lacking in the first couple of hours seasoned horror gamers will struggle to find fear. Apart from Mr X. My cons aren't really anything major or game breaking just little things i found bothered me in my playthroughs. Generally this game is top notch though and all RE fans should consider getting this. If you're just a fan of survival horror you'll love it too this game deserves your attention. I'd give it a 9/10,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-28,0,0,10,False,Recommended,What an amazing remake this is what a survival horror game should be. With ammo and healing items being limited you can t just shoot everything you see. You run away from enemies only for you to forget about them and get a good scare from them later which I loved.This game can be easy or difficult depending on how you manage your inventory basically like any other RE game. This game can be a little difficult for some new players hopping onto the RE series as you can get lost or stuck with navigating around the maps/puzzles. The game will have an option for you to do assisted mode which is basically easy if you are having trouble but you won t be able to change it back later.The graphics of the entire game looked amazing. The character models are all very detailed and their facial expressions were spot on. I also love when you shoot zombies on the head/arms/legs you ll see chunks come off from their bodies. The lighting of the environment made my anxiety go off the roof as you don t know what s to come around every corner especially when Mr. X is pursuing you.The main story of the game has been tweaked here and there which makes this game feel a bit new rather than 100% of the original. I personally had no problem with this but a few might. Keep in mind Capcom is releasing free DLC that will probably fill in those missing story pieces on February 15 so if you don t have a date for Valentines then make it this game.Everything about this game feels great and I would highly recommend this for everyone to play.Now if you'll excuse me I m going to go unlock the Tofu.P.S. the LickersP.S.S Ada THICC,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-04,0,0,19,False,Recommended,"I am basically happy and positive about this game and I would probably give it 10/10 if only I didn't play RE7 before and this is why Resident Evil 7 is much harder and more rewarding game. RE7 ""Normal"" is harder than RE2"" Hardcore"". Please Capcom! Provide the patch! We really don't need marking items on the map and marking objects that are not needed anymore is really bad decision! These things wasn't present in RE7 and I think adding them was a bad move and this is why Marking items on map breaks the exploration and makes game simpler. I use map really frequently just for navigation and planing my exploration missions. This was really cool in RE7 when I never knew what objects I left behind when running trough the locations. Adding marks on unneeded items is even worse. In RE7 I never knew what will happen next and will I even need any item I found any time soon. This added some uncertainty to the gameplay and that was really that what was thrilling about that game. I had to consider wisely any change in my inventory and each decision about leaving item in the storage box or disposing an item was feeling important to survive. This is why I think at the moment RE7 gives more survival horror experience than RE2 remake.Another thing are some animations. Zombies and humanoids are more than good they are just perfect! But it's too bad lickers behave really rigid not that good as zombies. They move really stiff their animation really could be done a bit better. It's such disappointing to see them moving so badly. They remind me the same enemy four leg dog like crawlers that was present in RE7 but with different model. That was one of only two things I didn't like in RE7 second one was lack of clipping so enemies parts was leaking trough doors. It's also present in RE2. Such technical bugs should not be present in horror games. This kills immersion.I know my review sounds very harsh for both titles but I was never interested in Resident Evil franchise since original PlayStation. What happened after years with these games is mind blowing. I love them they give me thirlls and I want more.I wish Capcom at least could add an option to turn these map and inventory features off not only for hardcore gamers but for all survival horror games fans.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-26,0,0,6,False,Recommended,The original resident evil 2 is one of my favorite games and along with Code Veronica my favorite from the franchise i think from generation to generation games constantly have lost the creativity imagination magic and charm that the games from the 80s and 90s have maybe for this reason i still today play 8 and 16 bits games so for that reason i am rigorous to picky modern games to tell the truth i only play a few franchises (Zelda resident evil uncharted God of war Final Fantasy Metal gear solid and one or two more ) I think fighting games and Rpgs are the only ones that are getting better in every decade. But speaking of this RE2 remake capcom have utterly surpassed themselves with this masterpiece graphically it is one of the best games on the market the controls are perfect and flawless the voice acting is very well done the atmosphere is incredible the terror and the fear playing this game are real remember this is a survivel horror game not a third person shotter like RE 4 5 and 6 even in the zones that we are safe our heart almost jumps out of from the chest the puzzles are very good (please think a little while playing do not go to YouTube to see how it is done because that kills the magic of the game) this is one of the best games ever made and undoubtedly the best game in the franchise games like this make me have hope for future generations because this is the right way to go.Also please play the remake of Resident Evil Zero and 1 too because they are also very good word of advice play with diapers because this game would make Achilles crap his pants.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

It takes what people loved from the original and stays true to it while adding a whole bunch and it looks phenomenal graphically. It does have a new over the shoulder perspective similar to resi 4 5 and 6 but with a much bigger focus on horror which is what so many people wanted. The game has a ton of replay value too as two different playthroughs with both characters are really quite different with new areas bosses puzzles and weapons.

2019-02-04,0,0,64,False,Recommended,"Like you need me to tell you this game is amazing. It's been out for about ten days at time of writing and almost everyone has spoken about it. Doubly so if you actually listen to any podcasts about video games. Well you're here now so yes. Absolutely get this game. Even if it's full price which isn't something I say too much. I think it's absolutely worth the money and while 2 is the one I've been waiting for 15 years for I'd like to hope if Capcom sees enough profit from this well maybe we'll get 3. Hell maybe even Code Veronica? I'd actually want CV more don't replay 3 like I always have 2 and 3 was pretty solid at the time of its release (i.e. it actually still holds up FAIRLY decently). CV was a friggin' mess from minute 1 and seeing it done better would be nice.ANYWAY(DUMB BIO BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THEM ""LIFELONG"" GAME LOVES FER ME FEEL FREE TO SKIP)So I've been on the RE deal since I was about eight when 2 was first released. My older brother's friend brought it over while our parents were out and I watched them play it. It gave me nightmares. I was always too scared to play the games (interestingly my sister and I mutually agree that if Raccoon City ever happened we'd just eat a bullet "" that."") but around the time I was in middle school I met a kid who had his own copy of RE2. Even at age 12 (or whatever I was) it was slow going still totally terrified of those games. But I loved them regardless. I'm not entirely sure when I came around and horror became one of my top 3 favorite genres but by the time I was first into high school I'd played 2 3 and CV multiple times learned every last fraggin' bit of lore there was asserted my most favorite characters and was drawing fanart pretty regularly. I was STARS Wesker at my fraternity's second Halloween party and I now have the disposable income to really go batshit bonkers on a HUNK costume this year.I say all this because it paints me as a pretentious fanboy and I have no illusions about that. I got unreasonably angry about the films having nothing to do with the series and changing all the characters for the worse (and being generally tripe on a bike) I don't care for the games after 4 (itself not REALLY an RE game but I do love it for having Leon Ada and Hunk and being super well designed anyway) but I've still played every last one of them out of that weird twisted brand loyalty some of us develop.But what that means is I am one of the snobbiest s you will ever meet about this dumb silly ridiculous game series and I want you to take my full meaning when I say I love it. And that I absolutely think this game lived up to the 1.5 decade wait and hype buildup.(ACTUAL REVIEW. I GUESS. IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT)I was among those who were first disappointed to hear that the game is over the shoulder rather than fixed cam like the first REMake was. I can now genuinely say that I was wrong. I almost can't believe it but this works so insanely well while resurrecting the classic horror focus it leaves me with scarce words. The camera is essentially NEVER a chore to control even when fleeing dudes and running through hallways and doors to get away I never had a problem seeing/knowing where I was going. I WILL say the character controls are a LITTLE wonky. Is it me or is the Witcher 3 pattern kinda beginning to become the norm? You know what I mean your character having inertia. Like you press run and there's about a .75 second windup before your character gets up to full speed and it carries over to a slight delay when turning. I'm not shading Witcher 3 I fraggin' loved that game. It's not even that moving the character feels bad it's just that it'll take a little getting used to and may cause you to dash into a doorframe rather than through the door which is stress inducing when there's a licker or Tyrant within a five mile radius.We're back to scary runarounds with this too. If any of y'all are like me you played the Hell out of 2 and 2 pretty definitely became a shooting gallery right around the midpoint or so of the sewers particularly for Leon. Ammo was everywhere (and every handgun pickup ranged from 10 15 bullets) and they even stopped being shy about giving you shotgun ammo AFTER you get the parts and turned it into the Zombie Exploderizer. You almost felt bad for all the virus victims running around. Or would have if turning them into torso stumps wasn't so damn much fun. This does not have that. Not only are ammo pickups variable (and many of them in the 2 6 range early on) but zombies are tough as all Hell now. Most general baddies are gonna average four to SEVEN direct headshots before going down for the count meaning you're going to learn quickly which hallways you need to traverse multiple times and juke routes to get around dudes. Less ammo and tougher dudes mean you are going to be running dry WAY more often. My first couple playthroughs I ended with little to no ammo leftover. Still boss arenas are littered with pickups so even if you go in empty you should be able to get through it. And if you spend everything in the fight the pickups will get you to the next fountain.I'm honestly kind of floored at the lighting system here. The game pretty accurately simulates what it would be like having a catastrophe in the city power grid failures mean most structures are dark as all Hell. The flashlight is automatic and I've never had a problem with the character's discretion at turning it on. It's a decently generous flashlight meaning you can get around but not so generous that you WON'T possibly miss a zombie and get ambushed. These are good things because they not only encourage you to keep your head on a swivel like you really would but also means it's a viable process and there are no idiot monster closest.If you had told me twenty years ago that RE would have some of the best voice and facial acting in the future I'd have spat in your eyes and you would have deserved it. But really this game does amazingly. Get ready to run into everyone's favorite Will Smith expy and have him not only be his own unique person but actually deliver lines with gravitas worthy of an actual good movie. Even though it's Resident Evil even though it's Capcom the writing here is actually pretty solid and they've rewritten some things I always thought were super dumb (why Leon's outfit looks like none of the other officers' Leon's general propensity to trust a woman he just met above all else Sherry's ABOMINABLE acting and linework the complete ing of the U.S.S. team apprehending Birkin Kendo's WHO ARE YA. WHADDAYADOON HERE and many others). It's a genuine joy to play through and you can actually appreciate it on a story level now rather than just murdering zambies.I will say it isn't perfect because no game is. The Ada and Sherry parts are completely different than they were originally and while Ada is perfectly fine Sherry's is now a forced stealth section. It's really only bad the first time because it's trial and error every subsequent playthrough you know exactly where to go and it's fine. That first run though good GOD was that annoying. I don't personally believe forced stealth sections add anything to gameplay and I wish they'd figured something else out. But it's quick enough it shouldn't be TOO much of a problem. Secondly on your first B campaign especially if Claire see if you can not use the minigun on the bossfight right after. I had to reload and redo the last ten minutes because I made it unwinnable for myself from what I could tell. Could be I'm a moron.The game handles great looks amazing sounds amazing and is actually good enough to satisfy a complete snob 20 years practiced. Can't recommend high enough.10/10 William Birkin",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-04,0,0,44,False,Recommended,After putting in many hours beating all scenarios and 100%ing the achievements i wanted to give my 2 cents.So you boot it up you tackle your first play through. You will be scared you will be anxious and you will die. Like all well crafted games however you will dust yourself of and go again slowly overcoming the fear understanding the mechanics and treating the game more like an action 3rd person shooter than the survival horror it is. Which segways me nicely into another point. This is absolutely 100% a survival horror you have very limited carry capacity ammo is scarce and zombies soak your puny rounds with ease. Running away is not only an option its a very viable strategy. As you dodge weave and backstep away from monsters and start to feel a sense of accomplishment the game will throw a curve ball at you and spawn the tyrant around the next corner forcing you to chance up your strats on the spot and worry once again. Youre CONSTANTLY on the edge of your seat and its SO MUCH FUN. The puzzles are simple but well implemented and chance the pace and flow of the game some more so than others. Some can feel like MMO fetch quests. The combat is tense you're quite slow sluggish and paper like in the hardest difficulties you can die in 2 zombie chomps But you have the capacity to stagger mobs and this is where quick headshots mad dashes and tactical grenades come into play. Its incredibly satisfying. It looks gorgeous absolutely stunning. Every.Single.Scene is well presented and implemented. I cannot fault the art direction one single bit.

2019-02-06,0,0,22,False,Recommended,***Very light spoilers***I have to admit being someone who played the original this was quite a faithful remake. The story is for the most part the same. The enemies feel fresh and new even though they are just upgrades of an original concept. Bosses feel as they would but look better than ever under the new engine. Now don't let me mislead you this is not a carbon copy of the past with a fancy new sticker attached it has plenty of new things to throw you off. The overall mechanics feel great the zombies are unlike anything I have ever seen (by far my favorite zombies of any current game out there) it just feels amazing to play. While there are some inconsistencies in the story progression this isn't unlike what we had in the past so I can let it go as them being a little too accurate or simply saving time on asset development. Bosses are fun an interesting but not overwhelming. The boss encounters can be very fun and take the player aback on their first playthrough but they are not completely overwhelming. The difficulty this game offers comes from your ability to learn adapt and make smart decisions when they are needed. This is a survival game after all. Do not expect some unbelievably hard supreme omegaboss to come in and sweep you off your feet they are completely manageable and to an extent even easy to abuse. This all comes with practice and experience however.I am certain everyone who plays this will have one heck of an impressionable first playthrough whether you succeed or need to restart because you depleted your resources too much to effectively proceed. Remember to play smart pay attention to all notes examine EVERYTHING and do not panic when a bad situation occurs. Good luck fellow RPD rookies.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

Why even bother adding them if you can just walk by them sure sure it makes some tense moments when X is chasing you and a Licker happens to be in the hallway too but I mean come on they're kinda pointless and it's not just like a random Licker here or there they're eventually in like every damn hall way one or two at a time to me it ruins the Licker it adds more of an ""Well would you look at that!!!! its just another one of them Licker folks. Hey little feller don't mind me im just passin by"" instead of a panic feeling of ""Oh heck It's a dang ol' spooky a$$ Licker man the fudge am I going to do I don't want to waste my ammo on this friggen frick???"" Not only that you can totally cheat them by just going in and out of the room if you have to kill them. Guess the same thing can be said about the zombies but at least some of them can chase you through doors.Anyways if you're a fan of RE 0 RE 1(Remake as well) RE 2 and RE 3 like me.

2019-01-31,0,0,32,False,Recommended,I'm simply blown away by how good of a REmake this is. The enemy design within the game works out great and you always feel a tinge of danger even when facing basic enemies like the regular zombies but full blown anxiety attacks when you screw up while fighting or fleeing from bigger threats like Lickers Mr. Birken or Mr. X. Speaking of Mr. X he's best scary snazzy looking antagonist I've seen in a game in years. His unstoppable nature large figure and stomping footsteps let you know he's a major threat from the get go and seeing him remastered after all these years in such a great way really makings me want to hug the whole team who put together this REmake.I haven't even mentioned the sound design which is critically important to good horror. The ambient sounds enemy sounds and even the sounds of the protagonists panting and cursing are all so well done! Take note developers this is what you should strive for when designing sound for your horror games.This is beyond a faithful REmake this was better than what I could have hoped for.With the massive success RE 2 is seeing I'm almost certain I'll be able to experience RE 3 remade using very similar assests in the near future. With how they handled modeling Mr. X I can't wait to see how they'll recreate Nemesis.Oh and I wouldn't mind a RE4 remake with more content added in a few years either.

2019-01-30,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Man I can't even begin to tell how positive of an impact this game has given to me. This game is everything I wished from the original Re2 and the developers faithfully brought an amazing retelling of the story with very faithful level design. Absolutely gorgeous photorealistic graphics fantastically optimized game engine that runs very well on my midend laptop very indepht and great sound design very memorable and great enemy designs and perhaps the best zombies in a modern PC game yet the storytelling is an upgrade compared to the old game but perhaps on my opinion they could have added more scenes like the one from the original when Leon meets Claire at the S.T.A.R.S. Office and hands her brother's diary to her adding more scenes with them in general would been good since it was lacking.I might sound unreasonable but the game cant be without some flaws. My personal opinion the game lacks a lot of music and some tracks like the save room track is way too short and some are barely noticeable due to the focus of ambient background noises which isn't a bad thing itself but it might been a bit too much. For me memorable tracks in game were at the chief iron's office and the sewer plug socket room cause the music usually were playing constantly there. I felt the boss fight music were bit too generic and doesn't come close to the magic that the original soundtrack caught but this could be just my nostalgia talking. Second critic I got on this game A and B scenarious could have fought different forms of the G than having the both charecters doing the same boss fights it kinda creates an inconsistancy in the story while on the original they atleast they knew how to seperate this properly to make the storytelling more believable. And my last criticsm on the game they could had way more enemy varieties nearing the end of the game the lab section felt tad too empty and perhaps maybe bit too modern compared rest of the series which really didn't give the sense of a cold and sterile enviorement that the original game gave. It's a shame they cut out the giant spiders crows moth enemies and more.On overall this game is amazing and my opinion sets a great foundation for future RE titles I hope capcom will come out with new remakes of the classics and do as a great job as on this one. This is a definete buy to anyone who is new to resident evil or to veterans of the series. Must buy.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-01-30,0,0,34,False,Recommended,"Alright let me make this as short as i can do you like games? i mean do you? yes? no? well if the answer is yes this is a Game yes an actual video game no ""life service"" no ""platform"" no ""always online multiplayer because we can't make money with single player games anymore"" t it's the real deal a GAME. First and foremost let me say this It's an absolute masterclass in Survival Horror well considering the early RE titles are themselfes the ones that started this genre proper it shouldn't be a surprise. Now since this is a complete remake the story was slightly altered and modernized in a good way the progression is slightly different than the original but most notably we get the RE4 6 Third person action camera that really stands out this time around because RE2 is the PERFECT fit for this over the shoulder camera angle which manages to really give the game a claustrophobic feeling and adds a lot of ""gravity"" to the overall gameplay. Guns feel heavy gunshots feel impactful and overall the gameplay itself is just excellent if you like well action games.Now let's get to the one thing that will probably turn off people who never played any game before 2010 The controls CAN be clunky but it is part of the design boss fights in particular can make you curse a lot because both leon and claire somewhat behave like trucks on a muddy road during those but this is a deliberate part of the design so you commit to your action and strategie going forward bolstered by it's particular focus on resource management and the overall theme of planning ahead for a few minutes. Now a lot of people that are not used to these kinds of concepts will curse the game while i sat there and admired how well all of the gameplay functions synergize and how well executed the entire thing is. Another ""con"" could be said about the game's lenght my first playthrough took me about 6 hours (while clearing out the entire game all items every room accessible with that character etc) and the second scenario took me a tad longer cause i chose to play leon first and claire second (claire being the harder of the two due to slightly less powerful weapons and i believe she also takes a bit more damage overall). So overall i'd say the average player will probably spend 7 9 hours per playthrough which amounts to about 17 20 hours for the ""full story"". But there is a TON more to do afterwards re explore the different scenarios try to optimize your time for higher rankings and unlock new guns and outfits etc. And yes you actually have to PLAY to unlock guns/skins/outfits for your characters you can't spend 20 bucks on it.. you actually have to play.. unbelievable the nerves on this dev eh? And the most unbelievable part of this all? FREE DLC coming feb. 15 with 3 new scenarios that's what i call madness! MADNESS!Well turns out this was rather long so sorry for this yet i haven't even touched on some of the most important aspects of the game so to wrap it up here are a few more bullet points that might be of interest Great optimization (running over 250+ fps maxed out (1440p) on a Vega 64 a SINGLE Vega 64 yes my rig has 2 but that'd be a waste of electricity at that performance) 4K runs at around 120 140 with like i said everything maxed out except deactivated Motion Blur and Depth of field for personal preference. Sometimes cheesy sometimes good story backed by STRONG performances from the voice actors (well done!) Still since the original some of the best level design in gaming history backtracking that doesn't feel like work but an actual revisit with a few twists here and there. Despite what i said about the overall controls earlier the Keybinds for PC are PERFECT you can certainly see this isn't a simple console port but done by people who know and understand PC players. NO SPIDERS! (yay!) Thanks Capcom from the bottom of my heart thank you for this cause i would have otherwise missed out on this amazing experience!

I treasure the first 4 resident evil games and now RE2 Remake will make it 5.

2019-01-26,0,0,20,False,Recommended,Classic survival horror returning with the RE engine. The game almost feels like a open world with the amount of replayability (ability to roam around) in the Raccoon City Police Department with the endless dark areas surrounding you for most of times during objectives gives the player a reminder of the hostiliy and how escaping one event doesn't neccesarily mean they won't be put in another. The game can be very punishing with the misuse of resources. Such as the attempt to guns blazing in to clearing a area will cause you to run out of ammo much faster than someone who would just use what is needed to bypass the enemies. This is because of the absurd hitpoints the enemies get making the player learn to be conservative with resources as possible. (Critical headshot in this game is rare)The visual design found in this remake will blow the old and newcomers into the Resident Evil series away. With the amount of detail found in the diliapidated Raccoon City to the terrifying facial designs of the zombies. (I also suggest users to switch to DirectX 12 if they encounter a bug with the first cutscene in the police station) The controls are something I can't talk about for keyboards since I just found it more simple with a controller. But the controller controls are fairly easy to remember. I'm expecting it to be the same thing as PS4 and Xbox. You should try and play around with the control settings such as toggle/hold for sprinting because it might not be the right one for you.The sound for this game will scare the living hell outta you. From the creaking floors in the police station to the endless footsteps created by Mr X trying to find you and last but not all the enemies growling sound all trying to make the player aim down their sight through every corridor and every hallway. Overall this is one hell of a game to remember in the franchise. Capcom being able to redesign a 90's game from the old tank control to a over shoulder camera angle to be able to appeal to modern day gamers show that they understand what survival horror fans today want and it is true that survival horror games do not get as much recognition as they should. But I think this one really does shine the light in the genre. I hope Resident Evil 3 Remake continues its development and nothing tragic happens in its way as I can't wait to discover what all the hype is about surrounding the 3rd series installment in its remake.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-04,0,0,20,False,Recommended,Please note that I am a religious fan of the 1998 version of the game.I enjoyed this game they succeeded in recreating some of the original experience despite the deep changes (modernization) in the gameplay.It is also remarkable how they were able to change so little in the level design more or less the police station floor configuration is still the same.The atmosphere undoubtedly changed from the original as gameplay is now much more fast paced due of the camera style changements. (Fixed va 3rd person). And I think from this point of view the original 98 game still dominates the soundtrack along with the slow paced exploration (it could be enabled in RE2make too with an optional dlc but the transition between each room is too fast now). Also fixed cameras have a strong advantage in creating tension of not knowing what could be there around a corner.That's not a minor issue as the atmosphere for sure was the key selling point of the original. But I have to say here we have some consistent improvements in character design characterisation and plot. Anyway it's not that this remake doesn't recreate that feeling in it's own way tyrant related gameplay for example is strongly improved now when you are able to ear footsteps between rooms and it creates much more tension because you feel the thing hunting you. Also ammo and weapon management became more strict now.For sure weapons feel much less satisfactory as they feel less destructive compared to the original. Just thinking about the shotgun once upgraded it was able to destroy the upper half of a zombie in the original. Here just to make zombie head explode you have to aim very carefully. Handgun too feels almost like shooting with a softair replica as zombie are now able to withstand a lot more of firepower.This is a design choice that I appreciated in exacerbating the sense of unsafetyness even if it has its own downsides it feels more realistic now for sure (in general the whole game feels more real).One criticism I have to move is the poor historical accuracy of some content laptops everywhere sci fi gadgets (Ada) usb pen drives a lab that comes out from the 20xx. It was an easy win to recreate some 90s atmosphere but they did poor choices from that point of view.So to sum up it is different from the original and has some advantages and disadvantages not better not worse but the first was one of the best experiences that videogames can offer.So I would definitely recommend this.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-07,0,0,18,False,Recommended,Thank you Capcom! I fell in love with this series as a kid in the late 90s and it was always a favorite series of mine... That said I was hoping that this could live up to the hype that it created once it was announced.It has exceeded my expectations so much. I am happy that most of what I see talked about this game is positive. I understand that some won't like it because they are irritated over finicky details or they feel like they have a lack of ammo or it takes too many bullets to bring a zombie down. Well... That's part of this game that makes it intense. It's not just the frustrations over figuring out the puzzle aspect the cheesy lines or getting slapped around by Mr X... It's a kayyer of figuring out how to survive. It's part of what makes it fun. They did great work with this one and the future of the series looks bright after this!,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-11,0,0,53,False,Recommended,"Resident evil 2 is a masterpiece of modern gaming that takes all the elements it went to recreate and renewed them in engaging ways. Zombies while slow (ramp up speed once in close) are a random element that makes you decide how to deal with them as ""how"" you deal with them effects your finite amount of supplies you are given. There is a tension that builds knowing that leaving them alive in whatever state you've left them makes a trek through that same place another ordeal you have to consider. Then about mid way on your first play through you are dealt with an adversary that forces you to play differently then your used too further increasing the tension. Some encounters will leave you feeling as if you barely made it out on the skin of your teeth which in turn further increases that tension. This is what makes Resident evil 2 a great horror experience. There is a sense of dread but you have the capability to overcome it and the way zombies act when ""downed"" further leave you wondering if you've truly taken them out as their bodies lay almost exactly where you left them as a reminder or a surprise. Capcom continues returning its beloved series to survival horror and this game is the very definition of that.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-11,0,0,12,False,Recommended,"I first played the original when I was about 13 years old and I would say that they managed to make this game appeal to people who played the original and also to players who are new to the series.The graphics are very nice and the zombies are a real threat because your standard pistol seems to fire only rubber bullets (you get used to it it's best to do a head shot and run for it while they struggle if you are somewhere where you don't have to clear the room because of puzzles).Anyway the game is not without flaws as the original was but it would be complaining on a very high level because the pros outweight the flaws of the games by a long run.What maybe would confuse people who just hear of RE2 the first time and fall into the ""playtime trap"" is that they say something like playtime around 5 10 hours. This could be considered ""fake news"" these days because while you could finish the game in that time if you don't struggle at all finding anything or never die this would only mean you've played 1 out of 4 times through the game because you can chose between playing as Leon or Claire once through the game each with a bit different paths and events and then after finishing this so called ""a game"" you can play the opposite version of that playthrough with Claire or Leon as ""game b"". So essentially the playtime will be at least 2 3 times as much as a single playthrough (unless you are not interested in that content after one playthrough of course but since when do games get judged by main story time and not complete content).Only little flawed master piece (my cons so far are only nit picks like gunpowder+gunpowder hand gun bullets but hey it's a game after all right?)PS This game proofs the lack of quality of american steel thanks to Trumps regime because knifes break after 3 4 uses.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-06,0,0,28,False,Recommended,This is one of very few games that holds my attention during my last 2 years on this ridiculous planet earth !Graphics With an i9 9900K processor and a GTX1080 this game runs MAXED out (Anti Aliasing Disabled) in 60fps on the 2880x1620P Resolution.Anything above this resolution with the given specs will drop frames slightly to the point where you have to tune down some other settings to maintain a 60 frames ratio.During some minor cutscene's Knife stabbing or certain specific area's !3040x1710P &gt Frame drops to 543200x1800P &gt Frame drops to 513360x1890P &gt Frame drops to 473520x1980P &gt Frame drops to 413840x2160P &gt Frame drops to 38It looks a little bit better then RE 7 !Especially on the reflections because that was a big weakness in RE 7.They look a bit less correlated and appear smoother even with AA methods disabled !Sadly this game only implements TAA and FXAA and both methods of Anti Aliasing greatly reduce texture sharpness !Making the benefit of higher resolution diminished bacause of these AA methods.I do not run a RTX card setup and i am not sure if the game supports the new DLSS AA method ( If i remember the name right ).But i can imagine that might improve both framerates and texture sharpness.My advice on PRE RTX cards Disable AA to maintain sharpness and a slightly better framerate on overall taking some minor aliasing as a small downside.Gameplay The game actually is pretty short if you play it like a slow detective driven horror story and really explore your surroundings on a first run you will aproxximately get 8 to 10 hours out of a LEon A playthrough.Yes the game offers Time based categorization to unlock some unlimited ammo weapons.But i greatly encourage you to play through it a FIRST time without aiming for those limits.Simply so you can really enjoy the game instead of rushing it because of a time scheme !The game does add queite some replayability in the form of perfecting your run.As well as adding B Runs to both Claire Redfield and Leon Kennedy.Just as much as also adding multiple survivor modes as other characters.That will add more playtime for those that stick around for some time !If you just are here for the story though. RE2 Remake can feel a bit short like most titles in the series.And comparing it to RE 4 or RE 7 the story is much more simplistic and in all honesty does not come close to those storylines i dare say the story even appears to be a little bit boring and certainly more commmon then those !Some minor downsides of the game do not appear during a normal playthrough.However when you really start to aim for those speedrun times to unlock certain unilimited ammo weapons.You will definitely notice some minor bugs.Like when the same type of zombie dies of just 2 headshots where the head actually says SPLAT!!!! !While after loading a savegame the exact same Zombie takes over 17 bullets to actually DIE and the same head to say SPLATTTT !!!This gives players the slight feeling they are playing through Random Generated scheme's that do affect the ability to finish of zombies quick or not.I tested this during the loading of the same area's multiple times and appear throuighout all of the game.And these Random Generated scheme's can also apply to specific boss battles When timing your run you can win significant on time or save ammo simply by loading your game and replaying it even though it seemed you have done it as quick as possible.These Random Generated slowdowns will most likely not appear during a 2nd or 3rd save game load !This kind of system can feel slightly outdated for a 2019 game !Especially when you have to restart a complete run just because some random developer thought it would be fun to add such Random Generated Scheme's !! Yes you can debate about it and it does add some more playtime.But it also adds a little bit of annoyance.Where things are outside of the area of your own skill and based on such scheme's.But on OVERALL !!I am really glad with the game !It definitely is much more balanced then so many other horror stories.And the inventory management and just a large enough diversity of weapons across Claire and Leon.Make this game outstanding despite some minor setbacks.Some also claim RE2 1998 was much better in terms of gameplay.Believe me !!!!!!!!!!!They are just being nostalgic because RE 2 Remake beats it in each and every way !!!!!!!!!!! The deluxe edition's price seems a bit expensive for just some character skins and such !!You are better off buying the base game.But i fyou are a millionaire and a greedy elite guy be sure to spend your dimes on the deluxe edition !So that the MAIN developer can give us more of these type of games over the upcoming years !NO RE 2 Remake it's story does not come close to the quality of RE 4 or RE 7 !It feels bland boring and common they even cut back on some scene's comparing it to RE 2 Original.That said where they do leave out scene's they often do add more then what the original had to offer on othert parts.And that is probably why the game feels NEW even though it is a remake !Do i think they went to the absolute limit !.No they could have perfectioned it way more !The played it too much on the safe side !!!!!!And relied a little bit too much on nostalgia for the sales department !But it is acceptable and comapring it to horror games outside the Resident Evil standard !It holds it head high above most titles.Then again this developer has a MASS follower base so honestly i would have expected a little bit more story wise !Taking the own series as a standard i would apply a 7.5 out of 10 score !Where RE 4 being a 8.5 and RE 7 a 8.9 for better story driven content then even RE 4 !Although again that may be discussable !But on overall i feel it is like a decent horror game !,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

Make them do more damage and find less ammo? Not the end of the world.Id wish I seen a shove or kick zombies out of the way feature maybe a curb stomp when you knock them down?Counter attacks A+ given if you have the items on you.Adding gun powder to make ammo very nice makes getting ammo for whatever gun easier.The cut scenes with Clair in them hahaha wtf the faces she makes for how shes rendered in the game its funny for how bad she looks.The auto discard of items would be nice to have again.Adding a +1 to guns that are mag fed would but a nice thing to see also.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-12,0,0,34,False,Recommended,I was not going to purchase this because I do not enjoy the 3rd person perspective. I played original re2 and it was great but controls and movement were terrible. I enjoyed the atmosphere thought. I loved re7 and it s 1st person approach so I was delighted to learn there was one made for re2 remake as well. I bought the game the same minute. The mod is great although a little bit clunky but so is 3rd person controls. I love it the atmosphere is superb and the game is even more scary graphics are fantastic same as the sound but I would recommend adding the original sounds (much much better... or is it just nostalgia?) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH. Especially with properly setup steam gyro controller (it s not a mouse and keyboard but it s a comfy couch and a big tv win for me) The story and dialogs are a bit cheesy for current times (not like 90 s action movies) but it s presented superbly. There are some downsides like pointless boss fights which are a bit silly (or old fashioned) and little frustrating but the rest is SO SO GOOD. My only gripe is that because you can play as both characters you repeat some actions despite doing it previously so there are some continuity issues which does not make sense. They could have easily be fixed with a bit of rewriting and then this geme would be simple incredible and classic. Also I m not sure why I did not enjoy mr T. changes from the original. He can add to the tension but can also be incredibly frustrating when you try to explore and soak the atmosphere however there is a trainer for that too. The ammo is really limited but it adds to the tension perhaps sometimes too much. Not a fun of incredibly difficult games so I play it on assiting difficulty to avoid adaptable difficulty changes. It s still plenty difficult and takes several bullets to down a zombie (even more to down them for good) so I would recommend it. I m not a hardcore player and rather enjoy the tension and atmosphere without running like headless chicken to avoid getting killed. Overall I d say 8/9 out of 10. If they had designed it to seamlessly flow from one play through to another without repeating most of the actions it would be 10. Don t pirate it. Buy and support it. This is how the games should be. And if you experience black screen in game with just menu visible. There is a fix by changing disabling one item in config file. Google it as I do not remember atm but did see it somewhere on the re2 remake forum.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-14,0,0,47,False,Recommended,45 Hours in to a game you can beat in under an hour if you're a masterclass player and study it. Just finished my Claire/Leon S+ runs and a few difficult achievements and started moving onto weekly challenges decided it was time to review the game.I could go on and on about this game but I'll try to keep it simple and sweet It just does everything it sets out to do on an entirely new level that sets the bar insanely high for future AAA survival horror titles. The game does an immaculate job of challenging you at every turn without feeling like it's cheated you and caters to such a huge variety of players at the same time. You can really take your time explore every nook and cranny immerse yourself in the horrifying atmosphere that's rich with lore and incredible sound/level design and be rewarded for careful planning and resource management. You can learn the game inside and out and beat it in 1.5hrs without breaking a sweat and STILL have a ton of fun every time you do it. The controls are tight the gunplay is super satisfying and responsive enemies react to your firepower appropriately on standard difficulty and the game really feels like it helps mold you into an efficient machine without you noticing it much which is about the highest praise you can give a game. RE2 R is an absolute must for just about any gamer and especially for those who enjoy strong narrative driven games with an emphasis on exploration or just plain old horror fans. Capcom showed up on a level most people did not expect with this title and I can't wait for what the future of the franchise holds from here on out.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-01,0,0,27,False,Recommended,"Resident evil has always been a huge part of my life. As a kid all my older family members played them (1 3 at the time) and were constantly talking about it. I was too young to play it at the time of course (about 8 maybe?)...so what did I do? I snuck out of my room at night and played them with the strategy guide they had ). I remember countless nights running from the dead while keeping an ear out for the telltale squeak of the floor of someone getting up. Not only did zombies send me running so did avoiding my parents. Pausing the game turning off the T.V and running back to my room became just as much a reflex as combining herbs. Every time I heard a toilet flush and a door close behind I would go back into the nightmare. I played them the entire time my family was talking about them but I could never join the discussion without giving myself away. I was the envy of all my freinds my age at school for having played them and one of the ""cool kids"" for those older who had. As I grew up and I no longer had to hide I began playing all of the classic and new resident evils regularly and they have been some of my favorite games all time. Come 2019 the are remaking my favorite of all the series resident evil 2! I wait in anticipation praying to the AAA gods for a good dice roll and not land 76. It comes out just before my birthday to rave reviewes. I quickly put my money together to try and afford the 80$ price here and Canada. Alas I should have put in more overtime at work. However to my suprise a good freind of mine Mr.ronoc gifts it to me as a present. What. A. Legend. Back into the classic nightmare I go.I make sure to buy myself the classic sound pack and boot up the game. I am greeting with the familiar ""Resident evil....2!"" and I grin ear to ear in nostalgia immediatly back in my parents living room at 2 in the morning. Ready to shoot some zombies. As I play all the old memories come flooding back as I run around a glorius HD rendition of the police station I spent so much time in. I know it like my own home. Running past zombies solving puzzles. All with the original soundtrack.This game is a masterpiece for new comers and veterans alike.

2019-02-12,0,0,56,False,Recommended,"9/10This RE2 remake is the proof that remakes/reboots can be amazing when done right. This shows that Capcom despite still messing up here and there throughout the years is still listening to their fans and willing to fix their past mistakes by creating content that people actually want.RE2 feels as welcoming to new players as it also feels refreshing to fans from the original games.Rather than continue to go down the path of games like RE6 this game goes back to the origins of the Resident Evil games gruesome disturbing horror. There are no cover mechanics no dodge abilities and no melee combat other than attacking with a knife. You rely entirely on aiming and running except this time using a third person view instead of the classic ""tank controls"" which not only allows the player to get a closer look at the disturbing enemies coming their way but also to aim where they want to aim (rather than a fixed up/center/down aim from the original game).The game looks and feels amazing a whole new look at the classic scenarios like the police station the sewers and the laboratory with nothing held back in terms of gore and violence. The game still feels like the classic game as it maintains many of the original items and even the layout for some of the places but also making some very necessary changes by either adding things that were needed or removing things that weren't. The layout of the police station is slightly different but a lot of it is still like the original. As an example Claire's crossbow was removed since it was an awful weapon to use in the original game being replaced with the SMG (which is no longer a special weapon) and the grenade launcher now only uses incendiary and acid rounds with no ""normal rounds"" anymore. Weapon upgrades can be found for almost every weapon in the game instead of only for Leon's arsenal. Puzzles were reworked to feel less annoying and troublesome while still offering some challenge and the inventory while still quite limited can now be upgraded by finding hip pouches.One interesting detail the game adds is that there are no more ""safe doors"" as enemies will chase the character through doors. Mr. X also shows up in both scenarios further increase how tense the game feels as he'll be relentlessly chasing the character until they manage to run away or temporarily stun him with headshots. He remains present through a good portion of the game and can be heard patrolling around requiring caution in order to avoid the areas he's patrolling.Difficulty levels are quite balanced Normal offers a decent challenge without feeling overwhelming Easy has enemies somewhat weakened and offers aim assist and Hardcore is pretty much a harder version of the original game the game can only be saved by using ink ribbons plus enemies are harder. In addition there are also less hip pouches to be found and some of the health/ammo items are replaced with ink ribbons.There is also a good number of unlockables. 4th Survivor is unlocked by beating both scenarios while Tofu Survivor is unlocked by beating 4th Survivor. There are also 5 infinite weapons that can be unlocked by achieving certain rankings in certain difficulties as well. S rank now only requires the game to be beaten under a certain time limit (according to difficulty and scenario) while S+ rank requires that plus a maximum number of 3 saves and no use of infinite weapons.My only problem with the game is that scenarios A and B don't really feel that different. While in the classic game it felt like they were both two stories happening at the same time with different puzzles and bosses involved this time it feels like the only difference is the first part of the game (navigating through the police station). After that everything feels pretty much the same. Both scenarios will have the same encounters and the same bosses. If we're considering that scenario A and scenario B are two stories that are happening at the same time as Leon and Claire go their own ways it makes no sense to consider that they're going through (mostly) the same events and fighting the same bosses.Still however this is very much an incredible remake that I easily recommend even at full price. Plus there is also free DLC coming up in the future as well.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-10,0,0,19,False,Recommended,This game is fantastic. I have no nostalgia for the original game I never played it. However this game stands on it's own two feet as a modern testament to great game design. The story is compelling the characters are fantastic and the music is great. Managing your inventory to try and make it to the next typewriter is as stressful as always but seeing the next saferoom and hearing that familiar music is so rewarding. I wish there was a little more variety in between runs instead of the same places with relatively the same progression. I also wish you could see the impact of one character affecting the other on the second run but that's just me.If you have any interest in this game at all I promise you that it's worth it. I paid full price but you could probably wait for a sale. While this game is amazing it's not going anywhere.

I was sceptical as to whether Capcom could pull of a remake of RE2 that felt both fresh but also didn't change too much of what made the original great. But boy did they do it with this! I think this may even be better than the original RE2 which I can't believe I am saying. It is genuinely terrifying. Being stalked by Mr X is what nightmares are made of. The zombies that shuffle around in the dark and lunge for you when you least expect it and not to mention the visually pleasing combat system which literally sees the zombies bodies fall to pieces in front of your very eyes when you unload bullets into them.Dialogue is also much improved and it also has a great deal of replayability to it.

Graphics are top notch sound design is on point and the game is just brimming with atmosphere. Not only that but there are two campaigns. You really get your money's worth with this game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-05,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Good game and I recommend buying it. But lets get to the negatives first so that Capcom hopefully does something about it with future updates Spoilers Ahead Story Zombie Brad is not in the game. Hopefully future updates add him back or if he isn't coming back on RE2 then hopefully Jill will face him as Zombie in RE3 Remake. Else it's going to be a waste. Ben's role in this Remake was a letdown. I was hoping to see more of him not just Leon being an and then Ben dying all of a sudden His death was cool but it was too quick . Leon didn't meet with Sherry on the police station at all. Even on Leon B. There's literally no connection between him and sherry in this game unlike RE2 and RE DSC. Even if he couldn't talk with her he should have seen her running away or something like that. Consistency error. If Willaim Birkin already breaks the bridge on the underground part of the police station when you play as Leon the bridge possibly couldn't be fixed in such a short time for Birkin to break it again when Claire comes. I'm not sure if Claire or Leon meets Birkin first but that is irrelevant since the bridge breaks on both campaigns which doesn't make sense. Same kind of error can be seen here and there in the game. There's barely any difference between A and B scenarios for the same character so at least there should have been consistencies among the story. Enemy types I didn't see different models of Lickers. Was expecting different Lickers on the lab. No spiders at all. Having at least few of them on the sewers would be great. Maybe just one spider as mini boss. Crows should have been at least present on cutscenes or something. Technical aspects Lack of proper support for different aspect ratios. Only 16 9 is supported properly. 21 9 works during gameplay but cutscenes are pillar boxed. 32 9 and multimonitor aspect ratios are vert vertically cropped . What's funny is that cutscenes are letter boxed to 16 9 and yet they are vertically cropped lol. 16 10 and 4 3 are letter boxed too.There should be options to turn off black bars and the cropping should be fixed. It's not like it's impossible cause all these problems are unofficially fixed and are available here on WSGF website www.wsgf.org . No option to turn off vignette. It makes the game way too dark. Again it is fixed by fans See the link on WSGF above . Having the ability to turn it off would be great. Ingame contrast slider would be great too. This game has sharpening filter which works well with TAA but any Anti Aliasing setting other than TAA suffers from severe sharpening which looks downright ugly. An option to disable sharpening filter would be great so that SMAA and FXAA can be used. Interlaced mode on PC looks noticeably worse than Xbox One X's interlaced mode as you can see on Leon's hair which shimmers weirdly on PC with interlaced mode with TAA. A small fix on this issue would be appreciated.These are some of the few things which if fixed would make the game a GOTY material for me. The game in it's current state is already great and was totally worth the 60$. The base game is long enough and enjoyable to justify the 60$.I finally found another good third person game on PC after Evil Within 2. There are so many 3rd person single player games on consoles and I like 3rd person games. The gore in this game is on point too. Shooting zombies and seeing visual feedback really adds to the immersion.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

Capcom went back where they started but with modern graphic and gameplay this is a masterpiece!! I love RE2,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-14,0,0,19,False,Recommended,This is what you call a game. The people who made RE2 Remake understood very well what made the original great and left all of that in modernizing and improving the rest. As a result we have a unique artifact of modern game industry where the 1998 game design formula is left largely intact while every other element fits a major AAA title quality wise. And wow what a breath of fresh air that is! A game that teaches you how to play in the process doesn't hold your hand and punishes you for stupid moves not lack of motor skill (the latter seems to be what today's game designers think difficulty is).Realistically this is not even a remake. It's a new game that follows an old story and an old design philosophy. Play it if you want to know how games used to be.Gotta love people who have had trouble with the game since it doesn't twist and bend to suit you though. Watching some people play has been a laughing feat for me. Almost as fun as actually playing. Oh yeah do I have to say I will play this again and again in the future?,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-14,0,0,149,False,Recommended,"From the frenzied playtime (110+ hours) I've clocked in for this game plus the effort sunk into the game to get Rank S/S+ and unlocking all ""Records"" and ""Achievements"" and doing runs (clear everything on map turning each room blue bare essentials run out of bounds run etc) this game caters to the methodical drink it in soak it up players enjoying the disturbing atmosphere right up to the speedrunners shaving their runtime below one hour. I've clocked in 11 hours for my first engagement with RE2R and has since brought that time down to 1 hour 10 minutes and still pushing to better that time on the next run I do. It's engaging gripping disturbing horrifying ........ it's pure Resident Evil at its core. Play this like a survival horror (save your ammo and outthink your zombie adversories) you get rewarded for the boss fights in the end. Play this like an FPS watch your ammo dry up and the ""You Are Dead"" coming up the screen. Play this right ignore your typical FPS/BR instincts just like how a survival horror game should be played.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-01-27,0,0,56,False,Recommended,I have played the hell out of this game it is just good. Capcom did an amazing job with balancing horror and good shooting. I played bits and pieces of the OG RE2 but never really knew what was going on or anything. It's a remaster so i'm not really going to do a review of the story. The shooting in this game is so satisfying and i love it. There aren't as many guns as I had hoped there would be but there is enough to enjoy for each character. Claire gets an SMG and a grenade launcher while leon gets a shotgun and a magnum which is the coolest gun in the game. Leon's story is more fun but it's harder. The graphics in this game are amazing theyre not as good as RDR2 but the gore in it makes up for it. You shoot a zombie in the leg you'll see its leg torn open. One of the only problems I have with this game Leon and Claire's stories aren't really different... They both do the same thing in the same area. I really wish If you were to play as Leon he would be doing stuff outside of RPD and not what Claire should be doing. After you finish scenario A and B you unlock the coolest part of the game HUNK survival. Hunk is basically S.W.A.T John wick he's just so cool. I do wish that they gave HUNK his own story all he got was just some race to the finish crap. I was informed that they might add more characters in newer DLCs and I cannot wait. The best remasters take that extra step and RE2 does just that. I hope other remasters can learn from this and we don't get something like Hitman 2 Silent Assassin HD again. Overall If you are a fan of the Resident Evil series but dont care for that weird camera angle get this remaster.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

Hell you could even say that I went into this game as a total series beginner (even though I did play some RE games back then I never really found myself wanting to finish them) but boy this game is just great.Don't let my 1.3 hours of playtime fool you I already finish Leon's A scenario and currently playing through Claire's B scenario. I played it offline so Steam didn't really record my playtime during that period. I even have the achievements to prove it.I dont even tend to replay games I already beaten even if it adds more to the game's story. But this game kept me wanting more.Now I'm looking forward in getting RE7 in the next sale and maybe even giving the past games another go with this new outlook in the series. Hell I'm now excited for the RE3 Remake if Capcom decides to do so.As a total RE newcomer I HIGHLY recommend it.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-02,0,0,8,False,Recommended,(Still unfinished with the game) Really happy they remastered it and I haven't been disappointed playing this.

So it didn't feel like just a run an gun action pact game like Resident Evil 5 and 6.

Sometimes a single shot from a 9mm pistol blows their head off and keeps them dead. Other times it doesn't seem to matter how many bullets you pelt them with they keep getting back up. This inconsistency makes resource management a frustration whereas in the original it was more of a calculation you could at least be sure when an enemy was permanently down for the count.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

Spooky gothic starting area check Limited ammo check Unforgiving enemies check. This game has by far the darkest story of all Resident Evil titles even Code Veronica you don't need prior knowledge of the RE universe at all as its only loosely connected to the previous entries. Resident Evil 2 Remake takes a brand new and modernised view of the original RE2 This has been briliantly done by the devlopers over at Capcom they have taken the spark which gave the original the essance that made it what it was. Slight changes over the game will give old timers a sense of familiarity which will be greatly appreicated.Although this game does suffer from some very minor bugs it is easily something that will be patched within the month. Saying that . this game is greatly optimised for anyone to play This is a great entry point for newcommers to the series since it has the perfect blend between classic Resident Evil game mechanics and the new and modern graphics and gameplay. Do yourself a favour and don't skip on this one as its one of the best games I have played in early 2019 and a very solid entry to the series. 9.6/10 Definatly a must play,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

Story took me 10 hours total (both characters) for a single run on standard doing Leon first and Claire second.

They simply revived the survival horror genre and the franchise with its ""typical"" puzzles intense feels of spookiness (among them jump scares that actually works) implementing more standardized controls and bringing back the third person shoulder camera. There's also plenty of content to keep you busy the story progresses nicely and will come with something new to the table.The games graphics are amazing even though I play on low/medium settings and its really well optimized performance wise.

2019-02-12,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Unlike the Resident Evil 1 and 0 Remaster Resident Evil 2 is so completely remade from scratch it might as well be a whole new entry to the franchise. It feels like the natural evolution the series would have gone in had it not veered off its survival horror roots.As much as I loved the original 1998 game and wanted a remaster of it in the same manner of Resident Evil 1 and 0 I cannot deny that this remake is an incredible achievement and have thoroughly changed my mind. So much so that I would be overjoyed if older entries in the series were remade to this degree.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-09,0,0,14,False,Recommended,This is an amazing game. AAA horror games are sadly very rare these days so we doing get to enjoy a lot of games like resident evil 2 remake. I never played the old re2 so this was a fresh play through for me although I have played through re4 and re7 and loved them both. This game sort of acts as a mix between re2 re4 and re7 with some features from all three. It has the story of 2 with the gameplay of 4 and the graphics engine and polish of 7 allowing for the game to almost feel like a greatest hits collection of resident evil. If you have ever played an re game before then you will be getting more of the same but in a day where this type of game is getting harder and harder to find that's not a bad thing. The only this I would warn players who aren't experenced in survival horror games may have a real challange with this game. Whilst it's not the hardest game ever made it sure as hell seems more challanging than most AAA games we see these days. That's not bad for someone like me who tends to enjoy older shooters like singularaty and half life but to some younger or less experenced player this may be a put off. Overall though I loved this game and I can only hope for a new resident evil game or another remake some time soon.

2019-02-15,0,0,51,False,Recommended,Amazing game beaten it dozens of times. But the more I play (especially the extra modes) the more I realize the zombies grab waaaaay too easily. Kinda kills the fun when you are clear of them but they magically grab you. But other than that the game is perfectAs for the free dlc its free so I can't really complain but I was hoping for something more similar to the main campaign instead of yet another 4th survivor styled thing. Which gets very old. The action in the game is meant to be cumbersome so making so many modes focused on action instead of the puzzles that the main game is focused on really makes no sense to me. But its free... sooo... If it was something we paid for I'd be upset,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-15,0,0,48,False,Recommended,This game took everything that RE7 did right and made almost all of it better. The dark days of post RE3 seem to be finally over. No more QTE saturated linear bing bing wahoo. Someone finally figured out why people liked the originals and tried to update the formula for modern technology. And yes the camera angles and tank controls of the original were never a deliberate design decision they were a technical compromise mandated by how inept the Playstation was and only replicated in REmake due to rabid fanboy outrage. RE2 Remake has its problems like the insufficient difference between scenarios and the retconning of the dynamic between some of the characters but none of that ruins it. It plays great looks great and sounds great. Great Aiming works well but is not overly precise so you can't just breeze through combat like it's an FPS. It can be hard to hit things sometimes and that is good in a game where you need to conserve your ammo. Headshots are not powerful they only have a slight chance of decapitation ie. the same as in classic RE games. None of the bodies of enemies you've killed will disappear. So you'll be always wondering if those zombies are really dead. Also the bodies are physics objects that can trip zombies that walk over them. Zombie body part specific damage can be utilized in a variety of ways. Armless zombies have a hard time grabbing you and zombies without feet can't walk. In fact without feet they will drown if they crawl into water. Enemies and bosses change appearance based on damage taken and the appearance is different depending what type of damage they've received. In general enemies are extremely tough so you are made to constantly feel like you're wasting ammo so you'll be afraid of running out at critical times. Mr. X is unpredictable and you need to constantly adapt to his random movement throughout the level. There are scripted scenes such as him breaking down a wall to get you but even that sometimes doesn't happen just to make you question everything on consequent playthroughs. All puzzles have been improved and made more sensible. The police station is no longer a place where it's impossible to work without hunting down weird artifacts so you could move around. That aspect is not gone it has just been reduced. The worst designed boss fight of the original was changed into a normal enemy that is tough and dangerous and there are several of them. It replaces the most pointless enemy of the original the spider. Even locations are resources now. The player is given resources to block windows so that zombies can't get in. The player needs to choose which areas to secure. Item interfaces have some improvements like the ability to combine items directly in the storage menu. Video options have a brightness calibration system that goes to extreme lengths to ensure that all players get the optimal brightness settings with any display. Some video options I've never seen before such as letting you choose the output color space. As should be No QTEs. I can't believe we still need to be explicitly stating that. Player can remove weapon parts that have subjective benefits based on their preference. Player can't cheat by reloading weapons in the inventory menu like in the original. All enemies have sufficiently realistic senses. Zombies need to actually hear you move or see you with their eyes to be alerted. You can avoid plenty of engagements by being careful. Zombies can follow you through most doors unlike the monsters in RE7. Discarding items is now done manually no more annoying text box asking you to do it. Also there are items you think you won't need anymore but actually serve a purpose so that's why the system isn't entirely automated. No universal crafting items like in RE7 where you could decide whether you needed ammo or health. You need gunpowder for ammo and herbs for health. Every boss battle has been improved from the original (Not exactly hard to accomplish). They have proper arenas strategies and multiple stages. Bad The primary factor that determines the score of your playthrough is time like it's a speedrun or something. Actually being a careful survivalist who takes no risks and receives no damage is irrelevant. Basically you need to rush through so you have the smallest chances of actually surviving without saving the game ie. the opposite of smart. Using items and keys pauses the game. No more tense door unlocking moments like in RE7. Lickers have no hitstun no matter how powerful your attack is and will do immediate high damage counterattacks. There is no flashlight button. The character uses it automatically. Main character will continue to repeat the same exasperated exclamations about the behavior of zombies even after having faced off with dozens of them for hours on end. Readables will condescendingly highlight important information for you regardless of difficulty setting. Some of the different sound environments fade in and out too quickly when moving between areas instead of there being proper simulation of ambient sound volume. Aiming is over the shoulder so the camera is offset on the right therefore any obstacle on your right side obscures your character's aim. At least this is not a game where enemies can shoot so they can't attack you without you being able to return fire. Impossible to use defense items on stairs due to animation incompatibility. The player must take the damage if they are attacked on stairs. Textures often fail to load the maximum resolution mipmaps for some reason. (Could be a driver issue though) Special visual effects such as volumetric lighting render in extremely low resolutions unless your settings are in maximum.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

My only real negatives are that you will be hounded by one particular P.O.S. and you have to learn to deal or this experience may be a bad one for you but the positive is that it essential to keep you on your toes and the experience fresh.

2019-02-13,0,0,60,False,Recommended,While it's not my favorite game in the series (neither was the original) they've done a really excellent job with this. The combat is decent the graphics are pretty great and the story has been spiced up just a little bit but for the most part has been left as it was. The dual scenario's are back (Leon A/Claire B or Claire A/Leon B) and you really need to play through both scenarios to get the entire story just like the original. I didn't really care for the 4th Survivor mode but I've really enjoyed the rest of the game. I have assisted mode playthroughs normal mode playthroughs hardcore mode playthroughs speedruns and guides up on my channel if you're interested. The guide covers how to beat the game without using the item box and without using health items/recovery items. This will net you the Frugalist and Minimalist achievements.

2019-02-05,0,0,12,False,Recommended,One of the best games to start off 2019. BUT!! The game has hugh major bugs. That can ruin this game from being fun. For users who may not be using top tier gaming pcs. So far I encountered the fps dipping to 0 alot the game will randomly decide not to let me to use my action commands if I point my gun at certain points in the game. The player will rapid fire and eat up my ammo. But for top gaming pcs. You can expect a truely horriffying experience. That you will want to play over and over. Otherwise just buy the ps4 and xbox one versions. Mainly because this version of re2 is extremely poorly optimised and needs alot of work. Before I would say it was past the beta stages . It's no where close to a release version. An that really dissappoints me. I really hope capcom fixes most of these bugs. Otherwise for most pc users on mid ranged pc. You won't get much playtime from all the bugs and poorly responsive controls. Ignoring the camera can be a broken me. When the zombie attack cam and small hall cam gets messed up it hardly resets propperly causing many unfair deaths. /,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

After playing RE 5/6 and being let down and multiple other horror genre titles doing the same Resident Evil 7 came out with a new feel and story giving us a breath of fresh air with interesting story fun gameplay and an atmosphere overall that was great for the genre. Resident Evil 2 Remake was announced and I thought no way is this going to capture the sheer perfection (minus the voice acting) of the original nor was I expecting any new content with it. Just another rework reskin that would be barely satisfying. Boy was I wrong. This is by far one of the most perfect games I've ever played. Literally everything is perfect. Soundtrack zombie sounds lighting voice acting (...you overgrown sonofa ) story re visited and the mighty rework on Mr.X's involvement in the gameplay. I'm a VERY picky gamer usually finding my niche in the horror genre and I couldn't be more thrilled to have a new horror game to play over and over and over again. I played RE7 on the PS4 literally around a hundred times achieving a speed run of 1 43 and with this game I'll do the same. Buy this. Rarely have I been fully satisfied with a regular priced $60.00 game we get A LOT of content right at release and FOUR FREE DLC! BUY IT AND ENJOY IT!,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-14,0,0,171,False,Recommended,As someone who has played all the main Resident Evil titles (0 7) this one was always my favorite entry and I always hoped it would get a remake similar to the RE1 remake originally released on Gamecube. It's finally here and man was it worth the wait! I cannot recommend this game enough. Whether this is your 1st RE game or you're a fan of the series or you just enjoy survival horror games it's impossible to go wrong with Resident Evil 2.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-06,0,0,77,False,Recommended,"+ Tense fun gameplay+ Excellent graphics and audio+ Solid PC version+/ Very streamlined A/B scenarios are lacking compared to the original Missing scenes files and content from the original New Sherry and Ada sections suck Ghost Survivors is just more 4th Survivor Not enough musicWhen it comes to combat graphics animation and voice acting it's a great reimagining of RE2 that's been heavily updated for a modern audience. It's still largely the same game there are zombies and mutated creatures to dodge and defeat puzzles to be solved items to be found and combined to then be used in other areas. The adaptive difficulty of the action RE games (4/5/6) is present though it feels unnecessary (punishing good aim and stockpiling rewarding the opposite) the ""zapping system"" (A/B scenarios) got ruined and there are some minor flaws that can be nitpicked but it's still a lot of fun.Ways that the game feels streamlined (good for some perhaps too much for purists) Like RE1's remake the map shows rooms as blue when there's no reason to keep searching Going near items marks them on the map Going near something an item can be used on marks it on the map removing the need to think about what to do next when points of interest can just be scanned Like RE1's remake defense items can be used if an enemy grabs the player from the front keeping the player safe whilst hurting or stunning enemies Inventory space can be upgraded to 20 slots allowing multiple firearms ammo types defense healing and progression items to be carried Autosaves prevent much progress from being lost and make manual saves unnecessary most of the time there's less tension and more room for taking risks Manual saves don't require Ink Ribbons except on Hardcore difficulty which also has no autosavesEntering a new area is always tense in all the right ways and the locations lighting enemy design and controls all feel very polished but for fans of the original the most obvious issue it has as a remake is that the A/B scenarios have been watered down leaving all four possible scenarios' game progression and puzzles largely the same and producing unnecessary inconsistencies within the story.In the original version whichever character gets picked first is used in the ""A"" scenario afterwards the other character gets a ""B"" scenario producing four different playthroughs (Leon A/Claire B and Claire A/Leon B) all with varying puzzles areas and story. There are choices made in the first scenario that affect the second such as picking between the Side Pack or Machine Gun in one will leave the unpicked item in the other not blowing up a certain boss will lead to it being a boss in B burning vines in one area will prevent them from appearing in B a gas can be used to make enemies weaker but it will make an enemy in B poisonous and lots more. None of these design choices are in the remake.The remake's scenarios are dumbed down with B runs simply having a slightly different route through the first part of the Police Station and slightly different solutions to the same puzzles. The route through Leon A and B is about 90% the same as it is for Claire A and B and the only differences between Leon and Claire's routes are very minor (relating to Leon's interactions with Ada and Claire's with Sherry). Puzzles are the same across all scenarios and solutions in Claire A and Leon A are the same just as solutions in Claire B and Leon B are the same. The Tyrant (Mr. X) is now in both scenarios instead of just B and no longer drops anything so there's not much reason to fight him. A more consistent story may have been a worthy trade off for the developer simplifying things but all four scenarios share so much now they end up contradicting each other more than before especially around the third boss where things stop making sense.In a relyonhorror interview shortly before release RE2 remake producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi said ""We have a Leon campaign and a Claire campaign they re separate and you can choose which one you want to play first. We did simplify it a bit and make it more elegant by eliminating the A/B distinction and sort of meshing together what happens to the character s A and B scenarios into one story. I think players today they want these sort of deep/intense experiences with the story and by stretching it across 4 scenarios the story gets spread a little thin and create a sense of repetition by going through the game multiple times to see everything. So for that reason we went with two campaigns that still show all the events of each character s story rather than have it all split up.""It looks like they changed their minds and rushed the A/B runs in because now the remake has them and they're much more poorly thought out and lacking in replay value than the original.There's not much variety in any of the bosses and without spoiling anything you'll be pretty used to how they thrash about by the end of the first scenario. One boss from the original is relegated to one of those silly RE6 style sequences where you have to run towards the camera and avoid one hit game overs. Both scenarios have four bosses three of which the same and the B scenario gets a fifth boss (which in all fairness should not really be considered a boss). The bosses exclusive to Leon and Claire in the remake were not exclusive in the original.The remake changed Ada and Sherry's sections and tried to make some original contributions to the story but these are the worst sections of the game. They're very limited in gameplay they both have one screw up and it's game over sections and Ada has this out of place hacking gun that can turn anything on or off and redirect power wherever she wants. The unlockable 4th Survivor and Tofu modes are still in as brief simple time attack modes.The scene introducing the Tyrant is gone and now there's nothing to explain anything about it. The scene that explains the helicopter crash very early in the game is gone so now it crashes for no reason. Leon and Claire can no longer meet in the multiple locations in the R.P.D. nor can Leon happen across Sherry like in Leon B. Irons no longer explains anything to Claire and because he's written a bit differently his actions just seem more dumb. His motivation and pacing in the original better fit his character. A lot of details from files in the original are missing. There are some missing enemy types (Giant Spiders Super Lickers Giant Moth...). The Bow Gun is missing a signature weapon for Claire in RE2 and Code Veronica. Unlockable costumes are now paid DLC. Extreme Battle mode is gone an update added the boring Ghost Survivors mode which was touted as ""what if"" scenarios until just before it released but it turned out to just be more 4th Survivor with recycled character models. Individually these things don't seem much but all together and with the way the A/B scenarios are handled the remake starts to feel lacking.Cutscenes are very well directed. Some of the dialogue and files could have done with another pass. Voice acting is good but the music is ambient to a fault and it feels like most of the game is devoid of it.Performance is very good in my experience though there are a few minor graphical issues at some points they don't spoil the experience.My first playthrough was thorough and at the results screen my times were 4h40m as Claire and 3h10m as Leon though some players may take double that time. Repeat playthroughs don't pass the 2 hour mark (without cutscenes).It's not a perfect remake like the one the first RE got but it's nice to see the series return to its roots again. For those who don't mind the graphics and gameplay though the original offers the full experience and is absolutely still worth playing personally I recommend the SourceNext PC version of the original with the Classic REbirth patches over the remake.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-15,0,0,21,False,Recommended,This remake transported me right back into my childhood when I played the original RE2 with my friend both scared sh*tless taking turns after dying. Great re imagination of the original. Graphics gameplay and writing were tweaked and enhanced to be up to today's standards. Camera is behind character's shoulder now inventory is easy to navigate controls are more responsive and less clunky. Graphics are stunning especially lights and shadows.What remained is the creepy atmosphere and hardcore survival experience. Especially Hunks campaign is tough as hell and I still didn't manage to pull through it (last time I died right before the end).Game is highly replayable there are two campaigns for Leon and Claire (both in 1st and 2nd versions) Hunk's and Tofu's unlockable campaigns also Capcom just released 4 new in Ghost survivors DLC.Even though main campaigns share most of the locations and bossfights there are lots of differences to make it worthwhile finishing them both. Both main characters have their own weapons trough the whole game different puzzle solutions encounter enemies and find items in different places both meet different support characters and each campaign has it's own sidestory taking place in unique locations.For those who finish them all there are collectibles unlockable gear and hardcore difficulty.I didn't encounter any bugs and framerate issues.Amazing work Capcom!

2019-01-28,0,0,103,False,Not Recommended,"This game does a lot of things right it released in 100% WORKING BUG FREE CONDITION it offers fun rewarding game play and beautiful atmospheric visuals. but that SHOULD just be the norm. not the exception. Unfortunately this game just loses it's appeal after playing the first and second run once. all of its replay value is based around completing the game faster and faster and harder difficulties. it gets dull. the first play through is filled with mystery and suspense but after that you know the map and enemy layout forward and back top to bottom. In a game that gets its thrill from the unknown Capcom didn't do anything to keep each play through unique and different. by the 3rd play through you're basically running around with spidey sense because you know EXACTLY where everything is every item zombie licker and shadow is RIGHT where it was the previous 22 times you played. it becomes too easy too predictable and too dull.Not to mention Leon and Claire's story barely deviate from each other. they fight the exact same bosses in the exact same order in the exact same way save the final boss. as far as the narrative is concerned it blatantly contradicts itself. despite advertising two different sides of the same story you just get two watered down stories that DO NOT coexist in the same time line.It is a GREAT game don't get me wrong. but maybe along the lines of 7/10. all in all wait for a price drop maybe $40. it just doesn't offer enough game for $60. even the free DLC isnt enough to rekindle my once passionate interest in this game. its just more ""speed running"" garbage.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

I still remember the day he said ""Gotta go pee"" and simply left the pad in my 6 years old hands. I immediately pressed B (the button for inventory on the Dreamcast pad) and kept staring at the TV screen terrified the game would resume on its own and I'd be killed (my father used to barely save at all and still does).Flash forward too many years.I'm sitting here whishing things ended up differently for Resident Evill. Suddenly Capcom announces RE2 RE(make).I immediately came.And I must admit I thought they would ruin it.But now the game is here in my library and oh boy was I wrong.Oh boy did CAPCOM nail it. GRAPHICS I'll start by saying I don't really care about graphics in videogames and that's easy to guess since I loved and still love the older games of the series. BUT I must admit fighting zombies surely is better with graphics like these. Really this game is great. There's tons of effects models are extremely detailed and look beautiful. And guess what? It's not that much of a heavy game my PC isn't anything special (I'd say average to good) and still runs it at 60fps (I'm not running 200% but everything else is pretty damn high). SOUND EFFECTS Probably even better than the graphics. Both the classic and remake musics are absolutely beautiful (I decided to play with the classic). Sound effects like monsters moving around windows breaking and so on are great. I jumped on my chair more than once just because of the background effects. GAMEPLAY Scenarios A/B 4th Survivor with both Hunk and Tofu three difficulty levels* customization options for weapons ammo creation like in RE3** (feature that I absolutely loved back in the day) alternative costumes Precinct Keys are back many enemy spawnpoints left from the original incredibly smart AIs lots of strategy involved (will you kill that zombie or save ammo for later on?) interesting changes in how the story unfolds and the puzzles behave. Leon and Claire seem much more real now and their interactions are lovely.What else? Oh right. Unlockable bonus content such as 3D models and concept arts like in the old days.Want more? Capcom announced a FREE DLC with a new game mode and new costumes.* About difficulty levels I wish the ""Normal"" difficulty level also had limited Ink ribbons** About ammo making I wonder if creating the same type of ammo a certain amount of times will make for stronger ammo...Update on February 15th Update is out three new mini missions like Hunk/Tofu Survivor with their own Records and rewards.

2019-02-06,0,0,84,False,Recommended,RE2 was always my favorite game in the series and this remake doesn't just do justice to the original tale it actively improves upon it. Better writing realistic facial expression and voice acting amazing visuals and a dismemberment system that STAR WARS games should be taking notes on. Normally I'd scoff at the loss of my tank controls (as I'm a master of the old titles) but the shift in control and perspective is superfluous when you take into consideration that Capcom managed to preserve the atmosphere and tone of the adventure without the need for the sense of dread that the fixed camera angles of the original imposed. Whether you're a veteran of the original or just a civilian reading about the horror in Raccoon City for the first time you owe it to yourself to play this game and experience the nightmare first hand. It's a true masterpiece of the genre.The Ghost Survivors Free 10 Minute Speedrun Scenarios. Cool if you're into that sort of thing but I'm not someone who puts hours into 4th Survivor Mercenaries Raid Mode ect. Had they been atmospheric mini stories I would would have more of an opinion here but I can't say that I'm actually going to run these enough to beat them.

It follows the same beats as the original including the progression of more bizarre and terrifying monsters to fight with heavier weaponry or flee to safety either way you always feel unsettled.After the first playthrough the game completely changes as it no longer has the fear factor but now become an incredibly engaging obstacle course to master and get the highest ranking on the most difficult settings. Great ingame rewards are given such as concept art models and costumes as well as the 'treat yourself' infinite ammo weapons which is the dessert to a very satisfying horror action experience.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-16,0,0,1,False,Recommended,Holy crap this game is addictive fun and absolutely bone chilling. The whole game is hard even on the easiest difficulty.With zombies never really dead you will either waste your ammo or stock pile multiple zombies leading into a unavoidable death. Not to mention a literal unstoppable 11 foot tall giant beast that doesn't die no matter how many rounds you put in him. Classic scenes the option to choose the original sound effects and the gore is more than a step up than the classic game. Its a whole football field leap. This game is great for everyone who enjoys a little bit of spooky fun and zombie brain smashing. I recommend this game no doubts about it so buy it now.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-16,0,0,56,False,Recommended,"In Resident Evil 2 (2019) you play as Leon Kennedy a rookie cop on his first day on the job or as Claire Redfield Chris Redfield's sister searching for him finding yourself trapped within the Raccoon City Police Station infested and surrounded by zombies and other monstrosities on all sides you must find a way to escape.Resident Evil 2 (2019) is a remake of the original Resident Evil 2 released in 1998 on the Playstation. It is a great survival horror third person game with light puzzle solving gameplay.Pros Mix of action / puzzle gameplay makes you work your brain. Tons of surprises and some extremely memorable set pieces. Figuring out the most efficient way of getting from point A to point B has never been so exhilarating. Game remains fun on subsequent playthroughs by having many ""easy to learn but hard to master"" gameplay elements such as how to deal with each enemy/boss effectively. Gorgeous visuals.Cons .I've beaten the game around eight times and I've truly enjoyed each moment I've spent with the game. However if you only want to play through the game's ""unique"" content once then you'll most likely spend ten to sixteen hours with the game in total which is something to be considered due to the game's price.If you're a fan of the Resident Evil franchise or if you're looking for a great survival horror game then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil 2 (2019).",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-16,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Amazing... If all remakes were like this we'd probably never need any new games! I'm a LOOONG time fan of the Resi series and survival horror games in general. The original RE2 was a fantastic game at the time but compared to today's games it wouldn't have held up. But Capcom have managed to find that perfect balance between nostalgia and offering something new. Fantastic graphics. Amazing and smooth gameplay. True to the original. Moments that are genuinely hard and panic inducing (When Mr X is chasing you on Hardcore and it's been an hour since your last save). From start to finish this game has been a delight to play and I can't wait to play more of it. I had reservations about paying full price for this game for a number of reasons I already have LOADS of games to play / I've played the original RE2 literally dozens of times before / I'm sure it'll be reduced soon etc. etc. etc... As soon as I started to play though in those first 15 30 minutes I knew I had made the right decision and that this was worth every penny. Now I just need to hope that they carry on and revamp RE3!!

2019-01-25,0,0,48,False,Recommended,Honestly this game is epic it has amazing graphics and even though im progressively losing brain cells from the puzzles in the game im probably not that smart lol but the zombies in this game are relentless they never leave you alone (apart from the main hall and you suffer from anxiety the whole game because you're going to get hunted down by those zombies the pistol can help sometimes to kill them for good but you never know if they are actually dead so i got ambushed by a zombie and almost died (and i didn't even encounter mr x yet) and when you run out of ammo your only option is to run and sometimes that can get you killed so manage you're ammo correctly and don't just waste it all on a already dead zombie so i highly recommend this game for people that liked the original and for people that just want to get some sweet anxiety from being chased by a small herd of a million zombies through the entire game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

It is very true to the original besides a couple changes to clean up the story and a couple quality of life changes. As someone who has played dozens of survival horror games I still got scared from time to time cause of Mr X. Leon and Claire have received much better voice acting compared to the original while still keeping the one liners that made the dialog so cheesy and as a fan of the original 3 games I adore this. The graphics are insane and I was still able to get an amazing experience on a low end PC even on low settings i still got some of the best visuals I have ever seen in the series.Capcom. you have done it again!

2019-01-29,0,0,44,False,Recommended,As someone who's played the original game when it first came out I can say that Capcom has done a fantastic job remaking Resident Evil 2.PROS The graphics are beautiful. Gameplay is very immersive. The zombies are scary again. Sound design is spot on. The R.P.D. is really creepy to explore. The new voice actors have done a great job.CONS Scenario B feels like it was tacked on near the end of the game's development. There's almost no difference in terms of story. Some boss fights are a little gimmicky. Soundtrack is really generic and forgettable. Getting the original soundtrack DLC is a must. The story has some plot holes.Overall I'm glad we got this remake and I can't wait to see how they are gonna eventually remake Resident Evil 3!,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2014-12-17,19,381,404,False,Recommended,"UPDATE This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.When I first got my key I got really exicted To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.Starting off Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends Survival Wilderness and EndlessSurvival Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.Wilderness When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.Endless Ah my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a ""Jury Rigged Portal"" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy Life giving amulet Touch stone Jury rigged portal and Tale Tell heart) If you respawn from the ""Jury Rigged Portal or Tale Tell heart"" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).Characters Wilson Pros Grows a beardCons None.Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.Willow Pros Doesn't Take fire damageStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)Cons When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest firesCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.Wolfgang Pros Gets stronger on a full stomachHas more hpCons 1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomachMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomachLoses more sanity in Night / AfternoonAh Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players If you are playing as wolf gang only ""Power up"" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.Wendy Pros Has a ghost sisterDoesn't lose much sanity in darkCons Does .25% Less damage than all charactersLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail inWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.WX78 Pros Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled / Stale and take no penalty.Can be charged by lightningCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp 200 Hunger 300 Sanity) Also gears give health hunger and sanity back if eaten.Cons Takes Damage in the rainStarts with low stats (100 hp 100 hunger 100 Sanity)WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.Wickerbottom Pro Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked.Able to craft her own booksStarts off with 2 Papyrus.Cons Can't SleepTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale foodWickerbottom The walking science machine You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.EDIT YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY.

2015-05-26,0,0,35,True,Recommended,I find it to be a fun game that you can customize with mods and can share with friends and have fun playing together. The mods are amazing and really bring the game to life with different characters that interact with the game differently and many different benifits. Playing the game with out the mods in itself is fun as well though rather simplistic. This game reminds me of a mix of minecraft and a fairy tale book. The style is unique and fun and the different creatures and monsters are simply amazing and sometimes scary. All and all i think it's a great game to play and really passes the time. I've spent hours playing this game without even realizing it.,Don't Starve Together

Unlike other game the community is not toxic at all and I have seen many nice people willing to teach the newbie even though they are not friend. In conclusion this game is very fun to play and the creator update the game very often and they create many events for the community to enjoy so I recommend to get this game even you don't have friend because you will meet more people and become their friend once you play it.,Don't Starve Together

2017-08-11,0,0,37,False,Recommended,This game is great there's so much to do so many things to collect craft and explore. This game is (in my opinion) way better than playing alone and has an item collection system that you can sell over the steam market. The game DOES have a story but you do need to do a certain number of things to beat it (I don't know how). The game is best played with more than two people but really any number is fine. One last thing to add if you enjoy a spooky Tim Burton style game this is definitely for you. But if you prefer FPS games to hardcore indie survival games go buy PUBG or something instead.,Don't Starve Together

Wendy is my favorite character cause of Abigail )You can survive with any character but it's hard to me as WX 78.. the summer and the winter are affects him even if he is robot and to fix him you need gears. For me it's pretty hard to get gears maybe put more tumbleweeds instand of fighting with the clockworks. The style is very cool and cute.. the music is amazing but annoying after a period of time especially like the idea of the pets.I recommend adding mods like more options/more items/more characters but don't put everything you see.. cause it's more fun when its balanced But to enjoy the game you have to spend a lot of time so if you have a time and interest to play this game Go for itA very good game also abit disappointing because sometimes the base is destroyed because of something dumb and then you need to rollback or live with it......I don't recommend it for mad/rage people I,Don't Starve Together
2017-06-05,7,261,55,False,Recommended,Where do I start? This game is great if you like survival games. It's easy to get the hang of but it also has lots of challenging elements. Playing singleplayer is pretty challenging and I don't recommend that for people who are new to the franchise. The game after all is called Don't Starve TOGETHER. Multiplayer is great. If the host doesn't have a great connection it can be laggy. 98% of the time the game runs fine online. There are so many character mods and music mods in the workshop for this game that it never gets boring. What's even better is that when you buy the game you get a copy to give to a friend. Overall I think this is a great survival game and I definitely recommend Don't Starve Together.,Don't Starve Together
2014-12-29,8,176,225,True,Recommended,Don't Starve Together has been an amazing experience. But that is because I played the original game and have a good understanding of the basics and intermediate gameplay. For the uninitiated it can be a long dark perilous road to making it past the first winter. I however highly recommend buying this game and the single player version. With no in game tutorial and no real tooltips you find yourself googling and asking other players for advice on how to deal with daily life. Everything kills you especially your friends. The pace of the game may feel slow but soon the amount of resources to gather and refine become immense and turn this game into a fast pace race to gather the gear to survive the winter.In closing this game has an unforgiving learning curve which is only magnified by the masses of new players who have never tried the single player experience. Prepare to fail many times through your own mistakes and those of others.Have fun and don't burn the berry bushes.

2016-07-04,0,0,105,False,Recommended,Don't starve together. As a name suggest the main point of the game is simple you have to avoid of getting you (and your friends) starving .However there is much more challenges than the starve which are you have to keep your sanity (or you will be insane and stupidly fighting shadows which cannot be seen by your friends. Believe me it's stupid to see someone randomly hitting the air and running around to avoid shadows. keep yourself healthy stay out of darkness make yourself warm during winter make yourself dry during the rainy days and fighting random monsters coming to your wayIt is a good survival game with cute graphics and i fell in love the moment i first tried the game.Moreover it is quite easy to play it with friends! You can host your game for free and ask your friends to join or vice versa. Just make sure both of you have sufficient internet connection so all of you could play well and have fun.Or you could just join some dedicated server and meet some strangers out there! Believe me the community is nice and i had a good time playing with some strangers.So if you like survival game open world crafting would like to see how long can you survive in this cute wilderness of random stuffs that might come into you play this game!,Don't Starve Together

Another formerly a clever librarian hugs the fire for she knows as soon as she leaves its dim light she will freeze to death. The third member of our party using a modded character inspects his inventory. I look over my group and sigh. I know we can't go on like this. Our moral is low and our supplies are even lower. I decide that to try and boost their spirits. With a scary story. They enjoyed the idea of listening to a scary story. They all gathered around the campfire and I began to tell my tale. They look at me in terror. I laugh I am glad that I have distracted them from the Horrors of Don't Starve Together. Unfortunatly the didn't end there. We heard a BOOM. The Ground started to shake.""What was that?"" we all asked eachother. Another BOOM. The ground shook ferociously. BOOM BOOM BOOM. Finally we see the source of the noise. It is a horrid creature. It stood 5 men high with long spindly arms and a furry body. It's one eye glaring at us in contempt. That is when the dark hands started creeping towards our fire trying to take it out. There was about 90 seconds until morning. The Librarian will die if she goes out in the cold and the Strongman will probably follow. I don't have enough time to think. The Giant attacks crushing my friend using the Modded character. The Hands reach the fire. It goes out. I run as fast as I can ditching my friends. Leaving them for Dead. When dawn comes I watch the Strongman get impaled on the Deerclops' ice spikes. The Librarian sees me and tries to run towards me for help.

2017-11-10,0,0,51,False,Recommended,This game is Incredibly fun to play with friends. Its a game that is very difficult to survive. (Quite Difficult if Beginner). Yet its very easy to learn and pick up.Even if this game kinda repeats itself (If playing Surival) it just keeps getting fun by the minute.I havent really experienced all the gamemodes but i have played Survival ALOT and my max days is 28 getting there was so satisfying. And surviving Winter is truly difficult without a doubt.I can't really think about anything bad about the game. Some stuff i hate which isent really a bug or anything like that is you can get quite punished if you cut down trees as there might spawn a big Tree Guard which (Probably can't get killed).The only time I actually killed that Tree Guard was spending a whole day burning down Trees and kited the (Demi Boss) onto them so he started to go on fire but still even after i killed the boss it was quite impossible to survive the rest of the day.But the idea of the game is genius. The way the game looks is one of my favorite parts of this game.Even though i only played this game for a couple of hours and havent gotten to end game.I could undoubtedly say this game is my favorite game.Its easy for me to find a game i love but this game is above only ''loving'' this game.And i always bother my friends to play the game with me because of the sole reason of this game is outrageously amazing!My total rating might aswell be 10/10 but i think me giving it that would be stupid mainly because i havent even reached endgame or not even finishing a game but to be full out there only because i havent experienced the end game would make it a 8.5/10 but i think this game has a potential of 10/10 once ive experienced more of this truly fantastic game!Update I have been playing a bit of The Forge which is an event and ive not played a lot of it but I did spend around 3 hours on it non stop and all i can say is that its truly fantastic! Very fun as i said even though this game repeats itself its still fun. And that the game does kinda repeat itself on survival and in The Forge i personally think that that is the reason i love it but thats me personally.,Don't Starve Together

My friend and I have spent so much time trying our best to git gud at this game but it never ceases to surprise us with knew things and in the end always kill us because of our curiosity. All of the playable characters are so cute and have awesome designs. I don't own the original game but that is subject to change when the steam summer sale comes along. Klei have proven to me that they are amazing at what they do and this plus the other games they have created can definitely speak for themselves. If you are interested in playing I highly suggest you give it a try. Not only is it cheap BUT you even get to send an extra free copy to a friend!

My friend decided to buy me this game a couple weeks ago and I can say that I can barely stop playing it it is super enjoyable alone on a random server because I know I can talk to someone and if you get a small group together it becomes the most fun yet stressful game I have played. I also like being able to meet random people when just walking around and say hi just adds to the atmosphere. I would say 11/10 memes,Don't Starve Together
2017-10-29,0,0,281,False,Recommended,This game is so much fun for me to play. I have never been good at any shooter games so this game really spoke to me. It is pretty challenging but the more you play it the better you get. its a lot of fun getting your friends together and playing in a world. Its halarious and entertaining when you play with comedic people. But it can be serious if you actually want to get things done in the game. I recommend this 10/10. Its a different art style that i personally love. I hope anyone who gets this has a lot of fun on it,Don't Starve Together

2017-01-06,0,0,280,False,Recommended,This is a survival game where you try to last as long as you can without dying and dying you shall. You live off the land by picking up resources and food and using that to craft items or food to better help you. There are a few levels you need to watch such as your hunger sanity and health as well as making sure you are kept warm in winter dry in spring and cool in summer. There are also plenty of mobs to give you trouble as well. You have to prepare armor and weapons to try and fend off them or they will kill you.The one BIG CON for me is the lack of info. If you are new you will be able to understand how to craft basic items and gather but you really don't know what anything else does. You get a small description of an item but doesn't tell you everything on it. The same goes for everything else such as mobs and resources you just don't know what they all do. They do have a Wiki which you will most certainly be reading. There are a ton of mechanics in this game and the game itself doesn't explain them at all. You will have to dedicate some time to reading what things do because you will be lost without it. The good part about this game is there are a lot of mods to help make the game better and better help the player with info. Once you get used to what everything does the game is fun but very challenging. I've put in a lot of time in this game and I've finally been able to get through winter and onto spring. I still have a lot to learn and I realized that when Spring came and kicked my with all the rain. I now see new resources and mobs so I have to go back to the Wiki and find out what everything does or else i'll be doomed.Great game but wish they had better tooltips of what things do.,Don't Starve Together

It may be boring for You if you don't have friends to play with but community is nice so you should find some people to play with.It's like Don't starve (DS) with DLC Reign of giants (RG) but you can play with friends there are costumes (You get them from presents while playing on server) which you can buy and sell on community market. I will show you cons and pros to buy this game +Nice survival game+Low PC requirements+It's DS but with friends +Mods and costumes+Caves and free DLC (RG) Sometimes you can feel bugs Without gamepad it's hard to play it After some time it may be boring for some people.I recommend this game for lovers of survival multiplayer games and for people who just want to have fun with friends.,Don't Starve Together

2018-05-26,80,1712,509,False,Not Recommended,"So I've owned rust for maybe 3 years played on and off and for the most part enjoyed it.Don't get me wrong rust in itself is a good game. The BP systems isn't the greatest and can take a while to get what you need but it works. Harvesting building a base exploring and having the occasional firefight is also fun (talking about when i started 3 years ago)The game looks good runs well and have very frequent updates 3 years on. The one reason why I would not recommend this game is due to the community. It is by far the worst community i've had the misfortune of experiencing ALTHOUGH I have met a handful of decent players.When I started out 3 years ago it seemed quite different. Over time it has just gotten worse and worse and it really makes the whole experience frustrating and unenjoyable.You used to be able to mill about collect reasources build a base and get going without too much of an issue. The people you would come across would more often than not be friendly and leave you to your own devices. Of coure you would get the occasional hostile but it generally wasn't that bad.Unfortunately now it is a much different story. 99/100 people will kill you on sight even if it is within seconds of respawning... they will also often flame you out over the mic. I've heard every insult racial slur and homophobic insult many times every play session.The trend at the moment is to greet you tell you about how they are friendly wait for you to let your guard down and then kill you. Many players will scream about being friendly and then kill you straight after. For the record I am one of the few friendly players in the game but it gets very wearing after a while when everyone just wants to pretend to be friendly kill you and then insult you over the mic.Yes I expect to get killed raided etc in rust but dont expect it every 2 minutes. It's not fun. I cannot imagine how new players will even begin to get to grips with rust you simple do not have enough time from spawning to learn. I've seen quite a few get completely disheartened and quite on their first server.Rust is not a ""pure pvp csgo cod shooter"" yet so many players seem to treat it like it is.I like to play games to have fun and rust was... once upon a time. Just not anymore. There is no penalty for running around and being an anti social toxic idiot. This is a major flaw within a game like this. You can run around insulting trolling and greifing as much as you like along with forgetting how to interact with another humans in a normal way and nothing will ever happen. Rack up millions of kos kills nothing happens.Just because I play a game like rust doesn't mean I have lose all sense of decency when I interact with people. Yet 99% of players do and it is incredibly sad.There is a reason the community on rust is shrinking. It needs to be addressed as rust is a good game...without 99% of the other players.People who read this review can tell me to 'get gud' as much as the like or whatever insults you have stored up your sleeves but at the end of the day there comes a point where the toxicity becomes too much and it's just not fun... Welcome to Rust.It's a shame I cannot recommend rust as it is up there with being one of my favourites. The community has just sucked out the last bit of fun for me.Edit Im not against the idea of rust (included raiding fighting etc etc etc). Im solely talking about the players and how they interact with you. It's really killing the game.",Rust
2017-06-18,113,3050,434,True,Recommended,So before i begin with this review Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes so i won t discuss this here.Pros Great concept Stunning graphics Game mechanics are great The combat system is good The crafting system is very good Weekly updates! Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game! Good and serious developers who listen to the community Modding is easy and the community has almost full access to modding SkinsCons Not optimised for extreme potato users but that is not a main problem i.m.o The community can be cancerous at times but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you! Server creation is a little complicated but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it,Rust

2018-08-06,10,161,539,False,Recommended,Things to know about Rust ZERGS (aka big groups) can stomp all over you because of sheer number advantage and the rate they can progress through the wipe. Zergs are especially powerful after they implemented the group update where you can see your teammates blips which means you dont have to call for a jump check anymore.NOT NOOB FRIENDLY Very very very few people you meet will be friendly. Normally anyone you meet with any type of weapon will be hostile. You'll even see nakeds fight you with their rock when you spawn.PLAY WITH FRIENDS Can't emphasise this enough. Having atleast one other person to play with is all you need. There are a lot of responsibilities you have as a rust player and it will be twice as easy and twice as fast to do it with a duo partner.YOU WILL DIE You will die with all the loot in the world many many times. Even more so if you try to play solo. I don't want to say solo is impossible hJune shows us that (and lots of other rust youtubers) but for new players its a no go.TIME INVESTING The people who play the most have the best results. As in a person who plays 10 hours a day everyday for the entire wipe will get much further than someone who plays a couple hours a day. If you don't have lots of time on your hand to play I wouldn't play at all.TOXIC COMMUNITY With any game there is a fairly toxic community. Half the fights you win with a gun your opponent usually makes fun of you for how many shots you missed and how much gunpowder you wasted but I find this funny.HACKERS Mostly on offical servers so i suggest for you to play on community servers such as solo/duo/trio. Only problem is community servers die quicker than official servers.EXPERIENCE Once you learn the ropes it becomes a really fun game with intense moments and great fights.,Rust

2013-12-24,17,11267,13,True,Recommended,"After around an hour and a half of bad spawns scarce resources and short lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and upon the realization that neither of us were hostile we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot on sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course he comes around sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then to add even more of an insult he adds an apology at the end as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting half naked unprepared players. All in all though I do see a lot of potential in this game and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",Rust
2018-03-29,1,3,201,False,Not Recommended,The flaws in rust begin right off the bat upon purchase. Rust has this one big issue of having an unspoken requirement to play which is the need of friends. Playing solo will only give you a miserable time. Next is the fact that Rust may as well be the devil of games because it demands your soul to play as well. Notice how everyone who leaves reviews for rust has with in the hundreds of hours? well guess what this is do to the fact that players have to frequently revisit the game to pay the upkeep on their base ( or repair the walls for people who played before the modern edition.) as to not have their base crumble do to decay. Lets say though you have managed to get past all those things gotten some friends and are all about letting this game eat your soul. Well guess what? you now have to face the horrible toxic constantly salty mob that is rust's community. Everyone in game is kill on sight and will not hesitate to your day up. Then there is rust's crafting sytem. With this modern versions good luck getting any where because this game requires that you grind grind and grind to make even the basics and it only gets worse with each step up in the game. Lets say though you managed to get far enough to get a gun well congratulations you now can actually get to the fun part of rust which is its gun play. Although I suck at it I will admit rust's gun play is really good and one of the only moments where the player feels powerful... before fighting some one with a better gun. The issue with the pvp is that the player who dies looses HOURS of progress and hard work.To summarize the grind is the worst part about rust. It has to be done so often as to allow the player actually keep a base and yet is so slow and boring that it feels like a chore and the community is so toxic that any time you do loot you go though major risk of just being shot to pieces by some wondering people and then trash talked by them just because you didn't even see them coming.,Rust

2016-01-03,0,0,2209,True,Recommended,"Rust a game where the inconceivable happens. A game where many feelings of joy laughter anger and sadness set foot in your adventure in the lands of Rust. I have played Rust for over one thousand hours now and I believe it's time to make a proper review on my experience of the world of Rust.Rust is my favorite open world survival crafting building tree chopping simulator on the market currently. It is a game with enough to enjoy for a century. With the game updating every week with brand new guns supplies resources and much more it feels like the game never ends. If you don't know already the creators of Rust are the same people who made Garry's Mod. You know the famous Half Life 2 mod the basically everyone on steam owns? That means that this game is plenty funded and will not be in early access forever like some other games...Rust is a game where many thoughts go through your mind while playing.. ""Oh geared guys I'm screwed."" ""Where can I censor the that are flopping all over my face."" ""Damn Koreans."" Rust may have a very toxic community but the community is what runs the game. Think about it if Rust didn't have any players the game would be because there would be no PvP. The games only fun and enraging because there are toxic players. Early game Rust is consequential and very intimidating. I recommend (if you're in vanilla/community) grabbing a already raided base so you can start out using less resources. It's a good technique especially because raiders tend to see already raided bases to be unworthy of raiding. Mid Game Rust is where you make a lot of tough descions. ""Where should I make my new and improved base."" ""What design should it be?"" Base designing is really tough and that's why I recommend fortify or rumbled. These programs allow you to test your base design without the worry of losing resources. Remember don't use wood to make your base because it can be burned by a flamethrower. Don't use sheet metal because it can easily be destroyed by explosives and don't use armored because it's just damn too expensive. Stone is perfectly right in the middle. If you want a guide on which items do what damage here it is End Game Rust.. Oh.. Where do I start well end game is where you choose what bases to raid how to defend your base what guns to make and I guess if you're into this kind of stuff slaves. Slaves are very useful for many reasons. One reason is they farm resources for you for a small pay and housing. Usually big clans use slaves as a lower rank for new members that want to join the clan. This way big clans can see if they're trustworthy enough to join. The blueprint system was a much more effecient way of using slaves because you could just give them a blueprint after they do their work but that's old business.My rating on Rust would be a solid 10/10 for great vibes and solid effort by the development team.

You can make your home/weapons/stuff defense it or just kill other players for fun.+It is gross. Game is full of gore actually. You can hit other players with a Rock ! And it hurts so bad ! If there will be blood expansion i can not imagine how bloody and crayz the game will be.+Free to build anything. It depends on your imagination only thing you need to grab some material and build what you want.You can build a dic.k shaped building white house or two towers from LOTR. Depends on you.+Need to think a lot.When you build some houses/bases and someone else just get in and grab your stuff you need to find tactics. Maybe traps better materials high walls etc. You need to think how to defense your base.In other hand you should also make a tactic to raid other player's base/home. You need to learn how to break doors walls traps.+Not even trust your father in game.After you realized nobody is trustworthy in game(except the one sit next to you in real life or your school/job friend who you can beat the sh.t out next day) you start not trust anyone. After you sleep your home will be raided i guarantee it. So you should not share all information or house plan with random mates.+No pain no gain.You need to work hard to get blueprints(the plans of items in game) on Loot Zones. Which can be painful because most player do the same. So it will be painful but worth it.+No endgame.No house can be defended till the next wipe or a well organised player groups. So there is no endgame you need to startover and try to catch perfect location and stuff.And there are so much more to discover by yourself. Negatives No chance without a teamIf you are really want to be a strong you need to stay really far away from people(which is not really possible) or team up. If you are forever alone good luck. Unbalanced animalsEven you gear your best a little dog can kill you with 3 4 hit. So your character will die you need to run back all the way again and hope no one else steal your stuff. It is kinda boring for newbies. I do not wanna talk about bears. Not enough contentYes there are lots of content in game but when we compare with other games there can be much more gear and stuff. There can be much more raw materials. Not stable shooting chanceEven you got the best weapons and extensions you can not hit stable which can be boring times to times. At least when you crouch you should able to do stable shot.(or hold breath option will be cool)For know its 8/10 game and gives a lot fun.Edit Became Please leave it.,Rust

2016-10-29,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Unfortunately I had to refund the game since I do not like the whole forced random gender and skin color mechanic which is a shame since the game seems like a great game overall. I understand the developers wanted to simulate realism and how you have no control over it when your born but at the end of the day this is a game and having a random gender and skin color permanently chosen for me killed it for me especially in a game that encourages roleplay and I usually like to put myself in the situation as if I were actually in the world playing as myself. As a gameplay mechanic it doesn't add much either since it has zero impact on gameplay and is 100% cosmetic unlike other games that add gender locked classes which actually tie into the gameplay.Oh and also that system doesn't work well when you realize there are paid visual customization options.Seeing as how this is still an early access title and everything is subject to change I hope in the future they open up more and atleast let us choose once what we want our gender and skin color to be that way everyone is satisfied and that persistent identity attached to our Steam ID philosophy that they are going for is still there.,Rust
2015-09-09,3,40,304,True,Not Recommended,My FIrst Review on steam. Rust has many addictive features it nearly ticks all the box for gameplay fun interaction base building and a feeling of achievement when you work for something. The one and only issue which is a big one is the serious amount of hacking and cheating that goes on during gameplay not only should someone be band for hacking but there Ip Address aswell. Aim Boting flying Teleporting Opening your coded doors without knowing the codes Glitching through barred up windows and walking through your base... These problems are endless and is not being taken care of quickly and properly enough You can spend days and hours building your base for it to be taken by hackers which nearly beats the purpose and the time you've put into the game to begin with. If you get raided by non hackers then no problem thats part of the game and part of what makes Rust good not knowing if you got raided while your offline by non cheaters. All in all I have uninstalled the game with no intention of playing again until the hacking has completely stopped and I think the game is going to lose alot of Players that won't return back because the interest has been destroyed by the degenerate people that feel the need to cheat in a GAME.... Great game Great concept Slowly but surely being ruined. For now I would not recommend this game for the sole reason of hackers your wasting your own time putting effort into something that you can't do anything about to defend.,Rust
2015-10-03,3,31,234,True,Not Recommended,If you enjoy running around a huge map spending countless hours collecting and crafting only to never get anywhere further than you are when you very first spawn into the game then this is for you. This game is about pvp. Sneaking around and trying to win unfair fights against other players. The game itself is simply too laggy for the fight mechanics to function properly. It is very glitchy. If you ever do get anywhere and establish a base filled with supplies than the server will simplly be wiped and you will have to start over. Do yourself a favor and wait until this game is out of alpha before tinkering with it.,Rust

But I'm a girl amd I have been waiting for the longest time for them to make girl characters and when they finally do i can't be a damn girl???? Im an ugly white guy!

2015-05-14,1,13,3,True,Not Recommended,I'm really disappointed with the direction this game has taken and aside from that the lack of responsibility on the servers( in more simple words the amount of hackers) Perhaps there might be something in the future but at this point it's chicken scratch compared to many other survival games. (Basically this at the moment is hunger games done so poorly I would refer to Minecraft on how to make a good hunger game mod),Rust
2014-01-12,0,0,196,True,Recommended,Pros Easy to collect resources easy to get guns and equipment not a lot of people kill on sight IF YOU ARE UNARMED.Cons A LOT OF HACKERS RUIN THE FUN For me 3/10 times I get killed is by a hacker.If you are armed you will get attacked by a lot of people.If you are trying to find your friends it will take you like 15 20 minutes to find them since there is no in game map no compass no way to tell where you are unless you are by a permanent building.You die if you are offline and not in your house when you log out your character falls asleep. His body appears on the ground sleeping.Tips and tricks in rust First thing you should do in a server is get a lot of wood like 200. Build a shelter and put a door (automatically locks when you close it) in your shelter put a sleeping bag workshop furnace and campfire.Furnace will need some stones which are those rocks you can hatchet at that is how you collect them.Once you do that try to make a hatchet.Next kill some hogs (TRY TO GET AWAY FROM WILD ANIMALS UNLESS YOU HAVE A PLATFORM TO BLOCK YOU FROM THEM) to get some food which you can cook in the campfire and some cloth which makes a sleeping bag and clothes. Cook the food next.Start killing some zombies you will need clothes to reduce radiation. Once you kill the zombies collect the blueprints and use them IMMEDIATELY. Blueprints help you create items. Collect the research kits from the zombies which can be used with the workshop to learn how to make an item by dragging it over the item.Once you get a pickaxe and a research kit from a zombie go to your workshop to use your research kit on it so you can learn how to make it.Try to be friendly to unarmed people unless they attack you. Share your food and help nice people out. Don't trust any armed person unless you know them.,Rust
2016-12-06,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,Don't let the high player count fool you this game is nothing short of a polished turd.The developer blows Doesn't acknowledge community feedback Hasn't fixed longstanding issues Like a petulent child he has cried out that this is his game and it will be how HE wants it to be and if you don't like it too bad He introduced microtransactions and hasn't fixed the ing bears? lmao cool story bro He developed a leveling system noone asked for I mean seriously the list goes on it's unreal how terrible this game has become rolls downhill quick my grandpa always said and two years ago I remember being so excited about this games progress. The game looks good and runs well for (If I had to guess) I'd say 1 in 5 players. the rest of us can off apparently. I bought this game for my friend a loong time ago he spent hours trying to adjust settings search for programs that would boost his performance and eventually just settled with playing the game sad all the time then never launched it again which for the most part has become what happened to most of the decent players.Now the game is loaded with and people who kill you on sight just because they can. It's one of the most toxic communities outside of the MOBA genre I've ever seen and you should not make the mistake of supporting these people. I don't understand the feesibility of appeasing a small fraction of tryhard losers who ruin the Rust experience for the majority of the playerbase. It's perplexing and any developers who consider working with this team who feel an actual sense of obligation to their customers should stay far away from these money hungry people. RUST was one of my favorite games the ORIGINAL Rust not this abomination. That game fell to ruin and has been replaced by an experience that doesn't live up to the Legacy.. I can't recommend it let alone even get it to run anymore if I wanted to they have their eyes set now on scamming console users with the same project and do nothing for the PC community. Don't support them this is not a survival game and they should be forced to change the tagging to PVP and drop the survival tag because that's what this game is and what it will always be purely PVP there is nothing survival about it. I can rest easy though knowing this game will permanently be a blotch on the Devs record and most assuredly will keep people from working with him because he doesn't want to make fun games he wants to make money money money money money money money money.,Rust

I've got 100+ hours on this game and this is what I have to say.Pros Making new friends (Still don't trust anyone.) Good Community (community likes to share ideas) Still have lots of more to add (more in store for the game) Doesn't feel too repettetive (Something new everytime) Graphics are amazing Listens to Community (sometimes but mostly yes) ing Garry ( I love you.)Cons Latest nerfs have been for solo players (nerf pipe and crossbow) Very clan sided (currently) Requires a beast to run well (still lags a bit with a 1060) It is repettetive in some ways (grinding with the new xp system) Crazy load times (can be annoying) Graphic options and Settings are quite confusingIf your overall feeling of this game is good but one little thing makes you upset you should remember that this game isn't perfect by all means. It's still in alpha and it has more to fix and more to come so you should always reconsider what you think about this game. If you really do have an issue then just press F7 in game and send the devs a message yourself. They need feedback in order to make changes that people want so before you start ranting about one little thing focus on the positives.9/10 would be mauled by a bear again.,Rust

2019-01-07,1,4,1036,False,Not Recommended,This game was one of my favorite games ever. Now that they added the BP's/Workbenches I now really hate the game. It now takes 10 times longer to get good gear. Another thing is that once they added upkeep to the TC it became difficult to keepup with bigger bases. You have to be on almost everyday to keepup with your base which can be impossible if you got a job. You don't see many huge bases anymore which I thought was great about the game. Yes clans suck but at least it was a very fun experience before all of this. Now as for the updates for recoil. I really disagree with this. Its now way harder to learn the AK. Never use the gun anymore. The gunes in this game just have changed to much and the game gets to boring to fast. The constant farming and trying to get scrap for everything can be annoying. The keycards and puzzles are good for more challenge but it just makes it way harder to get good stuff. I just missed the old times when barrels spawned everywhere. Not on just the roads. The NPC's are just dumb. I really wish they never added them to the road. Hope I got my point across.,Rust

2015-06-27,4,24,354,True,Not Recommended,I brought this game years ago when it first came out and I was full of hope and elation when I saw the word survival. I played it constantly and have until just this weekend. The devs used to listen to what we had to say and those that brought it and played is every day loved the game. The basic of just having ot eat to get through the day sneaking up on animals for the kill and creaming over finding a blueprint for a weapon that took quite a while to craft. But as the years progress the devs no longer listen and just want to pander to CS players they close the comments on the update blog they push for an update they say will only cause server wipes once a month but then push through several updates over the weekend every weekend causing those that host or pay for a server to be constantly updating every 2 minutes. They have lost the way and I am quite happily disgusted in this game. If you want a survival game with automated mounted machine guns on your fortress a large range of guns and a spear and bow to top it go for it. But I'm out! * Drops mic and walks out of the game*,Rust

This has changed the game to a point where unless you dont have a life you wont stand a chance in not getting first day after wipe. Before this update you could actually put thought and design into your base now your only hope is to make your base as wide and tall as possible.

2015-07-27,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,My experience with actually getting the game to work can be found below. Now that I've actually played the game I can give a better review of it.So after a long long time I finally did manage to get the game running and honestly it wasn't quite worth the fight. The thing about these kinds of games is that once you reach the top there isn't much else to do. The battle just to get established can very well put people off and it's mostly a resource gathering grinding trek. There is no true way of getting to the top without some miracle. Most servers already have their top dogs their trolls their raiders etc. The best spots are usually taken and if they aren't they're not for a good reason.The sad thing about this game is that the potential is there. I can see it but its just out of reach.I can't see this game as a worthy investment of time because everything you build can be so easily destroyed in a matter of minutes if the server population demands it. If grinding resources to build something is up your alley then this game is fine. But as it stands I can't in good conscience spend anymore time in this game because the only ending is ultimately disappointment.________________________THE ADVENTURES OF TRYING TO GET THE GAME TO WORK!My experience with this game involves everything except actually playing. While my time in this game technically is 71 or so minutes the amount of time actually in game and not in a bloody loading screen amounts to about less than a minute.First off my install somehow broke and so I had to install it again. That Anti Cheat software that came with it also failed to install when it popped up the first time and so I had to find that and make sure it installed. I had to go into the files and set the executables to Admin mode. I then set the graphics settings to Fastest and waited. When the game began playing (HA!) I had to set its priority to high in Task Manager. After ALL OF THAT I had to sit through intensively long loading screens. Most of the time the game would crash on the loading screen for both the main menu and when connecting to the servers and loading the map. But finally FINALLY entered the game twice and witnessed the glory that is Rust! For a solid 10 seconds of slideshow rate frames and freezing before I was kicked from the server (I tried several). I tried another and it just couldn't be bothered to go into the loading screen before kicking me back to the main menu.I have fought with this game for every minute I have played it and it absolutely refuses to run for me so I cannot recommend this game based on that fact. I am lucky twice over in that I can get a refund and that this game was a gift from a friend who thankfully can get his money back. The only redeeming quality from this fruitless endevour is that the main menu music tickled my fancy.,Rust

2013-12-13,0,0,207,True,Recommended,This game is actually amazing especially considering it is in alpha stages right now. Admittedly it is very difficult to get started what with all of the naked men chasing after you trying to beat your head in with a rock and all. But overall this game is great quick tip for anyone that is trying to start the game first prioity is to get cloth to make a sleeping bag so you have a spawning location to get cloth you have to kill animals. As of now animals and ore are extremely scarce so dont make a house until you find a spawning place for animals and ore. Once you find a good location make a house in a hidden place because when you log off your house is still in the server and people are running around griefing and blowing up peoples houses. OVERALL this game is amazing it is a mix of Day Z Minecraft and Stalker. Once again this game is in alpha stages and will have many more options once the game comes out. Also quick awesome fact for all you valve fans out there this game is made by the creator of garry's mod.,Rust
2015-01-12,0,0,566,True,Recommended,"Okay look. Garry and his team have made a really good game here I have spent many hours playing for over a year on and off. With the new rust game updates the new game is a massive improvement over the old one however there are still major bugs that need to be improved. I know its an alpha and it is to be expected but the bugs aren't constant and they are on and off and new bugs seem to be appearing every day. These bugs just dont seem to be small but allow newer people to the server to recieve loot from houses and buildings by breaking walls where the designers have purposefully built to be close to indestructible. This game is often refferenced against DayZ from which I agree but instead of finding loot you have to make it and build houses in a ""Minecraft"" styled way with a lot more physics going into building and crafting. It is possibe to enjoy yourself in this game but only for limited hours before your ""almost indestructible house"" is destroyed and everything is lost having to start all over again. It is impossibe to feel safe in this game even once logged off in a safe place you are almost garanteed to log back on the ""YOU ARE DEAD"" screen and having lost everything. The way the game is designed makes it feel that this is how the game should be but there should be an element of saftey in your own home once logged off. Servers now are just full of half decayed and looted houses with almost everyone being a fresh spawn. Although this is mostly bad the few good points definatly outweigh the bad and this game can be enjoyed but you are likley to become irritated with the game much faster than you hope. With a few friends I would highly recodmend this game and try to get a good few nights playing before you lose everything... but them few nights of playing are so much fun you would be glad you bought the game. Hope this helped people make their decision on buying this game.",Rust
2015-01-13,0,0,127,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a well conceived survival game but like so many early access games it's just in the droll phase of step by step development. Here's to hoping that the game's new engine will help propel it into a finished state but I'd give it a rating of like 60% in terms of possibly ever being done given that it's in the early access state of limbo. I'd definitely recommend waiting until completion on this one.,Rust
2014-05-04,0,0,20,True,Recommended,We've just played this with my youtube buddy and here is the resulting video http //youtu.be/wdrddFEH3kcFor the textual review Rust is undone expect that take that in mind and do not buy it if you do not agree with it. It has a great potential but the development will probably take a lot of time to the future. I can see Rust being a really great survival game in a year so far it really need a lot of attention and a lot of passion from the developers.I do not regret buying it since we had fun even though it was randomly filled up with boredom and anger. I'd say don't buy this game if you don't like pvp because you will die because of other players being better equipped a lot. There are graphical glitches and bugs that's completely normal for an Early Access game. Don't let that strike you down because it will eventually get fixed. Otherwise I like the direction this game is going so far (dev blog) and I will definitely play it again probably with my buddy Dayton again since in the end we enjoyed it. There is a lot of servers and a lot of them have plugins which enhance the game we have yet to find a server with a map plugin or a teleportation commands since finding your friend might take hours! Get this game if you like the video above because it's a summary of the fun you can have and probably not all of it since we didn't get far in terms of crafting and stuff. I guess we leave that for the next video. (y) Recommended 7/10 (Rating may change in future thanks to development),Rust

2014-01-23,0,0,147,True,Recommended,"Sooooo. How do I explain Rust.... Here's about a story for you.I play for like 2 days. I get m4's bp's and get a good group of friends. Alright? No biggie right sounds good? Well it doesnt end there. My friends go offline I dont see 'em for like 2 days. So I ee this guy running on the street by my house right? I say "" Hey stop! Come over here "" he pulls a gun and says ""where?"" I said come closer I didnt wanna get killed by some guy decked out in full Kevlar. Anways... My plan was to talk to him build a base for him be nice and hey have a new friend! SO MUCH FOR THAT! He shoots me in the face and I kill him with my last 3 M4 bullets. I said ""Hey man! come back. I think my mic was muted I wasnt looking for enemies!"" He calls his friends and they all raid me my town with all offline friends and I respawn at my bag right? WELL THEY REPLACED MY DOORS and I am now stuck in a box. I am a naked caveman stuck in a box. I have to dance for them and all this BS. Moral of the story you ask? DONT TRY TO BE FRIENDLY. You will end up as their form of entertainment to flop around your pixely Now THAT is what I call Rust. Have fun guys!",Rust
2014-01-22,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,"I've been in game long enough to hear people say it's a human bastardly simulator and it's just that.If you came to this game looking for a fun and simple survival experience a way to relax while progressing your way up the tech trees and building a place to call home.. then you are in the wrong place.This is a survival game it's going to be difficult.This is a game with tech trees you retain your knowledge of blueprints you find and can build new weapons or buildings.This is a game where survival is important if you want to keep all of your stuff.This is a game where working with others... is optional.Where i'm getting with this is that by all means this is a survival game in it's mechanics however the playerbase makes it something different.I want to ask the readers of my review if they have ever played Garry's Mod have you? If you have then you would know that in many servers without death protection there is trolling beyond belief spawn killing spawn trapping and in general just people being douches.""But Svarr not every server in Rust is like that not everyone is a "" Yes this is true there are some servers that disable player VS player combat and those generally tend to be a little friendlier in terms of death count.. However there is a mechanic in Rust so that your buildings you place CANNOT BE REMOVED EASILY IF AT ALL AND CAN BE PLACED MOSTLY ANYWHERE EVEN NEAR OTHER PEOPLE'S BUILDINGS yes you can even place a wall in front of a door to block people from getting in or out thus ruining everything they have done for those long and difficult hours they have been playing. That's all it takes.If you play this game you have a very high chance of wasting your time doing so yes wasted why would i use that word? Because everything you have done in game is gone the moment someone decides to troll you and that happens often. The only thing kept is your blueprints you have learned that's it.*So let's describe how a regular game of PVP Rust before the PVE Rust experience.*PVP Start You spawn in world and see a bunch of crudely built shacks from the starter blueprint this server has a mod to give you starter items so you type in /starter and recieve a stone axe basic shelter camp fire and stove. Good start so far to get things rolling!Some few minutes later while you are gathering wood a player comes by and shoots you in the back of the head for a one hit kill oh dear you just died and they had nothing to gain from it you were pretty much nude and helpless in the starting area. Oh well at least you can start again and try to go out a bit more right? They did loot your body but you can just get that again.You spawn in again and run out a bit it's dark out and you can hardly see anything but this allows you to get away without being seen all you have is a rock (gathering tool somehow) and a torch. This time you are near the ocean in the cliffs you see many more abandoned homes that are falling apart constantly some of the walls falling down from decay.. You figure you'll be safer among old rotting huts that have already been ransacked many times over at least for now.You try using the /starter command again in order to get a head start but to no avail it appears it can only be used once only 40 minutes and you are stuck with only a rock and torch if you use your torch you'll meet a most certain death as player killers will see it for miles and come to you with a shotgun and a full suit of Kevlar armor so instead you try to get wood in the dark you gather enough wood for a door which you put on one of the huts you found without a door so you would not have to make your own hut you feel safer now as you have your own room small as it may be. You find yourself getting hungry and need to find food you have not seen any animals nearby slow enough to catch deer are too quick to catch on foot bears will murder you without a gun wolves will make you bleed to death from their bites and pigs are your only resource left so your only choice is to try and find a pig in the morning you notice your hunger bar also has a cold status you could start a campfire but then players would find and kill you you decide to freeze for tonight and figure you might have to get used to it.Morning is coming along and you figure you should hunt while the sun is rising so you are still slightly under cover of darkness at least to just scout it out first. You cannot build a bedroll to respawn in your hut without cloth and to get cloth you kill ... pigs for some reason as any other animal. You try to use your /starter command again but cannot yet. You are starting to starve and must get food quickly. Quietly edging around cliff sides in a meadow you try to spot players to avoid or food to catch you spot no animals you spread out for a while and still find nothing and fear that if you go out any further you'll lose sight of your home so you keep trying to roam nearby. You could easily get sniped from here with scoped weapons so you decide to hurry it up and risk it by running.You keep roaming around for a while unable to find food nearby you die of hunger before you can find any yes just like that.You re do everything you done before and this time you could use /starter again you decide to hoof it as fast as possible to avoid dying like before put up your hut build a door from some wood real quick and this time you made sure to find a place with food this time.You feel set! You have food properly this time nearby some resources of stone and wood you feel like a king once you collect enough stuff! You start to get better at sneaking around and gathering under the radar you got your friend on to the server and he's helping you out at your home you find out how to build after messing up the first time you have yourself a warm home to call yours two stories high and the day endling irl. You decide to go to bed and log out your character in the server while inside your virtual bedroom. Things are going well and you plan to play again after your real life responsibility of work or school or being with friends.The next day when you log on to the server you are surprised and disappointed when you find your doors blown off their hinges by explosives or destroyed by pickaxes! You've only been gone one day you think how could this have happened? Do i really need to stay in game ALL the time to keep anything i've built or done? My character is even dead and looted the same for my friend... Why would this happen to me? Damn it.If you decide to continue you may get a little bit luckier but meet the same end the next day if not you quit and go to another server and have the same thing happen once more if you join a server that does not allow player vs player combat then read the next segment.PVP story end. PVE Start You log on to a PVE server and convince your friend to join you there instead he was convinced to keep trying on the last one but joined you anyway that's good things move faster with friends.You start building and the community seems okay so far here some random religion or politics discussion going on internet things as normal. Having built up your house with your friend everything seems fine no threats no problems. You read online that if you leave the server without using anything in your house like a door or fireplace then your place will start to decay so you plan with your friend to get on every day at night and make this your regular game. As you both log out and sleep irl some guy places a wall in front of your only door out and ruins it all you quit the game out of fusteration and never come back. The end.PVE story end. Do i recommend this game? No it's a horrible game with your work being ruined every turn of the corner.Unless you like that avoid it. D",Rust

2013-12-11,0,0,1155,True,Recommended,"Unlike some other early access titles on Steam (ahem Starforge) Rust has FREQUENT updates that work &amp generally aren't game breaking with active devs (see devblogs on playrust.com)It's got many great features and is a game you don't get bored of you've still always got to be careful although those first one or two nights in game will be a little more difficult.It's very much worth the price and I'm very confident that this will continue to recieve updates as even the over 7 years old game ""Garry's Mod"" (also one of my favourite games) is still updated by Facepunch Studios still going with a huge community. Rust just recently beat the all time peak population of its game which is very impressive considering it first debuted on Steam around 2 years ago.The grind in Rust isn't so bad as some say even for solo (and if you still hate it you can play increased gather rate servers). You can get a nice stone base in like 1 2 hours. Combat is hectic and fun and when there are things at stake it's way more adrenaline pumping. The game is really fair runs quite well and isn't overly complicated like some other survival games. It's easy to learn but can be hard to master. I can say without a doubt as a huge survival game fan that Rust is the best survival game that I have ever played. It's seriously good and it's worth $20 for hundreds of hours of fun.",Rust

2016-03-26,1,5,286,True,Recommended,Personally I believe this is a great game and has a lot of potential. Both the graphics and gameplay is very well done and is incredibly fun to play with friends both the crafting system and layout of the map is unique making it a fun experience for gamers whom enjoy Survival based games. The building element in the game has its pro's and con's as sometimes both roofing and foundations randomly disappear when being placed. However the variations of buildings to be made does make it quite fun for those whom like to build. The AI however in this game is poorly made hostile animals tend to glitch through objects and buildings to get to you including attack helicopters which may spawn very close to you but I think can be fixed in future updates. As the game is in Early Access I believe it is an impressive game and worth buying for those who enjoy Survival / Crafting games.,Rust
2017-11-24,1,1,4595,True,Recommended,Best survival game I've played so far. Dev are enthusiastically doing amazing work. For what i should say this game is quite time consuming if you cant stay in game for LONG hours you should be aware as this game is quite addictive. I would like to point out that its easy to get rage when you keep dying. But its a great game. Peace,Rust
2017-03-09,0,0,4994,True,Recommended,This game used to be something amazing and completely one of a kind. Sadly the only part that still holds true is that it is one of a kind. The devs have taken this game from something where the more time you played the more experience and knowledge you gained therefore you had an advantage. They are now at the point where any random person can just pick up the game and be just as good as any other player within a week. The game has lost all purpose and is pathetic. Almost 4000 hours in this game and it has been turned into a waste of time thanks facepunch.Edit They've made some good changes in the last few updates that have really turned the game around. It's still mainly focused on how big your group is but there is now more of a chance for smaller groups to suceed. If Rust continues to keep making these positive changes the game will become great again.,Rust

Then this is the game for YOU! Rust is definatley not something you want your kids playing. Not gorey but there is nudity everywhere and you cant control another players mouth so strong language may vary. If you are thinking about getting this game I'll have you know that it is very fun only when played in groups. IF you play alone you will get crapped on and not enjoy yourself. A huge part of this game is making friends and enemies so choose your enemies wisley get a decent group of friends and survive. This game isnt survival per say its more of a survive players or PVP based. Yes there is PVE but mostly just PVP. People will kill you regardless if you're naked or if you have loads of gear. If you don't like that you're in the wrong isle for games. Gameplay is a solid 8/10 very repetetive no animations. Graphics 7/10 Not insane but very good nice. Optimization 5/10 depending on your computer and your settings you might find this game with framerate issues just reduce your settings and you should be fine.

2017-09-13,0,0,162,True,Recommended,Rust was fun. I will probably continue to play it on and off for a long time until another game like it comes out and it is better. Building a base looting the various locations of the map defending your base expanding your base and attacking other people's bases are some of the most enjoyable things to do in this game. It is even more fun to play with friends. Rust will occupy you for time to come and it is constantly being improved. Still though it should have left early access by now. They have some bugs and issues they have to fix. Some of these include bad optimization glitchy game mechanics. Come on guys you've had nearly four years four! This game is so great I just wish the creators would try to take more risks with their updates and take this game out of early access. Overall I really like this game.,Rust
2016-11-27,0,0,1346,False,Not Recommended,"""Early Access... Oh boy... here we go."" This was the thought reverberating in the back of my mind when I first saw this game recommended to me on steam roughly 4 years ago. I thought to myself ""Whats the worst that could happen?"" as I pressed that glorious green button and added it it my library. From there I was hooked. The game at the time was what is now refered to as ""Legacy"" (Rest in Peace Legacy Rust gone but never forgotten) Rust. What is clunky? Yes. Where graphics that great? Not really. Did it have quite a few bugs and problems? Hell yes it did. The thing is that clunky feeling is what gave the game its charm. Not to mention the amazing community that made Legacy what it was. Now before I explain why I can't really reccomend this game let me tell you a short story that might help you understand why I feel rust has lost it's charm.""Roughly 3 years ago I ended up getting on my computer one friday afternoon to play rust. The weekend was here and I was ready to waste it away playing rust before monday comes to ruin all fun things. I ended up finding this medium population server (Note Medium population for this time was around 25 40 players) that had wiped not but 2 hours ago. I hit the connect button spawned in and got to work. I managed to gather quite a notable amount of resources before I saw this fairly large 2 story wood base with 3 people outside of it. From the distance I could hear them talking quite casually. I took it upon myself to walk up to them slowly and ask them if they were friendly. They said yes and we talked and made out peace. Moments later I asked them if I could join their group. They accepted me in and I started my grind. I talked with them quite a bit earned their trust and became quite good friends. I'll refer to these three as Ian Hostess and Xe5. After becomming friends they let me in on the fact they were going to build a giant metal base in the center of Next valley and name it Next Towers (Even though there is only 1 but w/e I guess). At this point we already had a wooden base of around 3 stories. I began my grind killing zombies hoping for metal building items. A few hours later me and the 3 other had gathered all of the items needed. We took enough to start a 1x1 with 2 doors and started the build. The end build was to be 3x3 at around 5 stories. As the metal base grew so did our group. Before long we had 12 people in our group on a 50 population server. As you would think a 5 story base would be quite a target on a server like this so we expanded.... vertically. You'll be amazed how many materials 12 people can gather when they set their mind to it. Before we knew it the base had reached 12 stories with a 1x1 2 story wooden gated airlock around it. To say that this base was a complete monster was an understatement. Now here is the thing for those who aren't familiar with Legacy. Foundations Ceilings and Pillars could not be C4ed. Only walls doors and doorways. Each floor had around 4 5 doors and it took 2 3 C4 for metal walls and 2 for doors. To say this base was unstoppable was quite the understatement. Because of this we made quite a few alliances. Other groups of 1 2 built their bases around around in Next valley. One of which is a moderately famous youtuber known as ""Holdacious"" who was part of our alliance. Yes im being serious. He went by another name at the time but I managed to catch up with him and have a chat about it reminiscing on the good times but I digress. We formed quite a few friendships and had a few hardships with these people who I still remember to this day. To top it off we weren't even a zerging clan. We helped new players get starting causing a massive boon in the population. Unfortunately we were removed from this server for having too much of a power chokehold. I managed to keep some of these friends I made to this very day and I still talk to them on a mostly regular basis. Not only that one of my closest friends to this day is one that I met during my time playing legacy.""Now thats enough of legacy. Lets talking about ""Experimental"" or ""New"" rust. Oh boy.. where the hell do I begin. In the stage of ""Experimental"" the game was in a hell of a rough state. Much smoothing and refining later and the game reached what I would deem a playable state. From this point on I started to realize that rust was slowly but surely losing the charm that It once had. Players slowly became much more hostile and toxic. This is REALLY prevalent in 2018 where most of the players you encounter are 13 year olds spouting racial slurs. As you can imagine these people are super agressive. Instead of pairing up and becoming a power together these people would rather kill another naked with their rock so they have a 2nd rock and torch. ""But... but... its a survival game! You should expect that!"" and this is true but it doesn't mean its entirely healthy for the community. Another part of this toxicity is the sudden appearance of players with TREMENDOUS god complexes. Imagine starting out on a server. You've got a 3x3 base with 1 story and its made of wood. You have an airlock for doorcampers and all the essentials you need. At this point you'll be pretty full of morale thinking ""Yeah! This is going great so far!"" until clan of 3 with flamethrowers torches your base down spending more in resources than what they're gaining to despawn your items only for the sake of ""being bored"". I consider legacy to be extremely new player friendly. The current version of rust I do not. If I were a new player and a group of 3 torched my base I thought I worked so hard on I would be quite demoralized. Probably to a point where I would refund the game if I could and never play it again. To sum it up the community is no longer welcoming to new players. People constantly act as if having interesting interactions with other players is just out of the question. To give the game credit where it's due I did have a few nice times playing this branch of rust. Except for the XP system but we don't speak of the XP system around here. There were times when I became somewhat major powers on servers but friendships where as temporary as the servers. You simply move on and make new ""friends"". The times I really enjoyed this rust is usually with friends that I knew before rust or those said older legacy friends. Also the quality of the game is very high. Bugs are usually fixed within days of them being found and game breaking ones usually overnight. The game feels smooth and definitely not clunky.It really hurts me deeply to see this happen to game I once held so high even going as far as to say that it was the ""Pinnacle of Survival games"". But as I've said Rust lost it charm years ago.",Rust
2014-02-17,0,0,278,True,Recommended,If you are reading this to buy the game then you get two games. You can sort of play the old verson of this game which is the reason I used to enjoy this game so much. Legacy verson if filled with bugs and hackers not to mention the community is very small. They have stopped improving Legacy Rust due to problems in codeing and its a shame. The new Rust is still being improved but I dont care for it over Legacy Rust. I liked this game and I have played my hours worth. If you are new to this game perhaps you would enjoy it. Its definetly a unique take on a survival environment.

2018-05-13,0,0,208,False,Recommended,Great game. I would recommend watching creator content before you play this will prepare youfor the wackiness and annoyingness of the game. You will always will come across A holes who will RDM you as soon as you spawn naked that is not a fault of the game that is a fault of the sometimes toxic community.Trying to survive of an officail server is hard even the low pop servers. try out community servers with tags such as noob friendly low pop ect... The game is heavy on four things PvP Farming Raiding and Basebuilding(this less heavy than others).PvP As a noob learning how the weapon system of any game works is hard try out bow train servers on the modded section. It will throw you straight into action and will give you an oppotuniy to fight with bows and crossbows (let's be honest if you can use as bow you aren't ready for guns yet).Farming Don't get too greedy go back and forth from your base and depot. If you find better tools research them before before you go out and possibly lose them.Raiding If you get far enough into a wipe to raid other players be ready you are gonna attract attention. Counter raiders are a thing Duh! If you don't want to use big boom booms eco raid Pickaxe/Spear/ a decaying base key lock raid of you have enough time eoka raid a wooden door.Base building Don't try and build a huge base asap. build a simple starter base such as a 2x1 or 1x1 if you feel more confidnet then expand learn how to honeycomb and wall / door stack (again look for creator content). There are many basebuild tutorials onlin they can be good just make sure it is usiing the most current base building system no bunker bases sorry. Try out the game please dont listen to what I say.

2017-08-01,0,0,146,True,Not Recommended,"To put it plainly this really isn't as good as a game as it's hyped up to be.I'm not going to say I'm one of the more dedicated fans of this game nor will I claim that I followed the game before this year. I'm one of the people who have spent time and effort into this game hell I don't even have more than 100 hours put in and tha time was alloted just because I simply server hopped and idled a lot. But I can clearly see what many of the much more dug in players are saying without a doubt.For starters the dumbed down gunplay is 5 times worse than any other game I've ever played. Most of the time during gunplay I geniunely wouldn't even be aiming at the person rather I would be aiming in their general direction but I would still end up killing them. Aiming itself is more or less just so you can find some sort of satisfaction with shooting. Bullets will just eventually go in random directions regardless of how long you spray down or tap. I could be aiming at a still target never moving my mouse an inch and begin to fire off the B.A.R (Bolt Action Rifle) in small intrevals and still somehow see the bullets take different paths every 2 shots.Next is the game progress when I first began playing I was amazed to see that I was able to go from naked to already owning assault rifles and having a full sheet metal base playing solo. I assumed this was due to the fact I was on a lowly populated server and simply was being smiled upon by a higher power. But as I server hopped between multiple vanilla servers and went on playing I saw that as long as the groups I join up with weren't raided or killed in the midst of farming and building that I would end up near end game status within 1 2 hours minimum. This seems like a long time but I assure you that is not the case as I've heard from much more experienced players it used to take longer. Once you hit that end game status you honestly have three choices spend your time helping/recruiting others to work with you begin raiding others solely for some sort of entertainment or kill off random people. Another thing on raiding is that it's extremely easy to raid most people even without explosives and they don't even have to be online in order for you to do so. Hence why you see the term ""offline raiding"" come up a lot as it is seen as a problem in the community and tends to get you hazed for doing it. While I'm on the the playerbase and its state this game's community is beyond toxic. Even servers that say ""Don't be toxic"" simply mean don't sit there and spam in chat or go off looking for arguments (which still happens every second). People justify killing freshspawns every chance they get with the ""It's a survival game and therefore you're idiotic for getting mad about it"". I won't deny this is a survival game and sometimes the fittest will have to excert their strength in order to stay on top but simply killing off people you can clearly tell don't have anything or you see spawn is just shooing off any new players who wish to get involved in the game or seriously ticking off anyone trying to start up. Not to mention you'll get griefers who block off your doors and make it impossible to leave your base people who seem to devote their time making monkey sounds into their mics whenever they down you or vice versa or you'll come across people who's sole joy in life is to roof camp and make it impossible for anyone who gets close to pass by. To put it simply this game's community is nowhere near welcoming to new players and you can easily see that reflected in the way the playerbase conducts itself all over steam.My last pet peeve is the fact of how in the game's current state it's way too simple. After roughly 10 hours of playing and looking up some basic tutorials on YouTube people would become surprised when I told them I had less than 100 hours in the game. This by itself is what can make the game very easy to pick up but this also means that by the time you really get a feel for the game you end up with not a whole lot to learn. Building is tedious combat is a joke and surviving is really just eating food every once and awhile and making resources to keep furnaces and lanterns lit. And the events that do pose a threat get really boring and annoying after awhile just because of the fact that unless you're working with a large clan or a high populated server you can benefit off of taking down the helicopter once or twice and catching one or two air drops. Obvious it's in early access which means the game will still make progress but at the same time it's also been in early access for almost 4 years now. Of course this doesn't actually have any affect on how the game currently is but is just an observation as they can easily just drop it at any point or can just simply ignore making true progress and additions. That's what a few recent survival games have gone through. To wrap this up simply the game is fun for a short period of time but you'll quickly grow tired of it. The learning curve is just way too simple despite what others are saying. The game can be fun if you know how to make it. For example I've joined servers that award players with five times the amount of resources than you'd normally get and there are already modded gamemodes and edited rules and setups for others like having no guns available your body doesn't appear as sleeping when you log off so you can't be looted or you start off with guns and materials. Those servers are what can make this game a whole lot more intresting as they can put emphasis on certain aspects of the game that most people don't even focus on. But if you play solely of vanilla servers you can still enjoy it somewhat as people will create whole towns and shops create local cultures and traditions and even will make bounty hunter groups dedicated to only killing known bandits. Of course sadly this isn't the case on most servers as you'll just get prepubescent children who technically have no business playing the game in the first place calling you the n word killing you over and over and covering their base in Swastikas and male appendages until they get raided and quit playing forever.If the current state of the game changes then so will be my opinion as time can change anything but at the moment I honestly see it as just another overhyped underdeveloped survival game to hit the market and for all we know could just fade away with the next year or so when something new comes out.",Rust

Once you accept that being killed by others is just part of the experience it makes for a very rewarding playtime. Nothing is more satisfying than killing a player with higher levelled loot or raiding someones base. Gunfights are tense as hell and starting in a new server with no equipment at all is an adrenaline fueled experience.The people you meet in game are either going to be your friends or your absolute enemies.,Rust

2017-03-22,0,0,228,True,Not Recommended,"The game is actually quite fun and put together fairly well. You can gather resources easily enough and you get PVP (player versus play ) PVE (player versus environment) mods. But it isn't all joy and happiness.Pro's Very short learning curve. You gain resources fairly easily and can build with blueprints. This can also be where the community comes in to play as you build from wood or metal.Nice specials such as holo sighs for the gun versus the iron sights they come with. Silencers are nice laser pointers etc.There are by default loot crate drops in the world whch can give you items you can't get any other way and in some cases you'll be lucky enough to get a signal beacon to call in another airdrop. Forewarning they CAN land on top of things or fall under the ground so you CAN lose them. o.OCon's Worst in my eyes is sleeping and your body laying there with people able to come in and take whatever they wnt and then kill yoiu.Also a heavy amount of cheating going on. Auto aimers that shoot through walls trees and even rocks. Invulnerability and other simple things like that come in removing all the fun.If you like Rust and want something diffrent (single player for the time being as it's one man developing it alone) is called ""Subsistence"". Beautiful graphics hunters (NPC enemies) will hunt you down for some in game sport they can break into your base so it's a good idea to build up while you can also build into theirs It also now supports bows and arrows so you aren't reliant on your starter weapon/pison. You can also better customize just bout everything. Furniture rounded corners plant beds for anywhere a chicken coop to raise them or rabbits etc. Give it a shot if you get tired of this one being overrun by cheaters as I did. Paladeus",Rust

2018-10-15,0,0,778,False,Recommended,Rust is a pretty amazing game. I've logged a TON of hours and have made tons of fond memories playing it but feel like some honest expectations need to be set for those interested in giving this a try. Unless you can play with a group or dedicate a lot of time to the game you're going to have a bad time. There is a ton of potential for adventure here and due to the unscripted survival nature of the game every single encounter will be unique.

This game looks and feels great.. gameplay and community wise another story.Devs have been slow to fix issues with some major issues with the game such as animal collision and they've pretty much just become a running joke anymore. You will have ninja bears and wolves clip through your base and kill you and the devs will laugh at you because they're too busy making adding cosmetics to the game so your pickaxe can look like a banana.Its funny because the game's setting is set kind of in a post apocalyptic/post nuclear war setting and the actual real life community couldn't be more toxic. In my opinion the Rust community is one of the most toxic and cancerous communities of players of any game I have ever played. But some people REALLY really like that about it. They enjoy being as vile and hateful and as spiteful as possible to strangers so there's that?The style of gameplay ""Crush/Destroy/Demoralize your opponents into not playing anymore so you can dominate the server"" attracts the worst kind of people so there you go. I have only ever met decent not so assholish players on RP servers where it is enforced.If you actually like to put time into games and aren't a casual player then prepare to rage at any sort of progress. You can spend days building towards something only to have to taken in minutes/hours. Clans pretty much completely dominate this game and like another reviewer said it is still rife with hackers. Almost every major server you go on will have kids recoil scripting aimbot ESP and other various hacks.While I have played with many friends and been in lots of clans I still do enjoy playing solo. However They've tried so hard to make this game appealing to single players but it will always be (because of the structure of the game) heavily biased towards groups. There is just no way around it no system they could implement that wouldn't be exploited.Bottomline If you have a group of friends and love crushing other people to the point of complete demoralization then this game is for you. If you are a solo/casual player who actually has to do with your life and can't sink 40+ hours a week into this you're wasting your time and you will probably only get VERY limited satisfaction from this game. Servers typically reset every two weeks causing you to lose all progress/building so like I said don't plan on progress unless you have lots and lots and lots of time to sink into this game and at least a friend or two.Cash me on a low pop building in the ocean.

It was a unique name. A unique name for a unique game. Thats what rust is. A unique game.I don't see rust as a game really rather a platform. A hobby. There are no objectives there are no storylines there are no emotional attachments to characters. Yet still this game has had more emotional devotion from me than games who's entire purpose is to create emotion like Telltale's Walking Dead or The Last of Us.You see Rust creates memories. Sure you might have got that epic 360 noscope on Black ops all that time ago but rust is something different. I remember being part of a 20 man Zerg ruining people's wipes. Yet I also remember solo farming for 6 hours to be destroyed by a clan of 10. However not all player interaction is bad. I have made friends in Rust (DashTypo and Cyrus) who have become friends in real life. If this game wasn't made I wouldn't have some of my best friends. I have created villages bases that are more secure than Fort Knox yet I have created sh!tshacks that could be destroyed by soft siding.I remember my first time playing rust. In night I was huddled in a small twig 1x1. I thought the wolves howling sound effect (That happens when the sun starts to set.) was a pack of wolves coming in close. I remember hiding in my 1x1 with my torch on for 5 minutes before someone with a Thompson simply blasted the twig out of existance and killed me. I quit and didn't play till a few weeks later.See while the loading tips help a bit rust still has a newbie learning curve. If you're looking to buy rust go on reddit.com/r/playrustlfg and ask a few people to help you till you hit 20 50 hours you should have learned the ropes by then. Rust is what you make it. If you want to solo expect things to be harder. If you want to zerg expect things to be easy but expect you to be hated. But if you are like me and are just out to have fun with the resources given to you by Rust then this game is absolutely for you.,Rust

If you don't like grinding ayway for hours to build a base only to have someone come and wait outside your door for 6 hours to kill you for and steal all of your stuff you're gonna have a bad time.If you don't like being hunted down by a bear that can scale a 50ft mountain in 2 seconds and run at 45mph whilst eating your feet and glitching through the map you're gonna have a bad time.If you don't like an army of bald men and women geared with AK47's bolt action Rifles armor and rocket launchers chasing you down as you frantically try to hit them with a rock you're gonna have a bad time.Both vanilla and modded two very different experiences will provide hours of joy if you're into the whole sandbox survival type of game however I do recommend you either play with friends and don't take anything too seriously or prepare yourself to get triggered frequently as this game can be very unforgiving.Facepunch are very active and listen to the community.

2014-03-24,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"This game is hard to understand. The community is just awful. Whenever I asked questions the only responses I got were "" ing n00b. Go read the wiki."" ""Did you watch the video?"" ""Dude just...just stop playing if you can't figure this out."" Totally awful I say.Upon logging into a server for the first time I was greeted with a vast array of crudely built structures some even in the middle of the road. I was hoping for an open world map experience so that I could possibly find a place that had not been severly mauled by previous players but I could find none. After wandering for 30 minutes I finally found a location that had not been with random wooden plank walls and began gathering resources needed to build a structure of my own. I scarcely got a one room cabin up (with no door) before nightfall. I began to freeze and had no resources to build a firepit. I died that night.Upon joined a different server I found that the spawn area was much more friendly and began gathering resources as quickly as I could. This time I got a house with a firepit and began searching for food. I found something that looked like a pig and ran off chasing it to kill it. Someone else appeared out of nowhere and killed it for me and began harvesting all the food. I was severly hungry and began to lose health. Then that player pulled out a bow and arrow and shot me until I died.This game is way too hostile to new players. It is not intuitive enough to learn what to do. Only established players have any sort of chance of surviving once a server fills up.It would be nice if this game had a single player option but until then I'm sorry I bought it and I want my money back.",Rust

2017-11-23,1,1,93,True,Not Recommended,I would recommend the game if it didn't have such game breaking elements such as twig tier buildables (lowest tier and literally just sticks and twigs) being able to bypass the security that the Cupboard provides as well as other types of exterior defenses such as stone walls and turrets (assuming a raid tower was made which covers you from turret's line of sight). I don't understand how such a big change like that could allow this game to stay afloat and plummet to rock bottom. Because of that I wonder how the reviews are still positive and even as high as 80%. Can you imagine losing a weeks grinding worth of loot only because you couldn't fend off players while you were offline? Sure thats what turrets are for but twig has made exterior placements of those to be useless hasn't it? At least you can use them effectively indoors...Its very well known how toxic the community is but that's kind of irrelevant in the makings of the game although because of them its becoming a lot like CS GO rather than survival esque gunplay like with The Forest for example. So always expect people to be either good or travelling in groups. So to increase your chances of survival you'll also likely need friends in order not to get KOS'ed and looted completely after possibly hours of grind.So if you're looking for a survival game you're looking at the wrong game get The Forest or 7 Days to Die although they are significantly smaller scale in multiplayer. Max amount of players may be 20 for 7 Days to Die and 8 12 players or so for The Forest in multiplayer. Although if you want a CS GO like somewhat survival game and lots of grind then this is for you. I've been checking back on things every few months and I have not been impressed despite the new things that have been added because they never fixed the issues players take with the twig update and some others like recoil or even.Ultimately from what I've seen the veterans of the game have stopped the only ones who insist to play are fanboys who refuse to boycott this game for its poor choice of changes to the game and the CS GO/KOS kids that make up the toxic community. This studio isn't going to heart the interests of those who want a survival game they want to get these kids that make up the toxic community to use their vast amount of free time to dedicate towards this game while others who work or study haven't got the hours to play this game solo and reliably stand strong and unfazed against raiders and clans especially.Do also take into account that this game has poor optimization although has had some slight improvements and also the game still has problems that cause memory leaks and ruin the way the game runs. I won't recommend any products of this studio until they change their ways and stop off those of the survival community the ones that they originally intended to sell their products to and made for them to enjoy as a survival game.I hope this review will urge you from giving this studio your money and you spend your money on more reputable games made by better studios who are actually invested in their respective communities and make their game better through its updates which they determine with your feedback. I personally would insist you pick up The Forest as it is a nice Early Access title which has very decent visuals and survival aspects are spot on. Although if you don't have a beefy computer maybe try 7 Days to Die as I believe it doesn't require as much as The Forest does.I'll just end this review here and move on with other things.

It is very well optimized for a early acces title the devs are active and an update is released once a week. Also it is not lacking of threads that make a true survival experience from wolves and bears to attack helicopter and of course other players that may or not be friendly and you will have to gather resources to build a secure base and weapons. There are some cons though the game is based on a unlock item to craft system and devs are yet not sure how to make things balanced for group and solo players so big groups are pretty much gods of the server. And the game is really time consuming if you want to compete with groups that play all day (no lifers as devs call them).8/10,Rust

2017-11-30,0,0,345,True,Recommended,The game has consistently been good since I started playing it long ago back in early 2016. Still in early access but now finally approaching the end of that era it seems. This is one of the best survival games I have played although it definitely focuses more on the PvP and base building aspect rather than survival against the elements. Players are quite often very toxic but if you actually try to interact with some you will find a few diamonds in the rough. Don't play this game expecting anyone to be friendly or helpful. Make sure you read/watch a guide before jumping in or you will be taken advantage of. I wish the grind was a bit less than it currently is but there are modded servers for that. Overall 8/10 game for me.,Rust
2018-01-04,0,0,1483,True,Recommended,I didn't think I would like this game as much as I do but once I started playing I was hooked. Note that this is a review from somebody that hasn't followed the game since it first came out so I'm giving you an unbiased review of the game as it currently stands. I play a few days a week with 1 2 other friends or sometimes just by myself. I mostly play for the building/base design aspect as well as the looting and crafting system.*The Good* Once you know what you're doing this game is a lot of fun and pretty rewarding. Progress in the game actually feels like accomplishment due to the difficulty and learning to build a good house/base is essential. I see this game being fun for a long time if you don't get too serious about it and upset if you die or get raided. There is a lot to learn in this game and it definitely doesn't hold your hand. There are a ton of objects to craft and the current system forces you to actually dismantle objects in order to learn how to make more of them. It gives a sense of progression since you are constantly looking for new stuff to dismantle and learn which also makes exploration 100% necessary to get anywhere in this game. The building system works really well and is fun and intuitive to use. The bases are actually quite tough and require multiple explosives to take down walls and doors. Great game to play with friends requires a lot of communication and trust. It's extremely satisfying to build a great base with a friend and accomplish stuff. Your buildings use resources over time so it forces you to log in and check on things and top off the depleting materials. The current state of the game seems pretty stable and I think the major issues are over with. There's still some fine tuning being done but I feel like this game is almost out of Alpha. It's very playable despite other reviews. It's not perfect but it honestly feels like a pretty complete game as of right now. I hope they continue to add items to craft and places to visit on the map. Lots of fun little things in the game to do such as building your own store using vending machines painting your own signs etc. I spent a ton of time making my own custom signs to put outside of my base and I always end up laughing at some of the hilarious stuff that people put on their own signs.*The Bad* You have no control over your character customization. I am stuck with a frumpy ugly woman as a character and I can't change it. It's horrifying when she's naked. Please please please let me customize my character a bit even if it's just to choose gender and a preset character design. They wipe the servers every couple of weeks and you lose everything. The reason for this is to keep it fair because if they didn't you would have mega bases full of players that roamed the map killing everyone and abandoned houses and bases all over the place. However it makes this game difficult if you don't make the most of your time between wipes. I highly recommend playing this game with a friend so that you can do more in that amount of time. Playing this game alone can be very challenging almost to the point of discouraging at times. My first week in this game was by myself and I got to the point where it was very difficult to progress to building weapons due to immediately being killed by larger groups of players while I was trying to get materials. Also my small base was raided pretty quickly and I was completely locked out which meant many hours of work was completely lost. The game can get really grindy especially when you need so much scrap metal to learn weapons. I understand that the game has gone through several major changes with how you make weapons and items and I enjoy this system. However this gives a major advantage to groups of players vs single or duos. Due to a heavy focus on PVP and raiding other player bases everybody has boring and ugly houses that are purely meant to make it more difficult on raiders. While I don't mind the raiding I think it should be more difficult to break into a player base than it currently is or limit the amount of explosives that one player can carry on their person. It's difficult to have a farm or any kind of outside stuff without it immediately being destroyed by other players just for fun. I'd really like to be able to have safe zone areas where you don't have to worry about people destroying your bases.Overall I really enjoy Rust. I don't think it's perfect but it's a refreshing mix of building/base design survival and PVP. Grab a couple of friends and figure the game out together and make some friends in game.,Rust

2017-02-11,0,0,1564,True,Recommended,My all time personal favourite game by far! I bought the game over 2 years ago now and at first I didnt play it much as it was rather confusing to me and a bit of a steep learning curve. So I didnt play it for a good 6 months until I started watching a Youtuber called Phaedo 82 ... His raid cams and update videos gave me a whole new purspective on the game and from there Rust grew on me. Ever since I have played hundreds of servers and met hundreds of people which has been great! A few months ago I decided to help out the community by designing skins for the game I do it for fun and am fueled by all the support I have recieved doing so one of my workshop items has over 13 000 up votes thats insane! If you would like to see my workshop click HERE ... Overall Rust is a very fun game which is changing all the time due to the WEEKLY UPDATES playrust.com from the amazing development team at Facepunch.

2017-10-14,0,0,697,True,Recommended,This game is not everyone and it takes tenacity to play any survival game. If you do not like grinding then you won't like this game so it makes no sense to leave a dislike on the game since you just don't like this category of game simple as that. I for one love this game and every painful loss that I have experienced. You will lose everything more than once. Its the struggle against the odds of you thriving until the next day comes that makes you keep going. People complain about being solo but you can make friends really quick (even though the community is toxic theres some really great people on here) I have gone from making the mistake on my first day ever making a fortress out of wood being solo to having 60+ friends across multiple servers and being pretty good at base building/defending. Even though I have a lot of friends I don't go for zergs because for me the best experience on rust is having 2 3 friends starting off wipe day meeting up and then overcoming the struggle of gathering resources and setting up home. This is one of those games where each milestone in base building PVP friendly truces etc feels so rewarding being your first go or your 100th. You will gain everything and you will lose it all.But it is so worth it.,Rust

They add new stuff they don't optimize anything (I have the same FPS for the last 2 years I can play GTA V at 4KxDSR with everything maxed out 80 100 fps Rust at 1080p 40 90 FPS) and they ruin the old stuff... HOW? Instead of improving the anticheat engine and eliminate all ""flying"" cheaters they allowed everybody to build twig structures on enemy bases so now they can climb their base ingorirng the cupboard. Utterly The new cave system they added is glitched on purpose. Devs glitched it to make it look ""deadlier"".Wolves can go trough rocks glitch inside ur house if you build next to a rock run with 10000 KM/H swim to the bottom of the ocean and kill you from there if you are above them. They added some nice things too but utterly useless. Like the table ... why would you need a table if you cant put things on it because they will despawn? Or the chair why would you craft a chair if you can't sit on it ? I've taken a break of 3 4 months from Rust I've just came back to it played it for 1 day and uninstalled it from my PC and my Laptop. Won't play this piece of garbage ever again not until they fix their mistakes. This explains why the player count dropped from 60k to 30k...Definetly wouldn't ever start over again. 5/10",Rust

2016-10-14,0,0,211,True,Recommended,This was my first open world sandbox of this kind but I'm definitely hooked. Like so many MMO's the game's biggest drawback is its reliance on endless grinding to advance your status on the server and maintain it until the next 'wipe' (when all players and their posessions are reset to zero). The game lends itself to collaboration with friends which cuts down the time you both have to spend gathering resources and xp and improves your odds in a fight. Construction and crafting systems are still under development but they play smoothly enough and offer different possibilities if you're willing to put in the hours it takes to explore and gather needed items. To its credit the game's environments are attractive enough to make even slower moments a rather enjoyable experience. Unfortunately when and for how long you're able to play will definitely be a factor in your experience highly populated servers with stronger players will be inhospitable to newbies so you have to catch a server right after the wipe or else find one with fewer players. Maybe devs will offer stronger built in incentives for cooperation in the final release but right now it tends to be a game of survival moreso against other players than against the environment.,Rust

As you accomplish these goals which range from simple score targets to more difficult skateboard trickery of the ""how the heck am I supposed to get all the way up there"" variety more levels are opened up. The game isn't exactly the most accurate simulation of skateboarding in the world as it has some pretty outrageous physics and lets you get away with things that make Rust much lauded 900 degree spin look commonplace by comparison. As the series has progressed it has gotten more and more combo friendly conceivably allowing you to continually do one string of tricks around the entire level lasting the entire length of your two minute run.You can combine grinds and other street style tricks by manualing (in essence popping a wheelie on your board) just as you touched ground.

2017-09-22,0,0,4409,True,Recommended,Rust is a complex game and if power is your goal a pretty challenging game.If you want to dominate your server you better make some friends and your friends better be good players.If you want to dominate gun fights you better practice and pick your fights smartly.If you want to laugh trolling people can be hilarious you can use external audio programs to blast music or use music that fits a particular narrative. Playing songs to troll salty players or mess with clans is pretty fun. There are voice changers that make you sound like a 5 year old and other stuff to mess with.The options are really dependent upon you.What sets this game apart from others is the fact that your hard work is always on the line which creates stress especially during fights. Most players know it as the 'Rust shakes'. I have never played another game with such intense fights which can be extremely rewarding or depressing. How you can manage those emotions depends upon your outlook of the game. You can ghost around being sneaky afraid cautious and careful or you can run full speed through an open field. You will lose your stuff in this game so if your not having fun getting that stuff in the first place then you probably wont find the game appealing overall. I can guarantee that you will have much more fun playing with friends in small groups (max 5) ((larger groups are frustrating due to communication)). It is completely possible to solo this game however I recommend sticking to solo/duo/trio servers. The more time you have put into this game the better you will become especially if you come from a fps background. Find good players to play with and learn from them and you will find yourself stealing AK's with revolvers and pipe shotguns. On Grinding You can grind hard in this game if you wish. You will have to grind to raid bases if you have at least 4 friends who share in the grind its not bad at all but the huge zerg groups obviously will have a monopoly on resources vs the smaller (and usually more talented) small groups. OR You can grind just enough to get a gun some gear and some meds and then farm (kill) other players basically farm players. Typically it takes me about 20 minutes to grind out some initial weapons (python wood armour face mask meds...). It takes time to get skilled at this game and you never really stop getting better with practice. BUT you dont HAVE to have 1000+ hrs to be good at pvp some people are just naturals and some just get lucky.Love Rust have wasted WAY too much of my life on it but it is unlike any other game I have ever played. I have had and continue to have some pretty great times on it and have made some pretty good friends.PS. Yes there are cheaters in this game but typically are a rarity. If you want to avoid them stay away from Official servers and when you encounter them switch to different servers until they are banned. Facepunch is pretty responsive to actual cheating and the last cheater I reported was banned in 5 hours. Try not to get attached to your gear its just data and don't hate on your friends when you lose. This game can bring the best and worst out in people.,Rust

Do you like to grind for resources like trees stone and metal to build a base for protection while logging off for the night and to come back with the chance of it not being there anymore? This is Rust2. Do you like to be attacked and have to fight for your life almost 100% of the time when you see another player? This is Rust3. Can you deal with monthly wipes (some being weekly on private servers) and starting over from scratch? This is Rust4.

2017-03-11,0,0,460,True,Recommended,A great early access game with very few bugs. One thing that I have notice in my 200+hrs of playing rust is that there are 3 kinds of bears in rust. The first kind of bear is the Ninja Bear. Which is one of those bears that sneak up on you from a bush or etc. and rek you. The second kind of bear is the Noclip Bear. Now the Noclip Bear is that bear that runs up and down and through rocks and hills. Finally the Stuck Bear is that bear that you find stuck in a foundation and is an easy kill for some fat leather and bones.Specs CPU i7 6700GPU GTX 1060 MSI Oc v1 6GBRam 32GB DDR4 2133mhzStorage SanDisk 128GB SSDBenchmark FPS MAX 101FPS MIN 28FPS AVG 70 101Pros well optimized fun little bugsCons bears toxic people clans,Rust

2018-01-08,0,0,421,True,Recommended,Before reading this I highly suggest you have a great PC or the game will give you an extremely hard time. I have a Titan V and a core I9 extreme and the game still gives me troubles. Frame rates drop below 20 on some servers sometimes. In my first week of rust I learned one very important thing never give up. You will get raided all the time but giving up is truly the end of you. The game itself is basically a hardcore version of Minecraft. You spawn in gather resources and build a basic base. As you keep playing you can start gathering gun components blueprints and loot Radtowns. You can solo rust if you want to but teaming up with players and friends is highly suggested because it greatly increases the experience and teaming up often gives you more chance of survival. Just don't join one those racist and hateful clans. And try not to be one of those 12 year old kids who are unprofessional and try to threaten u when u kill them. No one likes toxic players. PvP in rust requires a lot of skills. You cant just engage an enemy with an AK and spray them. Chances are you are never going to land a hit. I recommend you guys play on a Battlefield server to practice your skills with all kinds of guns. After a while of practice you are ready for some real Rust PvP. Personally when I play PvP I like to track down players and then surprise kill them. Also NEVER stay still in rust especially when you're looting chests. You can still press WSAD when looting so feel free. That's all I have to say. Overall this is a great game except that the fact it is not really that optimized when it comes to graphics. Here are some ratings Community 4/10 (toxic with some nice players)Gameplay 10/10 (fun but hard to master)Control 10/10 (easy)Optimization 6/10 (I don't even know why there's a Mac version.)Difficulty 7/10 (close to dark souls when u try to solo official server but it gets easier as u play)Graphics 10/10 (when u play on maxed settings 1/10 when u play on potato)Audience Anyone who is mature enough to play.

2017-09-15,0,0,480,True,Recommended,This is by far the best survival game there is the key to surviving? Trust no one not even your self. You may have picked up a friend at the beach but it's only a race to who makes the first weapon. You will build a house and within minutes you'll most likely lose the house but with each loss comes a new house with advancements to ensure your enemies won't make it inside. Building a house isn't just a place to get comfy it's a maze for your enemies. This is not a game for making friends although when you do make friends you'll have a blast. This game updates what feels like weekly biweekly although I can't agree with some of the changes it's better than no changes at all. If you're a soft whose looking to play a survival game to make friends go back to your roblox or minecraft. This is RUST there is only one goal to SURVIVE11/10,Rust

2014-08-13,0,0,40,True,Recommended,REALLY FUN GAME! It is a very realistic game once they took out the zombies. Super fun building and lots of cool crafting items. They is laggy for bad computers because it has so much detail. As long as you have a 8 GB of RAM you will be fine. You can't trust anyone in Rust. As long as you have a handmade cannon or something someone will always have better weapons. You still have a chance to kill them. If you will buy this game and you are new to 1st person survival games then I wound play on N00B friendly servers. Unless you want to take the heat. Also there is Experimental MODE! I don't like it because you spawn with tons of stuff which is kind of cheating. I know Experimental MODE will get better. Remember RUST is in it's Alpha so you can judge it but it will get better. I think it is very detailed for an Alpha and I recommend this game to you and your friends!,Rust
2016-08-22,0,0,106,True,Not Recommended,In short do not try to play this game if you intend to Solo or go in with a small group. This is not a survival game this is a PvP battleground in disguise. This game is only fun for people in huge clans and groups. Everybody else will only feel anger and frustration.The game mechanics and graphics themselves are satisfying. The problem with the game is the experience itself which is quite horrible. High level players shoot everybody on sight there is no human interaction. If you meet somebody with a gun on the road (and you will) they will kill you every single time and waste all your progress.High level players raid and grief bases constantly to the point of abusiveness because they have nothing else to do. (ever seen the YT comments section? Those are the people playing Rust). And since you are level dependent you will be facing off against advanced firearm wielding opponents armed with bows and spears all the time without a chance of crafting equal weaponry till many gameplay hours later.There is no way of properly fortifying your base if you don't have massive resources. (high level players will blow your walls in smaller houses away with C4 and such). And since there's so many of them it is no problem for them to amass the necessary resources. They can easily steal any buildings you create this way invalidating all your progress.The only solution to the problem is joining a bigger group of people and grinding your level through to the point where you can create competitive weaponry. But if you play in a smaller group like me you will have to waste your time away trying to cope against insurmountable odds. Even if you manage to fortify and equip yourself if you don't have a clan that plays 24/7 your base will be offline raided. Verdict Ultimately I gave Rust a negative rating because of all the frustration it caused. There was a lot of fun to be had but all that got overshadowed by constantly griefing frustration and simple abusiveness. Worst of all it wasted my time.Now if you like what you heard and would like to join this cesspool of violence griefing toxicity and gang fighting be my guest and go join a clan the game's mechanics are definitely solid. Me personally though I rather go play Battlefield and have actual fun without the grind.,Rust

2015-10-27,0,0,4170,False,Recommended,rust is probably one of the most addicting games I've ever played The reason for that is it's never ending sure there're server wipes and restarts but never ending in the fact when you stop playing your character sleeps in the game still vulnerable to death or which means you have to make sure that your base is save enough to protect your character or play with others so they will protect you I rate RUST an 10/10 9/8.5 M3+3+3 9 best $20 ever spent it's my first review so no salt please I could of elaborated on the review but this is just to level up,Rust
2016-11-28,0,0,427,True,Recommended,"Rust is the kind of game you love to hate. I love it because Rust itself is a good game the idea behind it is awesome and its potential is huge.BUT (there's always a but. And a butt) the community is rather toxic and the game is poorly optimised. All public servers are ""ruled"" by big clans so competing with them if you're a solo player is next to impossible. Also rust gets reeeaaaaally boring after a while if you're a solo player and being ""successful"" in rust by yourself is a nightmare. Only once did I manage by myself to make a base so strong that it never got raided all the way in an entire month but it was tedious boring and not really worth the time invested in it.Play Rust with your friends however and the whole game experience changes. You probably still won't be able to compete with the established clans on public servers but tons of fun are guaranteed nonetheless. PRO loads of fun if you've got a group of friends to play it with Has the potential of being the best survival multiplayer game on the marketCON Extremely poorly optimised Gets either boring or frustrating after a while when playing by yourself New Exp system sucks Early Development since it's launch in 2013 we do get regular updates but nothing gamechanging for the past 6 months in the way of optimising Did i mention that it is EXTREMELY POORLY OPTIMISED?

2018-07-01,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,"After watching a few YouTube videos I had a good feeling about the game and found it somewhat interesting to say the least but honestly the very toxic community turns this game into a waste of time and money.What should expect in this game Looking for an enjoyable experience? Wrong place pal. Very toxic community trolling greifing racial slurs homophobic insults cussing and/or plain mockery. Scammers that have no problem with admitting this! 99 out of 100 people will kill you on sight no questions asked cos for them Rust is a pure PvP CSGO/COD shooter Straight up savages who take pettiness to a whole other level because they just can't be bothered to farm wood stone or other resources on their own so will leave you to do the legwork for them then kill you. Players with by far superior gear kill you on sight and then loot the very little you got. How else do you think they got their castles? By grinding on their own? No by killing newcomers and taking their hard earned resources. Back stabbing apparently is a normal behavior. You should be on your toes and expect to be attacked even by a butt naked player who apparently looks harmless and on top of that says he's just passing by and means no harm! Teams will crush your puny fort in no time if they set their eyes on you! I didn't get that far anyway but YouTube is full of videos if look up ""Rust raids"" for instance Playing solo and especially without a microphone is something you would end up regretting shortly Advanced players with better gear camping on the roof of their castles and shoot/kill passing by newcomers for no reason at all! Did I mention that you WILL be killed and looted multiple times on sight? Apparently there's no penalty for running around and being an anti social toxic idiot. You will be killed in a matter of minutes far more times than the hours I have played (5.6 hrs on record according to Steam)On top of the things I said above apparently a while back the developers added a ""decay"" mechanism to the game basically punishing the casual players that don't invest hours and hours in the game to keep their camp not collapsing on it's own.I saw a couple of camps that had strong doors but no walls with easy to reach chests full of resources. One time instead of sharing the spoils we found a prick just shoots me takes the loot from the chests then turns on me and takes my very little stuff I had leaving me to die butt naked with like 3 4 HP.",Rust

2018-01-07,1,1,14,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I cant find a single interesting moment in this game.Its always just spawn grind and eventually die to some with a crossbow or rifle. I know that this is a common thing to happen in these kinds of games but its almost ALWAYS what eventually happens here.I cant make any friends/teammates because I can rarely ever find a friendly naked or even a friendly person at all! Even when I do manage to find someone that isn't just some thirsty for pvp we either both just die or something else that just brings everything back to square one. The servers are either full too populated with people that have end tier gear or with only like 4 20 players on the entire map.When I am sometimes successful though and have a decent base and weaponry its even more boring! You cant take the possibly fun chances anymore because you will almost certainly lose it all! Its just not fun.,Rust

2017-10-22,0,0,1145,True,Recommended,I would personally like to say I recommend this game for many reasons but lets get into it. This development team is one of the most dedicated teams I have ever seen working on a game. Almost every single thursday we get all kinds of new content they also highlight content that is in the works. I have owned this game sence the first month it was on steam many many years ago. I have met some of my best friends on this game and some of my worst enemys. After the Blue Print sytems was merged with the componet system it has drawn my self and friends back. I can really see this game developing well and I am exited for the future. I am not saying this game is perfect because it is far from it. There are many problems but they slowly get worked through.,Rust
2016-06-19,0,0,2783,True,Recommended,One of the best survival games I ever played. Facepunch studios are doing a good job at the game updates. It keeps the game fresh every week.

2016-09-01,0,0,347,True,Not Recommended,I just wanted to update my review for this game. I gave it a thumbsdown when it was first released once again I give it yet another thumbsdown. So after two years the game is still in Alpha. It's literally one guy working on it anyway so I don't expect him to rush it and release the full version fast. With that being said there's still A LOT of bugs in the game. Bears and wolves glitching through walls and floors rifles bugging out with reloads I've even had it where I would be crafting something with an open inventory and the item never came to be AND I lost my mats doing it (it has only happened once so far).The optimization for the game is poor but again take into mind there's only one developer so it's nothing against him it's more along the lines of because of a limited amount of resources he can't push the game out fast enough nor can he fix all the bugs in the game right away. After all it's still Alpha.Another thing I dislike are the servers. A mass majority of them wipe within 2 weeks to a single months time. The reason for this is due to clutter AND some players are so high of a level and well established that it makes being a new player or fresh character almost impossible to move up or at least take a lot longer. Some servers only wipe the map and everything you own and build but leave XP. Some servers wipe everything. None the less it's a good and also a bad thing. It's good that it makes you on even levels every few weeks but the bad part is it makes you feel unaccomplished. Don't get me wrong you could always get a private server and build to your hearts desire but from my understanding is that most Rust Server Hosts require a wipe so their servers aren't cluttered.Now the typical game itself starts off fun however once you get higher level (about mid 20's and up) the game is ridiculously easy and that's including when you're PVP'ing or just doing PVE stuff. There's literally nothing challenging or exciting that happens. By the time you're level 25 majority of the time you can build an amazing base and can make some of the top tier gear weapons and items. Once you're fully equipped and well armed PVP is really really easy. There have been servers where I be able to take out large groups of players with just a scoped Bolt Action and HV and Inc rounds. Or just fire rockets into a swarm of people. Or watch clans fight it out hide in a mountain side and blow rockets into the middle of all of it and go down and loot everyone after they're dead. Easy stuff. A little too easy.One thing I've also encountered that is a pet peeve of mine is that a large amount of the servers I've been in have no problems with killing a fresh character. Personally I always felt bad for 'em and I try to help if I'm already established on these particular servers however majority of time from experience and from witnessing other players is you could have a rock and be gathering and some level 30+ would come around and gun them down. Rinse and repeat. To me that's just ill taste in gameplay and a large percent of the servers I've been on do this frequently so people who are new to Rust tend to get a bad taste for it.I know people are complaining about the new XP system comparing it to the old way Rust used to be upon release. Personally I like the new XP system. I feel like it makes you strive for leveling but there are people and entire clans that power level with each other and that's where it breaks the game. Within a day I've seen a clan get to level 20 while most solo players were still around level 10.When the game first launched it was fun but got boring fast. I hopped servers all over the place. Even got my own for a short time. The game is very repetitive and to be frank gets dull real fast. So if you're looking for a cheap way to have a short amount of fun and like survival games by all means buy Rust. You'll have a blast. For those of us who wanted more don't bother. Just wait 'till the game fully releases (as stated it's still in Alpha).In the end Rust is still a better game than No Man's Sky and still a better game than anything Valve has released within the past 5 years.,Rust

2016-09-01,0,0,87,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a deathmatch survival game at this point. You gain XP by killing people animals and the environment. The higher XP the better equipment you get for killing other things. If a group/clan gets together they can XP share by giving each other tools/resources. Meaning now they level up twice as fast.Do not plan on playing this game by yourself. It will be impossible. You will be killed at every step you take. You will be killed when you spawn. You will be killed when you are gathering resources you will be killed by a 12 year old with a sniper from a km away.I also do not recommend rust unless you have a $1000+ computer to run it. The game is horribly optimized. My 6700k/GTX1070 struggles to run it at times. Look elsewhere for a survival game if that is what you are looking for. Rust is a deathmatch game with a survival aspect.,Rust

You either going to get screwed or double screwed and just to think that this game is sitting at $34.99 it's not worth it.

But all cancer aside I do think this game is wonderful I have met many friends playing this game and it's has been very fun time playing. I would give this game a 8/10 on graphics 7/10 on gameplay and a whopping 1/10 overall. Yes this game is a good place to find cancer people or even ed up people.

2018-06-11,0,0,1699,False,Recommended,I know I don't have a lot of hours like many Rust players but still I think I can share my opinion.Rust. If I needed to describe Rust in one word I think I would've gone with Unforgiving.A new player jumps on a server after buying the game what is going to happen most likely 1. You will try to get some resources for a weapon and get killed in the process.2. You will try to build a base and get killed in the process. 3. You will spawn fresh naked on the beach wake up and the get killed.All of this (happened way too much for me) might make people really ask themselves why they even bought that game if they can't do anything.Hear me out. This game can be extremely frustrating. Dying over and over again and again believe me I know it. But and there is a big but here there is no other game that can make you feel the way this game does. The bloodrush when you fight with someone when your bag is full of loot when you recycle alone or alot of components (required to get stuff in order to progress) your hands are shaking and gets stone cold when you fight. The feeling of victory is sweet as f ck the feeling of losing sucks so much.You die you lost everything you had on you to the other player who won and vice versa you win you get to take everything of the other player that is if you won't die while looting or returning home. I played a lot of games and no other had made me feel like. My recommendation on how to get started and make your start more bearable. 1. Learn. Learn the basics of the game basic resources how to build a base TC and building privileges decay system bags comfort system and such. I watched couple of videos before hopping on to a server just so I understand what I'm doing with my life. 2. You watched some videos you think you can start now don't go for the official servers as they are really hard for new players start at a modded server where getting resources is much easier getting weapons and setting up a base is easier. Do it so you will be able to test yourself and the way you manage your base resources and how you act on the field try out weapons of all kinds because you will play with most of them at the end (good servers for trying weapons are combat tag battlefields and such most of the time in the modded section). 3. If you think you are ready got the basics etc. hop on a community that is small or with group size limitations just so you know how a Vanilla rust is where it's much harder to get resources and your efficiency and prioritization will be tested. 4. Finally if you enjoyed playing on a community server that is group size restricted you can stay on community servers I had tons of fun there hell I think my first 450 hours were on a solo dou trio community server playing with my cousin and his friend big problem is finding servers that wouldn't die so fast. If you are up for a much bigger challange try going on an official server where there is action non stop zergs (5+ people groups) and a lot of people nonetheless. Officials can be really hard as they are not group size restricted so think carefully I went on an official because we became a group of 4 and there wasn't a good community server for us to play on that wouldn't die after the first 2 day of the wipe. Hope my review was helpful for some of you that are considering buying the game.,Rust

2017-03-26,1,1,1166,True,Recommended,Update 27.03.17EAC patch has resolved the issue below changing my recommendation accordingly. The good Rust itself is great a beautiful world and balanced gameplay. Servers that cater for everyone fast paced to slow vanilla you can immerse yourself in over a month. Invest emotionally in bases and neighbors that invariably become new friends.The bad (resolved for now)A growing number of players cannot play because the EasyAntiCheat system (very much needed!) malfunctions and prevents the game from launching. Rust Devs are not directly to blame and the 3rd party seems not to care about the damage it's product is doing. What does that mean for you? After buying the game you have a few months of play and then a chance to get the bug EAC will fail to launch and so prevent you from joining Rust servers again. It's been more than a month and NOBODY seem interested in solving this hence my recommendation you do NOT buy this gem of a game.PS. I'm not a cheater no VAC bans and none of my friends have VAC bans either I just want a working EAC so I can join my buddies again one day. PPS. If you're from support and reading this don't bother to suggest that I repair the game / EAC remove and reload / EAC try another version of EAC or eSports EAC run anything as administrator run anything in compatibly mode disable my firewall and AV check my hardware / OS for latent problems google a fix...I have done all of those now it's YOUR turn to make an EAC removal tool (for new and old versions of EAC) to get this sorted out ASAP.,Rust

If you play casually you will just get destroyed every 30 seconds. It might be for you if you like pvp survival but for me it changed into something I hate.,Rust

It was probably the best settlement I ever built by far fair distance away from the beach slap dab in the middle of the desert landscape (There are three in total Snow/Ice which wards off freshies and great for nighttime stalkin' Stalkers gonna Stalk Forest/Grasslands/Highlands for all the first timers who enjoy being in the presence of Mutha Nature and theres the Desert desolate wasteland lots of quarry and pumpjack locations perfect for the marauders of the server.) and we had it all armoured (Tier 5 Max Protection) up since we had more High Quality Metal than we knew what to do with We slowly invited people into our settlement of Pumpjacks and Mining Quarries we slowly began to become the biggest ""Band"" on the server.Long Story Short we got raided by DDOSing hackers that kicked off everyone on the server including admins and fly hacked into our well fortified complex then ending the kick wave and letting us spawn back into our bases to find that they were all C4'd. Thats one of the many struggles of Rust Dem Hackers EAC seemingly does JackSh*t against these hackers (VAC just likes to create problems on all other games that don't use Source) but this is Rust. Those who played the ORIGINAL Alpha would have known that hackers were RAMPANT in that thus one location on the old map dubbed ""Hacker Valley"" mainly because only hackers were able to get there in the first place. Like seriously who DIDN'T hack back then?Jokes aside we were kinda fed up about the whole ordeal so we took it upon ourselves and decided to go mess around with Ladders and Power Pylons (The BIG ones). We ended up trying to Spodermin up and trying to stand on it which we so HILARIOUSLY failed hardcore but then we discovered we could put SIGNS up on the Pylons making a platform. What was even better was that we could place FURNACES N' CHESTS N' SH*T up on these sign platforms. We pretty much had the most ist base on the Server hell even the OWNER decided to come base up with us.We always had plenty of freshspawns (Nudemans) to harvest for food since they always tried to come up and raid us with rocks and spears yet we still held our ground with just crossbows and Beancan Gurrnades. Best moment of Rust so far. Storytime Aside lets see the pros and cons of Rust PROS + Well Built Engine.+ Uses Unity5 Uses It Well Too.+ Plenty Of Different Experiences Each Server. You never will know what may happen on the next server you join.+ Lotsa' Gunz! Rust has plenty of guns to fit everybody's playstyle. Like going as the Sniopah? Get a Bolty. Like it up close and personal? Grab a Shotgun or Custom SMG. Pathfinder? Grab a Thompson/R250 (Rusted P250) and slap on a suppressor. Light Packer? Grab the R250 and knock in some Incendiary or Explosive ammo you won't regret it. Wabbit Sesun Hunter? Grab a Shotgun and load some Slugs. You'll have plenty of Newman carcasses to feed you for a while!As you see these are just some of my Preset kits but ofcourse you can go ahead and go full Pirate with the AK dress in Red and go raiding. Make some of your own combinations.+ Weekly Devblogs on what's going on FacePunch does an excellent job of keeping the Community up to date on what they're doing every Friday of each week and we can't forget their Trello trello.com page where they post their conecepts on where to go for Rust and it's great to say that the concept art they do is quite nice looking too especially the Trainyard Radtown concept (Lookin foward to it guys ).+ Every Second Week Updates they do an amazing job of keeping to their update schedule unlike most other EA Devs.+ FUN! Theres alot of fun to be had in this game like me and my mate how we discovered the Spodermin Pylons. All by Happy Mistakes!Now comes the Cons Hackers OFC this was going to be one issue but EAC and VAC are seemingly unable to deal with the hackers that run rampant on some servers. Theres always going to be someone who is able to crack the security. There is always a way in. Admin Abuse another big issue I forgot to mention theres SOME servers that have 16y/o teens who think they can tell people what to do on the server and kick whoever they want just because their Iceberg base got raided (You will actually be suprised at the lengths people go to off an Admin It is VERY Entertaining. P). SOMETIMES Game Ruining Updates I have ONLY encountered ONE of these bugs during a server restart where the world would not save and WIPE the map of all bases. But this has been since resolved a few months ago. Would I Recommend This Post Apoccalyptic Manhunt With Explosives? /i FU*K YES I WOULD! 10/10 IGN! 8/8 WHILE I FINGER MY PROSTATE!",Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,2472,True,Recommended,Just to screw with the sad buggers that have been posting bad reviews because they are salty that they nerfed launch and added BPs. You think this is a grind? Was you there when the XP system was out. I was. Lvl 30 for an AK no finding one and researching it day 1 so you can keep it for the wipe. You all legit make no sense to craft and AK yes it takes a level 3 workbench but you dont need one to research it. This stops people raiding you in the first 2 days and taking all your stuff. You still have the ability to craft one at a bench. Ever thought about interating with players to get loot you need for you crafting something at someone elses base for them. Say you find an AK and research it by day 2. Someone else will have probably farmed like mad for a tier 3 bench. You ask that player if he wants you to craft a gun for him in return for stone or sulfur or whatever you need as a player. Maybe you could set up a shop that crafts stuff for scrap. AK no problem 100 scrap plus mats.I can really tell who played the original blueprints in experimental and who did'nt by the way they talk about the new system. They have no idea that player interaction was such a massive part of the system and a great way to make allies and meet new players. Hell maybe even join a clan. I would advise anyone who is having trouble adjusting to the recent changes to try and find someone who was there for the last system and try explain what your issues are and why you feel so upset with the changes. I would also not be posting negative reviews just because you cant camp launch no more thats just lame.In conclusion Rust is a great game to play with your friends and the mechanics and art are one of a kind. The enviroment even in lower settings looks amazing and you can build anything you can think of with some imagination. If your a people's person you will find it a very sociable title with the players at the heart of it all. For the recuses in us all you can also have a laugh as a solo so long as you don't expect to be living in a castle with a million turrets on a vanilla server. The primative aspects of the game are pulled off in a way I have never seen a game do it. The bow fights are so satisfying and the noise it makes when you get a headshot. Obviously fighting full gears with bows is especially hard as it should be but the gun play when you progress that far is very good. People who like ARMA and PUBG to name a few because of the skill required to land ranged shots will really love Rusts take on it. I would recommend this game to anyone although it can be a marmite of a game. You either love it or hate it XD. Check it out play some and see for yourself its totally worth the money for a game you can play for hours!,Rust

2017-10-15,0,0,960,True,Recommended,I've got close to 700 hours at the writing of this review. I've gotta say Rust is unlike any other game. By far the most hard core survival / pvp game out there. very dynamic and sandbox. Also very good balance between tedius realism and fun non realism gameplay aspects.In addition to that the devs are wonderful and constantly improve and adjust the game adding new elements bringing old ones back nerfing buffing etc. Really feels like you're part of an ongoing project that is also entirely playable. The last forced wipe reintroduced blueprints in way that made servers stay full even weeks into wipe. This is definitely my FAVORITE point in the games history for me.Excited to see where things go their road map is long modular vehicles seem to be next and that will no doubt make it an entirely new game again. This game is I repeat though hardcore. it will you off. but you will never play a game anywhere else where hunting or being hunted is so riveting and killing another player and taking their so rewarding.I'm not a fan of the instant gratification of games today and I respect and appreeciate that Rust and it's devs constantly walk that fine line of rewarding vs gratifying trying to find the perfect balance.I take breaks from rust sometimes. Play other games. In the end I always find my self back though.,Rust

To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town. Do whatever it takes to survive. Gameplay Rust is a PvP/PvE survival game were you build up your base and people try raid your base and get all your loot. Optimisation and Visuals The Optimisation and Visuals are Amazing! Its like seeing the world through 4k Conclusion Rust is a good game for people into PvP but if you like surviving there are some severs that are PvE.

2018-01-26,0,0,1534,True,Not Recommended,"When I joined Rust there was a system called ""The Component System"". The game was fun you had accessibility to everything in the game as long as you had the materials to craft it. Bases were fun to create and the game was simple yet grind worthy. After a couple months the game has gone downhill. The developers have added in the ""Blueprint System"" requiring players to gain the item research it THEN have the ability to craft it. The problem with this are the drop rates. C4 Rockets Launchers Certain Guns.. All are insanely hard for solo's Duo's and Trio's to get. This increased Zergs and Clans and really ed over everyone else. THEN the upkeep system was added in which gave the game a little boost upwards forcing players to be active otherwise their bases would decay. This idea SEEMED to be good until massive amounts of servers began to get DDOSED which concluded with servers going off and bases decaying while servers were down. I feel as though Rust took a turn in the wrong direction but can easily get right back on path just need to give it some time but for now.. It's a complete disaster.",Rust

It's like they know where they want to go but the way they built the game means that they CANNOT get to where they want without tearing the game apart.Multiple major system and gameplay overhauls within months. Blueprints XP Components and now Scrap. Each getting progessivly worse and changing the META of the game in good but mostly bad ways. INCREDIBLY grindy and impossible for solo play. Only way to raid is with rockets and c4 no newbie raiding is possible at all. Tonnes of useless garbage added like chairs and bear ing rugs instead of fixing fundemental problems with the game.When met with critisizm the reply is always ""we're trying"" and it's just a major cop out. This game is so ing addictive or it was addictive. If you're solo or a duo you have no chance. You have to have no job or a social life to play this game. Upkeep system completely ed everything doubled the grind hasn't affected clans in any way because they always have insane farm due to the numbers.Gunplay has been slaughtered built back up and then set on fire again. Completely streamlined which ed this game completely. They take one step forward and 50 steps back. Old gunplay (2015 2016/17) was the best. Insane recoil for very powerful guns made them very hard to control and took skill to use. Mid 2017 was a bit the same but there was huge aimcone which was an issue and made bullets spray out and miss the target consistently. Late 2017 they pretty much removed recoil all together and replaced it with bullet pattern trying to emulate CSGO of all games. the AK47 has no ing recoil stance recoil doesn't matter anymore. Gunplay used to be very rewarding and now it's not.You should play legacy if you want to know how to do gunplay right. This is more of a managment problem than a game problem. The game has multiple developers all spread accross doing different things instead of focusing in on one problem to fix it. Gunplay has 1 developer out of many working on it.

2014-01-30,0,0,104,True,Recommended,Although i would recommend this game it has it's ups and downs. Ups Great communities who if you join the right servers are really helpful and guide you (especially if you are a noob like me!) Downs Wipes are a pain in the butt. If you are on a community owned server (owned by a player) then they do monthly wipes which is great because it keeps the server fresh and deletes abandoned buildings etc. But its tiring to come back on and restart everything over and over.Another downside is some of the servers are horrid. The people are horrid. You die all the time. You plead for help and no one listens.Its a game of two sides. Ive had sessions where ive enjoyed playing for hours and other sessions where i've wanted to smack the living daylights out of my computer. Damn i wish there was a neutral option..,Rust

2014-05-21,1,1,53,True,Recommended,Great Game?When first purchasing this game i thought it would be full of bugs and lack lots of things due to being in Alpha stage. But I was surprised It already had a large player base with many servers a little amount of bugs and a considerable amount of things to do. It then constantly got updates and it still does just adding more and more fun to the game.The game is set up on a huge map that would takes days to explore completely. It may take even an hour to get to the place you want to go but by no means is this a bad thing. It is not just survival also. You can choose to make allies and fight wars against other survivors. You could choose to kill or new people and steal the food that they have started off with. You may just want to raid the abandoned and radiated towns and factories for good like weapons ammo food or rare and uncraftable items. Due to the game being in Alpha some things do annoy me though.This could be the large variations of admin mods that may have compatibility issues when updating Wrong world Models These are small things though and can be expected from a game that is only in Alpha.Another thing that annoys me though is that they removed good old zombies from the game and replaced them by just adding 3x the amount of animals. This is bad for 2 reasons. 1. You used to be able to scavenge good stuff from zombies2. When you spawn on the server for the first time you are just attacked over and over again by wild animals such as wolves.Overall thought the Game is great. +1,Rust

Graphics are meh despite running terrible on a mid to upper range pc (6700k/ 1060 6Gb OC) actually loading into a server takes about 15 mins on average speed internet the community is absolutely cancerous and the server lag sometimes makes pvp impossible.

This game has tons of potential unfortunately you need to either hide in a cave or bring your own group of 5 to 10 people. Then there is the community you will barely ever find anyone who won't kill you for absolutely no reason. Most of the community are garbage CS GO brats who constantly talk and launch half asked insults. If you like harsh survival games go for it.

2017-07-24,1,1,2254,True,Recommended,After about 2000 hours in rust it is safe to say I can give a decent review in regards to this game. Now if you are looking for a boring friendly and quiet game you are looking in the wrong place. When you see the load in for a rust server you need to mentally prepare yourself for your inevitable death because you will likely be killed multiple times trying to get up your little one by 2 shack hidden in rock rumble or a nearby forest. Now though you may die I have never played a more exhilarating adrenaline pumping heart wrenching game. You will door campers and roof campers. You will meet noob killers and naked killers alike. You will also meet the occasional friendly and meet some really cool people. If you like a challenge you will like this game. I love it for the building the grinding the raiding the killing. It's not perfect but it sure is a good time.,Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,1422,True,Recommended,I had a falling out with rust. I've been playing since the EXP system and it wasn't perfect but it was enjoyable and I made tons of friends that I continue to play with until this day. However when Rust changed to components it lost a sense of progression and I became jaded by people getting full gear sets on day one. I fell out of love with the game and found new games to play with my friends. But now with the BP system back in place I can tell you without a doubt that I've fallen back in love with the game. Thank you Devs for all your hard work and the work you continue to do on this game. You guys are headed in the right direction. Continue to make Rust a survival experience and do not cater to the streamers that want quick guns to entertain viewers. You guys are killing it.,Rust
2017-10-13,0,0,3812,True,Recommended,With 3k hours in the game I have been through a lot of changes that Rust has been through. The devs are always pushing new content. This is by far the best survival game in my opinion. There are few games which can drive a person to flip the f**k out and this is def one of them. The community may be super toxic but with a simple toggle the chat and voip is gone.I would def recommend this game to anyone that likes survival pvp crafting squeakers etc.,Rust
2017-10-13,0,0,1405,True,Recommended,After the reform back to Blueprints I feel like this game while it's had a massive change promotes longevity to server life and encourages the reform of old communities and loyalty to a server instead of building a base getting raidied then moving to a new server that wiped that day in turn killing servers off in the process.

2015-06-05,0,0,15,True,Recommended,"Okay. After I heard that this game got ""rebooted"" or something I was excited. So I started it up. The server loaded for 23 minutes after which I encountered the most horrible framerate I have ever had the horror of playing on. Before I could run this game on native resolution with medium graphics for a playable 40 50 fps. Now I set the graphics on ""fast"" (which I would assume is the equivalent of ""low"") and on 1280x720 resolution. Somehow just as bad. I know my PC isn't the best but it was just fine before. I'm not going to Not Recommend this game since it's a good game and maybe my issues are to do with my PC (maybe some incompatibilities I don't know). It's a good game but for me it's just not playable. Give it a shot see if it works if not just request a refund since Steam does this stuff now.Major edit I take back what I said before. The devs are working on it actively and it's getting better day by day. Optimization is better gameplay itself is better everything keeps getting better. Overall hugely enjoyable.

2017-12-07,1,1,305,True,Not Recommended,I like the building system (mostly). I like the research and experimentation. I like exploring and finding loot.The developers are very active. New stuff is constantly being added or tweaked.I'm not a cold blooded killer. I don't kill people on sight. I don't steal their hard earned stuff. I don't grief people. If you're anything like me you will hate this game. It has the most toxic community on earth.I hate that almost every other player I have encountered would shoot before they'd so much as say hi. Usually they don't speak at all. Other players are just walking loot boxes. There's no incentive not to kill people on sight. Kill them before they kill you. Do not expect to make any friends. Everybody just wants to kill you and take your stuff. You are never safe. Anywhere. There is no recourse for players who focus on gathering and building and not hunting down other players for easy loot. Anything you collect and build is just more stuff you can lose. You'll be targetted ganked and raided and nobody will have any sympathy. These are psychopaths we're talking about. They enjoy your suffering.If you die and aren't exactly sure where you died best of luck finding your stuff. There's no indication of where you died on the map. If an animal kills you they have the tendency to eat you. Don't go in water if you're carrying anything you'll miss (visibility under water is near zero). The same can be said for caves. There's this one pit trap I've seen a few times...Don't make a mistake when building or place an object unless you're sure that's where you want it. Once you put down a wall or floor and upgrade it the only way to remove it is to destroy it (and it's gone for good). Some objects can't be picked up once they're placed (campfires sleeping bags shelves beds vending machines drop boxes to name a few) and they have to be broken to be removed.All things considered what I like does not come close to outweighing the absolute hostility of this community.Hardcore PvP. Toxic community. Unforgiving learning curve. Not recommended for casuals.,Rust

2017-12-24,0,0,478,True,Recommended,This game is Fun to play that is until you run into people. You can never trust people well enough that you feel comfortable with them. Most of the people you run into will kill you with rocks because they have nothing better to do. If the rocks don't kill you it's the people with bows. If that doesn't kill you than the people with Semi auto rifles will gun you down even if you don't have anything they'll still waste bullets. What makes this game terrible is that when you leave or game crashes your player doesn't go away instead it sleeps. People can loot your body while you sleep which can be very annyoing if you're the person who's trying to build bases. Most times when an update comes out it's pointless to join a lobby that has over 163 players ahead of you. Your stuctures also decay over time so you're constantly having to look for resources that are hard to find just so you can get killed by someone because you can't find food or were attacked by someone else. Like I said before the game is fun that is until you run into people. I don't play the game too much because of how stressed out I get from playing it but I enjoy exploring.,Rust

It brings out the worst in people making them greedy and mean for no reason besides ""winning"". You can't win in this game there's no final chapter it's an endless cycle of excitement hopefulness fear and defeat. One of the worst feelings in the world is spawning back into the server and waking up on a beach with a gutted base or in my case still in your gutted base on non KOS servers. After repeatedly doing this it doesn't feel rewarding or fulfilling just a huge waste of time for a little bit of excitement. And the game is designed that way!

And there goes over half of the player base.And they also upped the price to $34.99? F*cking INSANE. This game isn't even worth $20 anymore.

2018-07-13,1,1,413,False,Recommended,After Playing Rust for Nearly 300 hours I can say that playing on official servers will make you some fun only if you play with a lot of friends (made easier with the new team system) since getting raided in this game is extra easy unless you reached end game.if you intend to play either solo or in a small group (duo or trio) some servers have rules to obligate everyone to comply to small teams so dont worry on finding yourself outnumbered 1 to 5 everytime you venture out.Modded servers are a lot of fun too they allow you to enjoy end game content within minutes and feel more comfortable using weapons without being super stressed of getting killed (in game kits every 5 minutes for basically every weapon in the game) allows you to learn how to use and handle those weapons without having to spend 1h to gather specific ressources to build it. For Starters I would recommend playing on a small modded server wtih a minor boost to ressources gathering (2x and 3x servers) to get the learning curve going faster because this game requires a lot of grinding so having that double or triple harvesting really gets things going faster.Dont be mad if you lose your base putting efforts in a base when you start out is pointless stick to small bases I play duo a lot and our starter base never gets bigger than 2x2x1 (depending on ressource rate sometimes 2x3x2) Tips Never have a single door always put an airlock so players cant door camp youNever EVER have a window on the first floor Always have a backup exit (would it be to jump from the 2nd story or a 2nd airlock on the first floor Never Venture out with valuables you dont have the blueprint for (guns explosives armor... etc) Make a list of priority when spawning such as1 Reach to your buddies while gathering ressources (hemp crates basically all things you can gather without staying too long at it)2 Harvesting Trees and Rocks3 Build a Starter Base Base location should be focused on certain points such as*Player Activity (how many players the more the higher risk but higher reward too)*Base Density (again higher risk higher reward)*Distance to closest Radtown (or road if you wanna play it safe)4 Loot the closest Radtown5 upgrade base6 loot7 harvest/gather/scavenge8 learn blueprintsThen you can find the good loot and get to the real stuffif you do get raided past this point every blueprint you learned you keep with you so exemplePlayer A learn satchel charge and beancan grenade blueprintsPlayer B raid Player A's basePlayer A respawn in the wildernessPlayer Makes a new basePlayer A craft Satchel ChargesPlayer A raid Player BPlayer A gets his stuff back (or whats left of it)Player A gets Player B stuffPlayer B respawn in the wilderness with this I think I demonstrate the importance of LEARNING things you find so you keep them after you lose everything (except blueprints ) ) BLUEPRINT TIPS Always keep scrap if you have to drop something because your full DONT DROP SCRAP because of how much you need and how scarce it isDont keep the BP in your inventory you have to press on it and learn it or else whoever kills you gets it and you dont have it in your craft listOnly One player can learn a BP so this can lead to friends fighting over who gets the right to learn it(in those cases I like to say whoever is online more often gets to learn it because its really frustrating to be stuck because whoever you play with is offline)For bullets and meds have every player learn it (you can make multiple BP) RATING I would say this game deserves a 10/10 for conceptbut a 8/10 practically since there is many issues and for the moment in my opinion its the fact that servers can be controlled by bigger groups of people and ruin the experience for others (especially on official servers) RECOMMEND I recommend this game to whoever has time on his hands decent skills in PVP and to those who keep on going even after being raided.,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,453,True,Recommended,"Out of all the survival games I would have to say Rust takes the lead. Rust is the most attention grabbing game that I've bought in the past few months. Even in it's Alpha state I feel like this game towers over the others such Day Z and Nether. In Rust you make your safezone. You build your home and you must protect it! When you log off your body stays there sleeping therefore raiders can blow your walls down and slay you in your sleep taking everything. This is where I find Rust gets to really shine. Getting raided sucks so you build your home so the raiders either 1. Cant find your stash (Make your house a maze) or 2. Dont have enough C4 to get to your stash (many doors perhaps a tower or even two towers with a bridge connecting!!?!?!)The point is in Rust it's as fun as you make it. You can be a raider (Peoples houses or even Rad towns a.k.a npc towns) you can be a good neighbor you can be a bad neighbor you can be a lunatic with a gun you can gather resources for that lunatic you can build fortresses in any shape you please (Washington Monument?) or you can very well be that dude that runs through the valley naked screaming ""GIVE ME PANTS!!!!!"".Rust is an amazing game and it's only in Alpha. I only see it getting better from here on out.10/10",Rust
2014-02-21,0,0,814,True,Recommended,For an Alpha it is quite a good game.

This game is extremely addicting from the farming to building and the PVP the game mechanics are sensational and the dev team is committed to making this game even better proven by their dedication to weekly updates. The game has its fair share of issues as all games do with cheaters &amp general toxicity in the community but overall most player interactions are entertaining and add to the experience. Playing solo is extremely difficult so new players should probably get a small group together to get the most enjoyment out of the game.

Now that was the golden days back when the game was great if you can put it that way. Now it's changed. While i still believe the game has tremendous potential graphic wise and gameplay wise it's not those things that concern me no no. It's simply the terrible community that Facepunch has created. I don't know if there's any direct reasons for it but i believe a good reason for it is due to the massive growth of clan creation. Clans are basically getting bigger and bigger as the days go. And clans race along to see who can get farthest before wipe. Which is great. People showing dedication to the game is great for Facepunch but i don't think it's great for us as a community. Because at some point the clans are gonna start raiding innocent people only for the sake of getting more loot to compare to other clans. It isn't the same as in the days back when legacy still was a thing. Back then you could just build a small base and have a group of friends now you make a giant compound with quarry spots built around the map which is ING. CRAZY.Now i will give you my Pros and Cons for this game.ProsGreat graphics Great gameplay (without the clans)ConsTerrible community Extremely toxicI used to enjoy the game now i don't.

2018-01-31,0,0,145,True,Not Recommended,Excellent game lots of fun but you cannot play with less than 3 people and you must dedicate lots of time. This game only works for gangs and gang mentality and illustrates people's tendency for raw human savagery when given power over others. If you do play alone or with just one buddy you will get clobbered over and over by a bunch of raiders and the game will be a total waste of your time. Get buddies and you will have a chance. If you don't have a gang go play something else.Some community servers have admins who blatantly abuse their admin rights (NN).,Rust
2018-02-01,0,0,488,False,Not Recommended,"Updating as the game has left early access.If you can get it on sale (under $10?) then it's probably worth it.You'll always lose everything. It could be raids or it could be server wipes (mandatory). Either way it all goes away. Yeah you can work to perfect your start improve your raid strategy but in the end it's a very limited game.Key pieces There's crafting and base building but there's about 1 000 000 games out there that use these and have much better variety and control. You get ahead by playing more not by skill. You have an assualt rifle and I have a nailgun? Well I'm screwed and there's no skill that will get me out of that scenario. How do you make bigger jumps? You steal everything from somoene and turn your 3 hours time into their 20 hours. But that only works if you're already equal/ahead... Playing solo isn't really an option. Sure some hours when playing together are overlap effort but in general it goes back to the fact that it's all about how much you play. A bigger group has more play time and therefore will ""win"". It's ""procedural generation"" but there isn't much variability to it. Everyone knows the best places to get loot and builds accordingly. The Launch Site Military Tunnels Airfield... They're all the same every time just moved around a little. So once you've played a few hours (20 30?) you know where you want to be because it's where everyone wants to be.Basic things don't work or work very poorly even out of early access leaving half the caves can trap you forever in a glitch invisible wall forcing you to kill yourself Caves randomly don't render the walls so you see into oblivion for a few seconds. randomly dragging items from your inventory didn't actually move them but instead leaves the dragged icon on your screen even after you close your inventory twice I've fallen through the ground to a magical outside the map place as if clipping. Both times I had to kill myself and lost everything. light from the sun/moon shows up in caves she underground areas well away from the light source. Typically this happens at a distance as if the game isn't actually computing that the light should be blocked. This can mess with gameplay showing you things you shouldn't be able to see or making you worry it's another player. trees and rocks have a target appear that helps you gather resources faster. However rocks targets can appear in walls or places you can't hit them. Tree targets sometimes just don't react to being hit. I've chopped a whole tree hitting slightly different areas around the target without it ever registering as hit.In short. It's a glitch prone game that changes often and has a generally terrible community. You can absolutely sink a bunch of time into it but you can't take a day off or you're screwed.",Rust
2018-01-31,0,0,64,True,Not Recommended,The game has a lot of potential and perhaps that is why the current state of it is so frustrating. As of now I would not recomend buying this game unless you intend to play in a large group to horde all the resources so you may then then procede to kill off and grief any players not in your clique. The game is basically a huge grindfest were you put in tons of time to aquire gear so that you may then use it to mow down new spawns and players who have put in less time. When a ridiculous amount of grind is required to get even the most basic of gear large groups hold a ridiculous advantage because they can both put in more time and keep new players or solos from even aquiring the nescesary materials to progress. Combine this with the fact that there is no end game content or reason to actually colaborate/communicate with randoms leads to a toxic enviorment where those with power have nothing better to do then greif and kos new and casual players.This is not a sandbox survival game but rather a sandbox deathmatch for clans and a dying simulator for casual roleplayers like myself.,Rust

2018-10-11,0,0,124,False,Recommended,This review will be updated once I get more hours and invest more time into this game (and bother to even do so) but overall It depends if you like to spend time with your friends and git gud together. Because sometimes it will get boring when it's just you and can't really set objectives for yourself.ORYou are a lone wolf who gits gud alone/learns better by themselves then make some friends/neighbors in servers eventually betray those neighbors or do whatever you want to play and enjoy the game. Fair warning though people are either very toxic racist or nice. Although this game is still in beta the devs/community do update this game and give it their all to improve for it's own good. I'm honestly proud of the people who work on this and encourage them to continue to update this game. I'd definitely like to see this grow into something bigger or better. Hell even both.However I recommend this game at it's sale price. $35 is a hard bargain for this game IMO. But I'll give it a thumbs up just cause some things outweights others.

And this edge is where you will find out what kind of person you really are. And i am so happy to see how many people have taken a ing swan dive into the pit of mayhem that is Rust. After 350 hours of this game you come to realize 3 things. There is absolutely no limit to how off you can get the game is legit made to you over and trustworthy people are far and few. Rust is one of the best experiences if you have 2 3 friends to play with. If the first time you play this game you're solo. I gurantee you will be hanging from your ceiling fan within 1 hour. But with a couple buddies this can give you one of the most fun unique and high risk high reward gaming experiences ever. The biggest downfall of the game is also its greatest asset and thats how you can lose everything in the blink of an eye. You can go out to fight some people come back to a base in ruins and find out its because you killed some clan s e girlfriend. But all in all this is a fantastic game and if you have the will power and persistence to get up again and again after being knocked down more times than you can count.

I have been there the whole journey and can honestly say this game is amazing I think this is probably my favourite survival game up there with ARK. I have had a lot of great memories playing this game with friends I am not even a good PvP player and still have tonnes of fun whether its meeting crazy people (Came accross a guy who was having full conversations with a barrel) solo hiding from KOS'er clans getting betrayed by ""friendlies"" (trust no one) making trap bases for the lolz (the salt will make you cry with laughter) or making a big unraidable underwater base with your friends D it is always a fun time playing Rust.The devs have been so active listening to players keeping the game balanced added new content keeping the game fun. Even after release they are still adding content fixing bugs and making sure the game stays fun. I strongly recommend this game to new players or players who havent played since Legacy even players who got triggered by a new mechanic and stopped playing I bet it has been fixed and the game will be fun to you again.Rust will always have a special place in my heart.

You'll lay a twig foundation and some walls hide beside your campfire in the night as gun and rocket fire sends heaps of noise towards you. See an airdrop land in the distance reminding yourself that your curiousity and trust in others got you killed.You might find the left overs of a raided base scrapping by just enough to construct a furnace or workbench. Proud of your tiny 2x2 base you'll expand upgrading to stone.Then in the middle of the night while you are asleep IRL someone will blow your measly base to pieces with you still inside.Rust can be frustrating at times but it is truly wonderful.

2018-10-10,0,0,130,False,Recommended,I ve played this game on multiple accounts so don t look at my in game hours and say I haven t played the game much because I have. This game is doesn t get repetitive for me raiding bases and killing people to upgrade your own base is a very basic setup to understand yet it s so fun to kill that last guy and be able to take his Tool Cupboard over to make his base your own something ARK and Minecraft Factions doesn t allow. The first base my friend and I made was actually someone else s leftover base from a previous raid he claimed his TC and then bam it was now our base. One Con many people have over all the good stuff is the fact that every player on Boosted/Official servers are toxic and will KOS in the blink of an eye. I believe this game is a great game for the price and I believe this game will burn more hours in my life than most 60 dollar games. Also this game has one of the best Steam Markets I ve ever seen way better than CSGO and other major trading/auction titles. I recommend this game to all players who like a challenge and want to find a game to enjoy.,Rust
2017-12-19,0,0,598,True,Recommended,A true survival game. Start out naked with nearly nothing. You grind your way up towards better tools via crafting and build a house. You must maintain your house and venture out into the wilderness battling starvation dehydration wild animals and other hostile (or maybe non hostile) players. You hunt for your own food loot abandoned monuments and hope to be able to acquire enough resources to hold your own against the harsh environment and other players. If you're fortunate enough you will be able to reach the point of being able to become hostile towards other players and loot bases if that's the path you choose to take. This is a must have game if you have the time to invest.,Rust
2018-04-18,0,0,114,False,Recommended,This is a pretty fun game if played with friends. If your by yourself you won't really be able to do much unless your on a dead server as everyone is out to get you as soon as you spawn. If you jump into a clan server pretty much just expect to die alot and build a tiny house in the wilderness as you wont be able to get near any monuments without being rick rolled by 8 people with ak's on a fresh blueprint wipe day. Still i'd recommend it if you like survival games that challenge you or if you have several hours to burn.,Rust

2017-06-09,0,0,1236,False,Recommended,Rust is a very brutal survival game because when you die you drop all your items and other players can pick them up thats the thing that makes the game so fun when youre doing good.You can also build a base that you have to design yourself fill it with traps hide your loot or just make it huge the choice is yours.Did i mention that other players most likely will try to raid you and steal that hard earned loot of yours? well they will... So you better raid them first!Its a game that has a good base to stand on and the developers are working to improve it with weekly updates cant wait to see what the future will bring.,Rust

2018-11-21,0,0,132,False,Recommended,Rust is a game that only attracts people that like its specific genre (or like the heart pounding intensity). If you do like the genre and/or the intensity then it'll be a game you can't put down. You'll have 1000 hours in no time. Some cases might be where they like it for 100 hours but then never touch it again. It's a generally well polished game with few bugs. It could use optimization and you'll need a fairly good computer to run it. I've had problems with it crashing a little bit but it hasen't crashed many times. My biggest complaints are how you can't pick how your character looks or what gender he/she is and the fact that the achievments are not optimized well (might work for some people but might be broken for others). Overall its a decent game that could use some optimization fixes (and more character customization). My rating for it would be a 8/10. Thanks for reading and have a pleasant day!,Rust

2018-08-25,3,1,1508,False,Recommended,"Rust can be summed up by an analogy comparing it to a day at the beach.&amp #x200B Vast majority of people there are with friends just minding their own business relaxing. A few select people take enjoyment out of building sand castles digging big holes and just having a good time. Then you have the 10 year old autistic kid running up and down the beach screaming. When you're at your sand castle the kid doesn't dare come near you. But the second you head to the water to wash up the little comes running in screaming kicking down your sand castle only to run away like a little prick back to mommy and avoid repercussion. And if you confront the mom you're met with a group of harpies screeching at you trying to pick a verbal fight that will inevitably attract the attention of a cop standing on the shore.&amp #x200B It's not the normal people you focus your attention on its that one little that ruined your day that sits in your memory. The vast majority of us see roleplayers and think ""Oh thats awesome!"" The way you would look at a sand castle. You keep building in the sand eventually that obnoxious kids mom will take him home.

If you build a base the chances are that someone will try to raid it.6. The server that you play on will define your experience.7. The graphics are very good.8. YOU CAN'T CHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER9.

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy",Rust

2016-08-14,1,1,4570,True,Recommended,UPDATE2 Blueprints are back YAY!10/10 UPDATE Now that the XP system is finally gone I can again wholeheartedly recommend this game.The new Component system is just great. It's even better than the old BP system in my opinion.Keep up the good work devs! RUST!I really like this game and have been playing it since its release a few years ago.I think in its core it's one of the few best games that were ever made. You start out with only a rock and try to build yourself tools a house and eventually real guns and ammunition with the resources you are gathering.Although building can be a creative outlet on its own for some PVP is what gives this game its character and makes it exceptional and unique. Now why the negative review?It's not the hackers although there are some (like in every other game ever). You can avoid this mostly by playing on community servers with active admins. Also the developers are doing their part to make this better in the legacy version of Rust there was literally no anticheat. Now with EAC it has become a lot better.It's also not the kill on sight mentality of the community which is quite toxic one has to admit. But somehow a toxic community is just the right thing for Rust. After all it's about surviving and teaming up with random people will and should most of the times get you killed from behind. If you really want to team up with somebody get to know them first and try to build a connection OR play with people you already know.It's also not the aspect that people who want to play on their own without a team or clan have no chance in this game which is not entirely true. If you are alone and have to fight vs 2 or even more enemies it ought to be harder for you. I agree that it was a bit easier to play on your own in ealier versions of this game (no reviving more skill involved in taking down enemies with guns you heal to 100hp at campfires without needing other people to stand near you ...). But the recent trend of the developers is to make it fairer for solo players (picking up people now takes 6 seconds and you have to stand still always 5 minutes cooldown on sleeping bags you recently put down ...).What the real problem is and I think it's not only me is that every once in a while there is a update that makes the game literally unplayable or atleast takes a lot of fun out of the game.The new arrowhead which made aiming with the bow and crossbow impossible the crossbow nerf which made it useless and last but not least the XP system which took all the fun and also all the possibilities out of the game. Now with the XP system you have to chop trees and mine rock nodes not for getting the resources but solely to get more XP which is seriously the most boring thing ever (and it still takes ages to level up).If you don't do this you can't build higher tier building stuff guns and all kinds of other stuff which means you stand no chance vs the other players.You don't get XP for playing the game and doing what you normally would do that is building hunting down and killing people raiding smelting ore walking around and finding monuments on the map. Instead you get XP for only some stuff like gathering resources killing animals (which are quite rare not only due to this) looting barrels and crates.All in all the XP system needs a lot of improvement.Don't get me wrong I know it's an early access game but that doesn't mean you can just do whatever as a developer. So how to solve this?Use the current prerelease version of the game properly and test the out of it. Report and fix every issue there is. And only then when everything is fine (and there is nothing GAME BREAKING in it anymore) and ONLY then release it to the main client. This goes to both players and developers.And if there is something game breaking in the latest patch and it cannot be fixed in a few days then do a rollback to the last version and test some more. One thing make it easier to switch between release and prerelease version so you don't have to download files everytime you want to play the other version. The players have always had many ideas to implement into the game (mostly on reddit). The developers need to listen to those people and of course decide what is to be implemented and what not.In the recent weeks they did listen and good things came out of it and also will come out of it in the future.When the current problems (XP system) are fixed I will reevaluate the game and update the review. In its current state I CANNOT recommend this game. TL DROne of the best games ever made. Game breaking patches every once in a while.More testing needs to be done by both the players and developers before releasing patches.CANNOT recommend game in its current state.,Rust

2017-10-08,0,0,868,True,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game simply because of the faulty anticheat they employ. Multiple waves of false game bans have been applied to hundreds if not thousands of Rust accounts I'm not saying that this game is impossible to play or anything like that but rather that its anticheat is literally known to falsely ID clean players as cheaters. There are even engines out there to defalsify accounts simply because of the terrible state of EAC. I played 868 hours on this game just to get banned for 'hacking' and never got any explanation as to why my ban occurred I've contacted multiple different community leaders and even devs just for them to say that I was cheating when I literally have almost 50 hours of gameplay on video simply because I knew that EAC would eventually falsely ban me or some like that would happen. In simple words the game's decent but EAC is extremely unreliable and don't be surprised if your account is falsely banned.,Rust

2018-11-30,0,0,812,False,Recommended,Rust currently is the best game for survival with stuff like raiding bases tons of pvp plenty of weapons to choose from tons of clothing and armour a handful of attachments for said guns and a base design feature that can allow you to build almost any base to your desire the other thing Rust is amazing at is gun play the guns feel amazing to shoot and the recoil is learnable but can still take time the weapons also do balance damage and can be reletively easy to get but most likely you will spend the most time with a bow/crossbow or a revolver or if you get lucky a semi automatic rifle or SAR for short. Now for the end game you have Ak's Bolt actions LR 300's L96 snipers C4 Rockets satchels and lastly explosive ammo for you weapons. Of course all is well and good until you get raided which with a bad base design can be easy or with a good base design hard but good base designs can be learned with time and you can always rebuild if you do get raided but most of the time you will get raided when you are offline not online.

And if you do make it to the point where you have a base set up and you think you're safe the next time you log in everything will be gone. Guns in this game are way too easy to find and much to over powered. I believe them to be the biggest problem with the game.Starting out in the game whether it be your first time or one of your many new lives there are so many things that you have to worry about. You start out at half health almost starving and almost dehydrated. If you manage to get all that under control it won't be long before a player finds you and kills you.,Rust

Sinking your mind and body into the game for hours on end at the beginning is easy to do on rust and can catch you offguard if you don't have duties to pull you away from it. The amount of content mixed with ways that content can mix together allows for endless hours of fun. Generated Landscapes always make for interesting and fun base design opertunities. Worth it? Yeah I wouldn't take those hours back I had fun some interesting experiences and some really intense fights. From being fountation wiped while inside a 7x7 tower that is 20 blocks high to mowing down intruders as they turn the corner with my Custom SMG. Playing on Modded Servers with Image To Sign pasting was awesome. My favourite gun would have to be the Custom SMG with Silencer and Simple Sight. Now it's an MP9 with Silencer and Simple Sight because I like the sleeker design look and the silencer looks like it belongs to the gun. My dislikes would have to be the Blueprint system along with Scrap and the T1 2 3 Crafting Benches. While servers can turn them off it would have pushed me away from the game if I had to deal with all of it during my early hours.,Rust

2017-10-05,0,0,1055,True,Recommended,"Would I recommend rust? To be honestly I really don't know. When speaking about the game I am very conflicted. While a side of me loves the thrill and the rush and the ""Oh crap"" shakes when something crazy is going down I still see the community being well toxic.I run my own server now and play w/ friends on it (Yes I play on my own public server I pay for it I can play on it you skids who scream ADMIN ABUSE). I think this has made me feel the greatest about this game. Playing on High Populated Servers is something you should never do unless you're in a group of 3 or more. This will completely ruin your experience. Some aspects of the game seem to easy it makes it a nuisance. Examples would be the extremely easy raiding aspect of the game. No challenge at all. The last update seems to balance it a bit more I will note. The component system which is more or less a system in which you gather parts to craft items is just a nuisance. It's not difficult to make things. It's pretty crazy that within an hour or so into a wipe large groups are already satchel raiding multiple people have mid tier weapons etc.I recently went back to play the old BP and XP system and I have to admit the XP System I think was by far the better one. Yes big groups were still an issue but you as a player were rewarded for play time instead of RNG. The more you did the better you became. It logically makes sense even in a realistic standpoint but I digress.To boil this down I think I would recommend it as it is a fantastic game. The only issue is the community.",Rust

So I continued to hate this game until one day someone decifed not to kill me but to bring me into their clan. I learned a few tips and truck whole inside such clan and left when the server wipe occured. I am now much better at the game compared to when I started and I actually enjoy it now. One tip I leave for someone playin rust but having a hard time don't quit the game because your new because soon enough you will get better.,Rust

When I respawned I started shooting at a player nearby I then saw another player closer and started shooting at him. He then downed me. As he started running up to me I began singing All Star by Smash Mouth. Instead of killing me as usual he sits there and listens. Then all of a sudden he revives me and continues to listen to me sing and he begins to dance. I continue to sing but start laughing and forget the words to the song. So I kill myself to save the embarrassment.10/10,Rust

2018-02-08,0,0,259,False,Recommended,Rust. A beutiful example of a gaming legend finaly showing its true colors. People may say this community is toxic and has changed but it hasen't. It has evolved. The legecy player who played until the server shutdown's I tip my hat to you. A game which should have been dead long after the release of the new rust still had their community. While everyone jumped ship they waited for the inevitable. The new rust is not legacy though. The people who flooded into the island were just simply there to try out this amazing game. With a bigger community comes new play styles base builds skill levles and most importantly people. For a game like Rust it needs new players. The noob trying to bash you with a rock is a new player who will soon figure out that with enough wood he can insted poke you in the skull with a spear. More and more people will come to rust and we need to prepare for kids edge lords etc. Thank you rust for all the great times and congrats on getting out of early access hell.,Rust

2017-03-28,0,0,691,True,Recommended,"Pro's Ever expanding game. Random maps and standard maps. Tons of servers vanilla and modded. Crafting of just about anything. Great survival aspects. Great building aspects. A great game to explore every part of the world. A stubborn development team do what they want. Gun play feels satisfying. Lots of weapons and skins. Everytime you start again it's different.Cons Forced wipes but this is for patches. You can't casually play once in a while. Some cheaters (haven't encoutered much and usually banned quick). Random bugs but it's early acces.This is one of the best games I have ever played.Now this isn't a game you can play casually once every few days this is annoying for people I get that. But it doesn't mean you should review this game negative as well as people who have spent hundreds of hours or thousands of hours in this game and start to complain that the game is just ""boring"".Everything gets boring over a peroid of time and if you have spent more than 100 hours in this game (which you've probably bought for /$15 20) than you have no right to complain about the game being boring.If you've put 2000 hours in The Witcher 3 or any Dark Souls or any game for that matter you wouldn't complain about it being boring but praised for it's gameplay story and mechanics and that you have spent that much time in the game.This game has a lot of features and it keeps on expanding.People complain about everything but if they have just thought about what kind of game this is they shouldn't and wouldn't have bought it.It's a survival game first and a builder second.

2018-02-05,0,0,1991,True,Recommended,"I mostly played what is now called legacy rust and didnt look much the way of ""experimental"". This was back in 2014. Then in I picked it back up a bit in 2016 still in legacy version (you could switch back then) and played a bit more moved away eventually.Few things to know about this game 1st it will global your free time. Literally. Always something to work on to improve to raid etc etc etc. Much better with some friends.2nd The biggest servers are not friendly. They're highly competitive clan dominated and salty. If you have your fun from it fine otherwise avoid them. *Note that going into them then posting a negative review because of it is pretty dumb as well""3rd You will become a paranoid f***. No exceptions. Shoot first ask question later. Dead people can't shoot back.That deer is hanging around my base. All day long. It was to raid me!!!! *strap C4 to a deer*4th You will enjoy every minute of point 3 )In a more detailed review its a game with potential that gets a lot of upgrades fast (altough that will decrease with the launch thursday game coming out of pre access) but I'm also looking at a small but enthousiast team of talented programmers that do good efficient work dont corporate t and have a plan.Thats more than most in this industry and just the last part is more than 98% of the ""pre access"" you find around.Definitely worth grabbing in its early access version as price will increase slightly thursday the 7th...and if you don't still worth it after.Make sure you find a server that fits what you are looking for. Some have some rules to enforce more friendly gameplay going up to totally banning PVP for player who mostly just want to socialize and build or new player to discover the map mechanic etc without the fear of having a 3000 + h player with his youtube channel invading their 1x1 with flamethrower blazing. Some boost interesting mods or extra ressource yield for faster progress easier starts (altough I suggest you at least try 1 regular ""me my rock and my torch"" start).

2018-11-24,0,0,477,False,Recommended,So Rust.. What is Rust?Rust is a survival multiplayer game where you live in a post apoctalyptic world. Most modern technology is gone.In this game weapons such as bows and spears are your best friend and eventualy you can get guns.Raiding for most Rust Players is like Christmas. But if you're the one getting raided it's not very fun.Rust can give you a lot of joy and sometimes salt. In some cases playing Rust is like a full time job. Playing with friends is also a great thing in the game well that is (if you had friends).Rust in its current state is a 'KOS/Trust Nobody' game. But you will have friendly encounters I promise.So should you buy Rust? Yes! Absolutely!My Review 8.5/10 Very Good,Rust

The game itself is really fun and good value for the price. The devs are always releasing new things and keeping it fresh. The huge downfall with this game are the hackers. The esp aimbotting flying code raiding take the fun out of trying to be competitive. The devs are slow to ban and the anti cheat is a joke. I have got my moneys worth but the cheating takes the fun out of it too often.

The second thing is that you need a nasa pc to get the best experience im running i7 8700k with 16 ram and 1060 6gb and i still feel like its not enough I needed to tweak the settings a bit in order to stay on 60+ fps all the time.

2017-10-28,0,0,84,True,Recommended,Great game once you get started but sucks when you keep getting killed as a naked with a rock when these guys with crossbows bows and guns etc decide to kill you when building a solo base. If you are playing solo in this game It will be tough especially on an official server which is what I play on but once you get started and make a nice solo base to protect yourself and resources you gather it becomes a really fun and good game just be aware you will have to do a lot of farming to get your base. Mostly wood and stone is what you will need for your base but you can upgrade to sheet metal if you want to later on.

2018-08-23,0,0,764,False,Recommended,Best described as 'multiplayer on hard mode.' I have a love hate relationship with this game. Not many games can get me to rage to the point of slamming my fist into my desk fuming like a off bull. This game can. You can lose dozens of hours worth of progress to little korean kids who will talk in your ear the entire time you desperately attempt to stop them all while blowing up your clan memebers cells telling them to leave work immediately and come home bc you're going to lose the base.That said I've had some of my best gaming experiences on Rust. The PVP is world class. But more importantly the experiences you can have with other players is simply next level. This game forces drama like no other. We've had red wedding type betrayals public executions and explusion from the group friends made and lost and more. You better hold on tight bc old lady Rust...she bucks pretty hard.,Rust

2016-12-12,0,0,1320,True,Recommended,Pro's Devs really listen to community Generated maps Size of maps Number of items Base building Voice chat AI of NPC's (Animals) Change roadmap (devs actually tell you what's still on their list and when they expect to pick it up. How fkin awesome?!)Con's Devs really listen to communityjust because 5000 people complain about something doesn't always mean there's a need to change.My recommended solution(s) Voting system for changes that (potentially) affect user experience in a negative way. i would recommend the devs to introduce a voting system for changes that (potentially) affect some players in a negative way. This way the (largest) group of customers who don't bother complaining on a forum get a say before changes are made. Toxic communityBuilding a base and getting some resources for clothing and weaponry takes quite some times. Hours for a basic base and supplies atleast. Imagine spending 30 minutes chopping stone and heading back to base finding your skull penetrated by an arrow right before your doorstep as you try to enter your base. I'f you're lucky the attacker is satisfied with the loot in your inventory. Even that's not too bad. Imagine spending 5 hours building a base and logging back on later to find out you weren't the only person who thought it was a nice base. Some people just rob all your others take over your entire base and when u meet the creme de la creme you will find some a$sh0le who decides to spend the resources he finds in your base to seal up the entire place making it impossible for anyone to use.My recommended solution(s) Safe zone(s) where people can gather resources without getting killed. Easy way for starters to get enough resources for a basic base. Passive mode. When you join a server for the first time you can hit the 'passive mode' button which makes u immortal to others for the first 2 hours. During passive mode you will be limited to gathering natural resources (no looting) and can't boost players (prevent passive players from helping to break in). 'Central Storage'. Offer players a 'central storage' they can access from their inventory and allow them to store (limited) resources (no weapons / clothing). This way they can store the stuff they need to get a base started and won't lose anything when they die. HackersStill alot of hacking going on. Mostly aimbot and ESP (used to locate hidden stash and lootrooms in bases). My recommended solution(s) KillCam with report function build in. Build in 1 minute delay if giving away user location is a problem. This lowers the trouble a player needs to go through in order to get cheaters under admins attention. Vote system on official servers. Official servers are rarely monitored by admins. PermBan steam players who've cheated in the past from official servers. OR have a set of 'zero tolerance' official servers with this permban policy for (ex)cheaters. Offer prominent figures in cheating scene a job and get them working for the good guyz. Like they say it takes a criminal to catch a criminal. Scout some players from community to admin official servers. GrindingGrinding grinding grinding.MY recommended solution(s) speed up the rock movement. Taking down a tree with a rock takes ages. Add some hotkeys to easy grinding. Hotkey press key once to keep running/walking ahead Hotkey press key once to keep hitting (grind) Hotkey press key once to keep ducking Hotkey press key once to duck and hit (grind rocks) Remove movement sound while walking (same while ducking and moving). This way i can sneak up to someone without holding CTRL+W (hello RSI!). Add larger (more rare) resources for wood/stone/etc. Those wood logs on the ground for example. Imagine getting 2k wood from a single log.i know those hotkeys can be used with config hacks or 3rd party tools but comon.. FPSWow this game is heavy on the specs. I've got a I7 3.4Ghz 16GB ram SSD and a GTX 970 and im playing on ultra low settings with 1080p resolution. This STILL gives me framedrops. I won't settle for less then 60FPS while playing PvP and my setup simple doesn't do the job.MY recommended solution(s) Let me disable GPU intensive stuff. I know when i remove grass while im admin on a server i notice huge improvement. This makes me think why the hell can't i disable grass on any server? I honestly don't give a about the grass.,Rust

2017-12-09,0,0,2830,True,Recommended,The game is great but at the current pace they will end up destroying the combat and worsening the grind for those that play in groups less than 3 (god forbid you attempt to play solo). I'll probably always come back and play Rust because it's truely amazing but I'm sadly beginning to enjoy it less and less. I have hope that they will start rebalancing some aspects to make it more enjoyable inthe future until then I'm accepting my fate of being raided by a group of 32.,Rust
2018-10-15,0,0,577,False,Recommended,If you want to play this game good luck it isn't fun it's addicting and enraging. It is a niche game that only some people enjoy so make sure you have a lot of time on your hands if you want to play this game because you'll be grinding hella for days straight only to lose all your loot and get offline raided by a clan of 32. But you restart anyways and you really don't know why you have to find friends online who play the game because soloing almost never works out and good luck trying to convince your friends in real life that this game is actually fun because on paper it seems crappy until you really get into it. There is almost 0 balancing in weapons basically who ever has more ak's and more people wins. When choosing between servers you either go on an official and get steamrolled by cheaters on the weekend or play community (Rustified Rusty Moose etc.) and get steamrolled by a clan there really isn't much of a difference. All in all this is an amazing game but they just need to fix balancing and use a preventative anti cheat rather than a reactive one remove the l96 from being able to be purchased and make the ak recoil unpredictable and you'd have yourself a rather good game. I would definetely reccomend getting it only if you have friends that would be willing to play it with you otherwise don't waste your time.,Rust

2017-12-09,0,0,536,True,Not Recommended,My review may be abit.... rusty Rofl.Rust is a MMO survival FPS open world game along with crafting gear and building bases what makes this game standout from others (At the time of its release) was the uniqueness of being able to raid people.Before rust i've never played a game like this before.I've played it with friends family people i've met online it was definitely enjoyable and we had alot of laughs together.IF you can manage to play with people who are competent and realise it's just a game then yes i do recommend this game for you.However be warned some people take this game too seriously and cannot control their temper.You will come across rude vulgar salty toxic groups of degenerates. I recommend the block and mute option for them to fully enjoy the game.Edit 2018 12 09 After putting in a few hundred more hours into this game iv realized it's complete the last 200+ hours iv played have been the most unpleasant game experience of my life Everyone is always toxic and raging spamming vulgar remarks in voice chat.And if that isn't the worst the hackers will definitely ruin your day all your hard work building farming and earing loot from PVP gone ina split second from hackers.Valve and Facepunch do absolutely nothing to BAN or remove such cheaters.Game 0/10 till they start dealing with these degenerates.,Rust

2017-10-16,0,0,1712,True,Recommended,Rust's community gets a bad rap for the Kill on Site nature of the game. That said that is apart of what I love about this game. This free to roam survival game is one that you can give up days of your life at a time instead of 30 minutes like in pubg. Jokes aside the game has been continually getting better and more impressive. It's visually pleasing to play and enjoy the environment. It's also immensely fun trying to survive and start as well as continue to survive when people enter later parts of the game.The recent BP workbench update was fantastic and the follow up balancing batch was even better. I have been hosting a server about as long as I have owned the game. I get a kick out of watching people play and how they progress. For the first time in a year I have held server population beyond 1 3 days and it was magnificent. I am super thankful for this last update and can't wait to see more like it.,Rust

2017-11-25,0,0,808,False,Recommended,Personally a great game to play with friends close by. It has beautiful and extreme terrain and landscapes although it does sacrifice for the fps and ping you are playing at. You will die a lot at the start but after successfully waking up and moving inland away from beach your are fine but please do watch your backs out there even if you have guns a naked could just walk behind and bam you will start over again. This game is about learning from mistakes and never giving up if you want to keep loot you have found I suggest getting a small base down to chill out and store your gear. Your not safe there though fortify the base with defensive posts and traps which makes it harder for other survivors to get in and if your raiding do It wisely and think that's all have fun and a great time out there everyone and stay rusty ) 10/10 ZIPS,Rust

I have logged on to multiple servers as a naked and was given a base and multiple full gear sets. Some people are rude but I believe that that's the entire purpose of the game.

Then you encounter with the first human being you have seen all day and the first thing the guy does is calling you racist names then trying to kill you like an animal. This game gets me very salty at times yet I still come back to it the next week of wipe. The game is getting better every month but the community just goes down hill.

Servers that wipe bi daily pre formed groups of 4+ even when they say it's ""trio"" max admins abusing their own powers wipe times set up on over 20 different servers that change names weekly so they ALWAYS get a giant headstart in terms of guns/bases hackers out the wazzoo I'm talking like 30% of them at least and they don't even give two . (and by them I mean Facepunch or the active admins). It was so bad with fly hacking lately that most servers had ""make sure to put a roof on your building or they might fly in and we can do nothing about it."" Crazy such low time spent by Facepunch to counteract the hackers but so much updating to whiny babies who just need 2 more asssets in the game instead of maybe fixing the real issues. And how do they constantly for years have gotten away with the excuse of hackers just be crazy and unsolvable? ""EARLY ACCESS GAME"" Make sure you read your fine print here. I challenge you to find a server on this game that is not completely based off the group mentality. If you're looking for a game where you do nothing Solo ( feel free to add the I can play solo here phase and you just need to do better phase.) I've played solo for the entirety of the game and have loved it but to say the game is geared towards the solo player is a blatant lie. Everything in this game is now group/clan based time/speed based (server dies in 2 days so you better rush the farming boi) and worst of all no anti hacker methodology in any way.

The redeeming value is that you can enjoy this game with some time well spent watching the experienced players on you tube. In most cases solid advise in base building and general game play.

Overall very fun but here is the major thing. there is no way to play this alone. you need to buy it if you see a good friend who you can get on skype or team speak and chat with. by yourself this game would suck a constant reminder of how quick you can die. but with friends you might have a chance to be the guys who you will no doubt be killed by when they have advanced weapons and you have a rock... just.. a rock.. as if that was what they needed. oh and a heads up. if they shoot you and is 5 times that is like saying oh here spend 5 min making that ammo because a 9mm bullet takes a few mats that you have to find from rocks all over so in a way it is not worth the time or effort to kill somebody. BUT if you have friends who want to play a way better DayZ and a Mine craft baby this is your game. they need to find a way to have your X Y and Z location on your hud because you will find yourself typing /location every 8 sec to make sure you heading in the right direction. overall at this date I give this a buy only with friends. with a few fixes this could be way bigger in popularity then DayZ,Rust

The comfort you feel while hiding in your mere 2X1 as the fire crackles and cricket chirp at night is something no other game has been able to replicate.

2017-06-15,0,0,245,True,Recommended,Rust is an incredibly addictive game and will eat up your time.As an early access game that has been out for 4 years I must say that the game is terribly optimized. The fact that the reccomended amount of ram is 16 gigabites is a big you from the developers. Granted I only have 6 gigabytes of ram personally so I cannot about it. But the developers have been trying to improve the performance recently. I have many problems with my amount of ram constant lag spikes and whenever the game has to render a new container or weapon I get an incredible lag spike and this degrades the immersion completly. Currently standing the game has horrible optimization. Granted this is an early access game (that has been in said early access for 4 years)Overall this is a great buy and it is definetly worth the price (that is if you have at least 8 gigabytes of ram) but if you do not have the recommended amount of ram feel free to go spend $150 dollars on 16 gigabytes. It is definetly worth it if you have the money.,Rust

Cant really roleplay a self taught military man by the using of ancient military FMs and TMs. If Im a black women with a hairy . Other than that the game is outstanding! The learning curve is a little diffcult but the game has so much to offer once you get pass the curve. *The combat feels naturally primitive yet modern which is a very awesome feeling and its a need to try. *The survival is intense because you never know what resources will be scarse or be common.*The base development allows for alot of creativity and is not diffcult to learn(easy to learn hard to master).*Almost all Survival games are dead. en dead ! Nobody plays them. I have had almost anything to do with multi layer survival. DayZ(1st love lol) WarZ H1z1 Miscreated Surivial Apocayplse and many more flops.

2016-12-04,0,0,317,True,Recommended,Boy Oh Boy! I made a huge mistake. I bought this game on sale months ago and played 1 battle royale. It was terrible horrible and I uninstalled immediately afterwards. I decided to reinstall recently and give the game a proper try. Jeez. It's utterly brilliant. Is it hard for new people? Yeah it sure seems that way but lets be honest if you have a brain it's not hard to avoid people until you get your little base started. I've now had over 8hours of fun and much more incoming. Recoil is a though. /,Rust
2016-10-11,0,0,2521,True,Recommended,"Without a doubt the best survival experience you will find out there as of now. Everything that most of the half done copies fail to deliver on Rust mostly does perfectly. The building system is pretty ing good. PvP is intense and balanced the game incredibly unforgiving and hard but yet rewarding and there are very few bugs (apart from the incredibly obnoxious and broken AI on animals. Running through walls and rocks.) For how little it costs I would recommend this to anyone considering the amount of time you will put into this game if you actually do enjoy it.Just a few pros and cons for those who can't be arsed to read all of what I wrote.Pros Great graphics for the genre runs well for most people myself included. The developers are great and do weekly devblogs of what's been done over the course of the week as well as things coming in the near future. There's a small/large patch every week so it's not like you'll go for very long without new things being added to the game.As mentioned above the PvP is very good in general guns feel great and there's a wide variety of weaponry in the game such as a bunch of melee weapons bows crossbows a bunch of guns (assault rifles sniper pistols etc).Cons The community is rather toxic and since it is PURELY a PVP EXPERIENCE you will mostly never find random encounters to be the same as in similar games such as DayZ for example. Do not be surprised if a group of 5 blows into your little shack and calls you ing garbage.Clans. As it is mostly a team game most larger servers (except for some who don't allow groups to be above a specific amount of people) have huge groups/clans of 7 10+ people that will dominate certain areas of the server. This has been an issue for a long time but it doesn't seem like it will change anytime soon based on what the developers have said. You will just have to either completely stay out of their way if at all possible or move to a more secluded part of the map when dealing with these no life clans treating Rust as their second job.This isn't necessarily a bad thing about the game imo but it has quite a steep learning curve and it seems to be quite hard for new players to get into the game without getting completely ravaged. Just pay that in mind I would also recommend not playing this solo as clans mentioned above will tear you apart ESPECIALLY if you are new.Other things worth noting Some might say that the game is a huge grind but it doesn't have to be if you do not want to. You can just play for the PvP for example raiding others is not a must. If you know what you are doing (and I suggest looking up guides on how to build certain bases etc if you have no idea what you are doing) you won't be raided all too often. In short you can just ""farm"" players for stuff if you're good enough and a small base that is made of stone and has metal doors will be ""tough"" to raid so most players won't bother until it's late late game when everyone has enough explosives to just raid whatever they want.",Rust

But the light that shines through all that muck seems to shine through very well. I've had some great times in this game overall and I feel that outweighs the bad. If you don't have too much time this game might be hard for you to love. Also get some friends to play it with that makes life so much easier although you can play solo. The Devs are very active pushing out monthly updates even though sometimes they are nothing we asked for and or needed. So overall wait until sale because $35 is a little much but otherwise its worth. Now that I've said all this good I'm gonna get raided. Gl Hf,Rust

2018-12-23,0,0,613,False,Recommended,"I've been playing Rust since I bought the game back in 2015. Since then it has gone thorugh several complete overhauls gameplay wise and in its current state it is one of my favorite games of all time. The idea of finding yourself in a foreign land on every server is something truely inticing. It forces you to learn the lay of the land all over again and reaquaint yourself with the regulars on the server aswell as the landmark locations. Where Rust truly shines though is in it's complex but simple pvp aspects. The guns have recoil paterns that a semi novice can learn in a few hours of practice with however obtaining a weapon in Rust is a very daunting task in its own. The most effective way to obtain guns is getting your friends online and running around landmarks looking for crates or looting supply drops/server events (Depending on if you're playing on an Official or Modded/Community server). Rust encourages team play in almost every situation whether it be raiding bases or pvping at the landmarks to even out maneuvering the tank at launch site Us regulars will know what I mean when it comes to the heli AI ) . Base building is a seperate skill on its' own. There are plenty of structural combinations and hundreds of unique items to place all throughout the map as you embark on your journey to total server dominance. Hopefully this review gives you some insight on what the game is like from a veteran player and you truely consider purchasing this game. P.S. Gathering/Pvp/EVERYTHING about Rust is more efficient when you have your friends or clanmates online to play with you and build up a base. The main goal of the ""endgame"" is honestly whatever YOU want it to be. What you play it for is totally up to you. From running solo and killing people at landmarks to playing with a few friends and taking out a heli for some sweet loot its up to you how your story is forged in this open world sandbox phanominon that is Rust. EDIT This game is 101% worth the money at full price. It semi frequently finds itself on sale usually around half off so definately a worthy addition to your steam library at only $10 on most sales.",Rust

You upgrade to stone. but it's still not tough enough to keep the hardcores out. basically after you have built a camp it's and endless cycle of being raided and having to start all over again unless you becom a the (raider).

I enjoy making a character and deciding their history their flaws their life. But being forced into a character I don't care about I just can't get into that. It's a deal breaker for me. The devs seem to be doing a fine job and this one lost purchase isn't really gonna do anything I just wanted to make sure people knew this one feature before going in so you can decide what you want to spend your money on with a better understanding of the product.

And if you dont enjoy getting a good start then getting killed by some guy thats fully geared/someone whos better than you ( Over and over again eventually you will get a good start get a base going and actually accomplish something.

If you enjoy adrenaline rushes shaky hands and heart pounding action Rust is a must. Always new content never get sick of it. Its hard solo but you can still have fun. Last nights experience on Rustralasia Main server/ 300 people (Night time in game)I heard a group of people setting up base near me they were obviously new players I went out with a free door to greet and gift them as they are my neighbours and I didnt want to get ganked to tell you the truth as I am solo. They killed me at first sight. This is a group of 5 guys who were growing and recruiting at this time. Im not a but I kind of had it out for them after that. Massive base went up very quick as they have at least 5 slaves running around. I noticed there front door had no code lock. People were entering and leaving all the time so I decided to make a wood helmet ate and gained full health made a bow and 20 arrows. I walked over to their base I heard 2 guys inside and also running footsteps on the right hand side coming back to the house. I opened the unlocked first door (only one other door to full access of their base guy inside heard me and opened up and started firing off arrows at me hit me I headshotted him guy came at me from outside to the right with a machete I headshotted him while other guy from in base was shooting at me I headshotted him 3 down MY HANDS WERE SHAKING ADRENALINE RACING HEART THUMPING WITH EXCITEMENT I RAN INSIDE LOOKED AROUND SNEAKILY AUTHORIZED MYSELF was in there for literally 5 seconds then turned around to be killed by 2 other guys who were heading back from farming...... so 5 guys I know of. I respawn unknowing to them I have Tool cupboard access run back to code lock it and lock them in get killed while doing so......SOOoooooo then I respawn make a few spike traps lay them outside their base sit in my 1x1 base I can hear someone stuck in spike traps so go out I get killed again. They still dont catch on that I have Tool Cupboard Authorization I have a few more losing battles with the last I counted of 6 ppl. I dont usually do this I genuinely play the game properly...... Decision to go to sleep and wake up early the next morining when they arent online wake up this morning and jump on still a few of them on farming so I go out and gather 1.2k stone go back with my hammer and building plan quickly walled them in with hard side stone on inside..... heart racing again and hands shaking with excitement LOL I run back home so content and laughing inside. I read one guy in chat ""Slaving gets real when they actually Jail/wall you in"". Had a good old laugh. They cudve used their hammers to break/destroy the walls..... obviously new guys.

If they would do like most other games and give you the option to host a game on your personal machine and just invite your friends I think I would rather enjoy it.

2016-05-27,3,1,3561,True,Recommended,Here's a little REAL story that I've endured over the time I played this beautiful game from many years ago when this game was first created.Spawned.I open my sleepy eyes as if I was asian I viewed and wondered around the area that is now my soon to be home. Not understanding what true beauty it was to come I found a rock I gripped the beautifully shaped fossil caressing it while it lay resting in my soft but firm hands. I look into the unknown surrondings viewing what resources I could possibly craft with this essential tool that I've just stumbled upon. I spot a bright but dim forest in the distance. Currently surronded by mountains behind my back and jagged rocks to my sides I look around for any other resources that I can gather while I'm pondering over this beautiful and majestic landscape. I viewed a rock so shiny that it appeared to be as if the sun is sitting right in front of me but it was a rock covered in yellowish gradient highlighting the very beauty that is bestowed right in front of my alerted eyes. I use the unforgettable tool that will eventually help me survive I hit the rock. Bags of ores come out of the unkown rock by my feet. I inspected the ore. Sulfur. After finding my way around this beautifully crafted map I found a place to build my home. I've been gathering resources and other materials for weeks now not spending any of it. Whilst searching for more materials such as Stone Charcoal Wood Metal Ore and Sulfur Ore I spotted my first animal in the wild. A Bear. Prior I found my perfect place for my home I crafted a wooden bow. Made out of oak wood and flax which I crafted into string by a road growing miraculously on its own. I knew this is the bow that will save my life and produce food for myself while surviving alone and scared. I then proceeded to craft arrows made out of oak wood and sharpened rocks that I've been collecting I crafted my first arrow. I then continue to create more arrows as to which I knew it would soon save my life. Once spotting the bear I unholstered my bow cocked a arrow and pulled back as if my life depended on it. Naked the only thing I had besides the weapon was my backpack which was filled with all the materials that I've been collecting. I put manmade tar on the tip of my arrow sparkling black it was I put the excess tar back into my bag. I looked in the bag and pulled out a torch. I lit it from gun powder I've salvaged from an abandonded house near the shore I sparked the torch and lit the tip of my arrow on fire. I once again cocked back as hard as ever on my bow aiming it towards the bear while it sits eatting a carcass of what it seems to be a human. I closed my left eye my right eye focusing on my pray I let the arrow go. The firery arrow soaring threw the wind sparks flying off the of tip of the arrow. Bullseye. I hit the bear in the neck but it did not go down it was stunned.I quickly pulled back another arrow but this one was not on fire I projected it once more hitting the bear right in the middle of its ribs. It was mad. Myself being on top of a rock feeling secure and safe I cocked back another arrow thinking it would be the kill shot I let go once more striking the bear in the fohead. The bear running towards me ran up a 90 degree rock and slaughtered me. Thanks Rust for being glitchy as . ),Rust

2018-12-29,0,0,2483,False,Recommended,"Rust IS a ""survival game"" but its more like a ""Please for the love of god i hope that the zerg next door doesnt my stone 2x2 for stealing one of their kits."" In the aspect of ""survival"" i'd say it does a good job of giving that feeling of life or death because if you're running across the map to the desert and you're starving to death and you're just about to make it a wild bear attacks and mauls you to death. Pros Open world pvp different tiered areas of the map for different kinds of people i.e beginners intermediate veteran &lt essentially and even though its the same repetitive thing almost every single wipe it seems like it never really gets boring. After 2k hrs put into the game I still get on to play and enjoy it and i dont see myself stopping anytime soon. Cons Official servers are toxic hell holes for hackers and moderators are basically non existant except for community ran servers. EAC doesnt really seem to put the ""easy"" into the name except for the fact that its easy for hackers to bypass. In my entire time playing rust ive had ONE developer get on and strike down hackers going after my base. Keep in mind around 1500 of my 2000+ hours have been put into officials. Pros#2 Variable landscapes and procedurally generated maps bring new territory each and every wipe to battle in for resources. T3 pvp VS T1 pvp IT IS COMPLETELY DOABLE TO KILL AN AK GUY WITH A REV/CROSSBOW even though it may seem impossible thats what makes this game a chaotic beauty in all of its glory. Nakeds running around roleplaying geared guys and then using the eokas they've just accquired from a box to gun down an ak guy is a glorious sight. Cons#2 If you have over 6 people on your team your almost guranteed top dog spot on any server if any of the aforementioned players have reasonably decent skill. Zergs and clans KILL servers but I more than understand its part of the game. If a solo player is to make a play on one of the zerg memebers its almost guranteed destruction for that solo. A literal army will storm to their base and desecrate it instantly. This game isnt forgiving to the people who play in groups under 3 on no limit servers but if you are intending to do just that i reccomend LOTS of anal lubricant and tissues because it will probably be the most painful and upsetting time ever playing this game. Pros#3 So let me guess. You're saying to yourself now ""Amazon thats cool and all but what do i do with all this stuff? Ive already wiped half the map i have a box of aks and now my friends despawning all of the sulfur in the base because we are bored."" Now here is where the cool part comes in. *Poof* All of your pixels are gone. You're back on the beach at Thursday in the afternoon saying ""Where did all my stuff go????"" Servers wipe on different schedules usually no longer than a month in time so if you've had your fun for the wipe guess what? All of its gone and now you get to start right back where you were naked on the beach with your precious rock. Cons#3 Now that we've gotten basic gameplay out of the way lets talk about mechanics and man oh man do I have a lot to say. Please for the love of god change the night cycle. Believe me its cool at first how it creates a sense of urgency to get inside to stay protected but the novelty wears off. Night time is referred to as ""afk youtube time"" because essentially unless you want to find all the naked dbs waiting for you in the forest or to flash a flashlight to signal other players to come mow you down there is no literal point of night time. Especially since now that the game is 35 dollars&lt (Not at the moment) players shouldnt have to sit in their base for 15 minutes and waste time. And you might be saying to yourself ""But Amazon I saw this epic new Hjune life hack where if you turn up your gamma in the Nvidia settings you can see at night! Yeah thats cool and all but does it really work? I would say after extensive hours of testing my results say it just throw the settings back to what they were because it doesnt really matter. Second thing is SCIENTISTS. And good god are they broken. ""Man it looks like a nice day to go hit some nodes."" *Scientist hits cactus on accident*Combatlog Entity.114586763 player to you Old HP 100 Head 80.0m New HP 86.6Entity.114586763 player to you Old HP 86.6 Chest 100.0m New HP 56.7Entity.114586763 player to you Old HP 56.7 Head 150.0m New HP 0 woundedEntity.114586763 player to you Old HP 0 Head 150.0m New HP 0 killedNow if you want to go ahead and check that for validity do it i couldnt give to . But notice how after the body part injured it shows the distance of the shot and look at the distance. You might be saying ""Hmmm Amazon idk about that one how is that scientist shooting a PISTOL accurately from 150 meters?"" And i would say in response ""The monkeys at HQ are trying their best but idk helk wants killer robots everywhere. The newer cargo ship event is the only one with balanced scientists except for the occasional invicible scientist that is literally unkillable. But i understand that the coding for the boat is still a little wonky so im giving them leeway on that. Now lets talk about the big kahuna Military tunnels. Imagine its 2009 and youre playing mw3 on christmas day and you see survival mode. You click and see a couple enemies and you do em dirty and kill them. Ok neat right? Now imagine that on round 100 except before battle all of them sniff bath salts and have aim that would make Chris Kyles look like a shot. And not to mention they could stab med pens mid fight so yeah you may have headshot him 3 times but you can take that and throw it out the window because THESE BAD BOYS ARE SMART. These arent your typical COD dumb bots that suicide run towards you. These bad boys regroup they send scientist with spas shotguns towards you and the kicker they take cover. Did i also mention they can hear? And just incase you have the solution of crouching take it and shove it up yours because hearing doesnt matter when you can see in the DARK. Huh wish that I could see like that when its night time in rust. Recap of Pros V Cons / ConclusionIn all honesty most of these pros outweigh the cons even though i understated the pros. Rust is by far the most fun game ive ever played and has allowed me to meet a lot of great people. Despite the toxic community you can really meet some great people on this game even though the majority of the community paints it to be the ""worst""(kinda is lowkey)But in conclusion better buy it now because if i saw the price tag at 35 dollars i think i would rather burn my money for warmth than spend it on this game.

This game doesn't feel like a solo survival game you can but its REALLY hard.

Soon as I got it however I found that now they were changing the fundemendals of how the ""grinding"" of the game is supposed to work starting with the XP system (You've heard it a million times by now.) Perhaps this wasn't the game for me anyways It feels like too much of a time investment to grind during a server's wipe cycle just to get raided by a lifeless korean when I'm asleep. I'd keep an eye on it but I don't have the high hopes I used to.",Rust

2017-12-25,0,0,960,True,Recommended,In 2014 I joined Seattle 2 (sever). Built a wooden shack between two rocks and had a questionable relationship with my neighbour. I was running it on a macbook back then 20 fps at best. For the first hundred hours I didn't even know how the game worked. Ever since then my love hate relationship with rust began. I bought a gaming pc just for this game. After almost 200 hours of solo playing got my first AK formidable base and many memories.Made many friends who are still in close contact with me so many memories. Its as if each wipe is a lifetime so clear and nostalgic. Only if it wasn't for school and grades I would spend all day playing this amazing game. There is simply no competition. But Rust is grindy YOU WILL RAGE. I have come to the point where I am above average than many players. If you have the time and the energy BUY IT RIGHT NOW. But If you have other dedications stay away.So far Rust.,Rust

2017-07-23,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a (solo) multiplayer survival deathmatch kinda game. Its like all the other survival games To do list scaenga a lot of merials Build a base Find more meterials Build base better Defend base Get rolled over and begin from the start (maby) RepeatRust must have one of the most toxic player base ever it even exeds leage of legends and csgo.Overall its yet another survival base builder game but it has a specil charm to it. That its a multiplayer that every one can join and every one can kill every one (untill the server is full)It has a good comunication system so you only hear the ones that are somewhat close to you so you dot have to listen to those 10 year old children whos playing their faverite minecraft song.For being a early access game its running very shomothely and good. It could be a finished game but it isent. The game is easy to learn but its still a pain for new players. Its more fun when youve leard how to play and kinda got into it a bit more.Overall i would recomend if you like these kind of survival games and have someone to play with.Its kinda boring to play for yourself becouse if you dont have a frind to play whit you would just get rolled over by teamers and then its no fun.

2018-11-24,0,0,541,False,Recommended,It is really hard for me to recommend this one.Over my time of playing the game has changed for better or for worse. A new wave of players have entered in the past few months that only pvp no voice chat just kos. This rips the heart and soul out of this game for the human interaction and hilarious encounters are what made the endless grindfest fun. Now if you want to play Rust it's more terrifying than before because some chickenshit ucking 12 year old might just shoot you in the back of the head and teabag on your corpse while screaming into their mic. The toxicity is sometimes funny but now this is getting stupid. Another big problem that this game faces now is optimization. Frame rates randomly get as low as 30 fps because of all the graphical enhancements these s added that their engine can't handle. Not to mention that even people with mid high tier PCs are gonna have trouble running this game and one little lag spike could determine whether you lose all of the you grinded 4 hours for or if you stay alive and kill the miserable bastard trying to steal your In this game's state however I still have to recommend it. I have had countless good memories because playing with your friends and finding people on servers makes this experience 100% better. Though PVP is now a big focus due to Youtubers encouraging it and a toxic community many players still come in peace and want to trade or around while they play. This is what makes Rust so great. The endless grind can be ended by some stranger who just wants to be nice. And at the end of the day whether you are the one being betrayed or you are the backstabber WHO THE DOESN'T LOVE ING PEOPLE OVER. And that's what it's all about. A score out of 10 for this stupid game would probably be a 6/10 due to the decline of the community and optomization.,Rust
2019-01-04,0,0,1,False,Recommended,the modern standard of multiplayer survival games. can be extremely consuming. currently the only issue i see in the game is the lack of balance in regards to playing due to progression servers are reset very frequently leading to either playing a lot in a short period of time or not playing at all for a long time. however when you're feeling it rust delivers the perfect military survival gameplay.,Rust

2016-11-13,1,1,1094,True,Not Recommended,Overall a good game with real potential.However I can't recommend this game given the very misleading nature of it. I initially played this game looking for a survival experience which is definitely what I got on the surface. However when you dig deeper the survival elements of this game quickly fade into obscurity and what you're left with is this tribal PVP fest where the only objective is to blow up your neighors house and pump him full of bullets with no real rhyme or reason other than to do it for the hell of it. Not to mention survivng in the game is laughably easy once you've collected the trivial amount of resources it takes to make a house with a door on it.Overall if you want to farm resources for a couple hours just to purposelessy shoot others then this game for you. Otherwise I suggest playing CS GO or Overwatch if you just wanna kill people without all the grindign.,Rust

While I will not list all the things you can or cannot do in the game I will state the issue with the game. #1 The community. For the most part it is toxic. Not sure what it is with the newer generations(I come from pong days) but they expect the world most times. Hats off to the devs of this game as it is a top 10 game on Steam. I think this game in its state now is worth the money they are asking.

2018-06-25,1,1,265,False,Recommended,"After playing this game for soon to be 200 hours I decided to write a review on it. I will keep it as real as possible. If you buy the game you will get p1ssed off a ""couple"" of times you will most likely rage quit a ""couple"" of times aswell. The game can be extremely difficult at times especially if you are alone or if you are just new to the game. Even as a player with thousands of hours you are going to have hard times. But. This is what makes the feeling you get when you get your base up when you win that intense fight when you finally found that item you have been seraching for so long so good. As a new player I found the game a bit boring because I struggled to do things it's definitely not easy to win those fights and survive when you are new. After playing and progressing with my friend though I started to like it more and more. Even though we still lost most of the fights we were put against we still had fun and when we actually won a fight it would give us an awesome feeling. I truely think Rust is an amazing game infact I've actually been close to buying it for some of my friends a couple of times just so they can see how great the game really is. And I just have to mention the devs. The devs are incredible aswell. Update in the beginning of every month with new enjoyable stuff every single time the game is devoloping at a high rate and I feel like it stays fresh due to this. If you like PvP a bit of grinding playing with friends or solo (if you want more of a challenge) raiding base building and defending then this is a perfect game for you. You may not like it in the beginning due to getting stomped by others but with time you will start enjoying it more and more. I strongly recommend this game.Quick guide to building your first base (it can be harder then you think) To build an base you need a blue map looking item called Building plan. Put the item in your hotbar so that you are holding it. At the cost of some wood you can place very sensitive building parts. You place the building parts down with left click and by holding in right click you open up a menu that let's you choose which type of building part you want to place down. Start with placing down some foundations then place a doorway at the place you want the door to be and then build walls around the other sides and place down ""floor"" as ceiling. Now you will need to upgrade these building parts since they are really sensitive. Make a hammer aim at the part you want to upgrade and hold in right click. This opens a menu where you can choose what kind of material you want the part to be upgraded to. Start of by making it wood or stone if possible. Wood can be burnt down pretty easily so aim to upgrade your base to stone. Once you have upgraded everything so it's not the basic plywood type make a wooden door and a key lock. Place down the wooden door and place the key lock on it. Aim at the key lock and hold in right click this will open a menu and go click on ""make a key"". Only people with the key to your door will be able to open it. Note It's good to make a extra key so that if you die with one of them you can still open the door. There is still many more things that good to know so please spend some time looking on YT about tips for beginners how to make a base or just look at a famous youtuber. By watching him play you will start to pick things up.",Rust

When you close the game it shows that you are still playing it even after making sure that you have killed all Rust processes that you can find in the Task Manager.

Playing solo isn't that bad but you would need to find a desvent server for solo players otherwise you will get raided hard.

(this is also because any community servers with a group limit of 2 or 3 are dead lmao) but clans with 8+ members and geared 12 year olds with all the BPs will ruin any chance you have this is still hard even with 3 or 4 man groups. i'm not saying that a solo should be able to kill a 6+ group or clan but i'm saying that it should be more balanced not gonna go in depth with it for the sake of the review but if things related to groups/clans/zergs were balanced out (not combat things like you not being able to hear 8 dudes sneaking behind your base them being able to get enough sulfur to raid you in 20 mins while it takes you 20 mins to get set up at the minimum) then the game would be really great.tl drbecause of optimization issues and balancing issues (mostly related to clans/zergs) and the immense grind (varies a little depending on the server) i just can't say you'll have much fun for $35 the entire time.,Rust

2019-01-10,1,1,3670,False,Recommended,"Rust is the best game I ever played. It has the highest highs and the lowest lows and I think that is the equation to a perfect game. I've always thought Cod 4 was my favorite game for sure it used to be but this is it now. If you know nothing about Rust its a first person shooter with building and crafting involved like a COD/Minecraft. It's like Minecraft? n*gga that's all you had to say.You start out as a naked guy with a rock. And nothing else. And you craft your way up to the point where you have an enormous castle with rocket launchers and C4 and everyone fears you and they do fear you if you're the big guy in your little region of the map. The maps are often enormous and the servers are 200 300 the team sizes vary between server to server. When you die you lose all your sh*t but you respawn back in the same ongoing world. They wipe the servers on different schedules. Sometimes it's weekly sometimes it's monthly.There's basically a technology race going on in the game constantly. Where people are trying to acquire resources to research items like guns and armor and if you want an AK47 (best gun in the game) you gotta find one first and research it through the ingame interface with scrap metal.There's a level of tediousness to the game. 45 minutes of gathering metal scraps won't get you much scrap. For 3 days 6 of us worked for 2/300 hours to find an AK47 or kill someone who had it and we never got one. Nothing is in the same class as the AK47 it dominates everything else. It's a full automatic assault rifle whereas the tiers below it are submachine guns and semi automatic rifles. If somebody sees you and their rocking their AK and you've got your SMG..they melt you in what seems like a fraction of a second. It has a very difficult to control recoil pattern it's a very difficult gun to use but it's definitely the best gun in the game. Numbers is very important. Early on we could use numbers to rush people with longbows even if the guy had a handgun we'd mow him down with archery fire and we'd take his handgun. We didn't always have 6 people online and there's a lot of grinding a lot of mining for resources killing people and taking their resources and you get random junk like screws and nuts and bolts and you have to take it to a recycling place and putting it in this machine and press go and then it makes a loud noise that people will come to.There are nerve racking periods where your heart is absolutely pounding because so much is at stake. Hours of work are at stake on a regular basis. Nighttime is pitch black you can't even see your own hand. If you have a torch you're a beacon to everyone around you.I'm pretty good at negotiating with people ingame and bartering with them and becoming allies with people on the server. People spawn naked so it's easy to tell when someone isn't a threat when they're naked. It's important to setup your base in the right area. The map is like 4 5 different biomes there are snowy areas desert areas wooded areas tropical areas. The resources are stone metal sulfur and wood. And they're plentiful. If you're in the forest there's more trees if you're in the mountains there's more rock. The real thing people do is once you get to a certain level you don't chop trees anymore you kill people and take their trees. Once you become the bully you become the guy everyone fears like you roll out with 6 AK47s and kill anyone you see you take their loot. Instead of chopping trees for an hour and getting 20 000 wood you kill one guy and you get his wood in 5 minutes. You become the guy who takes from others a warlord essentially. There's a snowball effect that is rapid if you're doing that sort of thing.There are missions in the game cards you find randomly blue green red you go on a quest and solve a puzzle and you get a lot of loot.When you run around naked in this world you find different types of individuals. Sometimes you can run up to somebody and be like ""Hey! You can have my torch and rock if you'd like em but I'm just going that way kill me if you want but I'm just going that way."" and sometimes they'll be like ""Nah man need some food?"" when indeed I do need some food because I'm literallly starving.I need me 8 men. 8 nerdy nolife men. We're gonna be doing one thing and one thing only killing nakeds. If you're out there I'm looking for people who are good at PVP. I need 2 4 guys that are good at PVP and know high level base design. I don't want some people who are going to play for 2 hours a day... if you can't put in an 8 hour shift it's probably not going to work. And you need to be 18 years or older because I don't play with children unlike some people twitch.tv . No offense to anybody. I'm looking for some grown up men (or women) who are into this game who are good at PVP and know what's up. We want to start up on a freshly wiped server and we want to grind hard with 6 8 men and own our corner of the map. I don't like being bullied by my ing neighbors.I've been biting my tongue about the minecraft parallels but they're there. It's exactly like minecraft factions which is a gamemode we ran and then the idea of the amount of time and effort you put into it is huge. I lived this for years I know all about this. Parallels all over we all agree it's exactly like minecraft factions but it has an updated aesthetic. It's what minecraft should've been because minecraft was described as cringy for years especially right when I was exiting and its like ""cringy? aww man"" but I get it. It's also the ingame player groups is quite young in that whereas a lot of grown men play rust. There's a lot of roleplayers too weird incestuous homosexual and S&amp M type relationships that go down in these servers. There's a lot of calling each other daddy BTW.Different ingame specialties come across these games too like ""hey I need a guy that can do this mind numbing task for 12 hours. You don't need much talent you're the scrap metal souvenir hunter and that's your job you get to be on our team despite the fact that you suck at video games if you're willing to do that. If anyone is out there and you really have a lot of time if you just flunked out after your Fall term and you don't really have a plan for January we're looking for a guy who enjoys finding scrap metal in Rust. I need a guy to mine sulfur for me for 15 hours a day. If you're willing to work 12 hours a day for me mining sulfur we might be able to find some monetary compensation for a guy like that. I might pay you actual cash for sulfur if you're willing to put in 12 hours a day. every. single. day. and mine sulfur for me.",Rust

2018-02-10,0,0,573,False,Not Recommended,This is a great game concept and I've been playing for about a year now. However the game is geared against solo players and casual gamers to the point where only those who are unemployed or are cheating through aim assist wall hacks or gamma hacks have a chance at the game. The grind in this game is hours long and can be rewarding if you are lucky. However if you play the game like you are supposed to and gather resources you are rewarded by a group of g fuel soaked neckbeards taking what you have on you and then using their collective power to wipe your base from the map. No matter how skilled you are in terms of gunplay or the hours of grinding that you put in unless you are backed up by a squad don't expect to enjoy the gameplay. However if you do have a posse that can get online whenever you are feel free to pick up this game now in alpha. I'm sure that you'll really enjoy the game in addition to the toxic atmosphere that has been established within it due to the alterations to mechanics that make pvp entirely predominant over social interactions.,Rust

2017-06-11,1,1,17,True,Recommended,"So I logged onto rust expecting a good time picked up a rock started hitting trees. Like you do. Not 10 minutes in I hear some collegefratboyesque voices yelling ""look a criminal!"" followed by gunshots and laughter. Naturally I creep closer and as I do two very white sounding men find and execute more ""criminals"" or thats what I gathered from their conversation. I stumble upon them just in time to see the two execute another black ""criminal"". I in rust am black. I watch in horror for approximately one minute as the two discuss how much safer they are making the world. Suddenly one turns slightly towards me and shouts ""Another criminal!"" Before I realize whats happened I'm lying on the floor screaming. Both in the game because I have been shot and IRL because the screaming noise is so loud my headphones are filling with blood. So I respawn collect 200 wood am walking down the path bare black on display. Whoosh. Bullet in the head. Then some 8 year old kid appears in an ironman suit says something unrepeatable about an unlikely anatomical configuration robs me of all 200 wood and my viriginity and leaves me listening to that god awful screaming noise as I slowly bleed out. So I respawn collect 150 wood. Dead. Repeat. Now I should mention that in addition to being black I have a how shall I put it ""painfully average"" The inability to change this is just maddenning. And yes that's the point of the game to teach the important lesson that no one can help the way they are born (female black male small penised) and that there is no sense in being racist or sexist. However I rather enjoy my white privilege IRL and whoever thought playing black man simulator would be fun was sorely mistaken. But thats not to say being white will save you from the brutality of the rust community oh no! Not even whiteymcwhiteface with a 2 foot dong can avoid the raving hordes of 8 year old neo nazis and 40 year old men w/o jobs who rule U.S. East servers. But thats not just specifc to Rust.",Rust

2015-06-02,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,Why you should buy this game The idea of running around naked unable to defend yourself while looting barrel after barrel after barrel for hours while dodging no lifers with rifles with no other choice if you want to even think about competing is somehow appealing to you. You like having your base raided while you are offline by no lifers who wait for you to log. Assuming you can even get one started on any server with a decent population. Cosmetic updates are more important to you then implementing fundamental gameplay mechanics and fixing balancing issues and you enjoy reading developer blogs about the same. You like seeing unimplemented basic survival mechanics such as thirst while seeing a thirst bar in your UI that does nothing. Chickens which drop wolf meat because they haven't implemented any other meat type are your priority but not for comedic reasons.You enjoy massive well coordinated base raiding with fair rules and outcomes. Oh wait those videos are completely staged on private servers with gentlemens rules in place and heavily modded. Don't buy this game if you want those things it's not actually something that happens very frequently and there is nothing in the game to support it.You are part of a large clan from some other game and are bored waiting for your current game to release a major update. You should get about a week of entertainment making other peoples lives miserable until you all realize how broken and unbalanced the gameplay is and regulate the game to the depths of your abandoned Steam library. To be honest however H1Z1 is better and will probably give you some custom game skins too.You are interested in getting started with game development yourself and want an interactive tour of the Unity asset store.Unregulated servers with admins who will spawn their friends C4 to mess up your base now matter how good it is and hackers getting the scraps is what you seek in a game.If you had a job where you could freely choose to work on fun stuff and ignore all the boring things for YEARS would you do the boring things sometimes just because they needed to be done? The development team behind Rust including Garry would not. Don't buy the Early Access excuse it's just laziness + not giving a toss. There are much better and complete survival games with less development time on Steam worth your time and money. Check out Arc for example its a little rough and buggy but it looks better and has more involved gameplay after just 7 months in development then Rust has had in several years.Update Its been said around social media that Garry has officially moved on from Rust personally. Keep that in mind before you go slinging him more money.,Rust

2019-01-11,0,0,700,False,Recommended,I absolutely love this game with a passion. If this game isn't for you you are a terrible Journalist.This game is constantly updated fixed and tinkered with.

2018-07-11,0,0,488,False,Recommended,"I have to change my review. I had a pretty negative review initially and stopped playing Rust for quite some time. However after giving it another chance I have to say Rust is one of the best games I've ever played. It is a REALLY hard game but if you can get past that you will really start to enjoy it. Additionally I think it's important to find a server or server type that you enjoy playing on as that will really add to the experience. I've been really enjoying playing on Savas which is a King of the Hill type of server. It is extremely difficult and can be incredibly frustrating but the server is extremely fast paced and makes it much easier to make huge plays and have constant fun than a vanilla server. However there are players that enjoy the grind of gathering resources building bases getting blueprints and eventually going on raids on a vanilla server. And other players like playing on modded for an easier gameplay but still have the overall legitmacy of Rust. There's a lot of negative reviews for Rust and I think a lot of that is due to the fact people don't give it enough chance or they don't explore the different servers and options of the game. I previously had a negative review and even wanted to refund the game I really hated it that much ... but giving it another chance and exploring other services and new options has really made Rust fun again. Rust is unlike any other game you will ever play. It's viciously unforgiving brutally frustrating and can be downright cruel. However the feeling of success in this game is unlike any other it is so thrilling and gives you such an adrenaline rush that it makes you want to play for hours on end.I would most definitely reccomend this game but I would urge any new players to keep an open mind and avoid getting frustrated earlier on while learning the game. The Rust community can be extremely ""toxic"" although you will quickly find out you too will become ""toxic"" once you get your hands on some guns loot and gear. The toxicity comes from the fact that this game is so brutal and cutthroat that you learn you can't trust anybody no matter how much you may want to. That naked that you just gave a revolver to help him get started? He's probably plotting to shoot you in the back and go deep on your base. That noob that was crying about how he keeps getting killed so you gave him some starter loot to get a base down? A couple days later and he's probably planning to raid your base. And that's what makes Rust so awesome it's very realistic to what it would be like if there was an actual Fallout. The game is incredibly cutthroat brutal vicious yet very very rewarding.tl dr explore the endless options and servers Rust has to offer. Find out what type of Rust game you are solo duo group clan etc. Do your best not to get frustarted afterall it's only game! And cherish your success and moments of victory because they will probably be shortlived by the goals of other players.Let's stray away from the overall gameplay / community expereince and talk about the performance of the game itself. Not many people give Rust enough credit for how breathtaking the graphics are on this. To put it blunt Rust's graphics and animations are simply amazing. I have never played a game with so much attention to detail. Once you open the game for the first time you will understand what I mean. Furthermore the dev's have done an incredible job at staying dedicated to improving the game. FPS and Ping continue to get better everyday lag is reducing despite massive amounts of players on a single at one day and there are constant updates with cool additions like outpost cargo ship bandit camp new guns new gear tanks hot air balloons scopes and so so much more.",Rust

2019-02-02,0,0,276,False,Recommended,Rust is everything Arma 2 DayZ Epoch used to be back in 2013 however the threat of zombies and PvE elements is absent the possibility of dying to something like a wolf or bear quickly becomes nonexistent once you get any weapon above a spear.This results in hyperactive PvP something that can be hard to get used to for casual players. Speaking of casual players playing this game solo is NOT a fun experience by any means unless you're naturally good at the PvP side of things but even then it's quite an unfair uphill battle. If you wish to play this game solo I usually pick a server with literally zero players and play the game for what it is doing the key card puzzles raiding the cargo ship etc. However all the rewards from said activities are mostly meant to be used in PvP so it's kind of pointless.If you do have friends to play with this game can be quite fun in a trio group on a medium low pop server with 3x resources. It allows you to reap all the rewards of playing while still having competition with the players around you. The vanilla servers while fine can be quite a grind for a casual player so I'd recommend a modded server for an easier start.Now one of my complaints would be spawn killing half the time you spawn you find yourself getting chased down despite them knowing you have nothing on you except a rock. The problem is you actually do have stuff on you in the form of animal fat. Facepunch has made players a harvestable resource meaning mowing down nakeds is suddenly an actual way to play in order to gain the upper hand. In my opinion I don't like this it takes the idea and humanity of you running into another survivor like yourself out of the equation.Back during the days of DayZ Epoch if you ran into a player an intense and fun standoff would be the result no one wants to die and no one wants to shoot as it attracts powerful zombies around you this means players are forced to either run gamble or reason with the other player I actually made a lot of friends from these situations. But in Rust as this strong PvE threat is absent you don't get these cool and intense situations you just get mindless killing and kids screaming.So despite my seemingly constant complaints throughout this review why do I still recommend this game? Well the flaws I've mentioned come from me comparing the game to something like DayZ Epoch but Rust as it's own game runs and plays pretty well. If you can get past the seemingly infinite loading times that is. The building is balanced however I think raiding needs a bit of a minor nerf the addition of more NPC events as of late is a great feature which adds much more to the game the combat is fast paced and fun and overall the game is a fun experience.7/10 Would recommend if you have one or two friends and a lot of time to kill,Rust

2019-02-02,0,0,449,False,Not Recommended,A very well polished survival game that's capable of literally making your heart race and hands tremble but not because of zombies or bears no because of other people. This game can be a you vs. the world kind of game where you can build craft and survive against a wide variety of things from radiation and the cold to terrifying scientist NPCs bears and the occasional kid shouting the N word into his mic at the top of his lungs.That's right this is one of those games that can either be fantastic and satisfying making bases progressing and making friends building a team. Or you could have a complete garbage experience with the overwhelming negativity and one of the most toxic communities to have ever existed. Game can be great but any rust player could tell you it's 90% toxicity and having a bad time. Why do you people bother playing then you ask? Well because of the highs you can get from high adrenaline intense moments and finally revenge killing and raiding that annoying 12 year old who keeps calling everyone a f*ggot a** b*tch. Don't buy it if you prefer enjoyment over raw emotion.,Rust

2019-01-28,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,"Great game but an atrocious community.I really wanted to like this game. I did quite a bit of research before buying. I'd heard of the community being toxic but I've also heard that recently the community has improved because toxic players have moved on and the core demography of the game are serious players. I watched YouTube videos and did not see the trouble ahead.Now before the fan bois start the trope of L2P let me just say that I've played FPS for quite some time. When I came into Rust I began in an empty procedural map to get my bearings. I moved on after learning about the environment to the regular servers where all the griefing started.That's what this game is a non stop grief fest. New players are not allowed the indulgences of 'learning to play"" when they are indiscriminately killed as a naked by a much more geared player and robbed of the sparse amount of materials the player has collected between his last murder scene. I was still in very close proximity to the beach as I know the more you venture inland the more you risk being killed by OP players.As an example I had spawned in my bag after having been killed for harvesting wood with a stone axe with an arrow shot while I was gathering. I did not have the materials to build another axe as I was missing the stone. I had already used most of what I had upgrading 1 portion of my 1x2 at a time where I was about 1/2 way done with the 1x2. So I set out to find some more stone. On a hill overlooking the ocean I found a node and began to harvest after having checked my area for any other players. Having to use the rock it took some time and someone heard my rock smashing in the distance and followed the sounds. I was almost done when I was shot in the back of the head with a crossbow. As a new spawn I had low health and was practically starving so I was immediately knocked down. The murderer came up and I spoke to him. I said ""Come on man? I was just killed a few minutes ago and all I'm trying to do is gather some stone."" He replied in a voice that sounded very pleased with himself ""What would you need stone for?"" (He was not a kid) His response triggered a bit of salt in my next response which was ""Are you really that fu %! &amp lazy that you have to kill naked's instead of gathering for yourself?!"" He was barely holding back laughter as this salt is EXACTLY what he wanted and said ""Yeah I guess I am that lazy!"" I told him it is players like him that are ruining the game. He actually chuckles and says ""Am I? Well don't mind me. I'm just going to let you lie there and bleed out while I finish gathering this stone."" I wanted to tell him what a hero he was with his armor and crossbow to plague new players who are just trying to get started but I died and my microphone went off. He probably would have picked me up if I'd told him how awesome he had played against an opponent who had no gear with his back turned but alas I told him the truth and died as he ran away with everything I had.I could tell you of how I then decided to team up with a group and the first thing the group leader does is to jump on top of my head. I asked him why he was doing this and looked up to see him tea bagging me. I told him that it was immature and stupid to which he begins to graphically tell me how far his big black d! % was down my throat and how much I secretly loved it. (This was a teenager of 15 16) I immediately quit the team and he started saying he was only kidding and what a baby I was. They wanted to kill me for leaving the group but another member told them to just let me go and he told me I should never come back. I could tell you of the roof campers and door campers and the ROE of shoot on sight quite a few of the seasoned players have enough that my average lifespan was less than 10 minutes unless I found a completely deserted part of the map. Even the other naked's were more intent on smashing my head with a rock than to gather for themselves.It seems the only way to survive in this game is to murder or be murdered. I don't think this was Gary's vision but it is a true representation of how people will devolve in the absence of rules. Apparently anything goes except for kindness or civility.I understand this is a PVP game but if new players are crushed 5 minutes into the play and all their effort is stolen what incentives do I have to return except to do the same to someone else? This self perpetuating griefing system will only result in more griefers and less people looking for a survival game who are not intent on joining the ranks of the low life thinking they are bad asses by attacking someone with zero risk to themselves. Giddy in the fact someone has rage quit and snickering when called on how low down they truly are. Threatening to kill you for not tolerating their stupidity?I logged off the server and went back to the procedural map in peace without the toxic players and I enjoyed the game again. I bought ""The Forest"" now as it seems the single player aspect is my only recourse because people lose their minds when it's a game and anything goes. I have played Rust for only 27 hours but the real community showed it's ugly head in far less time than that. I will absolutely not miss the griefers.",Rust

2019-02-02,1,1,104,False,Not Recommended,"On first sight this seems to be a nice survival game. But what kills it for me are some game elements which makes this game extremly unfair. This game is a vicious circle. If you want to sacrifice a lot of time and at the end of day being robbed all your stuff or you have a criminal attitude and feel happy from robbing other people then this game is for you.1) There are regulary supply drops that contains high level automatic weapons ammo explosives armour defensive systems and armored building elements. &gt 2) The one who gets this equipment first will dominate the game/server. So a few high equipted people will definitely get also the next drop and the drop after the next. Also they will be able to play in endgame areas and farm endgame weapons. Also they will control the access to this areas. &gt 3) As a new player on the server it is unlikely to compete against the better equipted players because every encounter will end in your death and your equipment robbed. The best weapon you can craft is a crossbow. Against automatic weapons (from the drops) you just can't win not even by suprise. Also it's very unlikely to find better equipment in regular areas. &gt 4) So you are damned to stay on low level and farm your off and hope to get better with more resources and maybe one lucky discovery eg. a low level firearm with high recoil and comparable low shooting distance. This can take dozens of hours. But nevertheless even with firearms you will be killed and robbed because you can't win a fight against players with better armor. &gt 5) Blueprints. At firstyou need the item eg. a firearm or bullet. Then you must research it into a blueprint. (Item will be deestroyed.) Now you can craft it. But if you can't get an item you wil not be able to craft it. &gt 6) Base raiding. A central element of this game. Basically destroying the house of an other player and steal all his stuff. To be able to destroy stone walls and metal doors you need explosives. But guess who raids and who will be raided? The one with the crossbow who farms tons of material but still without being able to improve (see 2 3 4 5)? Or the one with the explosives (see 1)? Try to imagine you don't have much online time but in the availible time you have farmed your off. Someday you login and all you got have been stolen or destroyed. PS There is something called ""wipe"". So even on friendly PvE servers all your progress will be wiped after one month or less. Waste of time.",Rust

I Personally prefer the vanilla settings of the game it offers the most fun balance for farming and trying to reach the highest teir of equipment for rading.However I have found that the experiance is very much dependant on community on the server which you choose to play on. Alot of the servers have enviorments that have forced people to kill any one at any time. Simply because you cannot trust anyone.. Not even freshspawns,Rust

2017-12-20,0,0,1429,False,Recommended,The game itself is a concept of its own even though there have been tons of survival games this one is currently in my preference the best. So to start off if your able to find a group of people to play with or atleast a solo only server its fair and balanced. They have recently updated group limits a lot on servers so it can make it easier to find servers without zergs. They have found an effective cheat detection so hackers get banned quickly and easily. The game is fun you can get mad but something always brings you back to play it. At the start the learning curve is sharp and if you havent watched any videos explaining how the game works or at least the basics of the game it might seem complex or inconceiveable however the controls are simplistic and its easy to get a grasp on the game mechanics.

2019-02-06,0,0,423,False,Not Recommended,Having started out playing games on the Atari like pong as a kid and then progressing from there I can say without a doubt that Rust is the single most TOXIC game ever E V E R past or future. This game has the largest concentration of sweaty haven't showered or slept in days while playing virgin filled screaming profanity pubescent crap throwing male teens and to top it off its a grindfest that puts all the power in the hands of the jobless no girlfriend crowd so of course it attracts them like moths to a light. Finding those 1% of players who were older and joining together on a Trio server was pretty fun but it felt like you had to encase yourself in lead away from the outside world as much as possible stepping inside of your base feels like stepping inside a saferoom after closing the door in Left 4 Dead. Just too grindy and too unfriendly for me to recommend although modded servers were more fun even when you really get to just combat you realize theres games that just do that better. If your a young male with a lot of free time on your hands and love to talk trash with your buddies and build this is your game for everybody else naw.,Rust

2019-02-10,0,0,490,False,Recommended,If you have anger problems or any stress related issues you are going to have issues with this game the player Base is more toxic than a nuclear meltdown and being offline raided all the time will take you to a point of therapy. However this game is fantastic and so addictive as a survival game it's perfect as a pvp game it's very good as a farming game you can't complain but as a social interaction experience it lacks mainly.due to the toxic players but you can get past that eventually. Just be ready to die over and over again. Good luck and I highly recommend this game. See you on the beaches!,Rust

2018-02-21,0,0,3752,False,Recommended,Well after over 2.5k hours in game here is my review. For all the time i ve been playing rust i ve been enjoying the game because of the strong feeling it leaves. These feelings re not every time possitive but still storng because you know how hard you had to work to get the gear u re roaming with and every time when you re fighting these feelings re here. There is fear of losing gear but also need to rule the island and show dominance and nevertheless greed that makes you lose more than you could possibly get. Since i ve been playing rust it was about the new beginings. Every failure moves you forward to achieving your dream. But last weeks i feel like new beginings re harder than ever before when u have to farm 15k scrap in two days to make that full gear and ak and then u got offlined. And then you have to face a decision whether to start again and farm all that scrap again or keep playing on a server where u actually dont want to play. To sum up I feels like the game was a bit more interesting before bps it wasnt that grind event the hq amounts form scrapping were higher and if u thing that then there wasnt early game my early game now is about a one hour after a bp wipe.,Rust

2017-12-24,1,1,1700,False,Recommended,This is my current review i currently have 1.5k hours and wow just as a game without the cumunity this game is very good the best it has been in years. But the community is the worst it has been but all in all I currently love this game. I would reccomnend playing on a 1.5x or 2x because it still feels like vanilla but its a bit easyer to get started. The devs of this game are amazing and I dont have many critisizms exept for two things. The first thing is that I think the current system (BP System) needs a bit of tweaking because since it came out it has had very little tweaking and I think it needs some also if you are thinking about being in a zerg (large group of people with low skill who depend on pure numbers) dont. My seccond critisizm is to bring back small official server. I really miss them.I dont know how to get started with this besides the fact that this is the best game on the planet but it is brutal twords new players if your new to this game and want to get started heres a tip dont refund it just keep it and keep trying. i have 450 hours in this game and have only have it for 5 months or a bit more all i can say is if you have the money buy this game if not save for itEdit so how do i start in the past few months rust has been through its worst updates ive ever seen for a few things i can name off the componet sysetem is gone. so you have to be in a clan or play this as a full time job next i used to just through out ak's like they were nothing but now i treat the worst gun in the game like a god. rust has changed and not in a good way you either be in a clan. or get out. (also i know have 1.1k hours in the game)#bring back the componet systme,Rust

2015-10-05,6,62,2697,True,Not Recommended,Disclaimer I have had RUST before it came out on steam more than two years ago in Closed Alpha. I was heavily into base raiding and PVP. If you plan on playing in carebear PVE servers skip this review. But here are my two cents about its current status otherwise. Take it with a grain of salt if you will... Yes The developers are more active now than ever.Yes The Developers add pointless content.Yes It gets frequent content updates.Yes Game's a blast when playing with a group.Yes Graphics are looking more spectacular now than ever.No The game has good performace.No The Developers are fixing issues that need fixing.No Glitching/hacking still exists. (It's just the nature of this type of game more on that later)No Game feels like a clunky mess after being rebuilt numerous times. (It was very responsive originally.)No Janky new mechanics are a hindrance in a situation where you need to be responsive against other players.No The game is STILL in Alpha Early access after two years. (Not unusual if you look at DayZ but still.)No Updates are slowly transitioning towards content only updates with less and less technical updates from Garry. (Which is what this game needs in my opinion more on that below.) With that being said the two biggest issues is that the game has been rebuilt from the ground up constantly and the hacking/glitching issues. 1. The updates seem to get worse. At the begening the updates seemed to fix bugs add cool content and help performace. Yet now it seems that every update breaks the game for a few days until another patch comes out to fix the last patch. The developers just got lazy They used to update on a weekly bases and have the same issues so they did a poll and despite people wanting them to stay on a weekly bases they decided that they will go on a bi weekly bases. They said this would stop the annoying hot fixes and enabe them to add more content in each patch. Yet take last weeks update as an example (Dev patch 80) they added almost nothing to the game said the performace would increase (Yet most people didn'y experience any change) and managed to make the game unplayable for many (crashes) and not fun for many more. They broke much of the game with bugs and when a hotfix came out it broke a core feature of the game. They made a bug which made spawning inside your base (aka sleeping bags in your base) impossiable which in a game like this is big. That would be like if a COD patch came out that made you unable to reload. There bi weekly updates have not done anything to help and if anything made things worse as it game the team more time to slack. Aswell if you look at the dev vlogs it seems that every week there is at least one member taking a week off and with a dev team of like 15 people that takes a toll. 2. The game used to be responsive though with the introduction of each rebuild it turned into a more and more unresponsive mess. Movement and responsiveness are huge factors in a game where aiming and positioning are the two most important things when PVP comes into play. This leads to unsatisfying deaths feeling like your character should be moving one way but turned out to be kind of glued into a certain spot. More often than not the game looks like a testing ground for Garry to practice his coding the game worked as is initially and now too much time was spent redoing the entire thing just for it to look nicer and feel smoother. 3. The developers are starting to slack on the things that matter. Despite 70% of the community complaining about slow performance the developers seem to be focused to much on adding useless content to the game. I personally am able to run Battlefield 4 on high setting and get a descent 39 49 fps usually stick around 45 and run Skyrim with ultra settings lots of visual improvement mods and 2k textures with 60fps. Yet in this game I have every setting turned all the way down to the point where the game looks like an ugly blurry mess of a game that would have been released in the 90's and only able to achieve a horrible 16 24 fps. With a game like this fps is important and yet when the developers say they are doing a performance update personally I have not seen a change in fps. in order to run this you need a beast of a PC that should run Battlefield 4 on ultra settings at a fps of 60+. 4. With hacking and glitching overall It's hard to blame Facepunch Studios on this one as they have taken a lot of measures to prevent hacking and glitching but it's such a huge issue in these types of games. You can't stop someone who constantly works against you in coming out with paid/private hacks when they have a price incentive for customers who are willing to skip the games week grind if it means killing a top tier base and being at the 'end game' instantly along with having the edge and never dying. Dying and losing your stuff is a huge net loss both morally and game wise.Find a hacker in CS GO? Report him and move on you only wasted 30 minutes of your time and you most likely never see him again. Hackers in DayZ/RUST? Your entire weeks worth of work is down the drain. With all the anti cheat improvements RUST is the type of game where even one hacker/glitcher getting through can ruin the game for an entire server. Though with the type of game its hard to even identify one granted if you're offline and your stuff is just gone with the doors/walls still up you'll have no person to point at. Even with wallers/aimbotters it's hard to tell with no spectate option unless you get shot in the head 5 times instantly. But a game such as this can't be expected to have a spectate option. Like I said its just the nature of this type of game. I expect this to be in Alpha for another two year honestly if it ever leaves Early Access is another question entirely. I honestly can't recommend a purchase at this point knowing that the formula is said and done and if you're looking for a game like RUST then there are others way ahead of the curve. I feel like a games experience shouldn't come down to an admin trying to police a server which is what happens here. The game itself should be designed with preventative features like that in mind. Games like these apply a human band aid in the form of admins who can be more often than not biased and given/give special treatment though its hard to argue when you own the server. Still the thought of an in game admin is archaic and should be left in the past along with the games that lacked proper mechanics that required a person to log in and manage a game. All in all I feel like the game just isn't worth it. The current direction its headed reminds me of ARK SE which isn't a bad thing but ARK SE already got there first. Even worse is that Facepunch Studios is working on the next Garry's Mod which means Garry will focus his time on the next project and leave this one up to his community managers and content staff to finish up the main bits while he adds a shiny new effect here and there. For all old rust players out there reading the game was a definite blast when it first came out. Now it's just a complete mess of a project trying to play catch up after struggling to redefine the game so many times. For new rust players skip this one and go for another game in the genre.,Rust

2015-05-02,1,8,645,True,Recommended,I am seeing a lot of negative reviews on this game and I wanted to say a few words to people on the game. I have over 500 hours of gameplay at the moment and I am still currently playing it. This game is a hardcore survival game and I do mean hardcore. Most people you encounter will in fact kill you even if you are a fresh spawn carrying a rock. However theirs ingame voip which allows you to communicate with other players and actually talk your way out of being murdered and having your precious rock being stolen ) You farm wood and ore and start up a base then you fortify it slowly. You can also craft weapons gear and explosives but only if you spend hours searching for the blueprints after that you start raiding other bases and killing people. I have played at least a 1/3 of my hours alone and still had a blast so soloing is possible. Overall this game is a time sink and you will be looking at the clock wondering where the time went. If you are a hardcore survival fanatic then this game is a must buy.,Rust

When I started the game a red font came up and didn't show any servers so I searched up so much videos and read up so much fixes for rust it took me around like 5 6 hours to find a fix it did fix after all that hardwork.

2016-08-12,0,0,40,True,Not Recommended,I just got this game. What these games have a problem with is as a new player joining an established server you never have a chance to enjoy it. you grind for an hour to get stuff and just when you feel like you are acomplishing something some jerk comes along and shoots you in the head. Then you have no gear and have to start the process over again. It is just a excercize in frustration not fun at all.THe other thing is that this is supposed to be a multiplayer game but it doesnt encourage grouping up or helping at all. it feels more like a one on one PVP game.,Rust

2017-06-24,0,0,182,True,Recommended,I saw the reviews for rust and I thought cool ima buy this! After getting the game I went to some community server I had no idea what I was doing walking around naked with a rock.Then I saw another player! I was excited to talk to him then he shot me with his bow. Damn.After resawning I got some wood and stone and built my wooden 'house'. I decided to leave my house to go explore. When I came back all my stuff was taken. DamnAfter some hours of rebuilding and locking my house some guy stabbed me! DAMMIT!! I begged the guy to not steal my stuff because I was new. Luckily he revived me and taught me how to build a badass house and how to get the good He was a fun guy he stayed in my shack for awhile but then he had to continue his own adventures so I waved him goodbye and wished him luck.After a more hours when I had bows and stuff there were other new players who had moved in my area. I wanted to shoot them but I remembered my saviour so I decided to accept them and we created a settlement for the new players of rust.Everything was great! But... The raiders came. They took everything. They shot down our houses and killed everyone! Now everyone is dead or left.10/10 would lose everything again.,Rust
2014-01-05,0,0,32,True,Recommended,"Think ""Minecraft with better graphic"" and you've got a pretty good idea of what this game offers in gameplay.Making a review about a game which is in Alpha is not an easy thing to do since many things can change for either better or worse. But as it is the game is enjoyable to play with friends. But I'll try to make a review anyways.Many a good thing can be said about it the graphics are pretty even beautiful some times. The crafting system is easy to understand and easy to do and within the first hour you've got a house to live in if you're on the right server that is. Weapons food tools all these can be crafted but for some of these items you need a permenant house where you can craft it using furnace and workbence. Just like in Minecraft.However where you might think you're safe when you log out like in DayZ or Minecraft here your character can still be kill looted and your home destroyed. This makes the game more interesting since now building a house won't be enough but you'll have to think about where to build it. This makes you carefully consider where to build and where to gather resources since the world necessarily isn't a friendly place. The amount of wildlife is interesting with Bears and Wolfs to be respectful of and Deer and wild Pigs to actively hunt for food and skin. The wildlife is a danger in its own right. Bears and wolfs stalk the forest and fields and will hunt a player regardless if hungry or not. Along with these zombies both slow and fast will hunt a player aswell. However as enjoyable this game is there are some problems which isn't surprising since this is an Alpha of the game and there are sure to be many more things to be added later on. However I can put out a list to say what I personally want to be in the game and what should be changed.Though the graphics are very good the ocean texture is the worst I've seen in a long time. I would never go near the ocean to watch the moon rise or the sun set with water looking as unnaturally as it does in this game.The crafting and gathering of material from the natural resources which actively spawn in semi random locations there are things that could be done to improve these features. It's way too easy. Metal ore and Sulphur ore along with stone is way too easy to gather. Pick up a stone and you've got it going. Along with the too easy gathering making weapons and is too easy. Within the first two days you're running around with guns and as soon as that's done one doesn't feel in danger from zombies or animals.As for the enviroment itself. As it is it ain't complete. The area is scarcely big enought for 40 let alone 100 players it ain't big enough. Bigger enviroments with a more complete wildlife would make this game so much better. A complete wildlife with herbivours and predators a complete foodchain would make the game not only more enjoyable but the impact it would have on the players would make people question every situation they're in. Should one try and take out a Bear for a already dead pig or should one wait for the pack to move on to see if there is any leftovers. The competition between players and other predators would make a deep impact and created a heavier situation for the players when confronted by other players. As for the predators already in the game they aren't fearful enough. One comes across a wolf or a bear you can outrun it. Nothing fanzy just sprint. But a bear is strong enough to kill a man with one hit and a wolf is way faster than a man. If the game is about realistic surviving a post apocalytic world with radiationposioning a constant threat the wildlife should have a deeper impact. As for the prey they are too easy to hunt and kill. One can sneak all the way up to a deer and land the first blow before it runs from you. Though I know improving the wildlife isn't high on the priority list and knowing that it wouldn't be implementet out of the seare computer power needed to run the game. It is an interesting thought and a thought I hoped realized in the near future in a survival game.As for this survival game I enjoy it. And if one loves the thought of the general survivormode or have played DayZ or Minecraft before they'll find this to be an enjoyable game aswell. )",Rust

Since they released the XP system you have to farm so hard to get to end game crafting.The game was great before the xp system you didnt have to play so hard to get some were. Ofcourse the BP system was unbalanced but it made it possible for working people to enjoy the game with out farming the life away.I Loved this game the best game in a while but now the devs are destroying the game slowly. It makes me sad.I would not reccomend this game during the current state 23/12 16 Okey an update on the game! I still would not recommend this game to my mates because this game in my opinion is broken. I don't know why the game dev start something and don't finish the stuff they are doing. for example look at the meet you get from a horse or a stag you get chicken meet.Well since the last review they added a ny system Components! i great idea but it has it faults. like the droprate on certain stuff is to low like sewingkits metalblades and so on. The stacksizes are to low your inventory will be full really fast and you need to decide on what to keep when your out farming.The game has some awesome concepts the devs wanna add like the mortar habour radbeasts and so on. Tho the game is unbalanced in the raiding meaning like takes longer and its harder for you to get rockets or c4 then it is for somone to add alot of walls to their base.There is no way that you can raid execpt rockets or c4 they have to add something else.The latest update really downed my fps the devs made you use shadows out of fairness because people without shadows would gain fairness during the night. I understand the why but for people with a low quality comp will not be able to play this game with good fps.The game has alot of potential! really it can be so damn great. But the devs are not listening to the players that put +1000hours in to this game they almost only listen to the newcommers.

2014-07-20,0,0,160,True,Recommended,I awoke cold and naked. The sparse landscape of these rolling hills was vast with the smell of ocean air all around me. With nothing to protect myself from the dangerous wildlife I grabbed a rock that lay at my feet and began to survive. It was less than an hour before I came across a cavalcade of Chinese folk armed to the teeth stacked tightly and apparently laying claim to the surrounding area. I narrowly escaped notice fearing for my life and my rock. I managed to use my rock to kill a wild pig and scrape his insides for raw meat. I tanned the flesh to prepare for clothing and despite doing my best to clean it I could not escape the smell of the blood of what I had done.I fashioned a stone hatchet to gather resources at a faster pace as well as to better defend myself from any potential threat. I ran to hide in a rock formation nearby and managed to bump into a long time friend. I thought that I would never be able to find him in the vast surrounding. He had built a shelter so as we sat inside for the first night I shared the food I had earned with him in the dark so as not to attract any attention for the stalkers of the night.The next day we gathered what we could from the surroundings and decided to search for a place to establish a safe area to build a home. Ran through fields scared more of people than animals. Ran through forests scared of a single bear more than the packs of wolves. We happened upon some rusty abandoned structures. There seemed to be only dead things here. It didn't seem right so we agreed that it would be best to search these buildings as fast as possible. Death would be swift if something went wrong but if we didn't try death would be slow. Then without hesitation we scrambled throughout all the rooms swiftly and met back together in the safety of the mountains just outside the compound. I found a handgun with a few rounds and some clothes. He managed to find some more rounds a shotgun and the blueprints to construct a rifle.With my military training I kept the handgun because I could handle the accuracy needed for what little distance it could cover while he kept the shotgun to protect us from up close. We avoided contact with other humans as best as possible with the occasional Mexican standoff of both parties before either parting ways with agreed neutrality on rare circumstances or the more likely shoot out. On the times that we had to defend ourselves from other humans we knew that we had to do what we needed to survive and scavenged their bodies for anything useful. Usually the pickings were scarce. One guy actually came at us with only a rock. I shot him in the head as he ran screaming at me and immediately felt remorse and pity for what this man must have been through. At least he is no longer suffering.When we found a cliff along the ocean facing out into the west we decided this would be our home. Before the sun slid its fingers out of view we had barely managed to put up the shanty with a few barricades to hide us further from view so as to obscure all the light from our campfire. That second night we maintained vigilance well into the night but at least we had warmth. At least we managed to get some sleep.The start of our third day was before the sun rose and in the twilight we split up to complete different tasks to provide for one another. I crafted a bow and some arrows to go hunting for food while he stayed in the area collecting materials for a stronger home. A stronger base. Around noon I returned to find a large amount of wood piled up and ready to construct. I had killed a deer and a wild pig and managed to bring most of the bodies home after I had drained them of blood and internal organs. I left the meat to cook as we began to put together a real home with thicker walls a few rooms storage crates and some make shift sleeping bags to provide warmth through the night without the attention of a fire. We lived like this for quite some time until our lives were ended one night. A group of raiders had found us as we slept killed us and removed all traces of our lives from our home.I awoke cold and naked. Alone and lost. This was my life now. I had to start over and so did my friend but we would repeat the same patterns to survive and search for one another and all with the memories of what have happened to us. Over time I made new friends and came across long lost old friendships and our group grew. At first we lived separate from each other but as the trend of night raids increased we slowly congregated and constructed a fortress. Together a tower was constructed with layers of walls to slow the enemy from reaching our doorstep. If they had managed to make it inside our tower they would have to navigate the maze of halls and doors to find us. We thought we were safe. We ruled over all the land we could keep watch over but inside who watches the watchmen?,Rust

2016-07-10,1,2,148,True,Not Recommended,After playing through the game pre and post xp update I have come to a final conclusion The community literally makes cancer look like a paper cut. While the game itself and its systems are well implemented the enviroment beautifully designed and the building system done well but slightly lacking the community is absolutely horrendous. Even if you find 3 nice people to play with you will get raided by 10 people harder up the than the 2016 Presidential Election will do the American public. 90% of people Kill On Sights (KOS) and the 10% that don't even though you may say friendly and just be starting out the game with little gear and resources will probably still kill you for fun. I would not be surprised if there was a psychological study done on the players of this game and find out that all of them are extreme masochists (taking pain repeatedly for joy) or sadists (having joy from hurting others) and probably also future serial killers. Most of this community should be put on government watch lists that's how bad it is and probably indicative of how they would act with actual guns and power in general.,Rust

2018-04-11,2,2,1194,False,Not Recommended,"Let me start with saying this. Rust is a very fun game but is very bad. Just because something is bad doesnt mean it cant be fun. I love this game and think its great but with the devs being absolute trash and their anti cheat selection is pure garbage. This game has EAC (the worst anti cheat literally clash of clans probably has better) it lets hackers go run around free and by the time the hackers get banned (3 days) they have new acounts and already raided you and ruined your wipe. I had hackers already ruin so many wipes but because I love rust I continued. Every time we got raided it was by hackers (7 times in 2 wipes). The rest like pvp was terrible because of cheaters. Each time I heared a tommy gun shoot or custom I got flashbacks of bullets flying over my head and landing on it (like mortar fire). Now back to EAC. I recently got banned and never hacked they said I had a ""macro"". You can choose to not believe me about EAC but he day before I got banned I was server banned on my main so I made an alt (to finish wipe) and got game banned on both accounts. Just a warning to anyone who is considering buying this game. Also if you are a solo or duo this game difficulty goes up 3 times harder. Good luck im not buying this game again why support devs that false ban a trash anti cheat terrible optimization and bad game decisions from the devs. Still my favorite game tho.",Rust

Although its kinda difficult to start out since you literally start with a rock you use that rock to hit trees and gather wood or mine or kill animals for food. Eventually you can get up to creating kevlar armour or shotguns or mp5s. It really is a fun game however I suggest you get it if you have friends because that always makes things easier. Start off at the same time since the worlds are pretty much endless and you can loose each other easily. Meet up at the spawn and then travel off together and create your world!

2014-01-01,1,2,279,True,Recommended,Rust is an adventurous game that tries to separate itself from the plethora of available MMOs out there. The most interesting parts so far involve actually showing more players openly when comparing it to other games like DayZ and Nether where interaction with other players is much of a subtle occurence. The crafting looting and hunting are all great and welcoming addons to the game that help shape each and every journey as well as individualize every server. Exploring is always welcomed with a new SLEEPER system implemented where if you log out your body is still persistant along with all the loot you have harvested still on character this causes a person to look twice not only for hostiles but for treasure as well. Major downfalls in this game include server instability due to attackers and an inability to favourite servers on the server list so far. A companion feature would also be welcomed for multiple permissions of access for doors and other utilities. Weapons are very responsive and crafting pistols/bows are very rewarding so far with amazing animations and sounds! +Hunting++True Nudity+ Huge world++ Customizable crafting for buildings+ Treasures and Danger to be found+ Day and Night cycles + Weapons / Aiming Down Sights + Community Enriched+Climbable peaks and terrain Server Instability No way to set multiple permissions for gates/doors Region locked players would be nice ( Koreans for KOR servers...UK for United Kingdom only servers.. ) Minor Bugs I would easily present this game with a 9/10.THIS IS ONLY AN ALPHA.

2015-06-30,0,0,234,True,Recommended,Rust No one expects the Spanish Opposition It's early in the morning in Rust. My friend and I have erected our first house just a 2x2 with 2 1x1 rooms a 2x1 hallway for furnace/campfire utilities a little attic space for a tool cupboard and backwards wooden door with a code lock.After repeated bear attacks we decide to invest in Eoka pistols and homemade shells for the both of us. Fast forward it's a little past noon and both of us have an Eoka pistol and 10 shells.We're treading back to our house to replenish on munitions and food after killing a bear. Then we hear it A voice from the bushes.We both haul back to our house in hopes of not being murdered. He takes a couple crossbow shots as we flee. Now safely inside our house I can recognize that the voice is clearly American. My friend and I decide to chase the unwanted invader away and/or kill him. We both storm him Eokas blazing as he flees from the property.We run back and restock yet again. This time two voices. Both clearly with heavy spanish accents. We quickly warn them to leave. They quickly shoot communications to each other in a language familiar but unknown. I realize it's Spanish.The next twenty minutes goes like this I open the door spend some already limited ammunition with no avail shut it and repeat. 18 minutes go by and I've got 3 shells left. I decide to put an end to the fight. I devise a plan to fling open the door and shoot down from the attic space onto them as they enter.The entrance to the attic is simply a furnace. I warn my friend to get in the attic and not get in the way as I return from opening the door. I throw open the door and run down the 2x1 hallway to the furnace to get into the attic. My friend accidentally doesn't realize that he's in the way resulting in my being shot by a waterpipe and dying on contact. My friend is however able to shoot one in the head and finish him with a bone club before dying out.I lie on top of the furnace downed. I see that I'm on 4 health just enough to get back up after a second or two. As soon as I get up I'm off to try and loot a weapon as one raider is still inside and I lost my Eoka upon being downed. I furiously swing a stone pick at the lone raider in a 1x1 room. I land two hits before having my kidneys removed with a salvaged sword.I quickly respawn in my bag which the raider has not gotten to yet due to his interest in the loot on the bodies. I run out open the first body I see grab a loaded waterpipe and blow the celebrating Spainard's brains out and close the door.The raid is won. My friend and I grab all the loot and supplies we can carry and we decide to migrate away from the looming threat of the area. We open the door and dash off into the bush under a giant chandelier of stars.,Rust

This game will never update. this game will never be anything more than a bunch of cavemen running around naked with rocks. The houses you build even if they're metal will decay over time. The time you accumulate in the game does not mean much in the grand scheme of things especially if your house decays in the process.

2014-01-21,0,0,57,True,Recommended,"So I played DayZ. And I liked the ""Social Experiment"" side of it. Meeting people and wondering if they will shoot you in the head or become your new best friends. But I also hate everything about Arma II (Gunplay?!). And I played Minecraft but I guess im not creative enough to play that game more than an hour.Then I came across ""Rust"" and people said that it's a mix between DayZ and Minecraft. That intrigued me enough to buy it.And I did not regret it at all. I have never played an early access game as long as I played this. 39 hours at the moment and counting. The only thing that is really bothering me right now are the hackers. They do everything in their power to ruin the game. But they can't succeed because the game is that addictive. There is always something to do something to farm something to craft. And you don't need to search for everything running and looting around for hours just to get a weapon while not even knowing what you will do with it once you got it. You just need a little patience and work to get your first little house or your first weapon. But why stop there? You can always improve your gear and your house. One little thing after the other aaand you played 8 hours in one session. The gunplay is rewarding as weapons aren't always easy to handle but you'll get to know them and with a little practice you will get it right. This game doesn't look like Crysis 3 but it's easy to look at and has beautiful lighting which creates very atmospheric scenerys and gameplay. As with DayZ I find the social aspect of the game most interesting. I had some friendly encounters and a lot of hostile ones. And that is just the way it should be. There is a certain kind of suspense that you just don't get in other games. This game took the best ideas from Minecraft and DayZ crafted them together on a workbench and created an amazing experience for you to play. I'm very exited to see where this game is going if the Pre Alpha is this good the final game will be amazing. And it won't get cheaper than this for a long time.

2018-10-06,0,0,636,False,Recommended,After recently hitting the 500 hour mark for this game I think I have the experience to review it. Before you read my review please take into account that I have player with strangers and friends and both are very different. Also remember that the way your game turns out may be entierly different to mine. Also please know that this is my second review ever and my first proper review.Rust is a fun challenging stressful game. I have played the game in many ways each one different.Solo This in my eyes is the most challenging way to play and I have played this way for atleast 150 hours credit is due to these people they have a slow start and the game is very stressful for them lately the updates have been mostly against these players mainly regarding the new teammate update. Facepunch seriously needs to adress these players and release and update that gives them an update targeted towards them.Duo This way of playing is really 50/50 if you are playing with a friend this will test your friendship to a certain level for me it turned out well and I think that is the same for most duo teams I cant reccomend playing duo with a stranger though they could betray you or just be unreliable.Small group 3 to 6 people This is where I have most of my experience and to be honest It is the same as DUO to me. Just more loot and a more toxic discord.CLAN I have ony just recently played this way its very organised and everyone is actaully quite good at working as a team in this most CLANS goals are to either Dominate the server or Dominate the server but also not be s at the same time. The second one is rare but Im lucky to be in a good clan with funny and respectful people. On wipe day there is one thing that every single group can relate to the struggle. Even though your group gets 2 boxes of sulfur within 2 hours there are still people who mess up your day there are still people who raid you because of wipe day struggles and people are still going to roofcamp your ing door.For me the group system helps ALOT without the team system most people would go insane it really makes rust easier. I dont think thats good though. It really takes the struggle/fun out of rust that funny moment when your friend runs through the door and you accidently shoot them in the face thinking they were a door camper is what made rust legendary to me.There is also some things that need to be tweeked especially optomizations. Luckily they are working hard to make the game run better on older systems. I hope my review reminded you about how great rust was and encouraged you to play even more or to even possibly buy the game. I think a $30 price tag would be more fair but just know this the devs do work hard and are great people who create great games. Thank you for reading,Rust

2018-02-09,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,"Rust is an unoptimised mess. After being an Early Access game for over 4 years Rust has finally got its first stable release.However instead of optimising the videogame to work on cheaper and more hardware or even the damn developer prescribed hardware the geniuses behind the videogame have decided to change the system requirements altogether.They want you to have an ""AMD FX 9590 or better"" CPU to run Rust. Hold on let me give you some perspective Far Cry 5 (2018) needs an FX 6300 Assassin's Creed Origins (2017) needs an FX 6350 and Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017) needs an FX 6350. Things look better in the GPU department though. Yeah I get it it's a CPU intensive game but really? You need an i7 4690K to run this game without dropping frames at all? I should also point out that the game takes FOREVER to load. Let's talk about the gameplay now. Rust is a game about survival and crafting. You must hunt eat and build a shelter while working with the community or against it. That's all. And that's more than enough for a lot of people and that's cool.But finding co operative players to build and survive with is getting harder and harder. Finding friends in Rust is a matter of luck. If you do you'll probably have a good time but if not chances are you won't get anywhere in this game without being aimlessly killed by some random dude. Rust servers aren't exactly the best servers in the world either. The community may be toxic for the most part but I don't want to hold the videogame and its developers accountable for it.Is Rust a risk you're willing to take?",Rust

Now you have to grind for days or weeks to be able to craft anything good and actually play the game. There's only one way to progress now. No trading no stealing no getting luckly no researching. Only chopping trees or hitting rocks. Even if you happen to find or loot a nice weapon you can't even use it because you can't craft ammo for it. Oh and your level will reset every so often so you'll end up doing the exact same thing over and over again. Servers are dying fast just look at all the recent reviews.

2014-04-02,0,0,490,True,Recommended,Okay i have just been reading a lot of other reviews for rust and have to get my own opinion out.First of all. There are so much negativity around this game all over the net due of cheaters bugs etc. GUYS COME ON. have some patience. The dev team is a small group of people working SO hard to make this game work and all u do is criticize them. (U think u can do better be my guest) its not always easy to make changes it takes time.Second. It does says in the storepage that it is an alpha early acess game and no one can expect that an early alpha game is 100 % bugless. Sure there are bugs in the game. i have experienced my share part of them but i dont let it get me down. In all the other alpha games i have been playing this is one of the games with less bugs. i have seen ALOT worse.Then there are the hacker problem.Sure they need to make some fixed regarding this issue but server admins can also do their part of helping out. ban cheaters. list their steam ids on a banlist forum or on steam forum so other admins can blacklist those players. In my opinion that can work very well for some time and help get alot of hackers out. i do that on my server btw.Also the devs have announced huge changes to the game in the future and it will be out soon.SO PPL CHILL OUT and let the devs do their jobI give this game 7/10 so far and im sure i will raise that in future to a 10/10,Rust

I got this game as a gift and as sad that is I just had to come clear with the person that gave it to me that this game is simply not fun for me. Why? Well there is why I'm a solo player.That's it that is all you need to know and before the comment section get flooded with people telling me to ""git gud"" or stope whinning I will simply sumarize my current experience in RUST.Like every body I start the game naked ona beach walking around I notice a bunch of bases and so I start wandering the wild collecting a few ressources along the way. I get tools and because I am fully aware of how the game is I prepare myself two spears. I keep wandering for a hour or two as I cross two people one guy running away yelling ""friendly"" and another that just tried to hit me with a rock... despite my warnign and me clearly holding a spear. It did not end up so well for him but he attacked me first. Eitherway I am wandering the place and decide ona place to instal myself not to close of any other base so I make a blueprint and start building... and a guy in a bow immediately enter the place where I just put a door there and instantly kill me. I took a breather and restarted... what else could I do? I restart the whole thing and reach the base... I than get shot by a bowman and fall down and after explaining I am a first time player he let me live apologize and even give me wood. I was glad not everyone in this game where nice so I made my base and prepare to go get some wood nearby... just to hear four giggling teenagers telling me ""Hi"". I turn around and I just see the end of a shotgun before he blow my head into bits. I woke up in my base and there they are again... blowing my brain (again). So... RUST... honestly not a bad game but most of their players are s... even if I saw a glimmer of hope I will not touch this game again.",Rust

You will spend your entire game naked and trapped in the stone age because you can't survive long enough to craft anything. You'll be killed minutes after logging in. You will have your base and hard work destroyed while your off line only to end up naked and start over from scratch.

I for one use to play Minecraft a lot but it gets boring why? BECAUSE IT IS NOT CHALLENGING AT ALL! Nowadays you get on a server on Minecraft and all you have to do is buy a rank and boom you conquer the server! Ya this game offers a real challenge. No more Mr. Nice Guy you will have to work to keep your house standing fight to keep your life and your items. This is like Minecraft but more items more fun and much more challenging basically the MANLY MINECRAFT! I say this because people automatically think yay a game like Minecraft but real life kinda look it will be just like Minecraft! Nope.

2017-11-10,1,2,2,True,Not Recommended,Calling this game a survival sandbox is extremely inaccurate. The world is not believable or immersive in the slightest (you will literally not travel more than 10 steps between player bases). You cannot design your own character's appearance. A**holes kill everyone on sight and the map is so tiny so you will never escape the sprawling suburban mass of look alike player bases if you tried.This is the first overhyped game I've fallen for in a long time. If you like survival/crafting games in the slightest get 7 Days to Die instead. This one is for 3rd graders on ADD meds.,Rust

The developers are very active on social media like Reddit. They respond to feedback give insight on what they've got planned &amp reasoning behind changes. It's very refreshing to see developers that are this engaged with their community.The only downside I can think of is that it s a very hard game for players that play alone. Even the developers said that it s not meant to be played alone. You re supposed to make friends or die pretty much. Don t let that put you off though. It s easy to meet other players in game &amp team up. And keep in mind that you WILL make mistakes that lead to your demise. Accept it &amp learn from your mistakes.

Watch videos before playing or you will be bent over and f*cked in the AS$ many times to the point where you want to F*CKING CRY but then you'll get lucky and kill someone then the snowball effect proceeds to happen you'll plop down a base and start to feel secure and get off for the night.

2014-03-27,0,0,667,True,Recommended,"It's been a long journey for me on this god forsaken Island. I'm not sure how I got here but the last thing I can remember is opening my eyes to a crystal blue sky. The sound of wind blowing between leaves and grass filled my ears. I wasn't actually familiar with my surroundings I was confused but happy. It was a weird peace. As if I had just died and awoken in heaven. I won't lie to you the peace ended quickly. I began to look around and come to the realisation that although I was in a forest I was naked. Very naked. This is the most exposed I have ever felt in my entire life. Stood in a strange area not knowing if I was in heaven or hell and me standing there whilst the wind blew between my legs in my bare skin. I hadn't even taken one step until in the distance I heard the most peculiar sound I have ever heard. It was a moan a weird one... As if someone was trying to impersonate a seal? Then just over the small lump of a hill a masked man appeared and when I say masked do not take this lightly. A mask was his only clothing everything else was on show. I wasn't exactly sure to what he was doing but still the sounds echoed from his mouth repeatadly from his direction. Still I had not even taken a step but thoughts began to question wheter I should head in the opposite direction. Maybe he has a speech problem or social anxiety lost his tongue or maybe he is just down right mad. The closer he got the clearer his person. I wasn't too sure as to what he was holding but It become clear. It was clearer than that crystal blue sky. Waving back in forth in his frantic sprint this moaning seal impersonating madman clutched a hatchet. Everything I questioned before about his persona instantly become clear... He was a mad man and he wanted me dead. Quickly I turned and began to run as fast as I possibly could! Feet crunching in the long grass weaving between the clutter of large trees. Still the moans echoed in my ears closer and closer they got. Eventually I decided my best course of action was to head for open ground assess my situation and pray I can find somewhere to hide. For what seemed a decade I dodged and ducked under trees. Each time the moans grew in intensity. ""What do you want with me?"" I screamed as I ushered myself through the foiliage.""UMPF UMPF I WANT YE DEAD YE FACKING BASTARD! UMPF UMPF.""""Please! You can't do this to me! I don't have anything!""Still my bare feet ploughed onwards eager to rest. Then just as the last of the leaves left my view I was in an open field. Surronded by large mountains encased in large clusters of rocks I ran straight for the highest point.""Okay stop! I promise I won't kill you!"" I wasn't sure if It was worth the gamble. But I did just to see if he really did mean to surrender his hostile actions. ""UMPF UMPF YE FACKING BASTARD YER DEAD NOW YE ING BASTARD""He closed in on me hatchet over his head and with all his force plunged the tool into my body. I was bleeding heavily. Life being sucked from my body each second. Still I travelled on as quickly as before this time knowing I have to lose this guy. I wasn't sure what to do about my grave injury. Only this was the least of my worries. Straight for the base of the moutain I ran to lose this lunatic in the rocky foundations. The sun was now low on the horizon. The constant threat of death being yelled at me followed by ""YE BASTARD"" constantly assured me that this night will be hell. I wasn't sure I was going to make it... But here I am.

2014-04-21,0,0,1057,True,Recommended,Rust has had quite alot of changes since I started playing in Legacy. The developers update the game every week which is nice to see in a development team. Rust lost it's fun that the Legacy version had but now 'experimental' Rust is in a pretty good spot (as of this review). A new system (component system) was released to make Rust 'fun again'.The game is based around you spawning on an island with nothing but a rock and a torch. You adventure to gather resources and componets to create a base and upgrade your gear. Once you are powerful and rich enough you can raid other people and gain even more loot. The fun part of Rust for me is the PvP interactions. Nothing is more satisfying than taking on a group of people with just a spear and coming out with full metal armour and an ak. Rust can be fun if you learn how to play but that's the hardest part. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the survival genre of games.tl dr Rust PvP is fun but it takes time to get used to the game.Sidenote Be prepared to get very salty.,Rust

2014-07-12,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,If u enjoy being mad this game is for you. There's nothing wrong with the game it's the s who play it. Most people will go out of their way to hunt you down and kill you if they even see you across the map even though half the time you don't have anything worth looting. Building a house is damn near impossible sense people kill you constently and you loose all your resources or someone breaks in your house and raids all your stuff. Enemy AI si more annoying than threatning. You could find an empty server and build there but the world is so empty it gets boring to not have anyone to interact with. Guns are hard to get use to (except the shotgun) and odds are you're never going to get good with them because when you finally get one people with more gear and better skills will just kill you before you can use it. Going to the far reaches of the map to build is the best bet but all the wood piles and loot spawns are in the center and that's where most of the s like to build. Even if u stay away long enough people WILL find and raid you eventually.,Rust

2016-11-01,0,0,387,True,Recommended,How would I describe Rust in a few words? It's THE survival game for me.Despite being in early access it has regular weekly updates active developers responding to the community demands and suggestions and a great user base. It says that it has micro transactions but in reality they're community made skins that have literally zero effect on the game (just a visual gimmick similiar to CS GO or LoL skins). Rust's gameplay is great it has a nice natural progression tree. It's really skill based there's a minimal luck factor in Rust (and no pay to win that's important and great). It requires spending a bit of time on it though it's not a game to just pick it up and play casually a hour a day. Also more friends playing it correspond to more fun )I recommend trying it out. If the price point scares you off then wait for a sale (it goes 50% off usually on them). If you're scared that the developers will abandon it they won't. If you aren't sure about that then just look at Garry's Mod (done by the same developer).Overall I would give Rust a solid 9/10.,Rust

2014-01-30,0,0,144,True,Not Recommended,"I know this is in alpha so I understand that it's still rough around the edges so I'm writing this review on whats in the game currently. As the game stands as of now I suggest you avoid Rust until at least the beta comes out. The game has a very fun concept to it almost like fallout/minecraft but focuses more on survival however that gets thrown right out the window when you actually join a server. You spawn with only a rock as your only mean of defense in a random location on the map which leaves you scrambling to get resources to build a shelter and a camp fire to survive. Unfortunetly this where Rust's charm and originality ends because you usually end up getting a 5.56mm bullet buried into your skull before you even get to actually do anything. Even if you do get lucky and establish a camp it will most likely get raided by bandits carrying a large amount of C4 and are armed to the teeth. During my playthroughs I didnt bump into many other players due to the map being huge and playing on low traffic servers but when I did find someone else I ended up getting my head blown off when I was minding my own and just generally screwing around. This is more of a community issue then a game mechanic issue since most players in this game adopted this kill on sight (KoS) mentality. The devs should either 1) make military grade guns and ammo extremely rare and more costly or 2) remove all military grade guns and replace them with more ""lore friendly"" homemade guns to balance it out. Another issue is the decay times. Hey do you want to make a kick camp or fortress? You do? We'll you better play this damn thing religiously or that will disappear if you dont reset the timers. If you dont log on and play this game for more then 3 days all your structures will decay and disappear. This is hard when you have a life outside of Rust or you play other games. I hope this game changes because with all of these KoS CoD plebs hackers trolls greifers and wannabe bandits this game is gonna fall faster then a lead balloon. If you really want a game to KoS every in the server I'd suggest Counter Strike or Gta V.",Rust

2013-12-11,1,2,522,True,Recommended,"Rust is one of the best survival oriented games I've ever played.It's like Minecraft DayZ and Stalker combined. Minecraft on building DayZ on harsh environments and players and Stalker on the apocolyptic setting.The community is what sells it. You really can't trust anybody but your friends and even they might have a chance to backstab you. You'll find huge bases that are home to entire armies of men in powerful armor and small forts made by a naked dude that doesn't know what's coming. Even if you're at the top of the ranks you can still be dumbed down by raiders and bandits.Every Thursday there's a new update added to the game. These updates are documented but can be a pretty good learning experience if you don't know what's coming. This way the game has a bit of freshness every Thursday. This can vary based on the size of the update though.The game can also produce some comedic moments. I have fond memories of a great event My friends and I were all running up a hill naked and I asked one of my other friends to play some tribal music. He did...but after a minute the tribal music changed to Wiggle by Jason Derulo. You can guess where things went from there.I would suggest buying this game if you're a fan of survival oriented games. It's an experience you can't miss out on. To some players this game may feel like just repeats of ""get killed by man with big gun"" but I can definitely say that it's much much more than that.",Rust

2013-12-11,0,0,70,True,Recommended,8/10 I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a base system type game. Though it's in early alpha it's more fun to play than any other. Here's my thoughts about the current legacy version which most people play currently. Crafting isn't hard to understand gathering rescources is a huge grind and in my opinion a bit too tedious for the outcome. Weapons in the game are broken when you reach the high tier. There's currently only two tiers low and high. The low tier weapons are fun as hell and make the game different in it's own way especially when you get a base going with a bunch of friends and are having to shoot arrows at people staking you out. On the other hand you outgrow these low tier weapons almost instantly which I hate. You start with making bows/axes/pipe shotguns that are hard to use and don't do that much damage but that's the way it should be with the material you use to make it. After one day of playing you are guaranteed and forced to make the high tier weapons. M4s/Shotguns/Pistols and the worse implemented weapon in the game C4... The reason why I say you're forced is because of the other people on the server. They just rush those high tier weapons to dominate the playing field before you're able to have a cozy little house going. If you're one of those people that like slow progession games and like to focus more on base/community building then maybe you should wait a while until they update and balance the game. It's impossible to build a house without having someone mass producing C4 blowing up people's walls/doors and taking everything you worked for. I love the idea of raiding but not this way... So my final decision. I recommend it because I most definitely see them fixing it up and making a great game in the future. Yes it's a bit unbalanced right now but you can always find servers that are empty or have strict rules.,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,113,True,Recommended,Best Game Ever! This game is so much fun i play it with my pals quite a lot and it's very fun! You should get it (WARNING! There currently isn't singleplayer C You'll have to go online and risk stuff unless it's a NON PVP Server) GET IT NOW!,Rust
2017-07-27,1,2,1,True,Not Recommended,Oh man the things I have to say about this game. I don't think that a game has ever made me SO mad at myself for even owning it. I guess that's why i permanently removed it from my library. Wait let me explain my reasons.First of all the fact that you start with nothing but your naked self and try and survive in a hostile environment is AWESOME I am not gonna lie. But the fact that you have to log in a game where hundreds of people have already built bases and have all essential materials and weapons that can take you out in a second is so f&amp %*ing annoying. What you basically have to do is be a vulture having to find the scraps that other people don't want. You are almost never able to get good weapons. And everybody that you meet on the game are such a$$holes they immediately start tormenting you and playing with you trying to make you feel as if they want to be peaceful but then stab you in the back later on.If this game had a Singleplayer option hell yes I would be happy to buy this game AGAIN. Oh yeah completely forgot you have to also have around a 5000 dollar computer to nearly run it as well as you would hope it would. I have a pretty darn good computer in context it could run Titanfall 2 at 100 fps at ultra settings but i can only run this at 60 fps on only high quality it's such bullsh$t.,Rust
2015-06-15,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,Realistic and fun survival in a pretty world. Unfortunately though it's only multiplayer so far and it isn't easy to make your own server so you're almost guaranteed to get raided as soon as you go offline and have all your hard work stolen and/or destroyed by random non friendly players. I really want to recommend this game but I can't do so in good concience knowing that you have to start over every single time because of raiders. If they add some better ways to protect yourself while you're offline or maybe a way to set servers to pve only instead of pvp and pve I'll change my no to a yes.,Rust

2017-01-06,0,0,1400,True,Recommended,One of my favorite games of all times I have been playing this game for almost a year now and while I have not played for all that long I have still seen the good and bad the beauty and the horror although facepunch has done some things that a lot of people dislike they still do thier best to make it fun for everyone.This game has it's disadvantages and with every wipe something new comes up wether it is a glitch or an unfair balance. But I have notice one thing that always comes up solo players get nerfed plenty of times. There are many ways that Garry could do to fix this but with every fix comes a disadvantage. For example if they added a new gun or even buffed a weapon that noobs (or fresh wipes) can easily make that would make it to where noobs could easily reck the top tier players this was a thing at a time with crossbows and stone spears (before the slight nerf) it was too easy to gang bang fully geard players.This game is always getting updates and fixes. Every thursday they come out with a new (usually big) update this is good since a lot of games thier creators give up on a game wether it is because they are making a new game or if they just do not care for it anymore. Although this game may still be in early access it is still a wonderful game and i would say that is most definetely worth the $20.00 US that it costs.Personaly I think that they work on things that do not really need to be fixed or at least not at the moment. For example the bears oh god the bears first of all thier AI is unbelievably screwed they will get you throu walls and they will climb a mountain in seconds. This is something that every player agrees needs to be fixed But i think that Garry just wants people to get killed or exposed out of nowhere example if you are going out in a group to raid or something and you are trying to sneak and a bear comes up on you you are forced to use your gun if you have one now you can come prepared for this situation by carrying a BP with some wood or bring a silenced weapon. However most people don't wanna bring a silencer since it screws the gun and most of the time you are almost dead by the time you can build a foundation to be protected from the bear or even building blocked. Doggo's however are easily killed if you have a bow or even a hatchet so with wolfs you can take the little dmg they deal in the time it takes to kill them with a mele or bow type weapon.That is some of my thoughts on rust and if you are having doubnts of buying the game well throw those in the trash and buy the game it is worth every penny it costs.

2017-01-02,0,0,834,True,Not Recommended,This game used to be really good. Back in the beginning of 2016 or late 2015. But then the developers decided to put in things such as Turrets and new rad towns and I don't know how but the whole game changed. It became toxic. PVP was forced by all the changes blueprints were taken away and things just got messy. I have brought many friends to Rust and have met many friends through Rust but that whole community is gone... Making friends on Rust is not a thing anymore. It's just kill on site. And yes this is a survival game yes you will get killed but from playing back then to playing now there is a huge difference. This game is ruined now. So no don't buy this game... Don't waste your money. You won't have a good time.,Rust

2014-01-15,0,0,324,True,Recommended,The best way I could describe this game is a little bit of survival minecraft and dayz. You have a chance to die and lose all your items but that's where the minecraft part comes into play. You can build a house on this very huge island make chests and hide your items there. I can say I have been raided many times and lost my items but it only made the experience better for me and made me want to play it even more.

2018-06-05,0,0,2390,False,Not Recommended,I'm extremely disappointed with Rust and with the way it's going. I've been playing it for the past 2 3 years and seeing it change in such a stupid way is disgusting. It was a great game 1 year ago but it's all turned terrible. Spray patterns for every single gun. A pistol a god damn pistol has a spray pattern?? Great... The ladder system is messed up aswell anyone can place ladders on your base which ruins base building and all old ways of doing it. I understand the fixes of walls being placed inside each other but that also was one of the main features of building. But then cupboards came out that was terrible. So you can lock your cupboard? That's insane. Way too op. Also 1 cupboard can link up an entire base still have to pay for all the materials you've used though. But it doesn't stop there. They are coming out with PUZZLES FOR MONUMENTS. This ruins the game for solo players especially with MANUAL buttons that have to be held by one player just do another player can access a certain room to get another keycard for the next area they need to go to. But he places have already been looted and players have been there before you why the hell is there any security? And Facepunch talk about how they want to focus the game closer to solo players absolute lies. But it doesn't stop there the component system also stops solo players from playing the game oh you need a blueprint for this? Ha go out and get it while you get killed by NPCs and other players that have better stuff then you. Blueprints actually made sense since you only have to get the item ONCE for the entire wipe then it was a battle to the death. Which was the most fun part about Rust the killing and then the raiding was enjoyable. Filling up my chests with armor that I got from my enemies was satisfying. But that's not fun anymore since you have to do countless hours of farming just to get a small shack set up that will get raided by a larger group. Even if you do get ahold of an AK or Semi Rifle you have to get the scrap to research it but wait you also need to get a tier 2 or even tier 3 workbench to actually craft it but wait it costs THOUSANDS of scrap to get anyway in the game but you'll just get kill by everyone else. Especially NPCs wondering the junkpiles and even if you kill them THEY GIVE YOU A FLARE. But wait they even waste their money on sound development even though it's not needed at all. They changed all of the gun sounds again when it was not needed a single bit it was god damn annoying since you had to relearn the sounds from all distances and from all guns. Even explosive sounds were changed (Which was the only thing that needed a change). Right now with the state of Rust it's really not worth it. Especially because of the price. 27.79??? There's not even much to do in the game and you want 27 quid for it? off.I don't even review games normally and I have to review Rust because of how dog it is going. Fix your game and bring back Ruin. THE ONLY HOPE FOR FACEPUNCH WAS RUIN AND THEY EVEN TOOK THAT AWAY FROM US.,Rust

In a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg.2. In another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings.7.

2014-07-06,0,0,1247,True,Recommended,10/10 Even though the game is currently in it's Alpha stage it has honestly been one of the best games I have ever played. The action never stops and it is never the same. You will always find yourself having a different experience every day.You have to survive no matter what it takes. Trust no one and watch your back. If you have to go into town make sure you're prepared to defend yourself. There is always someone willing to kill you. I can't describe the feeling you get when you are raiding another player but it is a feeling like no other. However you will eventually get raided too and it will be a sad day. You must stay strong find out who raided you and get revenge. Your heart rate will probably increase several times while playing Rust as there are many threats all around you. The biggest of which are other players. Some may be nice but most are not. If you want a dynamic experience with endless action variety and fun I highly recommend this game especially with your closest friends. Be prepared to spend alot of time having fun in this game.,Rust
2014-07-03,0,0,227,True,Recommended,Ok. So I picked this game up earlier and I wasn't 100% sure what to expect. After dying a few times because I tried to take on wild wolves and bears with just a big ****ing rock I managed to build a fire. Then my friend found me and we began to construct a somewhat large fortress in the middle of bloody nowhere. No one could find us (except once when we killed somewhat in a slight misunderstanding... He thought our fortress was empty and we thought he was a thief). We had a few guns and bows and lots of supplies. Then the server was stopped and we were kicked forcing us to find a new one. There we were alone facing mutant wolves and bears with bows and arrows until a veteran player joined our group. Now we're building a new fortress and we already have a good amount of supplies. Basically if you play with the right people you will have a great time but according to many other reviews some of the players can be real ***holes. It takes a lot these days for games to get me as addicted as I already am to Rust and I highly recommend it to anyone with even a remote interest in sandbox survival games.,Rust

There was nothing.10/10 would watch my hopes and dreams burn again,Rust
2016-05-12,0,0,433,True,Recommended,The game is good. It is not particularly well made but it has that addictive quality to it. There is always something more to do there is always another mountain to explore or another person to meet. This was the original survival game that hit it big and it is definitely worth a purchase. Highly suggest exploring the servers there are really fun faction servers that add elements of diplomacy into the game.,Rust
2016-05-16,1,2,74,True,Not Recommended,"Keep getting shot on sight too many young players for a rated ""M"" game and there is no progression. Cannot tell if this is any better then DayZ most likely about the same. At least in DayZ you need at least one or two people to survive allowing some kind of community base and teamwork base gaming. Rust is a failure comparing to Ark and sadly at least i get killed less with players shooting on sight due to the amount of work each player can do for the community and allowing for more players to play together. Note Ark still have about the same amount of young players that still shoot on sight. Until I see improvement to rust I will try again and write another review.",Rust

After running aroumd with a rock in my hand with no clue I figured out that I ave to just not die. After figuring out how to collect resources and crafting i got the hang of it after 30 mins. I like the crafting menu it shows what you have enough resources for at the top of the list. Also the fact you have to wait to craft items gives it a real feal. The graphics are great for me even on an alpha i3. The only thing i really disliked about the game is that i couldnt find any help with what keys did what therefore i mashed buttons. It's a great challenging game. I would recommend it and honest rating would be a 4.7 out of 5.,Rust

2016-05-14,0,0,795,True,Recommended,Rust is a pretty amazing game in my opinion even more so for still being in Alpha. The game is a wonderful mix of both FPS action and creative buiding. The ramp up of creating your weapons and base make it either very rewarding to defeat another player or group of players or very destructive when you lose. The fact that you worked for what you have makes in all the more thrilling and motivating when you get in a battle.The community is the most important part. 90% of the content in this game is player created and it opens the doors to limitless possibilities and encounters. Also the Rust development team is one of the best in the industry when it comes to communicating with the players!Moreso than any game I have played this game gets my heart racing. It is a hard game. Rust is unforgiving unfriendly and unmatched. And I think it is one of the best games on the steam marketplace right now and that it will be one of the best in the near future.

2015-11-06,0,0,159,True,Recommended,TL DRRust is a great game it is worth the money. But it falls short on speed stability and is very laggy. 7/10.If you dont know Rust is an Early Alpha Survival game. Like much SURVIVAL games you SURVIVE. But this is almost half a crafting game. You need to build a base big or small to survive.PROS ARE HERE CONS ARE BELOW! BACKROUND With my experience of both legacy (the old abandoned alpha of the game) and the current alpha I have quite some backround. There are a range of tools weapons guns and a guitar. MAP The map is big and unlike DayZ it's hard to recall any familiar places (You deicde if this is good or bad). There are 3 biomes to live in Forest Desert and Arctic. Each place needs different type of clothing. For the Desert you have to walk around in almost nothing to not burn to death and the opposite with the Arctic. There are also Radtowns abandoned areas with barrels to open crates to search and a bunch of other phat lootz. With the word RAD in it the places sometimes have radiation. Fortunately there are a lot on this big map unlike Legacy so there are many without building around it. GROUPS You can be a friendly person who takes anyone in their team scavanging and searching radtowns. You can be a gang of builders just building GIANT skyscrapers. You can be a lone wolf killing anyone who walks near you. You can be a group of raiders blowing up doors with C4 annd rockets! Or naked men. You can be any group you want. PvP and PvE PvE (Player vs Environment) is where there is not people killing each other only the world.PvP (Player vs Player) is where players are fight other players.This game is both. You can use guns bows crossbows rocks spears axes and more to kill people or animals with. Environment The game has many prey such as horses pigs deer chicken and other people. It also has predators such as bears wolves and other people. You also have to fight cold heat and hunger.PROS Fun survival game you can play for hours Unique survival with a lot of fun stuff to do Community servers that you can play with cool modsCONS Game is very buggy Laggs A LOT Some hackers but not many Long loading screensCrashesAt the end I'll give it a 7/10 only because the game is so fun alone or with friends and groups. You feel nice gathering for the day and coming home at night.,Rust

2016-05-20,0,0,5076,True,Recommended,Rust. ....These 4 letters have defined an entire Genre of gaming since its release. Legacy Rust was on of the most Amazing unique crazy unbelievable heartpounding adrenaline rushing experiences that I have ever encountered. It is not so often that an alpha game gets their entire formula correct but hell this game accomplished that and then some. Gameplay is fluid and fair while also being harsh at times. Visuals are astonishing. Atmosphere is beautiful. Friendship and partnership is crucial. PVP is hardcore. PVE is rewarding. Base building is simple yet complex in the minds of true creators. Anything is possible. Hackers can be prevalent at times but can be defeated by players with knowledge. Skill is KING in this game. If you plan on spending time on this game and getting your money's worth then this will be a rewarding experience for you. Do not start playing this game and believe you will be able to go up against people with thousands of hours on your first day you will be REKT but you will learn quick if you try to adapt to how your preferred server plays the game. Not every server will react the same way to how the game is played and that is Great. Take from me Every day in this game is a new experience. The only thing that slightly annoys me is that Legacy Rust was scrapped and the developers chose to recreate the entire game from scratch. Most of what made Legacy Rust unique is gone but the New version of Rust is still worth trying out if you missed playing the original alpha. Though at this time I cannot be sure if the developers are taking the game in the right direction and it could drastically change in the coming months. The developers have introduced a lot of nice things that make the new version better in some ways but they have also left behind many things from the legacy version that made every one love it so Passionately. Legacy Rust will always hold a special spot in my love of gaming and the experiences that I had on it will always be cherished in my memory. The people I have met through this game are some of the most amazing people that I have ever encountered and I am so thankful that this game brought us together. To sum this all up even though Rust has changed over the course of time it is still worth the price and you will have one hell of an experience while playing this game.,Rust

They seem to love to hand free stuff off to their friends and then ghost your bases so they can be easily raided by said friends. I guess I could see it being funny once in awhile but it is never ending. These guys seem to be the losers that get owned in any real server so they make their own then use admin privileges to ""get even"" at the world they suck in.

2018-03-06,2,2,1046,False,Not Recommended,"As someone who has a lot of experience playing first person shooters survival games ect... I find I cannot reccomend this game. Most of my hours are from legacy and approximately 200 of my almost 800 hours are in new rust. New rust has some great asthetics However the gunplay is what kills this game. Which wouldn't be horrible had the character movement not been a toddlers effort at porting minecraft into unity coupled with 30 tick servers. For those who don't know CS GO runs at 64 and people complain. So when your guns shoot nerf bullets already and the only sniper in the game is worse than any given rifle at range it makes the game unplayable coupled with the aforementioned movement mechanics. This is why people want to cheat. Furthermore the gun attatchments are completely t. A muzzlebreak which according to wikipedia actually increases accuracy ""MOST MUZZLE BRAKES will cut recoil by 50 percent. ... There is also evidence that... using muzzle brakes results in better accuracy quite aside from their positive effects on the shooter."" Yet in the world of rust a muzzlebreak reduces accuracy by 40%. It's just got the worst gunplay ever. Once these issues are fixed maybe rust can make a comeback.But wait. There's more.Thought you could play this game with your best buddies? Nah. You're going to need your entire school. Because most servers have giant clans of 15 30 on them on average where most have a membership of atleast double that or more that rotate shifts so that someone is always on. The game rewards larger groups making it almost unplayable and killing the average player. Want to go harvest some ore? Great! oh wait you open the door and 30 players with a variety of guns are building a raid tower and skull ing your base. This same idea applies to resourcing.

2016-12-30,0,0,244,True,Not Recommended,"I am a huge fan of full loot pvp. I grew up playing Wurm Online and though I came to find that game pay to win as I got older (and I eventually got banned from that game for complaining about it) there is nothing like that feeling of your heart racing in an intense pvp situation. I dearly miss that feeling. The first time I had that feeling I thought I was having a heart attack. But eventually I got more used to it. And it helped me to evolve and become a stronger person. Its like the thrill of riding a roller coaster. Its unpleasant but strangley addicting and enjoyable because of how intense it is. PvP can be an ultimate test of your cognative ability and with full loot involved it also is a huge test of your emotional control especially when your on the losing side. This is something that for younger people can be very overwelming at times. I've even seen fully grown adults rage after losing something in full loot simply due to the investment involved in getting what they lost.That said Rust has these things. I missed PvP dearly so when I found rust I jumped on it. I first played in a small gaming community with a bunch of friends. We built a base and some other people in the community built an opposing base and we fought back and forth. We made deals to never raid when offline and the game was a lot of fun and action. Several newer kids to the genre of full loot had to learn the ropes and I was glad to teach them how to have fun despite the intense drama of the situation. We had a lot of fun until we found out that an admin who happened to be in the opposing clan on the server was spawning in thousands of high ql metals and building a massive base. Then he raided our base when we were offline and said someone else did it. So all 12 of us left the server and my fun times in rust ended.After these events our little group split tried to find a new community. Sadly everywhere we went everyone was hostile. We found that our situation on our community server was a special one and that the vast majority of the rust community will KOS you without even talking. The game was no longer a game about teamwork negotiation and conversation. It became a game of trying not to be killed by s who wont even laugh when you make a joke after walking up to them. So pretty much everyone in our little group left and stopped playing the game at this point.Now I understand that PvP is meant to be hostile and it attracts all sorts of nasty individuals who want to get their ""fix"" of being a . This isn't a bad thing it makes the game more interesting. Even I like playing as the badguy in pvp games (thought I make it clear that out of character I'm friendly with everyone because its just a game). The problem isn't that these individuals are in the community the problem in my opinion is that there is NO BREAK from the action. There is no in between time between time where you can cool down unless you find a special community like we had before (which is very rare). This is very different from Wurm because in the land of your kingdom you could make friends easily. There is a sense of patriotism for your kingdom a sense of loyalty to your comrades. This is something a PvP game needs deerly in my opinion and its the only thing keeping it from becoming a call of duty style death match. There needs to be other groups other than the s who want to kos you. There needs to be some nice people mixed in to keep things from becoming bland. In rust unless you get invited into some gaming clan your screwed from the get go. Noone will talk with you. If you are super lucky you might find someone willing to talk but this is rare because these sorts of people don't play this game.TL DR This game is bad because there is literally no break from the intensity of full loot PvP. There is little politics other than one guy is stronger than another so he will kill him without mercy. This makes it a bland game that is nothing more than a deathmatch which is ok but not what I'm looking for in a full loot pvp game.",Rust

2016-02-21,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,This is a review on an Alpha stage game so my opinion might change soon.The fights and battles in this game are great if you are in fair fight but that is only positive thing I can say about this game.You spend more time running looking for items gathering resources and building than actually have fun. Hunting is almost none existant. It lacks animals for hunting animals are too uncommon unless you count killing other players for loots as hunting. Dont bother playing this game alone and build a secured home since it just gonna get destroyed and raided in just a day after you finished it.People in game are so cancerous especially the huge clans who bullies weaker players repeatedly. You cant trust anyone because almost everyone kills you on sight. If you are solo you cant gather up materials to build a secured home and decent weapons for more than 2 hours without getting attacked. You gonna get killed and raided by heavily armed kids with sniper rifles automatic rifles and bombs just for sport repeatedly while you are still a stone age player with sticks and stones. You are forced to have your friends play with you or join a group or a clan if you wanna last long to have fun I say just play Battle Royale mode if you want to waste time gathering and making items. The game still needs huge balance fixes. After all this game is still in Alpha stage and repeatedly being scrap for more than 2 years. It is being updated once a week or more. I say wait to play the game when it is out from Early Access.TL DRGet friends or join a group or a clan to have fun unless if you wanna invest a huge amount of time enough to be able to fair up against gun weilding players.,Rust

The problem is that it is almost impossible because every second there will be a crap with a gun to shoot you in the head or a glitching bear / wolf to somehow teleport to you or go through a mountain to kill you after you gathered so many resouces.You cant find yourself building a proper base but if you have a team of atleast 7 friends.Even if you did succeed to build a base you go to sleep wake up at morning and find out that you have been raided after the whole hard work.This game is full of toxic kids that their main goal is to kill and destroy everything in their way with no mercy.The official servers in rust are wiped every month which is b*llsh*t because even if you could protect your base from the as*holes that trying to wreck you to pieces you lose everything and start over again.This game is full of cheaters and liars.

2016-12-08,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,"You know the game seems like it would be fun but the problem is you just can't start the game at this point as a new player if you are alone. If you play it with others then MAYBE you can survive longer than 30 minutes. Here is a summary of the game as a new player Wake up you are literally butt a 'd nekkid with nothing but a rock and torch. Run over a tree bang on it with the rock GET SHOT.Respawn literally butt nekkid (again) sneak over to a tree bang on it with a rock GET SHOT. Respawn literally butt nekkid (again) run over to a stone bang on it with a rock GET SHOT. Respawn literally butt nekkid (again) sneak over to some bushes wait a bit look around until you think its clear sneak carefully to hemp plant or mushroom to pick it for food so you don't starve GET SHOT. Type irate text into the server chat about how they are D bags and A holes for killing a helpless noob naked person and how they must feel a real sense of accomplishment. Respawn literally butt nekkid (again) starve to death.Exit try a new server.Repeat.The problem is that if you were playing the game from the beginning then you are roaming around with AK 47s body armor grenades rockets and C4 while noob savages are just trying to survive for 30 minutes at time to build a wooden lean to. This game MIGHT be fun if you can find that just right server by yourself or if you band together with a group of friends (it seems like it would be a good way to survive) but as it is the developer needs to do something if it wants to attract new players. Perhaps a learning server where there is no PVP and you can carry simple items and crafting materials over to the non tutorial server? Also I know the game is still in Alpha so its hard to talk bad about it too much. I will check back again periodically to see if the experience gets better but as it is you either need a group of friends to survive find the ""perfect server"" where the D bags are minimal which probably does not exist or the developer needs to make some changes. But maybe just maybe the deveoper doesn't want to make any changes because this is the exact way they want it to be. Who knows.But at least I got it on sale for $9!",Rust

2017-11-13,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a blank canvas the devs refuse to paint on. It is one of the few open world survival games that both runs well and looks fantastic the team has done a great job of creating the procedurally generated map system and the mechanical basis for a great open world game. With that being said here's why the game itself is terrible and the question must be asked why has this team been chasing it's preverbial tail for the last 4 years?Everything Rust could have been if Garry didn't have the artistic taste of a potato https //youtu.be/C5GYZoTGEUgWTF IS RUST SUPPOSED TO BE?Sadly the team seems to lack creative vision to do anything with this great game engine. The gameplay hasn't gotten past a PUBG style battle arena with crafting there is little to do but farm scrap and metal to build guns to kill other players with so you can get their scrap to build guns to kill other players with to get their scrap to build guns to kill other players with... There is no over arching narative very little in the world to interact with and the survival elements are so simple there is more incentive to just go around killing other players than actually trying to survive. It feels like Rust started as a survival game that went unfinished then tried to mimic other successful open world titles (in theory) even though those features either were never fully implemented or ever fleshed out beyond concept art. It seems Garry wanted to gain some of the success Ark and PUPG have had without ever understanding it much less executing on it. In Ark there are ruins dungeons and baddies you have to fight to get to the good loot and all of it centers around slowly unfolding what the Ark is how you got there and what happened to those who went before you. In Rust we find a single NPC a tank that you cannot easily fight and many atmospheric locations buildings and tunnels that are mostly empty. We've had tons of great ideas and concept art from the Rust team as to what the lore environment and characters of Rust could be and none of it has seen a code commit. Rust has no lore no driving exestential question or struggle to hand the player and is about as nuanced (unsurprisingly) as Garry's Mod. Garry's vision for the game has about as much flavor as a plain potato and it seems his creative team is being stunted by it. In PUBG players are similarly dropped on a deserted island and forced to scrounge for resorces in order to kill each other. Rust has started including air drops and arial bombardment events (the helicopter) just like PUBG. All recent developer time has been spent on tweaking the loot crafting and firearm combat systems to more resemble a battle arena fps than an open world survival and exploration game. Rust will never be on par with PUBG though since it can take days to craft decent weapons and gear you will almost always be outclassed by large groups of people and there is no victory or acheivement you just keep killing until someone else kills you while you are offile and takes your stuff. WHAT DOES THIS GAME NEED TO BE GOOD?This team needs someone with a singular creative vission to take the reigns and move the game forward in one direction. To either abandon the exploration and lore aspects to focus on rapid crafting and PVP combat or to focus on PVE features first fleshing out the world's lore inhabitants and challenges and balancing out the PVP later. This game has gone through highschool (4years) and still doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up.TLDRRust needs to figure out what it wants to be and needs strong leadership to flesh out a creative vision to move the game development past simply constantly tweaking the crafting and combat system.,Rust

2013-12-18,0,0,152,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. It takes Minecraft and puts into a realistic world that is massivley online. I only have one problem with this game pvp servers I do not play on them there are servers you can play on that take away the pvp.*Edit after having more hours on the game*In the previous version of this review I said that I hated the PVP. This was only because I did't have very much experience on the game and I did't know how the PVP worked at the time and after having over 100 hours on the game I see that the PVP is actually really fun. there are really good raiding mechanics also because it is actually pretty balanced. Just about the only way to break into a house is to get C4 which is very hard to obtain and most of the time it will take 2 3 C4 to break down a wall whilst metal doors take 4 5. The PVP is actually pretty tactical as you can be offed with a single shot to the head and just a few shots to the torso. I still do recommend PVE servers to new players just because the game takes a little getting used to like how the mechanics work just because the game is actually pretty unique as far as survival games go but overall I have had a TON of fun with this game and really love it. If you are looking for a good survival game with an option of PVE or PVP then this game is the way to go in my eyes.There are also lots of updates to come for this game so you will get bored of the game just to come back and see that there was an update. Making you want to play the game again to see all of the new features that they have added. There is one factor that might put off some players the game as of now is only online so there is no single player included and the servers for the game are about $20 USD a month if you want to make you own which to some people is very pricey.,Rust

Get as far away from civilisation as possible otherwise you'll get caught in the spawn collect die repeat cycle.. Other than that if you are someone who is high and mighty with guns and a heavily fortified base.. Stop being to people who have nothing If they are a threat atleast fire warning shots unless they are trying to raid you.,Rust

2013-12-11,0,0,15,True,Recommended,Good survival game. It has it's down falls but it has a lot of content to keep you occupied for a couple weeks or however much you play. One thing that is bad about this game is the community but even successful games (LoL WoW etc) have a negative community so don't put much stock in that arena. Overall the survival is what makes this a better than average game. Some people like to just start a character and become a loot goblin within the first couple hours. This game isn't for you. You have to be strategic and mindful of how you gather your supplies. When you aren't battling against the zombies and the aggressive animals (which is a good change of pace since most animals in survival games just let you kill them) you have to watch out for the people. I've found most people can be helpful but you always have your bandits in survival games.Give it a try it's only $20 bucks and I'm sure more content will come slowly throughout the next year or so. Enjoy!,Rust

2017-01-29,0,0,1778,True,Recommended,So lets start by saying i came into this game expecting to pick up quick and get rock and rolling.... well not so much. it is a very brutal game that will you off over and over again untill you become the monster the game molds you to be. well thats not always a bad thing expecially when you become freinds with random nakeds and create some badass bases! mastering your own design and getting betrayed by the ones you hold dear (other nakeds).Then again it creates teamwork and disipline unless you wanna lose your base in a day or two that is. so with about 700 hrs+ into this game im addicted!!!!,Rust
2016-07-09,0,0,1686,True,Recommended,This must be the best game i have ever played. its very fun once you get to learn all the game mechanics. you chose how you play no one can tell you how to do it. you can play as the biggest on the server. the nice guy. or perhaps someone in between. the pvp in this game is amazing. no other game made my heart pump as hard and fast as rust. the developers have alot of love for this game and their updating all the time. its sometimes buggy. but the are hardly ever game breaking. ive played this game for over 20 hours in a row without getting bored. just buy it!!! and btw expect to rage a lot but nothing will ever beat the feeling of killing someone with so much good gear that you re set for life! the raiding is perfect. it doesnt take forever to get enough c4 to raid. but it doesnt take to short either. this game is not a pure boring survival game. its a open world game where you can do pretty much everything. build a town! kill your enemies! make friends! betray your friends! make new friends! and get betrayed by them because everyone now knows your a backstabber!,Rust

2018-06-02,1,2,12,False,Not Recommended,This game has the potential to be fun but after spawning in about 20 different times and on multiple servers I can comfortably say that Rust promotes an environment for edgy children to run around throw racial slurs and other derogatory terms. At first I was okay with it but after several encounters I noticed that most of the player base was the same and they were all comfortable because they knew they could get away with the racist crap they say on a daily basis. Regardless if you have friends and can find an empty server go for it other than that this isn't a game I would recommend.,Rust

2017-06-19,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,After hearing some initial positive comments as well as the positive ratings on Steam I decided to pick this game up for a cheap price earlier this year. Worst purchase so far..The graphics are fine and there is a big menu of craftable items but that's the only redeeming point about Rust.When you join a server you will find yourself in a cluster of little houses all over the place destroying any kind of immersion instantly. Soon (on a crowded server) and with that I mean 1 3 minutes you find another naked player attacking you for no reason with a stone. After dying or surviving you continue your path to only have this happen again and again and ing again. Within 30 minutes of playing I ''met'' eight different people and all attacked me while they had nothing and I had nothing. And this all with 16 year olds screaming at you through their mics or cursing on the chat channel.After my first experience I waited a couple of days read some guides and tried to build something up.I tried this for three times. Both times I got killed by guys with machine guns or whatever. No chances to hide no chances to build somewhere secluded. At one moment I finally build a simple shack I could not find any stone in my nearby area to I went to walk around. After being killed by two guys with a shotgun I took a one hour break. When I started the game up again I spawned and walked back to my base only to find out that it completely had been dissapeared... I dont know if it was the game (decaying) or other players but it was complete to lose my first little 2x2 house within two ing hours. The world has little fiolage and you can see people from miles away doing their stuff. In addition to that the world looks bland and it does not invite you to explore or gives you a feeling of being in a wasteland. I mean this game could be ''Oke'' but it is just pure with the community of foul language and non stop fresh spawn killing.For a real survival experience there are tons of better options as well as better options for online survival.,Rust
2014-02-26,0,0,444,True,Recommended,Having orignally given this game negative feedback I am now satisfied with it enough to recommend it.I would advise all prospective players to avoid the main servers as they tend to be over populated and fun sucking. However if you can find a community server with an average of 20 regular players you are laughing!Me and my boyfriend play on this every night and have been lucky enough to find a decent server. Although there is raiding going on it adds an element of fun to the game. There is also an economy starting where people are trading materials its quite fun to watch!Word to the wise if you are not fond of dieing..... often... this game is not for you!,Rust

2016-07-27,1,2,36,True,Not Recommended,OKAY! This game. What to say about this game...I'm gonna try and keep this fair and unbalanced as I see it so here goes. Pros 1. Really grindy. Granted I like grinding for items others may not but to get what you want you're gonna have to grind2. Weapons handle nicely. Pistols have low recoil and low damage shotguns have high recoil and high damage.3. Populations for everyone. Wanna play with 100+ people? Got a server for you! wanna play with 0? gotta server for you!4. Mechanics are pretty well set up. Building crafting food/water ect. Granted the resource collection is a bit...odd like you getting 25 50 wood per hit from a tree but its offset by high requirements for items so...do what you will5. This game is centered around friends. Making them keeping them joining them ect.Now for the Cons 1. The grinding can become tiresome at some point. 2. Speaking of weapons your choices as a newbie are run or lose everything you have because too many people camp the spawn areas with the weapons.3. The population you meet is more than likely going to kill you if you do not go in with your friends from the start.4. you will die. A lot. I know that the point of a survival horror is to die at first and slowly get better but its hard to even get started when you have everything from pipe guns to flamethrowers (personal experience) shoved down your throat even when all you have is a rock and some wood.5. food can be EXTREMELY hard to come by so you'll be forced to kill another person just for that (see 4).So all in all if you are looking for a fun and challanging survival game pick this up. The only REAL reason that I don't recommend this is because its been in alpha for quite some time. It's being updated constantly sure but the fact that its in alpha means that its gonna be VERY buggy and people who can exploit this will ruin your game. So my advice as someone who's played since week 1 proceed at your own risk,Rust

2014-02-26,0,0,21,True,Recommended,OK SO IT IS MY TIME TO REVIEW SOME THING GTHIS GAME IS THE ITS RLY FUN IF YOU HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND TIES TO DO IT!1 OF COURSE EVERY TIME I GOT ON IT WAS WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN IT IS ALSO VERY EXCITING BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST A FEW PEOPLE THAT CAN EITHER SLOWLY TURN INTO A BIG VILLAGE OR JUST CAMP OUT SOMEWHERE IN HIDING.(Okay done with caps)However whilst playing by myself the intensity of the game really was overwhelming but in a good way. It's hard to stay alive the first few days if you don't know what you're doing or just in general but once you get the small necessities it's actually very fun. I wish I could play it more often. Some of the servers are really creative seeing how the makers put some tight boundaries... I like the eerie survival attitude and I think anyone out there who likes those games where you find loot and kill animals will like Rust uwu,Rust
2014-12-20,0,0,287,True,Recommended,My friend told me to get this game. I was kinda skeptical about it since it was a survival game in early access like the money making ones that stopped getting developed after the devs got their money. But when I heard Garry Newman took over rust I had no doubt.He made Garry's Mod which was an obvious success. Good to know there is legit people making the game not just some random company that may be trying to jack money. The game itself was the first game I ever played 8 hours on in a day. Sure its in early developement has some lag spikes glitches. ITS IN EARLY DEVELOPEMENT. It gets so frustrating when you die so much but once you progress and finally make your house and get a footholding the fun begins.*BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE* 10/10 no doubt even with all the underdeveloped aspects,Rust

2014-03-10,0,0,36,True,Recommended,Rust is a great multiplayer only (for now??) game it is very addictive you can compare it a bit to Minecraft (crafting builing &amp MP PvP Survival) but with improved graphics and pretty modern weapons. I recommend this game for competitive players that have experience with Minecraft or games like DayZ and 7 Days to Die. The game is still in Alpha stage so be aware that you might encounter bugs and such for example the movement of other players is not very smooth and animated. The anti cheat engine needs to be improved it seems not very hard to bypass anti cheat systems like VAC on this game a active server with active staff seems to temp solve the problem. The developers are active and work hard to improve the game!Buy and play on a nice server!,Rust

2016-06-16,0,0,198,True,Recommended,Great game recommended to everyone who seeks distraction for many many hours days or months in a world full of adventure! Runs great on Linux and AMD graphics cards (GCN equally so pre GCN).Beware! Enforced gender!Rust chooses gender and race randomly and attaches it to your steam ID. Up until now (July 2017) there is no way to change it. The Dev team obviously sees this as part of a public gender education (read about why they did it). The flaw in their reasoning is though that if they wanted to educate us on the equality of gender and races then we should at least randomly get the opportunity to play in all available combinations. But that's not the case. As a player you're stuck forever with what you get in the beginning.So beware as you may end up with a gender and race you don't like forever and there is no way to change it.,Rust
2016-11-28,0,0,131,True,Recommended,I started playing rust because my friend told me that it was a fun game. When i started playing i was killed alot and i mean alot people are going to kill you for no reason and steal your stuff which isn't very funny. But when you have survived long enough to build a base then the fun begins you slowly progress and get better loot and better weapons and soon you can take down other peoples bases and steal their resources (you should expect that other people are going to raid your base too).9/11 because of ninja bears,Rust

2014-01-14,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,So... imagine every frustrating aspect of DayZ in that you have a bunch of morons running around killing on sight. Okay now imagine you can't find weapons to defend yourself with. This includes against animals and apparently zombies that even after (some miracle of course) if you manage to find enough stone to make a hatchet you are quite literally unable to put up a decent fight. Hitting even defenseless animals is stupid because it takes forever (my experience was chasing a pig halfway across creation with a hatchet) and will probably lead you to another player with a firearm or a zombie or run you past a wolf or a bear.Yeah... Also no character customization and head bobbing making my guts churn I think I can safely say play DayZ and this game.,Rust
2016-06-27,0,0,1233,True,Recommended,"I'm going to explain how this game is and if you want to play it or not. There is a lot of good reviews and a lot of negative reviews. But I'll explain. This game personally and I mean really personally I have more then 750 hours in is absolutely great. All these good reviews will tell you all about how amazing the game really is and how much time you will spend if you really want to play it. Now lets talk about all the negative reviews. This game Rust is meant to be really hard It's always been a really hard and brutal game. If you run into other players they're 9/10 going to kill you hands down. That's just how the game is. You grind you build you have fun you die a lot you might be getting raided but all that is a part of the fun. The complete brutal hard game of Rust is what makes this game so enjoyable. You gotta think you gotta plan this is a game where you wont even be on the game and you will be thinking about it like ""How are we going to raid these guys"" or ""I wonder if my house is raided."" Or anything about the game. Rust if you really want to get into it can be a second priority a fun one. Hands down if you give the game a try and don't mind how hard the game is you will spend way more hours then you would know it. The 750 hours that went by flew by and I've had so many memories and fun times. I konw 1 000hrs is coming right around the corner easily. Listen to me guys give the game a try and don't post a negative review because you died and can't handle a hard brutal game! Now lets talk about bugs. The game looks nice but there are some minor bugs and stuff that honstly shouldn't be a problem. The one thing is Optimization. Optimization on Rust needs some working on so you can run the game on a good card but may not even get good fps. It all depends and if you tweek the settings anyways it can run nice and smooth. Also depends on how many people are in the server or ping or the server hoster. But if you find a nice smooth server for you you will ruin your life spending hours on Rust. &lt And I mean that in a good way. ) . Just give it a go and give it a CHANCE and have fun. )",Rust

2017-04-05,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,"I really do not understand why people claim this game is so good. It lacks any meaningful depth or narrative or a reason to do what you're doing other than ""survive"" on an island filled with glitchy animals poor animations and a survival aspect that's about as deep as a puddle after a light summer rain. There's no real progression or any special aspect to your character you don't level up or gain experience or anything when you perform actions in game. Your character doesn't mean anything. He/she doesn't learn how to craft better as the game goes on it's the same regardless of how long you play.You could certainly say that there's a ""goal"" so to speak and that's to get the best gun/armor or whatever in game. Well...once you do get that it can be taken away from you almost immediately if someone decides they don't like you. And even then what's the point of having the best gun? You use it to kill other players? Okay.... what useful thing do you get out of killing other players? Nothing. Once you get the best things in the game it basically turns into Hoarding Simulator (as one other notable reviewer called it). Or maybe you want to build the best base?Also easily taken away explosives and rocket launchers etc all make destroying player built structures a breeze and that's not a good thing. And I'd might be able to forgive the game if there was a bigger PvE aspect to it! Right now there's... animals. And an attack helicopter that randomly spawns and will kill you pretty damn quickly if you're caught outside with an arbitrary amount of clothing on you for some reason. There's no dungeons or places you can raid that are defended by AI it's all empty. Oh but of course you need radiation protection because for some reason the notable landmarks are radioactive. Graphics wise...The lighting is good but the textures animations modeling are all ...pretty bad. Subpar. Low resolution textures pigs that look like they're modeled out of crayola model magic animations that look like they took about 10 15 minutes to make at the most. I know game development is more complicated than I make it out to be but come ON put some actual effort into making swinging an axe actually look realistic vs. a man wildly swinging his arms like he's an a tightrope and losing his balance. Overall I feel like I cannot recommend this game. PvE PvP whatever it's all very lacking and subpar. There's no reason to play there's no driving force to do anything. It's not even that good looking of a game.",Rust

2018-01-02,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,I didn't want to give this game a negative review. I didn't want to give this game a positive review either. See _I've never actually played this game_...I bought the game with a gift card on the recommendation of my 40 *coughcough* brother and my twelve almost thirteen nephew. And while the display above shows that I've spent 8.1 hours playing the game that figure actually represents the amount of time I've spent downloading files and syncing with servers before the game's client crashed. After four days of trying I uninstalled the game and asked Steam for a refund.But here's the funny thing Steam has playtime limit of 2 hours for all refunds. And the 8.1 hours I spent downloading files and syncing with servers counts as playtime even though again _I've actually never played the game_.So given my experience with it I cannot recommend anyone actually buy this game until a more stable version is released. Maybe even wait until beta testing. Since I can't get a refund I'll check back in from time to time to see if they've advanced to beta and give it a try then. If I can get the game to work at that time I'll change this review to reflect the actual gameplay instead of the crashing client.,Rust

The group with more people will always win. People can't online raid since they will just rebuild things and respawn with guns where as you can't unless you have an excessively sized zerg of course.

The base of this game is what I have been searching for. The thought of coming into a world with next to nothing and coming out the boss of the whole server is exiting. The raiding experience is so much fun. Grab a few friends and go break into someone's house and stealing all there stuff. There are a few moments when you get ransacked and lose all your hard earned stuff but that is just the fun in the game. And the rush you feel when the person you are raiding is coming home and you are now in the same house is intence.,Rust

2017-11-02,0,0,704,True,Recommended,My first 150 hours of Rust have been incredibly enjoyable. The gameplay isn't hard to get into once you know the basics but there's always another way to do something better than before and I really like that the PvP element pushes you to learn from your mistakes and improve your methods whether it's constructing your base more efficiently or moving and dodging more effectively. What's more is that Rust continues to evolve with each update released. I'm always finding new ways to build bases and traps and new tactics to outplay the people who live around me and the updates just keep introducing new possibilities and styles of play. What makes Rust so good (in my opinion) is that it doesn't force you to play a certain way. Sure you can go all out with a big group and big guns but if you'd rather trick your opponents and lure them into devious traps or ambush them while they're doing a recycling run you can do that. The community continues to amaze me with unique tactics you never know what to expect from another player.While the visuals aren't exactly next gen they are VERY pretty and the sounds really match the ambience of the the overall game. Sitting in your base next to a barbeque while the sun sets and listening to the subtle crackling of the charcoal or rustling through bushes in the pitch black darkness of night and watching the moon lit silhoutte of a deer on the horizon it's beautiful. I've heard many negative things about the recent twig and blueprint updates and I too was sceptical at first but after playing through it I can wholeheartedly say that I support these changes and I think they really help the early game stages stretch out which is something that I feel is necessary for a survival game like Rust. I love that the team is still working hard on the game and producing regular updates with new and interesting content.TL DR Great gameplay great visuals great fun.,Rust

Create weapons hunt for food and resources to maintain surviving. As of right now (Alpha version) do not trust Official Servers to many people using a downloaded script or .exe file to fly through the air shoot you through mountains and other solid objects as well as magically appearing in front of you.

2015-03-29,0,0,266,True,Not Recommended,I enjoyed the game for the first few weeks. Over all this game is loaded with hackers which really makes it unplayable. You build a base then hackers just fly through your walls. Reinforcing the buildings and making armored doors is pointless because when you log off some hacker will just fly in your base and destroy all your items. Its happened to me about 15 times now I Log back in and all my stuff is gone and all my walls are intact. The admins on Rustafied are aware of a hacker named baezil but they dont really care because they are friends with him. So admins just let hackers run around. Another problem with the game is that the admins do not have a replay mode so they have to catch the hackers in the process of doing things wrong. I regret buying this I wish I could sell it at this point.,Rust

I read through atleast 100 reviews and almost every thumbs down review I saw was a complain about how Rust is unbalanced or the toxic community or can't even get started on wipe day or any day or even the aim cone is all about luck and leasy amount of skill is needed for Rust. All this to me are just a bunch of guys who just had a super bad wipe day and went straight to give it a thumbs down and quit the game. Rust is so much more than getting roasted and KOS. It's the interaction I know a lot of times it's very hard to find that interaction but when you find it when you were striving for it for so long you make new friends. Also about the aim cone don't ing spray and pray how about you burst for oncei n your life time you freaking plebs.

If you can t handle having your base taken over after you spent a day building it this game is not for you.This is a game whos player base is full of toxic trolls.

2013-12-20,0,0,504,True,Not Recommended,"Welcome to Home Invasion Simulator 2013. Many people ask what the point of this game is when they join a server the general response is ""survive"". This is a misconception the object of this game is to learn how to make explosives and C4. After you have accomplished this you simply raid and slaughter other players for their materials. The community you will be presented with will be of players begging for starting gear and not to be slayed as they are new spawns. You will turn around to take a step and suddenly billy bob found a shotgun and isn't so friendly anymore. While a fresh and fun new idea it is executed poorly as of now. The system of learning new materials will require all of an hour running around to go from a rock to M4 + full kevlar (even after the new patch). You could spend hours building and fortifying your base feeling safe and snug. 2 3 C4 charges will blow down your wall / door and you will learn as do we all it's simply a waste of time to bother with building any structure in this game.Seriously if you do consider buying this game and playing right now remember this.

2016-07-17,0,0,157,True,Not Recommended,The supposed premise of this game You wake up naked on a beach. Armed with a rock and a rudimentary torch you must craft and gather and slay your way to survival via all sorts of exciting situations. The reality of Rust The game loads and your little nude avatar gets an arrow bullet or rocket to the skull from a band of fully geared up armoured Russians or Brazilians within 3 seconds. Sometimes you don't even have to witness your own death the game loads up and you're already dead because your newly appeared body was killed in limbo while logging in. If you survive spawning you can then harvest up to 50 wood or 16 stone before being capped. If by some insane miracle you find a relatively quiet area and manage to harvest enough wood stone and hemp to make a proper start for yourself you will find that the front door of your home is removed very easily in seconds when the raging plebian hordes arrive and with it goes any progress that you may have made. There is only one way to survive in this game and that is to join said band of plebians and go around shooting harmless naked men with your AK 47. For the regular solo player looking for a little enjoyment Rust is more like a mod for Woodcutter Simulator 2013. A mod that adds the ability to die relentlessly over and over again while chopping. For the sort of people who enjoy pulling off spiders legs and are afraid of fighting alone it's a homo erotic sadism experience not to be missed. 10/10 Ramsay Bolton.,Rust

It is frustrating trying to survive at first what with everyone and their brother killing you with rocks to assault weapons. Until you make a friend. Then you die together. Then you make more friends. Then you die as a group. Then you have half a dozen naked dudes running around actually getting enough resources to survive and build a base make some clothes and generally survive a little easier. Maybe you find some weapons of your own and the blueprints to make them. Eventually you and your cadre of fellow survivors are wandering around the beach killing naked dudes with rocks as you search for loot and houses to raid. Then it dawns on you you and yours have become those guys who made life so difficult when you first started.10/10 for being a great experiment into sociology and the base behaviors of humanity itself.,Rust

2015-06-12,0,0,3488,True,Recommended,"As I close in on 3 000 hours of Rust I thought it wise to augment and expand upon my original review.TL DR This game is crazy and you might be for playing it but you should play this game!What even is Rust?? RUST IS IN EARLY ACCESS AND CHANGES WEEKLY! In its current (and by far BEST) iteration the game can be broken down into a few stages. First you will spawn naked on a beach with nothing but a rock and torch. You will use your rock to gather resources such as wood stone metal ore and sulfur ore. The wood and stone will allow you to craft early tools and weapons like the stone hatchet stone pick axe and spear. Along the way you will want to gather the hemp plants for cloth to make clothes and a hunting bow. Finding and eating mushrooms corn and pumpkin so you don't starve to death is also a bonus! Second gathering enough wood and stone to build a structure is key. You will need a base to be in when you log off and to store all the goodies you'll be coming across as you explore the island. After your base is up you'll search for junk piles containing barrels and crates. In these you will find useful items and components which u can return to your base or recycle for scrap the marrow of the game. Scrap is life. It allows you to research found items so you can craft them and can be a valuable trade commodity. Without scrap the revolver you found can't be replaced without some luck if you die with it as you would not have researched it and thus can not craft a new one once you've re spawned. Spawn gather build collect. That's the rhythm of the game.What to expect This can depend greatly on where you start playing. If you jump right into a high population server you can expect zero mercy. You will be hunted down moments after spawning while still naked carrying nothing but your rock and torch. Chances are the person killing you will be talking trash about you being a newb and telling you to ""git gud"". If you enjoy trial by fire this will be up your alley. You could also choose to start on a low population server or find and empty server to get your legs under you. In any case Rust is ruthless and every person you see should be viewed as the enemy. Hide shoot first or die. There are also PvE (player vs environment) servers where you're unable to kill people or destroy their buildings. These can be good for getting your feet wet but will certainly give you an unrealistic expectation of what the game really is.Finally expect that once you've spent hours building your nice little base hidden off in some corner of the woods hours collecting resources and materials to expand your arsenal and hours enjoying yourself that you will log in one day and find some one has blown into your base with explosives killed your sleeping body and taken all your possessions. That is Rust. If you can't handle it this game isn't for you.So is it even worth it? The shortest and best answer I can think of is ABSOLUTELY. The satisfaction of finally finding that item you've been looking for from getting your first air drop from killing your first tormentor to narrowly evading the patrol helicopter as you scurry home with a full inventory to taking out the Bradley IFV patrolling the launch site to your first big score on a raid is unmatched in any game I've played. Sure the low points can make you question your sanity for putting yourself through this and question the very foundations of humanity and morality but in the end it's a game and triumph can take many forms and there are many paths with which to achieve it.In conclusion I recommend this game to anyone. Never played a FPS? Doesn't matter. Aren't big on survival games? Doesn't matter. Aren't an insane sociopath? Doesn't matter. In Rust you will find a niche modded server a worthy adversary a despicable villain or a true friend. You will discover the joys and art of creating structures painting signs and pictures or exploring. You may take pride in playing fair and being noble or revel in playing the profligate. In any case you will find something to love about this game.Ten out of Ten Original Review ""They finally got some long needed fixes taken care of. This game is awesome. FAR superior to the original iteration. I have plowed through many hours of both. If you're new find a PVE server so you can learn the ropes. Once you know how to get through the first few hours without dying constantly can quickly make a semi secure base and know how to find and shoot guns you can try PVP. What I've Noticed PVE Becomes boring rather quickly as there is no real threat to you other than a sneaky bear or wolf or an attempt to quickly enter a RadTown before you have the equipment to survive. PVP Is nearly impossible unless you start on a server with a very recent complete wipe. If you decide to play PVP I highly recommend you find a fresh wipe server even if the ping isn't ideal. If you are part of a group of at least 3 very active and smart players you can pick a slightly older wipe server.""",Rust

2018-01-06,0,0,134,True,Not Recommended,"At first you will think that this game is going to be a pretty great survival game. Then you'll want to quit in frustration when you can't even get off the starting beach without being killed by other naked players or hunted by people in full armor with assault rifles for fun. Then you'll manage to find a space to build a little base and start to actually play the game. Just as you think ""ok maybe this will be good"" somebody destroys your base for no real reason other than they think it is funny. You have nothing but the learned blueprints. So you start over faster this time since you know what you're doing. But within a week you realize...it doesn't matter what you do. Someone is always going to blow up your base and kill you just for fun. You might then move to a server that purports to be noob friendly. Within an hour of starting you return home to find someone has destroyed the door to your base and put up their own so you have lost all that. Then you try to find a new place to build only to have someone with a rifle randomly kill you. You might reflect that it was noob friendly because you managed to survive a whole hour.Now this is not a survival game. In a survival situation humans do not randomly murder one another and even when they raid each other people do not maliciously break things. Rust has a lot of potential to be fun but the way it is now it only takes one or two malicious players to completely ruin any fun that most everyone else is having. This means that even if you go onto a more laid back server perhaps one claiming to be noob friendly those handful of players will still make you not want to play. The gameplay is completely dominated by PvP except that it isn't really PvP. It is players with explosives and assault rifles versus players new to the server. I suppose if you want to drag yourself through a couple of weeks of gameplay you might be able to draw even with them in blueprints but then so what? That just means that you are constantly being raided. Any GAME that has such drastic PvP in which everything you own can be lost should have non PvP zones at least as an option for the server. The gameplay is justified in that ""we want people to do what they want to do"" and supposedly limiting player choice in any way or setting up artificial rules would hinder the game. However any sort of claims to real player choice is silly since people don't really respawn metallurgy is not actually that simple and a stone ax doesn't really take a whole tree to make. The game is made of up of arbitrary and unrealistic rules. I don't see how adding in rules that bring in new players and keep people playing would be worse than rules that allow a person to run around blowing up the homes of new players for no gain other than mean spirited fun.Either this is a survival sim or a game for fun. If it is a survival sim PvP is unrealistic because murder and destruction are not something that happen without consequence. If it is a game for fun the fun is somewhat ruined by the overly malicious PvP.",Rust

We thought we had it until a gang of 5 came up so we hid in the forest one of my friends perished yet I guarded his stuff with my machine gun I heard people saying ""Come out"" I sprayed the machine gun until I ran out of ammo but a swift shotgun hit to the back of the head put me out for good my friend continued trying to avoid them he broke his leg and was found.

What they did was take away zombies. They piggy backed the hype of day z by releasing a zombie game (which i think is reat its the whole reason i bought rust) only to take the money and then completly change the game. If you are interested in the game then WAIT UNTIL ITS 100% FULLY REALEASED or some or all of the parts you like about it may change.

2015-11-14,0,0,248,True,Recommended,Rust ? Well Rust is a long story little sport. Sit down and let me tell you. It's not a Game eventualy it becomes your Life. If you want to have fun get it with friends or make some friends on Rust (wouldn't recommend it).I played for a while alone had a hut a thompson and had fun alone. Played a few hours a day and I was done. Then I went for building a Clan biggest mistake in my life. We were a group of 15 back in the days when there were no compounds that was crazy. We played day and night there was always someone guarding the Base. We were from different natunalities so it was easy to keep track of it. It was always about the last tree to chop the last ore to collect or the last base to raid.It was intense we were playing for 40 hours straight from the new wipe so we can be faster than the other groups.And the things is... you never see the time past by playing rust. You could think that making a base and going offline is ok but no.... The Rust life doesn't let you do that. It makes the Game your first worries in the morning... It was for 2 weeks straight I could not sleep well or long just because of the fact that you don't have a time out or a pause like in other games.You have to constant fear of beeing attack by other players and Rust is the only game that has given me that thrill until now. No other games has gotten me to the point where I am sweating and shaking like crazy because I am nervous if i miss a shot well because if you miss it you will lose all of your It's like real life a couple of million years in the future a post apocalyptic world would just look like this just naked people protecting their Rock...

The gane still runs like s*** but has been improved without adoubt. This game also needs to get a better anti cheat system because seeing some dude no clip through a wall is stupid and annoying.A couple of things could be improed maybe add a system that you level up (like in ARK) and you have to unlock the guns with like a skill point or something like that. Maybe make the metal hatchet better because in my eyes having a stone hatchet collect 20 wood and then have the metal hatchet collect 25 is a bit stupid I understand overall it collects more but it doesnt make any sense what so ever.This is an idea i came up with a couple of friends the idea is to be able to aim with the spear but the longer you aim the less the amount of damage you do to someone after you throw it and maybe add an offline mode to the gameIn conslusin the game is great but it could be massively improved on the PvP side.EDITThe PvP is better much better and is no longer clunky. I also like the new system with the blueprint fragments because it allows new players to get acquated with the game and the experianced players become more experienced with the game.,Rust

2015-03-01,0,0,179,True,Recommended,I am like many of you guys most likely. I have a computer that really isnt ment to be gamed on. I try my best to make the games work. When I got Rust that is exactly what I did. When I got it I started to play Rust Legacy(which is the best on my type of computer). When I first got on it though it was very laggy. After alot of searching I found a command to lower the lag and raise the FPS significantly(that helped me out a lot). When I tried the newer version of rust though that was a completely different story. When I got on I tried to get to the options by pressing f2. When I finally got on that I saw that I had 1 FPS! That shouldn't happen so I hope in the future that I can get a better computer or the developers for rust some how make the optimization good for basicly any computer. I still rate this a 10/10 because this game offers such a cool survival experience. Also If you are thinking of getting the game just get it. I totally recommend it. If anyone has any info on how to reduce the lag on the new Rust please tell me about it in the comments.,Rust

Starting a match in rust is fun but when you get loot and good stuff it gets dumb. Im not saying raiding is bad but its bad when the raiders leave you alive or at least leave your bag untuched and put a turret infront of your door so you are pretty much screwed until it runs out of ammo but you cant stop them from putting more ammo in it cause your stuck inside. The people who do this kind of thing have no job or any type of life outside of this game. I spent 5 hours on a sunday night tring to get out of the house and get away from the turret. This isnt uncommon If you havent bought this game yet and convinced that you want it then I will warn you that you will get trolled on every server you play on.

2017-07-10,1,2,2292,True,Not Recommended,The idea of a survival game is great. However the game takes forever to load the official servers lag like crazy and the community is horrible. First I acknowledge the game is in beta but the game takes an incredible amount of time to load. I timed it for the review and it takes around 8 14 minutes when starting the game to actual gameplay. There are times when the game freezes midway and forces me to start it up again. If this wasn't something that happened constantly I wouldn't complain about it. Second the official servers are either full or have terrible lag. I live on the east coast any other game's east coast server works fine for me it's only on rust. I know that their are many other community servers that aren't full and aren't laggy. But that just proves facepunch's incompetence. Third the community is mostly awful. If you aren't playing with friends or just started out you will be surprised to find out that everyone loves to kill on sight. It's aweful because if you aren't around during the wipe you have an unfair disadvantage. Lastly like I said before the idea is great and I can see a good game come out of it. However Facepunch needs to step up. As Rust in its current state I would not recommend.,Rust

Good way to teach your kids s. Anyway since they are no longer updating the legacy version and opted to make a completely new game we will see how it turns out.

2014-10-09,1,2,39,True,Recommended,Ok so i went around looking for someone to kill with my spear but it becomes night so i head up in these mountains and i see a base of course all the doors are locked since well its a big base and i look around and on the side of the cliff theres some loot from some dead bodies and in that loot was a key...which unlocked there front door. so i go in an they have tons of ammo a thompson bolt action rifle and a shotgun and while im getting the loot i hear a guy in the other building walk around not knowing im right next too him and i sit there crouch for a good 5 10 m waiting for a chance to sneak away. I did and ran away down the mountain were i found anouther base which some guy was in and it turns out he uses the same key as the base up on top so i break in and take all his stuff (mostly clothes) and he came downstairs right when i was leaving and he had a pistol and started shooting me But i survived and killed him and from now on he will be my very first kill in rust.

2016-12-23,0,0,1022,True,Not Recommended,"Short version Game 7/10Community 0.5/10Long one As many other reviews have mentioned the community around this game is incredibly toxic. On two separate servers I was mocked for not knowing how to begin when there is no in game tutorial (even a single pop up with the basics of hit trees to get wood hit dark grey rocks to get stone and pick up hemp or hit cacti to get cloth would have been enough though the map and sleeping bags could really use an explanation as well). And so after visiting a few extra game websites to figure out how to start playing what's really a pretty simple game I finally began.After waking up naked I ran up to a tree and started hitting it only to hear someone whisper ""Hey buddy"" behind me. I turned around and he killed me with a gun. I woke up naked somewhere else and arrows immediately started flying past my head. I jumped around a bit until the other fellow finally pulled out a gun and killed me. Third time's the charm right? Nope. After waking up naked I started running away from the spawn area only to get sniped at and finally killed by a couple of guys who were quite some distance away.Finally on the fourth try I was able to functionally start playing. After a couple of hours I had a reasonably functioning base cue a guy trying to sneak up and kill me with a silenced rifle. Luckily he was a terrible shot and I got lucky I killed him first. I took all his gear and started exploring to see if I could find some of the stuff I couldn't craft myself. About 10 minutes later I was dead and being looted by a guy with a machine gun.After restarting again and getting a friend involved (who also was new to the game but strength in numbers) I got a reasonable base and plenty of supplies. Had high quality metal bars smelted and could craft most of the stuff in the build menu. That was when I realized why everyone sat around killing other players Unless you're really interested in just exploring the island there's really only about 10 hours of gameplay here. By that time you'll have a fully functioning base good armor and at least a semi automatic rifle. At that point might as well just hunt new players as there's not really anything else left to do.",Rust

2016-11-14,0,0,253,False,Not Recommended,I can't recommend this game UNLESS you play on a modded server with battleroyale OR it's PVE.... Reasons why are below...I played this game back in legacy and I didn't mind it in fact I LOVED it... until I began to realise a constant pattern of the same thing over and over and over again.... What was it you ask? Was it the collection of resources? Was it the endless building? No...I have two words... offline raids (and if you enjoy doing that to people then you're a cowardly dishonorable c**t)This STILL has not been changed I mean I KNOW it's a GAME but think about it logically here... What MORON would stay asleep (which is what your character is doing in rust while offline) when they are getting raided!?The devs need to implement a system where said person has claim of a said area and if all the group who are living there (part of said claimed areas group/guild/faction) are offline then no one can raid the place. For example the buildings in the claimed area are invulnerable until someone from the crew logs on and IF that person decides to leave the crew they can but first have to empty their inventory and when they leave they will automatically be TP'd out of the range of the claim area with only a rock and a torch therefore leaving them the better choice of staying with the crew.... also if someone begins raiding said area and THEN you log off too bad for you... only THEN can they continue to raid you.... so as to prevent combat logging like a pansy just as to prevent offline raiding like a pansy respectively!This is the MAIN Reason I don't like which takes away 90% of my reason TO like it sadly since a similar system has been implemented in another sandbox builder Life is Feudal which overall is a very well made balanced game my review for that is available on here also!,Rust

You start nude with a rock and a torch you approach a base or a house you get shot down. You search for a relatively empty space and build a house you get shot down when you go out and there's people. You grind more materials you get shot down and your grind gets looted.Talk about this in chat and get mobbed by other players.It's stupid all your game progress gets continuously stolen by other players who exchange their bullets for wood.All because the game allows this. People are not this way in other games. What about turning off player damage allow people to choose a faction and territory create pvp areas and safe areas or create a common objective?Only thing to do is craft bases and weapons and destroy other bases.

You WILL be killed continuosly by every thats on the server. You will never get to build anything or achieve anything as everyone thinks its very funny shooting you with thier guns while you run around naked with no weapons. The game spawns you continuosly at random places so even if you started a house somewhere...you will never get back to it. Changing servers you will find that you will have the same problems and eventualy just rage quit.

When you spawn into the world you should fully expect to be shot in the head by another user who might as well be a Seal Team 6 memeber with end game items standing on top of an impentrable base with a sniper rifle shooting anyone in an outrageously large radius. If you happen to get in a server without one of these people you progress towards aquiring basic equipment after collecting unreasonably large quantities of items. If you have gotten this far I applaud you because i havent. I originally bought the game when it first came out in 2013. Now in 2017 the game is just as and unplayable as it is now but with microtransactions. I'd rather buy $20 worth of Bad Rats copies and send them to my friends because that would be more fun than Rust. I highly recommend against purachsing Rust.,Rust

This game is filled with tons of ways to kill or get killed building a base is the most rewarding killing another with alot of loot is a blessing. I extremely recommend a friend to play with which makes it more fun and easier to progress. Now as for the community it is the most toxic at the moment. That's why you just got to be more friendly your voice and manipulation will be your guide. Try avoiding any heavily geard players alot complain in the reviews about how the community and the unfriendly players are what cause them to not have fun just avoid always stay 1 step ahead of them.Furthermore others also tell how there is no ""beginners tutorial"" when you can easily search on Youtube or Google tips and tricks on how to get better a game like this can't have a ""tutorial"" you gotta just have to think ahead and plan. This game is very fun if you ever wanted to practice you can search up Battlefield servers to practice pvp and team work.Only thing that bothers me is the animals being able to go through stone but can be easily countered by placing a foundation you can stand on and axe/spear it to death it's easier after that.",Rust

2016-07-25,2,2,47,True,Not Recommended,Okay im gonna dive right into it. Rust is a good game. The concept is amazing and the mechanics are pretty well done. But i would not recommened this game to anyone with a life. i.e Job Girlfriend or any type of activity that you do that does not take place in your computer chair. Rust is ruined by its god awful community which is by far the worst i have ever EVER witnessed. I'll explain why.The people who play this game are just disgusting and no im not saying this because i juts got raided or died i'm saying this because they are just genuine no life s. If you're a naked with a rock just trying to mine a tree to even take 1 step in the first part of the game you will get shot dead by a level 30 Veteran armed to the teeth full armor AK47 the whole nine yards. It's not even fun i promise you. When you join a server your are always gonna be behind everyone which makes it impossible to even do anything. Noobies are literally dominated by any person with a gun and it will always stay that way. No matter how many times you start over from getting shot on sight you will keep dying and keep losing everything. Hours of resources gone soon as you go offline to go to work sleep or hell even take a i promise you will come back to find everything you have gone. Now i have been raided AND done the raiding and honestly out of the 40 or so hours ive played this game i'd say 3 are doing something actually fun like raiding firefights over air drops etc. But the remaining 27 hours are literally me farming resources getting shot dead. Trying to find food getting shot dead. Aimlessly making some sort of house to protect my 1 stone...... Theeen coming back to find it stolen house broken a sign saying i'm gay... Oh yeah that's right! Shot dead. I promise you people do not play this game with out at least 3 friends becuase if you don't every hour of this game you play it will just be you hitting trees dying hitting rocks dying running around naked getting sprayed down. The game itself has the potential to be very very fun but due to no life kos'ers you will have payed $20 to hit trees get shot while your naked and get robbed everytime you go offline. The new xp system ruins it too but only minorly so i'm gonna go fast to get it over with. IttakeswaytoolongtogetenenoughtXPforanythingusefulorprotectivebutbythetimeyoufinallygetsaidXPyouwillhavegottenraided50thousandtimesandhavedied150milliontimessointheendyou'realwaysatsquare1. Oh and if you usually cant get past square 1 because why? A. B. or C?A. Shot deadB. Shot deadC.

I'll give you a hint..Shot dead.Please please people dont pay money to die every 10 mins to neckbeards that play this game all day. The life you have so far more worth it. GR33KWARR10R,Rust

But this isn't a bad thing because you had fun... and if you didn't your not playing the game right. This might make no sense to new players but throughout my experience some things especially on vanilla have just got so grindy (keep in mind I play solo sometimes) that I start to lose fun in the game. Because if you have played rust as much as I have sometimes its a chore.Don't be hesitant to buy this game once you have read this because what I was just talking about is barely even 20% of your play time the rest is fun but it can vary if you are playing solo or duo etc. because some of the load clears up and plus your most probably playing with friends which I highly recommend. buy this game.. its worth the money and a must have for a steam library.,Rust

The ammount of adrenalin running thrugh you was unlike any other game ive played I had high hopes for Rust then everything changed when Facepunch attacked.Lets not go over the two weeks of DDoS Rust faced that was just a phase to make the servers better and it worked. My beef with Rust is the sheer ammount of hackers. VAC bans in waves that does not take care of the people on the server I play on now sure Facepunch has done a few things to try and crack down on hackers but that did not change much 20 or so dollars later and they are right back at it. I can go to any server reguardless of the population and run into atleast one person using speed hacks or godmode. Its unreal. Rust is really unplayable and that to me makes this game a failure.On a side note not really a problem with Facepunch but it is a reoccuring problem I face in Rust when I play with my friends.Power Hungry Abusive Admins. Ive played in TUNS of servers I litteraly mean TUNS. 6/10 servers will have abusive admins be it they spawn themselfs gear or use godmode during raids you will run into this problem a lot.I'll come back to rust in a year or so I hope that Facepunch makes this game into what it could have been when it came out.",Rust

2018-05-11,0,0,737,False,Recommended,After well over 500 hours of playing rust I can honestly say that this is one of the best games I have every played. No other game that I have ever played has the same sort of approach to player interaction PvP base building looting mechanics or updates. In this review I will express and explain the pros and cons of rust followed by why I love it so much.Pros +Very active developers that genuinely care about what players want (new content is being added all of the time) +Building a base is intuitive quick and easy no need to spend time crafting each individual part of your house (sorry Ark) +Thousands of servers which consist of community modded and official There are a LOT of different ways to play. +Quite a refined crafting system (although some more detail could be desired) +Resource gathering and looting is always interesting because you always have to watch out for other players. +The game is very rewarding when you achieve something ie finding rare items to research or dominating pvp situations. +meeting people can be funny (or not &gt D) +The game really reminds me of the walking dead in how there are so many people with different goals eg friendly/kos/betrayal. You really have to be careful who you trust in the world of rust or you could be betrayed.Cons You have to be prepared to lose everything. People can take your home and everything you have worked for in the blink of an eye. This could also be seen as a pro as it is what makes the game so exciting and fun. People can just sit on top of their bases all day long and just rain hell at you from above. If you are a solo player you can sometimes easily be outnumbered. It can be hard to start up as people can sometimes kill freshspawns. It is quite hard to get the hang of the game.Despite all of these cons from my personal experience I can recommend this game from the bottom of my heart. I managed to meet the right people and I actually made friends playing this game. The constant updates mean that the game is never mundane and the genuine fear of having all of the stuff you have worked so hard to get taken off you is actually quite thrilling. Getting revenge feels great if you have salty neighbors who like to kill you on sight or just getting into pvp situations and getting out alive with the loot. 10/10 and congratulations to Facepunch for creating one of the best games I have ever played.,Rust

2015-12-28,0,0,238,True,Recommended,"I really like this game I've only owed it for about 5 days and I already of 40 hrs played. Before I bought this game I didn't think it was worth it. I heard bad reviews about the game lagging and what not. But after I tweaked some settings the game was running a smooth 60 FPS. If you like survival games such as Unturned Minecraft and such you are going to love this.If you just got the game and want to learn how to play join a small server with 10 or less players on it. This will help you learn how to play the game by allowing you to progress without much players trying to raid you/kill you. My friend and I did this and now we are the most advanced group on the server after playing for only 35 hrs on the server keep in mind this is the first time we played Rust.Also want to raid people but still make friends?

Offer free items Free items such as food bad weps water tools and such to noob players.2. Make Friends with the noob players After giving them the free items allow them to build thier base fairly close to yours give them random items and they will trust you.3. Raid them After a few days of you giving them your cheap items they will grow and have some nice items in their base you raid them and take back the stuff you gave.4.

2017-03-31,1,2,3120,True,Not Recommended,Honestly with how long ive played this game the current updates and optimizations that Facepunch has given this game has started to ruin it. As with most gamers shadows are one thing people dont want to have in some games due to performance drop in FPS. Well they released one update where you cannot turn shadows off saying they want it to be fair for everybody. However this doesnt make it fair for players (like myself) who cannot spend thousands to buy a new PC in order to enjoy this game. I used to run 60 FPS solid with a GTX 660 and sure its out of date but it worked. Now after all the recent updates to graphics and design the game has gotten the reccomended GPU is labled at a 970. When it comes to pvp and you are running 20 fps constantly due to trees causing shadows as well as major bases rendering in with their shadows from distances it makes PVP hard for players with low end computers. The dev's dont listen to the community on what they actually desire and this is why ive contemplated uninstalling the game completely. I LOVE the game for its raiding aspect and PVP but i cant even enjoy any of that now with the current state the game is in. I do not reccomend this game for players who do not have a high end GPU or even a low quality PC if they wish to play for pvp as you will be highly disappointed when you find out how much the detail lowers the performance of your PC.,Rust

2014-02-26,0,0,114,True,Recommended,My opinion on Rust is that is a fun game that is worth the money even in the alpha version. When you take into consideration that Rust is one third the price of most new games (such as Cod Battlefield 4 Skyrim etc.) it s hard to throw any real bad remarks its way. Sure the game isn t perfect but that s because it s not even close to being finished yet. The thing I believe people are most upset about is how hard it can be to get started with the game because there are normally enough hostiles out there to kill you before you even get set up. The solution to this is to simply find a server with only a few players on it. The game is awesome and I love it. I wouldn t say it s a perfect game but that s because it s in its alpha form. I will say that for a game in its alpha form its 4.5 stars. Pros 1) The game is different in the sense that it s a first person game and the only real objective is surviving.2) Its $20.3) You can play with friends or find new ones. Together you can build up a massive home and become the strongest group/alliance/gang on the map *or* you can separate of and get some friendly competition/wars going on.4) The game leaves it up to you on what to do. There s no definitive path to take so you have to make your own. You can be a hermit raider warrior survivor zombie hunter noob hunter beggar good guy bad guy or just a random guy who runs around naked hitting things with a rock. The possibilities are endless.5) You can build almost anything and if you don t like taking the time to do that you can raid someone for it.6) Zombies. I think they re a good addition to the game. The zombies don t pose a large threat to even a lower level player. Their main point is to challenge you. Do you want to shoot it with a gun and waste ammo and give away your location to other players? Or do you want to take a more risky but stealthy move? The zombies are also rewarding because chances are you ll be able to loot as much ammo of them as you used (if you re a good shot). 7) The map is very large so you can have several people on it and never run into each other.Cons 1) The game isn t finished so it isn t always smooth. 2) The gamers on here (like most anywhere) can be complete a holes. You could have no idea what to do and instead of them teaching you or letting you leave they ll purposely make life difficult for you.3) The firefights aren t really that great. It normally comes down to who sees who first and who has the best gun.4) This game will make you very paranoid. You might end up becoming the bad guy that you always hated when you first started out because you don t trust *anyone*. What if the guy is just pretending to be a noob so he can find my base and loot me? What if he s part of a larger clan and is scouting me out for a raid? What if this guy I ve been playing with for a while is really just a twerp that ll loot me the second he gets mad? Can I trust him? These are some of the questions that ll continually rush through your head as you play.5) You can get on one day and find that hours of work went to waste because someone looted you while you were asleep and that can be very frustrating.6) The game can be time consuming. It can take you hours to build yourself up and many more hours still to get everything.7) There s no way to travel fast in this game. It s a big map and if you want to get to the other side you re going to have to go on foot. This can take a long time even if you don t get lost. As you re traveling you ll have to constantly worry about getting killed by wolfs zombies or hostile players.Tips Look up a Rust walkthrough or Wiki before playing. There s a lot of stuff to learn in it and some of the stuff is really hard to find out about on your own.Try to lay low as a new player. Remember people can and will kill you.*ALWAYS* make a bed as soon as possible. A bed is a respawn point and if you don t have one you ll spawn in a random location on the map. This is a good way to lose all of your gear or even your house.Try to make at least one friend that you can team up with in there. This ll help you in so many ways. You ll be able to gather resources faster provide support for each other in battle or just be able to share knowledge and equipment.Hope this helps. Good luck.,Rust

2016-08-09,0,0,2837,True,Recommended,"So yeah after 332 hours I have decided to review the controversial game that is Facepunch'so Rust. Rust is a great game. Most of the time. It has one of the best sets of textures and beautiful graphical content in an open world survival game I have ever played. The game also runs modestly well on nearly all hardware but requirest a PC forged in Mount Doom to run the game at max settings above 60 fps. The only bad thing about Rust is the way people havery decided to ""play"" the game. There is NO specific way staying how to play the game. There is NO manual on how to dorder Rust and that is part of the beauty that is Rust. However some of the community play the game differently. There are multiple types of people who play to be honest. There is your Solo players who casually play for enjoyment. There's your small group of addicted players ( about 3 6 ) who play just because it is a great game to play. And then there's the CLANS. In my opinion clans ruin the game for me and a large chunk of the community. They can be ruthless and savage. Most love KOSing and slave driving. However. There are clansome that show moderate compassion for those solo players who find it difficult to play. If you want to see some really good Rust game play you should checkout Ser WintersYouTube channel or Zuckles. Veriigo gaming not so much. But yeah. Rust is what you make of it. It's a great game for small groups or strong solo players who can build a community or have allies to fall upon. And whatever you do. Don't with clans. Unless your putting high external stone walls in front of their gates. XD",Rust

Even though you can get you gun fascination on much quicker in DayZ this game is definitely the winner for me. Being naked... Eh... Not really my style. But crafting and surviving that's what it's about. I personally think this game needs more weapons like a Spear or Pike a Maul and perhaps more ""developed"" versions of current weapons. As of now created weapons are crude. The kind of thing you'd see from a ten year old playing with sticks. I'd like to see the ability to improve the process and therefore improving the end result both aesthetics and performance of the weapon. It's like Mine Craft if it wasn't made in Java and therefore is higher quality. Just remember it's a run or die world out there so get used to it.",Rust

2017-04-05,0,0,1162,True,Recommended,"This game is one of my very few favourites. It's very grindy if you are new to the game and dont understand the way it works. It can be alot less grindy and alot more fun by simply doing rad town runs and recycling. The trill of having that fully loaded inventory with over 2k scrap and 500 cooked HQ metal is crazy. I feel my heart through my chest when I play and i've become addicted to the thrill of it. Entering epic counter raids with nothing but a water pipe and landing that one game changing headshot on a fully geared AK boi hearing that satisfying crunch as they fall to the ground. You can only imagine how they are screaming in their mic for the rest of the team to kill you meanwhile you already gone. Many people say grining isn't fun. But compared to alot of other games with a similair sort of concept of ""Grind build fight"" It's simply alot more fun. Games like ark cause me physical pain by grinding even in a large group. But in rust I can easily get a solid 2x2 4 floors high and fully honeycomed with just my one bud. Playing in the bow fights is also really fun ans I think this game is really well rounded. I believe the devs are doing their job right and if any game had a dev team as good as rusts that game could get alot better. This game is a MUST BUY.

This game lacks any sort of optimization and the devs arent really going to bother with it till its out of early access (its been in early access for 3 years allready so who knows when its coming out) so if you dont have a mnster rig dont bother with this game just look at the recomended requirents and youll see what i mean. the devs also tease and advertise tons of cool concepts that will likely never be added (horses are the most glaring added but unrideabe which turns them into little more than a reskin of deer.) even going as far as to say thre will be amazing things added in update 100 then completely skipping that upate alltogether (cute but still where is the amazing new content you promissed.)honestly i would wait until this game comes out of early accsess has some content they actually advertise in the concept art and has some optimaization associated with it. instead of buying this game invest that money into omething by the time this game actually comes out of early accsess that $20 dollars will be worth a fortune.,Rust

2017-05-27,0,0,884,True,Not Recommended,"I used to love this game.The devs are going the way of DayZ nerfing everything never addressing long standing problems most of the promises they made early on will never come true and they completely don't understand what it is that made this game fun and approachable in the first place and they've made yet another generic crafting/grinding game with occasional PvP that is so laughably one sided most of the time that its just frustrating for new players to start. They've developed themselves into a corner.This game also lost its ""rustiness"" at some point along the way. Look at the early concept sketches and how cool this game COULD have been if they had gone the way they originally intended.According to the concept materials Rust was supposed to be a game where you had to scavenge for basic things like boots springs little bits of metal rusty pipes etc and craft crude weapons out of them. This game was never meant to have fully functional assault rifles at least not as a craftable thing. In a world like the original Rust finding an assault rifle or army helmet would've been seen as godly in a world where everyone is rocking spears and bows and the occasional pipe shotgun.We were meant to be naked starving and primitive with occasional luck finding something from the ""old world"" that could be used to help us in some way like finding street signs and sharpening them down into weaponry or fashioning armor out of them or finding bits of metal wood glass etc and building a shelter out of that.Now this game is a grind. Get ready for the excitement that hitting trees has to offer. Brace yourself for the blazingly awesome time that is hitting rock after rock after rock for stones/metal/sulfer. Get your camera out and capture the raw beauty that is a janky twig staircase that was used to bypass any and all security measures you can hope to put down. You don't play Rust for your own personal benefit/gain you're just gathering resources for whoever the biggest clan on the server is.The inherent problem with a game like this is that you're almost required to build a big base which they will wait until you are offline to raid and once you're offline there is NO WAY to know you're being raided unless you get ""lucky"" and log in mid raid. All of the turrets/traps in the world don't matter if you don't have a way to know you're being raided when offline. Base building games are only fun if they are designed that way from the start and properly thought out from that perspective. Rust is trying to be a PvE survival game a hardcore PvP game a base building tower defence game and Minecraft all at the same time and it doesn't do any one of those things really well.PvP is broken and unbalanced. Base building is a joke in terms of flexibility and design and even more of a joke in defense. They are slow to help solo players and quick to help the large groups.Rust was best when it perfectly filled that void between casual game and hardcore game.Rust should be two different games. One a modern shooter with all the armor and high end guns and focus on big bases/clans that Rust has now and the ""Caveman simulator"" a lot of us wanted back when it first came out with spears/bows/scavenged stuff with small primitive shelters. They'd make more money anyways and have a bigger over all community... seems win/win to me.",Rust

2018-12-22,0,0,301,False,Not Recommended,Rust would be a perfect game if it weren't for two very simple things lack of balance and lack of objective. It has come out of Early Access (after 4 5 long years if I'm not mistaken) and it's still an unfinished game simply due to the fact that there's no objective whatsoever in the game. You'll spawn fight for survival build your base raid other players and get raided until the server gets wiped. That's it there's nothing else to it and it's such an immensurable WASTE because the game is really damn good. Graphics are great sounds are even better shooting a gun is really unique for me in Rust and the game gets even better with friends. But all of that comes short because there's no objective in the game.On top of that it's totally unbalanced when it comes about raiding. You are able to build a fortress in half a day but you'll have to grind resources nonstop for a week if you want to raid a simple base. It's so unfair spending 150 metal fragments to craft a door and having to farm 2200 sulfur to create gunpowder to craft a C4 charge to blow up the said door. 250 metal frags x 2200 sulfur... how can this be a balanced math? I'm not even mentioning the 1500 scraps in order to learn how to craft a C4 charge + 1250 scraps for the workbench level 3 that you'll have to farm. Even if you raid a base filled with resources you'll hardly profit out of it not to mention the risks such as being ambushed mid raid or on the way back to your base (but that's player strategy not really a flaw). The community of the game is one of the worst ever but I feel like it's unfair to put the blame on the devs. This game just really brings out the evil inside of us.Anyway I wish I could recommend this game because it is really good... but it's lacking a soul right now and I more than anything hope that someday we'll be able to play it in its full glory full finished state. Minecraft has a bloody difficult objective hidden behind a apparent pointless game how come a jewel like Rust has not?,Rust

2017-05-10,3,2,428,True,Recommended,"For me Rust is a game for players who like a challenge sadly this latest update has some minor issues but theres nothing to worry about. Facepunch studios (creators of Rust) do the things right in the fastest way possible they listen to what the players are asking to fix in this fantastic game take the c4 exploit as an example but if you dont know what it is then lets get right to it. the c4 exploit is where you can get a ton by meaning a ton is lets say millions of c4 (raiding tools) which in us rust players were really bad but the good thing was that its fixed in very little time meaning ""they do the right things in the fastest way possible"". this game is really fun when you get your hands on the mechanics of the game or lets say when you have learned the basics on how the game works BUT i do suggest to have friends be playing with you if you dont then maybe when a server has restarted you could ask a player for some teamwork but a neutral amount of players are very greedy and want to kill you and snatch all your loot and resources. but in my case i was a friendly guy and when someone asked for teamwork i was very polite and said ""me"". and that was the time where i met my friend named Zach so far i think Rust can train your social skills and teamwork with other people by playing this game and by this last sentence i now answer the question ""Do i recommend this game?"" and the answer is YES and why? because the game is very fun to play in a very cheap price but it can be very dissapointing when you get killed or either raided. and thats why i said in the very beginning that this is for players who like a challenge.",Rust

This game is not possible if you play single player. There is no winning in this game unless you're a clan with a good base in a small server.

2018-12-15,3,2,976,False,Not Recommended,I've played around 800 hours on a decent gaming PC I'm a senior game dev and I really wanted to like this game but it just keeps getting worse.This is not a game. It's a waste of time.Worst problems 1. Toxic players probably the worst group of people in gaming. Almost everyone is toxic and vile. Everyone is out to trick you or make you feel bad rather than enjoy gaming together. Admins do not monitor or police voice chats.2. Pointless gameplay you'll spend 4 10 hours building a base only to have 3 kids hijack the TC in a few seconds or take the doors away with their magically acquired AK47s while you only have a bow. Even with a locked RC there's no point. ie there's no fair game. All your work gone.Then there's the wipe the game is so compromised that the server wipe to clean up the mess and delete all your hard work has turned into a feature.3. Jerky gameplay. Every time something streams in you insta die from a headshot. Even on LOW quality.4. The aim system the core of the game is so bad for a shooter consequently many players hack meaning you get 1 shot killed from far consistently while it takes you 3 or 4 headshots to kill an opponent.5. Hacks Memory is unencrypted and wide open even the .NET game files are easily decompiled and recompiled so exploits are everywhere and are constantly being patched but the memory poke exploits are never detected. Easy Anti Cheat only checks checksums of some files and does nothing to counter aimbots or anti recoil apps.Unity uses standard mouse input so it's trivial to get around recoil automatically. (Much harder on a game like Battlefield with DirectInput and encrypted position memory)Gameplay problems I have a high end gaming pc and this game struggles. Unity 3D games just can't handle large detailed worlds.The physics management is really bad ie amateur game level and objects load dynamically. This means if someone attacks you your pc freezes for a few moments while their textures load or while new physics colliders are allocated before you can respond. So you die if you move around a lot.Any new physics interaction? Small freeze. Even with 16G RAM and top CPU it's still jerky.The few maps with drivable cars are unplayable because the dynamic loading causes the cars to constantly crash. Hot air balloons are jerky when new terrain streams in so people simply snipe you out from 500m away.Social problems This is probably the worst part of Rust. The players on all servers everywhere are just vile. Racist sexist abusive. The behaviour is encouraged through zero policing so it gets worse and worse with each wipe.If anyone complains they are told to leave.There is no such thing as fair play there is no game. It's just a bunch of school bullies using exploits to bully people with a few pretty textures and a fairly decent crafting system.It's fun on a relatively empty server with a strict active admin but that's rare to find.,Rust

At the moment it takes the cake for my favorite early access game on the Steam market. Now let's get into the game review Well to start there are many one eyed snakes. Too many. Thankfully there is censorship. Otherwise... Actually no turning off censorship is possibly the best thing ever. Not because you can shoot people in the but just because that's such a humorous part that makes the game complete. Next the gunplay is clunky but that's how the devs intend it to be. Imagine you're in a survival scenario and you're trying to build a gun. Then you shoot your homemade gun. Actually shooting guns in real life is clunky. I've never shot a gun before but I imagine it's not going to be anything like big FPS title like ""Call of Duty"" or ""Battlefield"". The game runs well even with a total piece of crap. PRO TIP Turn off the grass. The community isn't as harsh as it is on another survival game like DayZ. Most of the time it's not total KOS but sometimes s just come up to you with the best armor in the game and an M4 by their side and blow you off of kingdom come.

2018-08-18,0,0,176,False,Recommended,The game is great Unfortunately the community is ruining the game. When I started playing rust I was friendly talked to people worked together with others helped people out. Altough that sometimes ended up with me and twelve other guys charching in with spears against guys armed with assult rifles while someone playing a hitler speach in the background it mostly ended with me dead and betrayed. I slowly turned into the person i hated. I now shoot at first sight cause I don't want to be betrayed. I feel sad what the game has turned into but i still enjoy it.

2016-10-10,0,0,1372,True,Recommended,This game can be incredibly grindy in vanilla so be sure to have some friends to talk to... oh and also this is a game of clans so unless you can take on a group of 5 people solo try to maintain an alliance or play with a group. I have the most fun in this game fighting other clans and getting their sweet loot other than that it get's pretty repetitive but pvp can be really fun if you're good at it.,Rust

2016-10-11,0,0,164,True,Recommended,Rust is a game about kicking down sandcastles. You also store all of your valuables inside of your sandcastle as if there wasn't reason enough to destroy it already. Grok this and the game can be incredibly fun. If for some reason you delude yourself into thinking your sandcastle exits for any purpose other than to be destroyed prepare to have a bad time.I highly recommend that game be played modded (which is very common). The vanilla settings of the game make the game very slow and Rust servers are frequently wiped to keep things fresh. Without the varying speed mods (faster exp more resources instant craft time etc) you'll scarcely be able to level up and craft any high tier items in between wipes.The mods also help shift the game in favor of skill as opposed to being in a large clan or having a lot of time to play. The mods allow for quick recovery.I personally think it is quite fun to play solo and pick off players from large groups this is my primarily reason for playing but many players complain that the game is unplayable solo. I feel that these complaints are unfair as skill and knowledge are big parts of this game. It is entirely possible to log into the game holding nothing but a rock and come across two clans in a fierce firefight. Wait for the right moment and you can loot a weapon. Wait for your next moment and you can kill the stragglers from either team. Do people expect to win 1 v 7 in a direct conflict? Only if the 7 are newbies. Rust PvP is about picking your fights. Always be moving to a better position always pick lines of sight that minimize the number of enemies that can see you. Drag separate forces into each other. Use another player as bait. Certainly don't spend your days mining and crafting guns and then committing hard in unwinnable fights.In summary Rust is about guerrilla tactics and sandcastles. Enjoy.,Rust
2016-11-05,0,0,1480,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. As you can see I have over 1k hours into this game. I've played it solo in small nomadic groups larger compound building online raiding groups etc. I've had some amazing moments in this game where I have laughed my off or just felt pretty fulfilled. You can build some crazy stuff you can roleplay you can blow up you can laugh at the broken animal AI. I don't regret 90% of the hours I have in this game.Don't buy it. I know that I described a mostly positive experience but I can also tell you that my main group has been banned from more than one server on account of whiney little 13 year olds that don't understand the game they are playing. Hackusations toxic behavior and an overwhelming amount of talking is what awaits you on nearly every server. Roleplaying is possible but is also pretty difficult because of the KOS mentality of most people and who can blame them? Nakeds with rocks could pull out an AK at any moment or a spear to toss into your head. The newest system was the final nail in the coffin for me as there is now no redeeming moment when you lose your base which eventually will happen. No more XP no more BP's to make you feel like at least you have some reason to keep going. I think the biggest problem isn't the developers though they do play a role obviously. I think the biggest issue is that the loudest people in the community happen to also be the dumbest.RIP Rust we had a good run. Don't buy this broken game.

Base building PVP the general feel of the game is well thought out. A lot of games like Dayz or H1Z1 have tried to come close to take the elusive best survival game but Rust is far more superior because of its building aesthetics and realistic environment. You get thrown into a world naked as you were born with only but a rock and torch now..survive. Crucial to try out if you are into sandbox survival games.,Rust

2018-06-09,0,0,2485,False,Not Recommended,So after 2000 hours on this game im going to give my opinion on it. I Started playing this game in the midst of the Legacy days when people played this game to actually have a good time. As of today this game may aswell be dead there is no point for new players to get into this game as you will simply get bullied by the clans which now infest every single server as this game has to be played like a full time job to even acomplish something. The playerbase is made up of toxic children and grown men who enjoy just being simple as that. communication is not even a thing since you just get killed on sight honestly if you want a good survival game with good base building and a good experience just wait for DayZ 0.63 you wont want to end yourself then.,Rust

2018-02-20,1,2,1812,False,Recommended,Is there even anything to say besides this game is the best game ever. Wait i have something this game is open world survival game where you explore a terrain/island trying to gather resources and build a huge base and take ove rthe server. I mean this game is great for many reasons but of course when there is pros there are cons. 1 con of rust is that there is toxic side of the community. This side has people who trash talk and streamsnipe and somemany othere things about the community. when you spawn in right from the server's wipe there is going to be toxic people. Kinda like in the world there is always going to be jerks and rude people.A good side of rust is that you can explore the world and farm and get PVP with a varitey of guns. You cna take down helicoptors you can get airdrops you can run around and talk to people(Freaking roleplayers) and you can build a base. My personal favorite thing to do in rust is to Buld bases Get a crap ton of PVP Take down Helicoptors and getting airdrops.Although rust seems like a perfect game with great PVP and alot of things to do there is still some down parts as I siad before. A toxic community. Anyways i think rust is a very good game and i highly highly suggest you check it out and play it.,Rust
2014-09-21,0,0,180,True,Not Recommended,This is hands down the worst 'game' I have ever played. I wanted to like this game. The whole base building shooter concept sounded like it could be really fun. After two weeks of playing I can't say that I had one tiny bit of fun.I wouldn't call this an Alpha. It's more of a hastily put together proof of concept. Hey look we can copy someone else's game(very poorly). Now give us your 20 dollars!It's not a survival game. It's a First Person Griefer. The goal of 98% of the players is to see how big of a jackass they can be to other players. I'd be ok with most of the griefing if it was done for the sake of fun and messing around. But the average Rust player seems to have severe social and mental problems. Prepare to be told by squeaky voice pre teens how they're going to violently you or your mother whenever they get near. And they find you often and easily thanks to the ESP and run speed hacks.Speaking of hacks. For a small price and one easy download a player has all the cheats. Well over 90% of the players uses hacks. Turning the game into nothing more than a cheaters free for all. 99.9% of the time you will die due to an aimbot headshot even when they just have an axe or rock. Play on an active admin server. It will do you no good. One or two hackers will get banned but the vast majority get a way with it. All the hackers make it impossible for a legit player to make any progress. Spend 12+ hours gathering and then building a small base to protect you and your stuff. Pointless. A player with a hacked client will simply find your base with ESP then walk through your walls while you are not logged on kill you and take or destroy all your progress.I played on a server with no players to fully see what the crafting/building part of the game was like. It turned out to be nothing more than a very boring daily chore simulator. Gather gather gather... craft/build a little.... gather.. gather... gather... Finding blueprints was even worse. Endless running around looting chests for mostly junk or endless killing red bears and wolves. Neither of which is a challenge. Just mind numbingly boring.,Rust

I watched some youtube videos (Which absolutely dont help when it comes to gameplay reviewing). It was fun for about 5 minutes. Then i got the worst perfomance issues i could ever get. I was playing with 18 fps in empty servers and i have a ryzen 7 1800x and a gtx 1080 ti and 16 gigs of ram. This game's optimization is as . Besides that it gets so boring after a certain point. There are too little things to do and they all follow the same repetitive pattern. Get resources &gt craft items &gt raid. And you migh say thats what all survival games do right ? No this game only has like 4 basic resources ? You craft the same basic items over and over again. Then you might wanna build a nice base and start from there. The game just gives you a huge middle finger as every server gets wiped every month or so which means starting from scratch every time. Its like the devs tried so hard to make it repetitive. Honestly i couldnt find one thing i personally liked about that game. To top it off steam support wouldnt even accept my refund request because i was over the 2 hours (It was 4). Yea how am i supposed to check if i like a game like this in 2 hours ? The only thing a newbie manages in 2 hours is too die a bunch of times. You can go for it if you are into these kinda games but i feel they went in the completely wrong direction tryinna make a fast paced survival game ???? Worst 10$ ive ever spent on steam.,Rust

2016-07-09,0,0,1712,False,Recommended,"Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources the entry level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance so when you're spotted by an idiot you'll start hearing the talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer they get louder and more confident and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying) and put him down with a single well placed strike. I wish I could tell you that as I was standing over his fatally wounded body that I didn't laugh my off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting ""Hey man wait a second!"" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.If it feels like we've been living with Rust for a long time that's because we kinda have. The game was first released in Early Access in late 2013 by developers Facepunch Studios and it's been a mainstay of goofy YouTube send ups ever since. If you're somehow unfamiliar with the premise think of Rust as a dumber more nihilistic Minecraft. You wake up on a map armed with only a rock and a torch. You quickly figure out that by banging your rock on a few environmental doodads you can harvest a few basic resources (stone wood and cloth) which you can parlay into a few prehistoric instruments like a spear or a hatchet. This is similar to the scrounging mechanics in plenty of other survival games but what makes Rust different is how deep that tech tree goes. Eventually from those same basic ingredients and a few mechanical leaps of faith (like work benches and furnaces) you'll be able to craft pistols flamethrowers and rocket launchers. Rust famously does not quarter off its servers to keep entry level nakeds away from the roving troops suited up in advanced firearms which means that occasionally your journey will end with you matching another player's revolver with a rock that you've tied to a stick.This is the heart of Rust. Wake up naked run for your life do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative or mythos or win condition. Most of the servers are on a strict weekly or monthly reset schedule which scrubs the island of any lingering housing or fortifications left behind by the players which gives the experience a strange sense of futility. Yes you will need to manage your hunger thirst and health and as you ratchet up the tech tree you will discover increasingly effective ways to stay alive but that's it. Sure there are some areas on the map that are stricken with radiation which leads to the implication that perhaps you and the rest of your misanthropes are occupying a far flung post collapse society but those moments feel more like window dressing than anything else.I spent the vast majority of my time in Rust playing solo but I don't want to discount the notorious community of players that band together in clans and wage wars of aggression along the shared hunting grounds. One of the fascinating kernels of Rust's brutality is how everything in the world remains persistent even if you're logged off which means that smart players arm their bases with land mines punji sticks and keypad locks while they're away. (Some clans even recruit players across all time zones to make sure there's always someone on guard.) That's a coordination I appreciated from a distance. There are a number of YouTube documentarians showing off the multi man raids that spawn from committed Discord channels all over the world. Instead I engaged with the population of Rust on a purely incidental level. An extremely geared man takes pity on you and drops a crossbow at your quivering feet. That's Rust! A kid and I are raiding an abandoned gas station for food and weapons and I give him the extra pair of pants I was carrying around. When I'm turned the other direction he bashes his rock right through my skull and runs off with the rest of my stuff. That is also Rust.I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along.Given the tone it shouldn't be surprising that the community I found in Rust tended to be fairly juvenile and toxic. There's a high concentration of racism and misogyny in the global chat so much so that I eventually left the channel entirely. And unsurprisingly the new player experience is quite prickly. The development team didn't spend any time cooking up a tutorial (which makes some sense when you consider how long the game has been available). Instead when you join one of the many servers you're presented with a few faint hints in the top left corner of the screen ""harvest wood!"" ""build a hatchet!"" The crafting system itself is fairly intuitive with well written tooltips for each of the items in the catalog and you can fast track yourself into some serious munitions if you get lucky with a few resource spawns. The PvP combat won't win any awards but it's tactile and packed with wonderfully sadist bone crunching sound effects connecting your hatchet with an idiot's head feels great and really that's all I needed. There is also a strange post release monetization model in which you can buy ugly paint jobs for your weapons and clothing. Rust is fascinating for a hundred different reasons but Counter Strike style weed leaf AWPs isn't one of them. Still though I think everyone should at least have a taste of Rust. It's hard to think of many other games that are this uncompromising in its worldview and I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. We could build a utopia on this island! We could cast aside our weapons and construct a peaceful commune where everyone is fed warm and loved. I love how Facepunch dangles that potential in front of our face with no real incentive pushing us in any direction. If we are to dehumanize ourselves and turn this Eden into a battlefield we will do it on our own terms. In Rust there is a real sense of complicitness when you eventually succumb to violence more potent than in any other survival game on the market. Despite the lack of rankings to chase or K/D to nurture or exclusive vendors to unlock despite the unassailable fact that none of this will matter as soon as the server is wiped we are at war and we always will be.",Rust

If you get shot then it's partly your fault for getting yourself in that position. ALT key glances behind you to help avoid getting backstabbed when you are busy mining or whatever.Game typically gets one big update per week and the devs are active on the facepunch forums to help tweak balancing of weapons etc. They keep the community involved in planned updates also.This is of course a work in progress but would pass as a finished game from any of the bigger developers.

2014-01-16,0,0,473,True,Not Recommended,Have you ever played the games Mincecraft or DayZ and enjoyed them? Well perhaps you've been drawn to this game then interested to play something that has a combination of both worlds wasteland survival elements with an extensive crafting system? Well be ready for a extremely infuriating experience... Beginning game Mostly revolves around just hoping for some random stranger not killing you out of a few giggles or evade them by being the biggest xenophobe in game. Getting a hatchet the first and vital tool is your next objective. Getting this you need to gather stones and wood which can be an experience as struggling as just trying to survive in this world of immature people attacking you on sight merely to have a short laugh since the gathering of resources is very competetive people don't like sharing. Coming to a place where there are resources if you are playing on a high populated server which is how the game is meant to be played will often lead to you getting shot axed or hit over the head with a rock. If you manage to reach that far you'll not have your first proper tool... Now for food! Hatchet a pig to death (Because all the other wildlife will murder or run away from you at this stage in the game.) and then make a campfire to cook your food and eat. If you've reached this far in the game call yourself lucky that you've not one of the murderous fully geared up s that wander the wastes of Rust. Now a bow... Your first weapon so you can defend yourself against zombies bears and wolves which all maul you to bits of flesh if you try using your hatchet. Now you can gather food and defend yourself reliably however this comes with a huge downside that is players. They will see you as a threat if you have a bow people will shoot you on sight if they see the slightest kind of weapon on your person. Middle game Now you need to build a house! Don't bother trying to even build a regular ol' wood shelter those people can break into in less than a minu... Yeah ignore all that up there to sum this up is this Great mechanics and a great idea for a game horrible community that does everything in its power to kill main and cause any kind of harm to you.

2018-05-07,0,0,81,False,Recommended,You'll never last in this game if you don't group up which is great but everyone groups up with their friends they know and trust from outside the game and they communicate outside the game which effectively defeats the purpose of what would otherwise be an awesome social experiment. It would be more immersive and challenging if players were forced to meet and learn to trust and cooperate with strangers within the game world. I am not sure how this could be enabled other than randomly and irrevocably assigning each player to a different server each wipe and the game is fascinating regardless just fatally flawed in ways that go further and are more interesting than most other games.

2017-09-10,0,0,85,True,Not Recommended,A game where others teaches you to be just like them or die and give up on the game.Toxicity is the buzzword The game tells you to survive. People are free to do whatever they want. The issue is not the game itself.The issue is that players *Want* to destroy everyone else no matter who no matter what they're doing.There's no instruction manual on how this should be played. It doesn't say that you have to kill anyone. You could do much the tools are there But all you will get is the equivalent of a singleplayer game with an AI trying to kill you.There is no real interaction aside being shot or being swindled by someone who feels smart enough by pretending to be friendly so they can steal your stuff.The few and far between who want to interact with others in any other way are killed on sight and eventually either give up or learn that they have to kill others on sight to keep playing the game.If you want this game for an FPS shooter multiplayer with elements of crafting get it.

2017-04-05,0,0,3955,True,Recommended,Rust.Rust is a game that very well make you angry sad happy and many other emotions. These emotions atleast for me are absent in every other video game I've played.Let's take into account the aspects of this game and what you will need to do in order to survive the potential grind.P.S. You don't need to grind to have a lot of items but if you aren't good at PvP what this game is revolved around then you're screwed unless you make friends with the right people.I've been playing this game for two and a half years and I've went through a lot of groups some including popular Rust streamers some including complete nobodies.Pros Extremely addictingHigh skill ceilingCommunity is amazing apart from the subredditVery simple game to learn hard to masterTo me every day I log in it doesn't feel like I'm playing the same game for countless hoursNo lifes win the game(You can believe I put 40 50 hours in 3 days. Love this game )Cons Grind ey if badSome toxicity Lots of clansHard to get startedHackersLagExplanation Let's talk about the pros and cons of this game starting with the cons.People are toxic every game has this. Clans are a problem because unless you cheat it's very likely you won't survive too long on a high pop server.Hard to get started applies to clans and that nonsenseAs of late hackers have infested this game luckily the admins are great. Don't play on official serversLag happens to everyone but I don't have this problem. However since everyone and their brother complain about it I might as well slap it on the list.Pro explanation skills.Highly addicting sometimes I play for more than 30 hours at a time. I want to make sure I wake up and I have stuff I want to get better I want to be able to live somewhat comfortably.

2016-05-10,6,23,1140,False,Recommended,"I wake up stark naked at the coast. Where am I? What am I doing here? With a rock in a hand and one makeshift torch I venture to explore this uknown land to find out what the hell is going on.Rust is one of the number of survival games which have emerged on the market after the success of the original DayZ mod for Arma II. It has been in development since the late 2013 and is made by Facepunch studios lead by the well known creator of Garry's Mod Garry Newman. It is still advertised as alpha although the game is already pretty well fleshed out. Similar to other survival games players are pitted against each other in harsh enviroment to fend for themselves and do their best to survive.First things first single rock just cannot do. I need to eat and beating something to death with a rock is a harsh ordeal. Good thing there are so many trees around. Few minutes of hitting are enough to grant me enough wood to make a spear. Next on the list is filling my belly. I heard some rustling in the bushes and soon enough as if called by my hunger a pig appears. One mighty throw and the poor piggy is lying face down on the ground. Filled by its grilled meat I am ready to head out.To survive in Rust you ought to fulfill your basic needs. If you do not eat or drink you will die really quickly. Finding food on a densily populated server may be hard for a new player but as in all survival games you are much less likely to die of hunger than by getting killed by other players. Indeed it is the fellow men you ought to be afraid of most. In Rust this is emphasized even further by the sparsity of other threats. There are no NPC zombies that would eat you like in DayZ at least not anymore. You can ocasionally run into a wolf which you can easily beat with basic weapons. Be wary of bears though which are deadly to even well equipped players.While sneaking through the bushes I hear a familiar sound. It is a human voice. How happy I am to find a fellow human I was beginning to worry that I am stranded here by myself. Immediately stepping out of the bush I catch the man unprepared. He visibly flinches after seeing me and his hand clutches his own wooden spear. Seeing my smiling face and after hearing my friendly voice makes him relax a little. That is his downfall and stabs him to death while I watch in fear. I immediately rush to my newfound friend and help him up. He is hurt but lives. Now is the time to deal with the assailant. We circle each other carefully and both of us throw our spears at once and hit. Urgh lying on the ground in pain I look up to my friend but instead of helping me he rummages through my stuff with a smirk on his face and leaves both me and the guy who has attacked us to die...That should do for the introduction. Now the real question is what exactly do you do? Right now I would sum up the game with the words ""Survive gather build and prosper just to have everything taken from you by raiders."" While you can just run around in the beautiful world of Rust explore and die the real fun lies in building your own sweet home. To do that though you need to gather enough materials first. For starters you can work with wood and stones which are quite easy to get. From the very beginning you can craft a stone hatchet and pickaxe which will make gathering much easier. Once you have got enough materials you can get to building.Rust has a pretty intuitive building system. First of all you create a a base for you new house. You do that by stacking square or triangular pieces together until you get a desired shape and size. After you have your base ready you can add walls windows doors and even a roof. The system is open to creativity which is encouraged because your house is going to be under the constant threat of being ransacked by other players.Once again I wake up at the coast yeah you heard right once again. Since my first encounter with other people everything just got worse and worse. I got as far as building my own house oh how beautiful it was. Three stories high with its own large furnace. I felt really high and mighty until I came across the wrong people. You see my neighbour was spying on me so as cautious as I was I shot a warning arrow to let him know I do not tolerate such behaviour. Half an hour later he was back with his friends with GUNS and EXPLOSIVES and in a couple of minutes my walls were breached and my house was in ruins...So far we have gone through gathering and building part of the game but that is just a half of it. Second half is all about fighting. For your encounters with other players the game has a whole arsenal of weapons to have fun with ranging from basic weapons like swords and bows to semi automatic pistols and assault rifles. The combat itself is pretty satisfying. There are no crosshairs but with guns one can look through the iron sights to aim precisely. Shots are affected by physics so arrows and even bullets lose velocity and drop down as they travel into distance. Everything in game is designed to look like a makeshift weapons even the most advanced rifles and it does look awesome! Compared to ranged weapons melee combat is very basic. Basically you just swing your weapon eventually throw it at your foe but there is no blocking or alternative moves. Bringing a melee weapon into a ranged fight usually ends badly.When you feel like you have already done everything you could have a nice place of your own plenty of weapons and resources you can always join other players (after making sure you can trust them) and go out raiding attack other players bases and steal their stuff. This is basically Rust's end game content and requires one to be quite knowledgable about the game as it is necessary to know different base designs and their weaknesses as well as to be proficient in combat since blowing up walls makes a lot of noise which is sure to lure in other groups. This is probably the reason why most of the raids happen during the night (in the real world) since the owners of the base are likely to sleep and there is much less players lurking around waiting for their opportunity to rob you which is kind of a shame since I believe that base defense and fights tied with raiding are when the real fun starts.As I have mentioned before from a technical standpoint Rust looks pretty good and not at all like an Alpha. Running on a Unity engine the game looks pretty slick I would even go as far as to compliment the looks as amazing when you set the settings on high However it is important to say that it is insanely demanding on hardware. If you are looking for a fluid experience with stable 60 fps on decent settings you will need a high end machine so optimalization definitely still leaves a room for improvement. Apart from that the game looks finished although Facepunch is still working on improvevements with regular updates to the game.In its current state I would certainly recommend Rust to everyone who likes survival games as well as to people who would like to find out what is all the surival ruckus about. Not only does everything work properly despite it still being an early access but devs also keep bringing in new content into the game quite often which keeps the game interesting in a long run. Rust is definitely worth the asked price!After four months I am finally getting the hang of things and the future looks bright. Despite having to start over and over I am always learning. With each breach of my house I find out what mistakes I made when designing it and my next is a step closer to perfection. While I might never build an unbreachable house the experience taught me that it is impossible it is getting harder and harder for people to get in and I keep enjoying myself more and more. Being stranded on this strange island slowly went from an ordeal to an enjoyment and I simply LOVE IT!",Rust

2016-01-23,1,9,1016,True,Recommended,This game is awesome. This game but I'm going to write my issues with it because I think a person buying this game should be informed on these issues before they buy it. Know that on every other point of it I support it and rank it #1 out of every game in my steam library which currently has over 100 games. I chose to write my only reasons for having a problem with this game rather than right a multi page thesis paper on why this game is amazing and changed my life because the later would take a long time and no one would care to read it. One issue with this game is you need a lot of time to play and get really into it or you need a friend/clan who will let you hop on with you feel like it and doesnt mind maintaining and defending the base. That being said this game will probably make you want to free up your schedule more to play it.Another issue is that there is a lot of really s*** people who play this game they are mean racist and kill on sight usually. However you can find servers that don't allow this behavior so it is avoidable. Or if your like me you can play on these servers anyways but hunt down these people and take everything they've worked for hours on away from them and laugh at them when they log on and freak out.FInal issue is that this game is in alpha and there are times you will notice it more than others. However this is by far the best developement team I've ever bought a game from and they are and I'm not exagerating the best at putting out updates on a regular and reliable basis. I have no doubt this game will be finished before they release it fully. You are not buying another Stomping Lands or Star Forged. I hope this helped.,Rust

Within a few hours (or as long as a couple days) you will get raided and slaughtered by a massive server dominating clan. Toxic Community My one complaint with this game is the community. Either they're all racist phallic loving four chan humping players or they're blood thirsy players who thrive off killing anyone even if you're a new spawn. However you do occasionally find a friendly player who is willing to toss a few things your way. Though other than that dont expect anything but a rather Toxic community. Hardcore PvP One moment you could be ontop of the world great base great loot then the next blown apart with nothing. Dont get overly attached to anything you own in this game ever. Unless you're playing on a server like ""Dustins n00b Pantry! x50 Gather x100 Loot."" blah blah blah. Vanilla Rust is intense as f**k. Is this game for you?If you liked DayZ think of this as a more ""Arcadey DayZ"" game. Its got a really clean UI and the devs are on top of their game with content and bug releases. Also if you like a constant challenge and the risk of being murdered at any given time try this game out.If you're easily stressed by constantly having to start over because you got slaughtered and your base greifed this game isnt for you.",Rust

2015-01-26,0,0,44,True,Recommended,"Well lets see I made a fort on the beach with a cage on the inside which I successfully trapped another person in and he then became my pet whom I named ""Bitey"". Now you should know that Bitey was the most majestic pet I have ever had. He was a bit vicious never content with the food and clothing I gave him always asking for rediculous things like freedom(what a greedy and ungrateful pet he was but nevertheless I loved him so). It was great till one day he just stopped moving talking or doing anything just silent. I was so very heartbroken that my pet was no longer animate I tried opening one of the doors (not the way out of course) to give him some air nothing. After much thought and consideration I decided that the only logical thing to do was to get another pet so that Bitey would have someone to play with. Using the same method I did before (baiting with treats) I trapped another majestic naked creature and named him ""Boris"". Boris didn't like being caged very much (come to think of it neither did Bitey either) and he didn't like Bitey very much either. In retrospect perhaps I should have made another cell and keep them seperated because much akin to having beta fish together Boris killed Bitey ate him and then promptly died from eating Bitey's raw uncooked flesh. I'll always remember Bitey and Boris as the best pets I ever had but their deaths gave me expirience on how to better handle my future pets. Game Rating 11/10",Rust

Like many of us with this many hours do XD. I didnt play Rust Legacy perhaps my view may have been different prior to the Unity Engine had been in place. Although the screenshots I have seen with regards to legacy were dissapointing. It looked ugly as quite frankily. Apart from that though this game is fantastic. I always try to play more games like Battlefield or Call of Duty but I alwasys seem to come back to play. Its addicting asf and will ruin your life. NOT JOKING.

2018-12-28,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,"A potentially great game however falls short. Played on FacePunch AUS 2 for around 150 hours. I've played enough now to give a fair review.Cons 1. CHEATERS By far the biggest problem with this game is the hacking. FacePunch is simply unable to deal with the hacking problem in this game. It's very easy to get away with cheating and the anti cheat software can be easily by passed. A big element of strategy in this game is the cost/benefit of raiding other people for loot. If you can see through walls it's easy to know the quickest and most cost effective bases to raid and gain access to the TC and timing for offline raiding. Regrettably this issue makes the game unplayable. Imagine investing 60 hours into a duo base and once you reach around 10K Sulphur to find it raided the moment you go offline. Pretty heart breaking. There are other cons in this game however the cheating issue overshadows all other potential problems.Pros 1. Overall this is a great game and putting the hacking aside this game paves the way forward for the FPS Sand box survival genre. There is potential for strategy politics and diplomacy. Develop alliances with your neighbours while conquering distant enemies... Despite the frequent wipes reputation means something. 2. The PVP is actually really good. There is a skill gap and often I could kill better geared people with good plays.Recommenations 1. Limit the clans for 5 10 people. This will make for an overall better gameplay experience for the entire server. Zerg clans ruin this game especially for more casual gamers.2. Region lock the server. Other regions create server lag..also Chinese Russian and Arab regions have a well developed hacking culture. You need to understand these areas of the world are communist and or authoritarian. These groups use games to dominate with cheats because they are powerless economically socially and politically in their own country. They also get immense pleasure in living out their fantasy in dominating ""western"" nations...if not in RL than virtually. This is the sad reality. Note that the point I'm making is cultural and not racial.Ultimatley I would ONLY recommend this game on the condition you play with an organised group of atleast 4 friends. In reality if this isn't possible I wouldn't bother with it. Also you don't mind playing with hackers. Don't fool yourself there are many cheaters that play this game.",Rust

2017-01-22,19,138,42,False,Not Recommended,Rust is a game that I will not be recommending because of how hostile the game is toward players who aren't in groups. Rust is a game where you will spend hours gathering resources to slowly build a wooden house only for a six man squad to tear everything down in a heart beat. Now I understand that the nature of these games is cruel but Rust seems to have certain crafting aspects that makes the game easy for groups and almost impossible for lone players.I could go into excruciating detail but all I'm going to say is. Grouped up players can pop up large bases with ease because there's multiple of them gathering and defending lone players will spend hours building a basic wooden shed which is ridiculously easy to smash down. Building wooden things in this game is pointless because of how easy it is to break for a group building a stone house with a metal door is easy but for a lone player building a stone house with a metal door takes an extremely long time and there's a very good chance that a kill on sight 12 year old will blast you away before you complete anything.If you plan to play this game alone stay far far away from it.,Rust

I'd even go so far that I doubt that in the next 10 15years anything on the same (or higher) level appears. I know it's an exremtly strong statement knowing the pace of the technology progress.I guess I don't have to mention the positive parts about this game anymore after my first statements.So let's skip to the negatives Since release the updates were good BUT the last 2 years it was ALWAYS a pain in the when the updates hit. Every single time it seemed like the devs hate their own work and thought every month how to destroy it a little bit more. With some changes it was clear that someone just had to write smth down what he did to show his boss that he actually did smth. So those changes came which did literally nothing but made the game a little bit worse. We were always pretty sure that the devs never play their own game. They can hire me just for slapping people with dumb ideas. Mainly Toxic community I've rarly seen such a toxic inviroment. The actuall building system is cancer I mean wtf you've to pay ""taxes"" for the existence of your base so being 1 2 days inactive is not an option and you get punished for playing the game. Official servers ""Stay the away from them"". Cheat 2 Win ONLY. It was different in the past and then Chinese cheater zergs came and kept knowing exactly that nothing will ever happen to them. Other option Rustafied servers ( 8h queue in the first week of the wipe (25%) )The negatives were hard ones but don't get me wrong the list of the positive things is too long to write it down here.I will always keep a track on this game and always return when I have enough time.

Everyone uses the Chat Function pretty much to insult each other orthey troll around.Also the Game Rust is really unblanaced and this is my opinion. You cant really learn the Game when you first start playing when you spawn with a Rock in ur Hand and no Clothes on People on most servers will already have a sniper rifleor a automatic Machine Gun (no skill requiered) except for maybe lag and the outnumber game.So many People will find their self in a uncomfortable Position now i was told that i cry way to much and i should play something else when i dont wanna get killed.The thing is ... And people dont understand ( especially them who have a Bowl next to their desk cause they dont even have the Time in their Life to visit the Bathroom)I dont mind getting raided and being killed i knew what i was getting into when i got the Game but how they kill me and why they kill me is a Joke. Its hardly unbalanced when you just start out and you cant do shiii* when they already have crafted their Stuff. Also im a Casual Gamer i dont focus on just one game i play alot games and also im a full working Person who has a social Life i cant spend 1000 hrs or more in a month on a game like Rust.So this makes the Game very unblanaced for people like me there always the so called no Lifes who say (but... but this and that but .. only need 2 hrs for that but...) i give a crap to be honest.The Game itself is great the Idea too the Community is mostly a Mess and filled with Trolls and Kids.If you have plenty of Time and you eat snacks all day in front of your PC while sitting in the Basement of your Parents this might be the Game you always dreamed off.If you are a full working Person with a balanced Lifestyle(gym family work social life other games) stay away from this toxic GameYou still wanna get it even tho you are just like me play on a small server with low Pop makes things easier and sometimes you find 1 or 2 friendly individuals.Graphics 8/10Sound 7/10Controls 8/10Gameplay 9/10Community 1/10Servers 5/10,Rust

Unreal engine isn't good at all.it's not safe to play on modded/custom servers the server admin can view your IP address and thus your approx location and such.there are other problems too like you place a sleeping bag somewhere on the map and put a hidden stash next to it but tomorrow when you join a server you get spawned in the middle of nowhere and there is no sign of your stash or sleeping bag in that same location you left them.I give this game 3 outta 10.,Rust

If you enjoy games like Minecraft but want a more mature approach to the genre this game is also perfect! Heaps of servers with heaps of people populating them. The games engine dosent seem to have any game breaking bugs and there are no big glitches that render the game unplayable.

2015-01-14,0,0,743,True,Recommended,"Ahh yes Rust what great memories I've had with this game. Whether it is killing a wild boar with a rock or running through towns filled to the brim with radiation while being chased by a mutated wolf. Not something you might hear everyday but hey beats the average monday am I right?Rust is one of my all time favorite games I love the creator of this game along with other games he has made such as Garry's Mod. In case you don't already know Rust is a survival game where all you start out with is a rock and from there you have to somehow manage to make a huge base get the best of gear such as kevlar assault rifles shotguns spike walls or even just some cooked chicken. The thing I love about this game is that you're writing a story as you play at least that's how I see it. Because you know that you have to get all of that stuff to be the very best but what you don't know is what you have to do along the way to get it. That's where the real fun is. Like I said in the beginning when you first start out you might have to kill a wild boar with a rock but then later on you might be going through ""rad towns"" to find some good loot and maybe be chased by a few mutated wolves... For me that's what makes this game so fun because even if you are close to being the top but someone kills you and knocks you down to the bottom you can re write the story yourself you can get all the loot again probably differently maybe make a few friends along the way who knows what you might do! Then when you finally reach the top after so much time you can finally take down that one person that sent you so far back... This concludes this review so if you are one of those people that look at Rust and see another boring survival game don't think of Rust like that think of it like an exciting story that YOU write and decide what happens in it. So would I recommend this game? Oh yes I would.",Rust

2013-12-14,0,0,26,True,Recommended,"A great game about survival in the face of extreme adversity.A mash up of Minecraft Dayz and Don't Starve you start out with nothing (literally nothing) except a rock a stick you can light up and some bandages. WIth these bare essentials you explore a vast island full of predators and other players some of whom would love nothing more than to kill you for your stuff. There's something to be said for a game where having a pair of pants is a proud display of wealth. I felt like a godamn king when I finally made a hat out of a poor boar i managed to run down and mash to death with my rock.You build a house craft various hunt and survive. People try to kill you sometimes. But sometimes they won't. That's people for ya. People are the unpredictable element that really helps this game shine in my opinion.It's up to you how to interact with others. Rust is a great social experiment in this sense. It would be beneficial if everyone worked together but no one seems to trust each other yet. Hopefully more updates will allow better cooperation but we will see. Some players have built pseudo communities with enormous structures surrounded by spikey barricades. I've avoided these so far too fearful to approach. Most people are untrustworthy and for good reason. Rust is being developed by Garry Newman the creator of one of the best ""do whatever the hell you want"" games ever made (Garry's Mod)",Rust

2016-09-22,0,0,2902,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. I truly believe Rust to be one of the greatest games of all time and it's by far my favorite game ever singleplayer or multiplayer. Rust combines the journey of self that is experienced in singleplayer games with the reward for discipline taught by multiplayer competitive games. There simply isn't another feeling like it short of going into real life and doing dope .Like other ""hard"" gaming feats successfully raiding in WoW controlling an island at the head of a coalition in Puzzle Pirates getting a high rank in a moba or even figuring out how to log into the game in Eve Online Rust has a steep learning curve which will punch you in the face repeatedly. But unlike its facepunching peers Rust allows you to define your own terms of success it's almost the holy grail game of Eve without spreadsheets. You get to do whatever you want and you'll innately know when you're winning or losing without a meter telling you your score but the game retains the satisfactory feeling of ""getting stuff done"" that other casualy sandboxy games like Battlefield or GTA lack.And if you want to play the game the ""normal"" way as a competitive long form pvp match against hundreds of other people it's better than Eve. The best part about Rust is the journey to riches and every journey you learn more about the game and about yourself (#knowledge). Rust's combat is as visceral as DayZ or Eve and it combines itself with the feeling of accomplishment normally reserved for more arcadey games like LoL or csgo. Yes the game can be played casually for an hour a week and you will still have fun contrary to what people who haven't played the game will tell you. No you won't dominate a server but you wouldn't expect to raid mythics in WoW with an hour a week or become Global in CS with an hour a week but you can still have fun and find success the same way you can casually in WoW or CSNo the game is not easy to be good at but it's as easy to get into as Overwatch and the difficulty &amp burden of #knowledge creates the depth and replayability that Overwatch doesn't have but games like csgo and mobas do while still being easier to get into than those games. You don't have to ask questions like ""wheres dragon"" ""whats baron"" ""why cant i play nami mid"" and you don't have to learn how to counterstrafe / what ct economy means / why dont my bullets go where my crosshair points just to play Rust BUT similar mechanics are THERE and you CAN learn them to get better.The biggest reason I view Rust as one of the greatest games of all time is that it simutaneously allows people to play a different game within the same game. Just because I play it for the pvp and competition doesn't mean others can't play it like Stardew Valley and have even more fun than I do. The stories and experiences you will have in Rust are reminiscent of WoW pre crossrealm and pre dungeonfinder but told through a much more entertaining fps shooter builder medium than a clunky mmo AND the #knowledge you gain (improvement) is so much more tangible than other games that it's just as much of a dopamine rush as seeing your level increase or getting a rankup. Anyone that is able to try something without letting prior notions discourage them will enjoy Rust for what it is simply because it can be so many different things. I would consider Rust a must play if you enjoy multiplayer games.",Rust

2016-07-12,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,So I got this game in the 2016 summer sale because I've always wanted to give it a try and it was on sale so why not now... Worst mistake I've ever made in my life. For starters it made me a male which was very upsetting I hate having to look at a male character model I'm playing. That's why I mostly avoid games where I cant play as a female or at least have a choice in those games I play where you're set as a male you never see yourself so it doesn't matter. The character you play can be genderless but the second thing that made me start this review is the community. I for one don't want to kill other players unless they are attacking my friends or trying to raid my base. I almost never shot at other players in DayZ I just went around helping people. I made this very clear on the server that I was a perma friendly and was new. No one cared weather I was gathering resources wareing nothing but basic pants and a hat with a rock or was saying I was friendly in chat. They most all tried or did kill me without reason then the hackers come into play. Guys who use hacks on a Noob Friendly named server to not only ignore the tool cupboard no build zone but also have 100% accuracy at 100ft at middle of night when hard to see 10ft. Lastly the Griefers and how easy it is to grief people this is a different subject but still related to the hackers. Because it was the same people building and quickly making a tool cupboard unreachable is far far far to easy due to the fact those hackers were able to steal a extra 1 my friend and I had but set it up and made it unreachable by us. The server had just restarted that morning so getting explosives was out of the question but we spend 2 hours trying to break into this cupboard and make them unable to continue griefing us only to have them been watching us for the 2 hours as we waste thousands of our resources trying to get in. Then repair it cheat into our base steal or destroy all our stuff then grief me more by trying to double back offering to help me get back on my feet after they just raided us. The rust community is way way WAY more toxic then any other game community I've played and I've played League of Legands... All these things combined have put me into a heavy state of depression as I'm typing this where I'm having thoughts mostly hollow of committing suicide...Don't buy this game if you don't want to hate yourself for years.,Rust

Thats why no one now trust anyone so the community looks worst/salty in this game.(They are but thats the reason they became salty)2) Game optimisation. You will lag get less FPS even in recommended system requirements. (I played in least graphic quality even i have better than there recommended system)3) Community/Modded Server running this game worldwide.(Official server will give you 150+ping to your nearest server excluding for Us/Uk/Russia players)My thoughts 4) Want to play SOLO? dont do this. Play with group or friends. Clan's minimum requirements are 1000+hours.5) It would be best game if these problems would not there.

I though I would get maybe 10 hours into it but I am just completely addicted!Hunting surviving raiding gathering building a house creating a society setting trade routes protecting your self from raiders zombies friends looting PVP PVE building creating. These are just some of the things that make this game amazing. Just using you imagination can unlock a whole nother aspect to the game. The game can a does have a learning curve but you can overcome it after about 5 8 hours of gameplay. The game receives frequent updates and you can see the update plans here https //trello.com/b/lG8jtz6v/rustThe graphics are pretty good considering this is an indie game. The optimization could be a little better but for better frames just hit f1 and type ""grass.show false"".I would honestly buy this game for 60 dollars if it cost that much. And the game has good and frequent updates and they listen to what the community wants!!And for the hackers On 1/7/2014 they just released a security update to combat the hackers and glitchers. The will continue to make updates for the game that will combat the hackers.

Though with the recent patch making the game very heavy handed in the raiders favor im finding myself becoming more frustrated. Building before yes had its challenges though now you cant even build a 2x2 room in an 8x8 building without having structural problems unless you use the exact same floor plan which makes it easier for raiders to figure out how you build things. Also giving an update with ladders and no ladder defense for us farmers? Not to mention the soon to be axing of water bases b/c they are ""to hard to raid""... its hard enough to build something in water so now im being punished for trying to out think other people? which is kinda the point of the game....Might leave the game soon.",Rust

2017-08-09,0,0,531,True,Not Recommended,First of all this game is not properly optimized if you don't have high end level gaming pc don't even think about to play it. Devs does not care about optimization on the contrary they are strangling it with more unnecessary models and skins.Secondary since reset time is widely accepted as 7 days by many servers. Most of the servers are getting dead after 3 4 days. Which is one of the greatest mechanical problems about the game. But this is not the greatest problem about Rust Couple of months ago Rustafied had introduced new server which is requiring phone number authentication similar to csgo for eliminating hackers. After first day server was dead already. Because hack users are creating the high percentage in this game and they won't really going to play on a server which has strict rules. On the other hand cheaters are not even getting banned from the servers they are just getting kicked. Because everybody wants to play on crowded servers servers can't sell VIP que accounts without having crowd. In small term banning hack users will decrease the population and prevent servers to have income.I saw many good games whose are currently laying on wasted cemetary even though they were carrying great potentiaI. They have always come to this point because of their vicious profit policy. In the greater pespective Rust is dying because of this situation many decent people are leaving the game. Why do I spend labor and time to see all of my earnings getting stolen by a cheater? I saw flying people myself aimhack no recoil etc. Rust hack is just the worse. You may see how bad it is on youtube. it's easily accessible and commonly used by 12 years old sassy self deceiver shitbricks and anti cheat system is totally useless about it.And here twitter account which is publishing people banned from Rust every minute.https //twitter.com/rusthackreport?ref_src twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5EauthorI am waiting for taking steps about hacking more than 4 months Devs are doing nothing about it. Servers are doing nothing about it. Community does not care if someone complains about hack they are just blaming him of being a bad player. (Yeah since decent people leave day by day Rust distilled with extremely toxic community)So yes hack is common thing in Rust If you don't like to get cancer I suggest you to don't playing it.

Facepunch a good example of these money guzzling developers released a ""game"" called ""Rust"" back in December of 2013 under early access.

2016-01-03,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,"Guns in this game are way more over powered than any other form of combat. The game is all about building up enough resources until you can get guns. Once you have guns it's all about either A. Raiding other people who may or may not have guns and stealing their stuff or B. Protecting your stuff/guns. Either way the game isn't fun pre guns and is arguably boring post guns.If you don't have anyone to group with you probably won't surivive long enough to pass step 1 ""Get guns"". If you try to build a base by yourself it will inevitably be destroyed by a group of people who have guns. If you try to get the resources necessary to build guns you'll find that people with guns camp all of the blueprint spawn locations and steal them from you.If by some miracle you do get guns or a teammate you then have to deal with the endless onslaughts against your base and the horrible profanity racism bigotry and overall disturbing behavior of the other players. Playing this game is like peering into the septic tank of the gaming community. But some people are into that thing.Also on the off chance you buy and play this game anyway turn up your gamma. You'll thank me when it turns night time and everyone else in the game can see you but you alone are effectively blind.

2013-12-15,1,3,134,True,Recommended,I have now played this game for 2 hours 1h with a friend and 1h alone. Playing alone is a little bit easier in the begining you dont have to split rescourses between others and you can use everything you find yourself. BUT it is harder to take down animals and players. If you are alone players will see you as an easy pray and will try to kill you if you have a friend with you people will turn around and run away (unless they rambo yo asss). Playing with a friend is alot more fun and makes some things easier for you like killing animals and protect yourself from other players. The only thing that is annoying is to find each other. It is a pretty big island and it will take you sometime to find your friend. Figuring out what to do and how to do things is pretty easy. If you have trubble just ask in the server chat there is often good guys telling you what key to press and how to find stone wood etc. Having a microphone boosts your chance of survival and relation among other players. Its better and faster communication with it. Players atleast what i have noticed feel more secure around you if you speak to them. The game itself is stable and there is alot of things to do. The graphics is pretty good nothing to complain about. Its still Alpha there is alot of things to come and the developers are trust worthy (the creator of Garrys mod is one of them). In my opinion this game is worth the 18 99 euros and its a great survival game. But make sure you have someone to play with and that you own a microphone. +Positive Great survival feeling easy crafting system simple building system and overall good looking. Edit Naked men hunting each other with rocks its so much fun! (no homo) Negative Hard to find each other (if you have a premade via skype) and annoying players who murder you for nothing.,Rust

2015-02-08,1,3,1612,True,Not Recommended,"I started playing this game in 2014 on the Official East Coast server with my brother. He started this game and found it quite additcing. He had managed to cobble enough resources together died several times but eventually wanted me in to play with him. This was the start of what I can honestly say grew into a passion for the game itself. We played on the officals for about 200 300 hours before the hackers made us throw our hands in vain (flying mostly) and went to a modded environment. We found some great friends along the way. I even opened my own server up in May 2014. All the while though Facepunch continued to evolve the experimental branch. I will continue to refer to this branch as experimental because it is just that. Compared to the actual legacy rust I wish FacePunch didn't even bother to waste our time. The legacy servers always had more people the action was more intense the community was just top notch. I am speaking in the past for a specific reason though. My server will stop in mid February which is how it should be. Since H1Z1 came out the interest in playing legacy rust has dried up. Players have moved on the community has moved on. The only thing binding people that I know is our teamspeak server. Rust legacy was always FUN. The Experimental not so much. I can understand the hardships with developers and having to re think where things are going. However in my own opinion having sunk 1186 hours into the game the mindshare that Rust had is no longer there. It has taken too long and there is little direction on where FacePunch wishes with go with this game. This is the problem with Early access though too. We get burnd out especially so if the game takes so long to complete. In this case the developer all but abandoned the legacy branch to move on to the Experimental while the player base continued on the legacy. They stayed on legacy too despite several changes to the experiemental. The ""new"" Rust just doesn't feel the same and I really doubt it ever will. The money for development came from legacy sales. I do not think they will get anywhere near the interest if this game ever does release. I am not knocking FacePunch for deliverying a bad game. My hours alone are a testament in how much fun myself and my team of admins/moderators had. However the timing is just off and my interest in particular is wanning. There are many other games coming out that have tried to capture that feeling you get. The shear apprehension of being in your base and being terrorized by other players as they taunt and hunt you. This is what is missing along with basically evertything we came to know and love about the legacy version. Crafting creating kill rooms in your base the thrill of blowing into a base with C4 and making sure your entire team keeps situation awareness high. It was fun also watching what others created. This is what struck me as being a great part of Rust and sadly this was absent from the new version. I'll miss the friendships and the community we made here but there are other games and hopefully some will follow. It was a wild ride and one I happy to have been a part of. I enjoyed playing the game of course and I feel the money I spent on the game on hosting on everything was well worth it. It's just a sad day but nothing is forever. As my brother would so often say ""We aren't Bert and Ernie and this isn't Sesame Street""",Rust

Finished upgrading the first floor walls to stone. About to start the next floor. I hear some footsteps outside my house so I clean out my inventory into some chests. (Side Note I made the center of my house a circle with the triangle foundation then went in each direction 3 blocks then used another six to make the corners filling in the floor). Next thing i know i get shot through the wall and get 1 shotted. I assume they were using Bolt Action rifles because I don't know of anything else can 1 shot you. They (being 3 people) procede to decimate me using automatic and the bolt action guns. They break into my base and destroy everything in a matter of minutes. 10 hours wasted because I forgot that the only way to win a survival game is to be a bag and destroy everything on site no matter how far into the game they are.Do I recommend this game?

2014-05-27,0,0,93,True,Recommended,"TLDR Best survival and crafting game it's worth to buy!OK first of all if you love crafting and surviving game you should definately try this game out. When you're new to any of the server you'll be spawned at some random place around the map which is kinda like you're lost somewhere and you have no freaking idea where you are going to. There are radiation places at many spots you need to stay out from them until you have some sort anti radiation stuff like radiation pills and all that. Don't think you're the only one around the map there are tons of animals which includes bears wolves and other unharmful animals like deers chicken rabbit etc. The main goal of this game is to survive you can craft tons of for yourself or your team mates. Raid other bases or houses and steal stuff deathmatching in this game is at TOP you will get killed most likely in some minutes if you don't know how to cover fight and run. From starting you would be only having a stone some healing patch and a torch (some servers allows to give you starter kit from which you can get several stuff to start ""/kit starter"" &lt I'm not sure about this because the server I played is having that feature so you can have some bows arrows and some cooked food). Anyway I really recommend this game it's just mind blowing the atmosphere of this game the features are really awesome. Also this game is having little bugs (less than other games like DayZ) which will be fixed in future updates as promised by the developers. You must try this game out if you're even a fan of minecraft or not it's just 20x better than minecraft as it doesn't have those graphics.",Rust

I play EVE so I'm used to worse.but the early game grind is just not very appealing when you do it alone.in fact owning a home isnt worth it unless you have a code lock as regular locks are soo useless that they are often the only loot found in earlier stated looted starter homes.game aslo runs like only 25 fps if I breath magic into my gpu.idk after like 3 years I kinda expected more from this.I wont refund but man do I feel dissapointed.gary you asshat btw in case you care being stuck as a female charater in fact does make the game harder to play as people either follow and or kill you just to stare at ma boobies.however im ok with this wierd little experiment in general lol",Rust
2015-12-02,1,3,27,True,Not Recommended,Bought this game on sale after having seen it on the store front page numerous times and heard a lot about it. Boy was that a mistake. This game is completely terrible and was a waste of $13. All you do is get killed and robbed by kids over and over again. Any progress you make in the game will inevitably be squashed by a 14 year old with a gun and way too much time on his hands.Unless you have a huge support group helping you out don't bother playing this crap. Actually even if you do have a huge support group don't bother. One day you'll log out and come back the next day to play and find your amazingly fortified base broken into all your stuff looted and yourself murdered.On top of the poor game mechanics and broken gameplay the game runs pretty bad even on a GTX 980. It's obviously not well optimized. The mobs are really buggy and animals clip through mountains all day while you chase after them trying to hunt them for mats. The map system is awful no trading system pvp is too unrestricted. Just not a fun game overall.Edit came back to see if the game got any better now it doesn't even work.

Game is a very large grind and the majority of your progess can be taken away in the middle of the night or while you are at work during offline raids which resulting is starting out from scratch,Rust

2017-03-29,0,0,2398,True,Not Recommended,Too many hackers in this game. Easy Anti Cheat is not doing the job. The grind is too much the crafting to just get killed by some retard with aimbotstarting on a new server is frustrating with the new meta (everybody has a pistol) unless you join exactly when it wipes.crossbows/shootguns are not used anymore .. it s p2 revolver. They made the p2 so op that they had to nerf it a few times lolzanother this i don t like is the chance to find something good is gone looting boxes barrels was random and fun in the bp time.The AK nerf was horrible making the gun sway left and right randomly that s when the game started to die for me. I used to be so good with an AK but facepunch wanted to bring the P2 the semi rifle.+ the bp system allowed you to trade or have ppl farm for bps. There used to be alot of interaction between players on a server ( the friendly type ) not just trashing The truth is FacePunch dosen t care about the ppl that bought the game they just change the game constantly to make new ppl buy it.,Rust

2017-06-29,0,0,84,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a game that is very difficult to enjoy. You most certainly don't play it for fun but rather to guard your base and raid others. It is a game that demands your time which is a more polite way of saying it is very grindy. While it has decent Base building mechanics and survival mechanics the game usually devolves into a poor man's PUBG with the other aspects of it (Survival and building a base) tacked on to it. The performance of this game has slightly improved but the game still faces huge issues such as an abondance of cheaters and griefers. Beyond that the community is hostile 90% of the time. This is an unfortunate side effect of this game's core design of destroying other people's progress. Because of all this I can't recommend this game.,Rust

Some people are amused by the whole ""lol I killed a naked guy with a rock and took his raw chicken"" thing but the novelty of that wears off almost immediately unless you are a child.

I simply don't understand how this game has so many positive reviews and I'm disappointed that the reviews swayed me to drop $$ on this game.

2015-07-29,0,0,78,True,Recommended,Good game. Terrible community.Multiplayer sandbox games like Rust are only as good as the players who in habitat them. And sadly Rust's player base is pretty miserable. The game's core mechanics are intriguing and have potential. But most of us normal adults aren't masochistic enough to endure the constant griefing from mean spirited pothead dudebros with low self esteem and sociopathic tendencies. Here's hoping that the developers recognize the need for a nontoxic player community and create mechanism within the game that foster cooperation and healthy competitiveness and discourages the blatant antagonism and nastiness that currently plagues the game. In the meantime I'll just play on my local private server.,Rust

2014-07-31,0,0,1137,True,Recommended,this game is really good and has potential. However there are many players that dont play the game properly cheat hack and do whatever they can to spoil someone elses game. I was on the experiemental version this evening minding my own business and not a threat to anyone when some random player decided to shoot me in the face. I had my own server for a while I didnt give myself any advantage over anyone else and played like the other players. So i farmed my own resources etc and build a base. Only to find that every time i logged back in I had been raided and walled in my base. Its pathetic behaviour. Ive just got so fed up with the game now that I shut down my server and I dont even bother playing anymore.Its a good game and sometimes you meet nice players but the majority of the time its about players being arsholes towards eachother. Im not going to spend hours gathering resources and building a base for someone to come and ruin for the sake of it.UPDATE MARCH 2015Ok so I started playing rust again after months and months of not giving it the time of day and I have to say that I am really enjoying playing the game again. I play PVE as I cant stand the PVP aspect of the game. First night I found a PVE server where everyone was really friendly. Built my tweed house and logged out untill morning. Logged in the next day to find that some moron had raided me and nicked what little stuff i had. They didnt kill my sleeper though so I suppose I should be thankful for that. I found a different server to play on after that. Ive been playing on another PVE server now for the last few days. The rules are simple No Raiding No Looting and No PVP and its great. Im free to roam around collect airdrops share resources with other players etc and It has a real community feel to it. So this game is whatever you want it to be really buillder hunter bandit...which ever. If you can find a good server to play on with good people the game can be very fun,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,94,True,Recommended,For an early access game Rust is a pretty large package. Rust is pretty bug free and already has a lot more features than most AAA games that release. The game features hunting building crafting and raiding.Hunting When you spawn you will have as follows a rock two bandages and a torch. with these items you must find food and shelter. This process involves beating an animal (deer wolf or bear) to death with a rock. Once you gain raw meat you will need to cook it. To cook meat you have to gather wood by hitting it with you rock and making a campfire. You then place the meat and wood into the campfire and wait. Once you have cooked meat you can begin not starving to death. Alternatively you can find food in towns or by raiding/killing other players.Crafting Rust features a crafting system which allows you to craft almost every obtainable item in the game. Once you gather the materials to craft you need to open the crafting menu (which is located in the inventory). When crafting your movment speed is cut in half and you cannot sprint. You also cannot craft more than one type of item at a time. However you can craft as many of one object as you want as long as you have the necessary materials. To gain the ability to craft more items you can either find blueprints or reserch items with a research kit. Building Once you have enough wood or metal you can build foundations. Foundations can be grouped together and be built upon. Take note thoough as only wood can go on wood foundations (with the exception of metal doors) and only metal can go on metal foundations (with the exception of wood doors). The building parts are as follows foundations walls doorways doors windows stairs ramps large spiked walls spiked walls and gates. Take note DOORS AND GATES CAN ONLY BE OPENED BY THE PERSON WHO PLACES THEM. You can however break down doors (I will touch upon this in raiding). You can also have basic furnishings. There are wood storage crates campfires smelters workbenches and sleeping bags. Smelters let you smelt metal ore into metal fragments and sulfur ore into sulfur fragments. Workbenches let You craft with metal. Sleeping bags let you choose an area to spawn.Raiding Rust is a VERY hostile game. If you find armor and weapons you WILL eventually be murdered by another player. To take it further if you build a home YOU WILL BE RAIDED EVENTUALLY! Depending on the kind of player you are you may raid. Raiding involves a wall or door being removed by either explosives or hitting it with a tool. Once that happens people usually die items are stolen and sleeping bags are destroyed.,Rust

2014-09-26,0,0,142,True,Not Recommended,"What started off as a good game slowly became 'early access hell' . I would've recommended this game a few months ago because it was so much better than Minecraft in every way. The gameplay was better the realism was better and the graphics was better. But a few months passed and Facepunch didn't really add anything new to this game. It started getting stale and not as enjoyable as compared to when I first got it. Then Facepunch announced that they would be making this 'new' game for Rust and that everybody who currently owned Rust would get it for free. However they didn't even bother fixing the fundementals of the 'normal' Rust. I still get framerate drops and lag spikes even though I can run Payday 2 on medium to high settings. The other issue is that the developers for this game especially Garry have been very unprofessional with the community. There have been many situations but the most recent was Garry's wonderful idea to remove 1st person and force 3rd person view on everybody. In the last few days the community overwhelming rejected the idea and made it clear yet Garry responded with a basic ""we heard you guys b*tching and moaning over nothing and we're going to do it anyways."" They need to realise that we paid our hard earned cash for this game and what are they doing? They're messing around and 'claming' that they're adding improvements to the game. I get 100mb+ updates which add very little to the game and guess what? They're not even bug fixes. I cannot recommend this game to anyone anymore.

2014-01-24,0,0,253,True,Recommended,"OverviewRust is an online adventure role playing game made from the developers of the hit game Garry s Mod. This game is all about survival trying to survive against animals zombies and other players to build a grand house cook chicken make alliances and hunt others. Rust shows a lot of potential for only being an Alpha development game...PresentationRust s graphics won t win any awards however they get the job done presenting a barren and lonely landscape. Fields of grass rocks cliffs bordering up to the southern ocean with a road going around the center of the map where most of the action happens. By the road there are several radiation towns and zombies around them. The models aren t anything special. There s a few basic animals that look decent two types of zombies which look less than decent (however the developers plan to take them out). There is currently only one player model that is just a basic human (type censor.nudity false in console to see nude men!). Overall the environments and models are average and very Unity esc. There are few graphical options to the game currently at startup you can select from a few basic options and in the main menu you can change the render distance and vsync. However by typing commands in console you can change options like turning grass off (there is a great guide to this Just Click Here ). Hopefully in the future they will add more graphical options and optimize the game more. GameplaySurvival games aren't exactly brand new to the industry. However each game has it s own unique play style and feel to it and Rust is no exception. You have a set amount of calories and need to continually eat so that you don t starve.There is also your general health which can deteriorate from attacks from players wolves bears fall damage hunger and other factors. The last state is your radiation state which is how much radiation you have from walking around radiation towns and such. There s no set objective in the game other than to survive however many players make many goals than just surviving. In the beginning the player starts out only with a rock bandages and a torch. From there you have to hit trees to get wood and hit certain kinds of rocks to get rocks metal ore and sulfur ore. Once you have enough wood you can build a shelter which will act as a temporary base. Then you ll want to go animal hunting and try to find a deer or pig to kill with your rock. Hunting in this game is very tedious in the beginning of a player s life and can be exceptionally frustrating for a new player. You try to chase the animal around attempting to hit it with your rock while trying to run and watch out for other threats. If you were to eventually kill an animal then in order to get the cloth raw chicken breast animal fat and blood from it you have to hit it with your rock for about another minute. While all of these things seem tedious by themselves they all somehow give an odd sense of accomplishment when successful. Now you can make a campfire to cook your chicken and make a sleeping bag for a spawn point. The developers have recently introduced a cot as well which is a nice addition than just a sleeping bag. Eventually you ll be able to make a larger and custom house which is a very nice feature. This is where a lot of people have fun with Rust. People can build huge mansion like houses or gigantic towers seen from miles away. But all of these come with the people who want to take them and all of the loot inside. Building an impenetrable house is almost impossible however this is where another aspect of the most fun is which is raiding. Get a group of friends together gear up and take a house down loot all of the stuff kill the people inside and run away victorious. However you might have just started a war. This just adds another level of depth to this game. In order to get items in the game (other than raiding or killing other players) there are a few ways. The first ways is to craft it with the craft menu this usually takes refined metal wood and other materials which are used together to make things like hunting bows revolvers and windows for your house as well as many other things. However not everything can be crafted right out of spawn you have to pick up some things from zombies or Rad towns. Zombies contain many different items including blueprints to how to make more complex things like rifles. you can also find these things in Rad towns. Rust gameplay is unique from other games as well as difficult and tedious however extremely rewarding.MultiplayerRust is solely multiplay and I believe that the developers will keep it that way. The Rust community can be brutal and many will kill on sight resulting in you having to respawn countless numbers of times in your early game. However Garry himself puts it best when other players don t kill you It's a weird thing. When any player can kill you easily and they don't it's like the biggest compliment ever. They become good friends. You go to bed and lie there and think to yourself ""that was a nice guy I hope I run into him again."" Garry is 100% true about this it is one of the things that really push this game along (however be warned you will die A Lot). Most of the servers are good and mid low ping however they will occasionally wipe with updates and servers go down when there is a new update until they update making you wait for long periods of time until the admin gets on to update it. ExtrasGarry and his team really work hard on this game and push out updates quickly and are working to fix things that are problems constantly optimizing the game squashing bugs and banning banners. The game however has experienced DDos attacks in the past but the team worked diligently and got the servers back up. SummaryRust is an extremely fun game if players outlast the beginning noobiness of just starting out. Only being in Alpha stage development the game has the potential to be one of the most popular games of all time. This game definitely deserves a look from anybody moderately interested in the concept there are some great videos online that I suggest you take a look at.This will prove to be another one of Garry s masterpieces.",Rust

I found his friend asleep inside. I killed the sleeper and took all the belongings they had. Then I sat by the door with a shotgun waiting for un suspecting soul to come home. As soon as he opened the door I dropped him with one shot. He probably had a heart attack and/or soiled himself. I don't let people live nearby they might try to rob me. But as for my house it appears to be some easy loot but when you try to get to it you fall through a floor that seems solid but isn't into water just deep enough to freeze to death in before you have time to hatchet your way out. 10+ victims in one day all distracted from the real loot next door.

I can't not recommend a game for its players but the players are awful. For the most part they seem to be 13 year old Call of Duty kids who do dumb stuff and think they are Rambo killing naked new spawns for their rock and torch. Gee thanks kid I was totally a threat to you gathering this here rock. I've barely owned it very long however I've already spent a lot of time playing and have nothing to show for it. That says a lot about the game it's good enough to keep you interested no matter how many times you die or how hard done by you feel. Every time you think ""It's going to be better this time!"" but it isn't. The game gives you hope to start again every time for making survival and fear fun and for that it's a great game but I will enjoy it even more when it's better balanced. You'd think from my experiences that the game is solely about PvP everything making your own get out there be a and TAKE IT FROM OTHERS! That the only aim of it is to go and KOS everyone you can.

All i'm gonna say is that this game is both great and God awful. I have nearly 700 hours on this game as of writing this and I do so believe about 400 of that has been fun. That seems like a lot but that leaves 300 left. That 300 was hackers 6 year olds admins and people who have no clue how to spell ""at"". I once played with some friends (They started hacking called em out they haven't really spoken to me since because they take games to the extreme. (aside from a few insults they gave me lol)) and they saved a guy from a rad bear. He joined our little squad and we had a good time for 2 3 days. That 3rd day though we learned that this entire friendship was a plot to get our gear. He told his buddies the codes they came in killed us and camped us for about 30 min. We got our base back. We ended up killing 3/5 of them later retreiving some basic gear such as weapons armor and food.Several things similar have happened and I consider all of those FUN times. If you are thinking wether or not to get this game (ik i butchered that spelling) then get it. It is an amazing game and I do like legacy more than the new Rust. I understand why they switched to the new branch but no offense to anyone I think it is .

You need to devote a good amount of time to this game to get out of it what you want. With the current construction system in place nothing is inpenetrable and can make for some frustrating times with raiders and griefers.

2015-10-02,1,19,117,True,Not Recommended,RUST SummaryRust is a realistic 3D Sandbox multiplayer survival game. Graphically the game provides a good artstyle however gameplay wise it is awful its not horrible but its not really my cup of tea even though I love sandbox survival games. The game failed to live up to my expections even though I wanted the game a long time.StoryThis game has no story.GameplayMechanics are fairly simple but gets complex over time you start off naked with a rock and torch and you're suppose to collect resources and materials to ''Git Gud'' after managing to get some resources without dying you're force to just follow the order to getting resources and raid other people's bases which may or may not have already been raided. Final NotesThe optimization was terrible and lowering the graphics to all low will not increase performance and there will be many full servers which leaves you with the laggy 200+ ping servers with people roaming around trying to kill you.Overall I didn't enjoy the game you may have enjoyed it but i did not so please respect my opinion as i respect yours.

2014-02-04,0,0,390,True,Recommended,RECENT REVIEW New engine completely rebuilt lots of updates It's a pretty decent game again although having a beast computer is the only way to see the new engine at its best It's too overwhelming on my computer and i'm having trouble playing it with all my settings either off or extremely low.Its got lots of new additions such as a completely new map which is absolutely massive and if you die without a sleeping bag placed chances are you aren't going to find your spot again anytime soon if ever horses they're quite cool and the deer the animals are just completely awesome except for the wolves they could be downgraded they run way too fast and glitch all over the place.all different types of building wood stone sheet metal reinforced locks cupboards There's so many new features and additions it's all had a makeover and is pretty.. hahaI guess it's a decent game again depending on the server you play on I won't be playing it as much as i used to but it's a nice treat every now and then ) EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I stopped playing a fair bit after zombies were removed and replaced with mutant bears and wolves It just wasn't as much fun I enjoyed finding an amazing server with a decent community running around the map on resource runs and seeing who could headshot a zombie first Zombies really were the highlight of this game for me after that was removed everything went bad there were no decent servers there were hackers less updates found myself and a friend just throwing flares down a hill and watching it roll for about 3 hours and that was all we did. Thus Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it. EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game I'm excited and dreading new updates I love the way it is at the moment not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better going to have to wait and find out I spend most of my time playing this game Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea it'll ruin your experience all together the key is to find a decent server with only about 20 40 people online i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money considering it's in Alpha it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad Looks great is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop and that's when I play with Render Quality 0 and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all Great game definitely worth a look at )I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo then again it's in alpha and only $20 Still worth a look )I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon D,Rust

Rust not even once.,Rust
2016-05-07,0,0,355,True,Not Recommended,This game is currently broken. The spawn rate of Bears and Wolves (predators who attack you) is ridiculously high. In addition the wolf has an insane amount of health ( as does the bear but that makes sense) and you cannont run away from it (the bear aswell) while it proceeds to do heavy dps. Furthermore they sit in generally the same area so you cannot go recover your items which is a huge deterrent for fresh spawns who were just getting started. Another thing is that all animals are able to glitch run up and down surfaces so they can immediately pop up on a rock and ruin your day. The bears and wolfs are good add in to the game to help keep tension but unless you are prepared (which considering they are still silent and everywhere making preparation impossible) you will get rekt. This results in very tedious and unfun beggining resourcing to the point where you will rage quit. And also the developers keep nerfing the playing without balancing out the the known issues aswell hunger rate has increased the cold is now colder? I understand wanting to polish things up but you leave nails sticking out ready to snag anyone who comes near because you are too busy polishing the floor that's dumb fix the game. Either nerf the predators or buff the player or make armor that isnt cheese to them. Nobody cares about the cold or hunger.,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,723,True,Recommended,Rust is a multiplayer survival game in which players starting only with a rock a torch and some bandages must craft shelters and fend against the environment. As the player you have to decide who you can and cannot trust. I naively thought that everyone was reasonably trustworthy but don't be fooled! It is to your advantage to begin the game with a group of friends and to start on an empty or relatively empty server. Once you get to know the map and how to craft most items it turns into a fight over the rarest of materials dropped by planes or found in radiation dense complexes. Despite being in alpha I have not run across any game breaking bugs or defects. Overall I believe this game is very promising and will continue to be amazing as it develops.,Rust

What I'm trying to say Is If you love the thrill and exitment and you can take n the challenges of big clans who will dominate servers then get the game but If you aren't sure If you would really like/enjoy the game save your money and buy the game when it develops back into a LoneWolf game and a Clan game.

2016-07-23,0,0,843,True,Recommended,As a survival game this game hits it perfectly. Graphics in this game are stunning. The game makes you grind and love your structures although it's time consuming but eventually it's all always worth it. If you are looking for game that eats all of your time Rust is perfect for you. Although as a solo and two man army player I can say that you are much likely to survive as a big group. The game taught me a lot and I can say there is A LOT of things you might not know. From 1 to 10 I would give this game 9. The game is good and fun but it have some flaws. The game has been made for really good pc's and it's recommended to groups. Really great game and I would recommend this for people who have good pc and loads of friends to play with.,Rust

I don t recommend a PVP server in your first game but I thoroughly enjoy PVE servers. I recommend the ""Wolfland"" server if you can find it. It has no C4 or explosives so no one can raid you if you have a metal door. When I got my first 9mm pistol I felt like I was god and everybody was an ant. Surprisingly people over say how often they got murdered. After 26 hours or so I only died once by player. I died more times falling.

Save a minute and give this a quick read.As of writing this I only have 279 hours in Rust and I haven't played close to 2 years.I don't have many friends that play Rust and it's hard to find almost literally anyone in game that doesn't either at most headshot you or at least kill you with bows/machetes on sight.The newer the player is the friendlier they are but the better they get the more vicious they become because that's how everyone else is. The goal is to stop being friendly start being a What's the endgame? Well it's essentially killing solo farmers with your 4+ man group griefing their 2x1 wooden hack so they can't use it and despawning what you don't need so the player you're ""raiding"" doesn't get anything and go back to what they were when they first joined the server a naked with nothing.Understand that it's a game with a large PVP element but is this what it's supposed to be? Everyone just killing on sight? No interactions going on crazy adventures doing crazier stuff? Why not play a different game like an FPS? Or fortnite? You can build and you're SUPPOSED to kill on sight.I highly suggest not buying this game if you're new. You'll think that from all the YouTube videos that it's a game where you'll meet insane funny people farm materials build a base hunt for food get some gear get more materials for a bigger better base get some weapons to try to take on some other similar players with your new found friends. But nope unless you're playing with friends that play every day have several thousand hours combined so they can teach you you'll only be get killed after spawning or at best farming wood with your rock while running back to your 2x2 foundation. And I'm not even mentioning the hackers (that are at a minimum 5 per server) because that's another issue completely.It's not a fun game anymore. Only positive thing I can say is that the Devs listen to the community and care very much about what you want.So yeah that's it.

I farmed the loot of of a town for 2 hours about 1 hour and 45 min i found a pistol everything i had found in that time before was useless. 2 people came up to me and shot me with a bow in the head killing me. That entire 2 hours i spent was wasted and i had nothing to show for it. If i want to level up to even get to the point where i can make a pistol i would have to go around hitting trees and rocks for hours upon hours. this Game is clearly aimed at people who play in groups.

2016-07-20,0,0,404,False,Recommended,"I've owned this ever since the zombie removal update (February ish 2014) and I can tell you first hand that this game has improved greatly. Unlike other games (*cough* *cough* DayZ *cough*) the devs of this game really care about their players and are always introducing new ideas into the game. That doesn't mean that this game doesn't have its own issues. In its current state animals can walk vertically over small cliffs so be prepared to die to ninja bears very often at the start. Just know that at first (especially if you play solo) the game will seem very intimidating and unforgiving. Expect to die a lot to other players since most people in this game kill you on sight. Be prepared to spend hours collecting wood and stone just to have someone take over your base using just a bow or spear. You will become acclimated to the game after a few hours and will be able to lead your own raids on other people. Give this game at least a good 20ish hours and I guarentee you will get some fun out of it. It's definitely worth your $20.EDIT So the game released from early access a few months ago and with its release came a price tag. It's now $35. Personally I still think this game is a no brainer even at the new price but I'd definitely recommend trying it with a few friends at first. It takes a while to get ""into"" the game so by the time you figure out if you really want the game or not you probably won't be eligible for a Steam refund anymore. The devs are still adding new content to the game despite the game being fully released. If you like the idea of grinding (you have to constantly supply your base with materials to prevent it from decaying away) and raiding (extremely fun) then I'd strongly recommend picking this game up. Just realize that you will get raided and you will have to start fresh at some point which sometimes is devastating. If this doesn't sound like your type of game or if you don't have enough time to invest in the game this game might not be for you.",Rust
2016-10-27,0,0,270,True,Not Recommended,"Sooo....Rust...yeah...I'ts not that I dont recommend Rust it sure is a fun game to play with friends 'n stuff (at least during legacy it was) but now that they included this t of leveling up to unlock blueprints...Even though you need some time to even be able to craft actual guns it still feels hardly balanced. It's not an issue with the game itself that everyone shoots everyone else but an issue that occured because of Rust's gameplay. After you've reached a specific point there really are no other things to do than to go out and raid bases or troll other people.I know they tweaked the hunger/thirst...you now have to eat/drink more regulary than before wow...Before the leveling system As a new player (on a server) you sure had problems competing with others but you could still get ""lategame"" guns and armor fairly easily due to the blueprint loot.With the leveling system Expect to be gunned down a lot before even wielding your first gun. You now have to get XP to unlock new blueprints.Long story short GRIND GRIND GRIND and expect to lose a lot of your stuff. I'm not the kind of player that sits on a server and grinds the hell out of a game 24/7. I don't have the time for that and even if I wouldn't be spending it on grinding...this is just not the way a ""survival"" game should work. It's about getting your stuff together and not punching a tree for the 1000th time and suddenly you'll be all like ""I can craft an fully automatic assault rifle now""Rust is dead for me now. I've had enough. It's not a game for casual players (anymore).But I will alway remember the good old legacy and the hours of fun I had &lt 3Ohh and PS If you loose a firefight just ignore the comments about it.

Unfortunately helk has taken great efforts to ruin anything good about what was once my favorite game. While others in the team may do their best to improve the game it is quickly devolving into a skilless pve grindfest. The most recent patch was the final nail in the coffin. Now there is literally zero skill inovlved in pvp. The guns auto correct for recoil when tap fired and have nearly no recoil to begin with so they are basically bullet hoses. The bolt action rifle has no scope sway with a laser sight. Over all the game now take less skill than Call of Duty. #MakeRustGreatAgain,Rust

2018-01-04,3,3,48,True,Not Recommended,Everyone in this game is a d**k.

2017-11-23,9,27,270,True,Not Recommended,The PvP is burning garbage since you can just heal with food/water mid combat. Yeah. Heal away those crossbow hits to the head.This game has been in alpha limbo for many years and will probably get pulled before it's finished.There is no fairness. In any vanilla server you could be a fresh spawn naked getting gunned down and called trash by some fully geared greasy sweatgoblin with an AK.Hackers are still a major issue. People turning on godmode spawning in whatever they want Flying Speedhacking and using autoaim to deal ridiculous amounts of damage.Even with a solid internet connection and being able to play at over 70fps in just about any other game that's far more graphically intense this game spazzes out and rubberbands people lagging hard even in servers where I have &lt 50 ping.After almost 300 hours I can say with certainty that this game a whole lot of doing stuff that isn't fun and the stuff that would normally be fun isn't fair. Most fights are won or lost before they even start.The only thing that kept me coming back is how I like to contribute to a clan or community or something greater than myself but I can do that in better games. I will not be reinstalling any time soon. This game is barely even a game and more like a social contest to see who can be the biggest buttmunch.,Rust

Players are hostile as even when you ask for something as simple as a rock. The new XP system is absolutely game breaking making alot of the useful stuff unavailable at the start of the game. The community is absolute garbage Killing new players and nakeds for the fun usually using bad excuses such as ""They are a potential threat to me"" When all they are doing is killing someone who is either new or have started over.

2015-06-21,6,11,165,True,Recommended,"Rust Currently in my opinion the best freeroam survival game out there (I do not currently own certain games so this is off my experience with survival games). Rust has it ups and downs. You can make friends or foes you can battle with your friends against your foes control whole areas build allies around you and dominate the land. For me Rust is a game that isn't going to get old soon. The various multiplayer servers allow you to choose what you want. You can choose a higher gather rate if you want a fast pace PvP and base building experience. Or you could play on one of the official servers if you are more on the ""Wanna Be Survivalist"" side of the experience.

There are some PVE monsters (wolfs bears etc) but they are not interesting.Why I think that this game is PVP focused?Maybe because You can build a rocket launcher and You can't build a simple cooker and You need to cook Your meal IN CAMPFIRE INSIDE THE BASE.After 10 hours of playing I almost built everything.Thats one of the reason other is their shop. They seem to focus on this now so they can make more money.Exporewise crap.Everywhere You need to go by foot swimming is really clumsy terrain very empty inventory very small.Your gameplay looks like this Spawn gather build gather build gather (Oh You managed to find the best path for gathering items) build You run again on same path as it respawned build.Then all of the sudden helicopter spots You and You loose everything. Not a single thing no items laying around.Everything vanished.There are no ""tribes"" and You can loot/kill people who sleep this is unfair.Anyway I hope You enjoyed my review and it helped You decide if this game is for You.PS.

But beware some people in rust dont take to kindly to other playersdefend your house with wooden spikes and metal doors. And killing off the attackers yourself.after you gather enough metal you can craft some guns such as pistol shotgun assualt rifle sniper and also you can craft some cave men like weapons such as ""Hand Cannon"" (Remember all these guns need ammo)you can also give your character some clothes to protect him from bullets melee cold raditionthere are alot of types of clothes that protect you from different thingsthere are also blueprints which you can find in the game to craft different thingsbut be careful in Rust because there are certain places which has radiation that can kill your characterthese places often have abandonded houses and factories near them which you can go to to find suppliesbut dont worry you can reduce your radition by taking ""Rad pills""Anyway I dont want to tell you the whole game I just told you the basics have fun with the rest of the game and finding out the rest )",Rust

2014-05-30,0,0,258,True,Recommended,Rust Legacy Review This review is for Rust Legacy which was the first Rust Module. I have a lot of experience in Rust and so far the entire time I've played it I've enjoyed it. You can play this game in many different kinds of ways. You get the choice to try and make friends perhaps team with them if you are lucky enough to find the people willing to let you on their team or you may want to stay quiet and be a lone ranger. Personally I would suggest playing this game with friends. With a group of friends you can have lots of fun being bandits and killing people on sight (KOS) or you can troll people going outside their base and playing music through your mic however the people on the house don't know that all of you are just carrying your amazing rock. Raiding bases can sometimes be intense especially when the people being raided are online. If they are online many battles may be lost and many won. I would suggest going onto one of the Battlefield servers on Rust that have kits that give you kevlar armour and guns. You can have a lot of gun practice on those servers. This can prepare you for when you may be in that situation when you are alone with leather armour and 3 kevlars outside. Just think of it you die and your base is basically gone. Everything stolen and some raiders might be so dumb as to hijack the base for themselves although they are not thinking about the fact that if they found the base other people will soon find it too. However after that long story if you manage to kill all 3 kevlars outside you are geared up for your entire team (if you have a team of 3) and you may even get Explosive Charges if they haven't already used them to break through your metal door(s). Basic Explanation of Rust Legacy Rust is an online survival game in which you join a server with just a rock 2 bandages and a torch. You have to go around collecting resources to build a base and create weapons. You can find weapons and other resources at special places in the Rust map. Some examples of these places are Hangar Split Rad Big Rad and Medium Rad. If you are lucky you can find blueprints for guns and armour etc. You can also find guns blueprints and building parts if you kill Mutant Animals. At the moment there are two types of Mutant Animals in the game. These are called the Mutant Bear and the Mutant Wolf. You can outrun a bear but wolves are hard to loose. However don't get too carried away thinking about your base and guns and animals for you are not alone. There are other people on the server some nice some mean. Most people don't even have a microphone. Whichever way people are out there and they will kill you for their survival. This game is a very serious intense violent survival game.,Rust

Late game sat mon mon thurs servers die and player base moves to moddedBuilding hasn't been improved for months. But hey. Thank God we have bear rugs now right ?Raiding is being made harder and harder. Unless you're a big group raiding anything bigger then a 2x2 is just not worth it anymore. Cupboard stacking. Cupboard radius buffs. Double wall stacking. The fact it takes 10 sulfur nodes to get 1 c4 but for the same 10 nodes you can make enough stone walls to take 10 c4 to get through.Components system is too grindy. How many times have you played to go ""oh. We need more gears"" only to hit 20 barrels and get nothing but wood or metal frags... Maybe the occasional sheet metal which is now useless since the heavy armour is basically a nerf right now.. then when you get that gear.. you get mowed down by a zerg.Any server with higher then 200 pop is basically.. you either hack.. zerg.. or no life. Why would you play on these servers as a solo or duo when there are legitimately zergs of 20+ around every rad town.

2016-11-07,2,30,127,True,Not Recommended,"I've played rust for about 100 hours and for almost all of that time I'd give it a good review. Recently however they decided to completely change a core mechanic of the game from character progression to map based progression. That might not seem like a big deal to someone who's never played rust but take it from someone who's well experienced with the game that is a massive change.There has been 4 eras in the way progress has worked in rust 1. Legacy The legacy era was pretty simple you go around the powerline and radtowns hit barrels and you could find blueprints. You pick these blueprints up use them and boom you learned how to craft something. Very simple but that simplicity left something to be desired.2. Blueprint Fragments A direct upgrade from the legacy era rather than finding entire blueprints you could find blueprint fragments in barrels and crates and could use 20 of them to learn a low tier blueprint or you could upgrade them to a sheet and learn a mid tier blueprint combine those into a book for a high tier blueprint or combine a few books into a library to learn only the highest tier items. There was a lot of RNG and it was frustrating to get the same blueprint twice but you had a much stronger and more satisfying sense of character progression with this system.3. XP System In my opinion the absolute best system that rust could have. The way it was implimented wasn't perfect but experience in a game like rust just makes sense. Rather than finding fragments of blueprints to just randomly learn how to make things you gain experience from crafting items gathering resources looting barrels and chests and killing animals and other players. When you gain enough experience you gain an experience point that you can use to unlock blueprints for use. When you gain enough experience points you level up and unlock new blueprints that you can use your points to ""buy"" (it didn't matter if you spent your points before levelling up). With this system clans and groups of players couldn't prowl the powerlines and rad towns to keep players from learning new blueprints solo players could go out farm for resources and learn how to craft weapons without the need to hunt down barrels and crates although it made it go by much quicker if you did. However it was very short lived and only lasted a few months before they completely changed it. The changes before had just been diferent kinds of character progression this new change completely removes all character progression.4. The Component System Hands down the worst change they've ever made to rust. Rather than having any kind of character progress it's all map based. You start out already knowing every single blueprint in the game (I'm not sure how it's supposed to be more realistic that you start the game knowing how to put together targeting computer systems and creating makeshift automated sentry guns but realism is certainly something they've always put before anything else). Rather than learning how to create something and always knowing how to make it you have to spend hours on end roaming the map trying to find a specific component for an item you want to make. And it's not like only a few items are like this a vast majority of items in the game require components to be made. This is bad for two major reasons A) It turns the game into a complete farmfest. All players do now is just run up and down the roads and power lines smacking barrels for hours at a time hoping to find a certain part. That's all the game is now. B) Clans can now lock down entire maps and completely gain control of rad towns and areas with high barrel spawn rates and they do. Before in the game the first few days of a server would be clans ravaging the rad towns for bp fragments but then after that you'd hardly have to worry about running into 6 guys at once because they don't have a reason to constantly and aggressively roam the towns and roads they already knew most of the blueprints and didn't need more fragments. Now there's never a point when a clan doesn't need to leave the roads and rad towns they always need more components to keep crafting new guns and armor. In most servers I've seen it's next to impossible to get to even a few barrels because clans just build all around the barrel spawn points and completely own those areas and they usually don't just let people get their precious components.At this point in development there's no reason to play none whatsoever. And it's not like the devs maybe saw what happened after they introduced this system and realized maybe one of the other systems were better they entirely intend to keep this system and just go with it from here on out and they even went as far as to say that they'd never go back to the xp system which a lot of people agree has been the best.I would 100% recommend that everyone stay away from this game it's going in a terrible direction and the devs don't intend on changing course. I would get a refund if I could but uninstalling it and trying to keep people from losing out on 20 bucks is all I can do.",Rust

2014-02-03,0,0,105,True,Not Recommended,The problem with the game is it is too easy to break the game. It has a lot of opprotunity but not enough to keep the game balanced. The only thing currently is to have an admin constantly resetting the game. For instance once a house hits a certain size only logical thing is to simply use large spikes to blocade the persons exits. The server I played on banned that and if you simply used that tactic you would be banned. So only other option farm and build c4. That is not my idea of fun or only attack people new to the server which personally I think is sort of cold. So stalemate between nearly everyone and just building bigger and bigger. Other problem is people playing on pvp server that whine like children when you actually kill them. I was called many of not polite comments. So definately mature rating because of the players crying. Oh and some admin abuse. For instance on angry campers because I was talking in the chat the admin wanted to take a screen shot didn't ask nicely and since I said could have asked like an adult. He closed the server. So yes huge childish behavior. Game is fun outside of the evrbal abuse and people complaining but needs more opprotunities to rebalance the game without server wipe. I.E. undergrounf tunnels to escape form your structure. Bigger maps so more places to make safe bases. Not just territories of first to metal mountain wins the game since that is where air drops land and all the metal nodes. Suggestion each day cycle nodes randomize in different locations.,Rust

Once I went out for a 15 minute walk come back I'm dead.The community completely ruins this game it is shocking how toxic it is. I enjoy this game at times but I would not recommend this game because all your time is spent gathering resources unless you are on a modded server on which there is likely a huge group of geared up guys that do offline raid 24/7.

2017-05-24,0,0,11,True,Not Recommended,Reason I wouldn't recommend this is mainly due to bugs needing to be worked out and lack of certain materials that should be simple to craft yet unavailable to you requiring you to find them. Items sometimes disappear out of thin air from dropping or dying which they drop and having issues finding your dead body with your items scattered across the place. Which some are either gone or hidden in hard to find spots. To top it off annoying A.I. Helicopter for some reason which flies out of nowhere gunning or blowing you up sometimes way too early. Having no way to defend yourself or run away (If your lucky).Speaking of running away trying not to die have fun getting killed by animals in two to three hits by either a wild boar wolf bear and some trigger happy player who will kill before you even can craft tools or a spear. Just like in Reigh of Kings or most Survival games all the hardwork you do will result in getting slaughtered by some random who will steal your Overall needs works.,Rust

2017-11-01,0,0,688,True,Not Recommended,This game is pure toxicity. While the developers have been shining up the visual aspects of this game the game's problem resides in just how toxic interactions are and relatively little incentive for anything other than KOS for 90 percent of encounters.That and it takes so little time to destroy structures that have taken days to create. The official servers are plagued with the worst of the worst in the community. The core gameplay is just meh.If you like endless frustration play this game.,Rust

2015-11-15,8,34,350,True,Not Recommended,"What's the goal?There isn't really any underlying goal to the game no environmental factor to overcome or point to reach. The game play comes from the interaction with other players and environment.How are the player interactions?Poor. Most players will aim to kill you or simply destroy your shelter(s) while you're offline.Are shelters safe?No. Any shelter you build can be easily destroyed for relatively low cost. Additionally it can be destroyed while you're offline and 9/10 times will be. Shelters should absoloutely be raidable but rust takes it a step too far by making it a simple task to completely demolish even large structures in little to no time so that it can be done in the span of an hour.What items are there?A lot of great survival items building items and tools. It gets weird however since players can also accumulated military grade items such as C4 Rocket launchers AK47's and Machine guns.Is it balanced?No. Knowledge is created via blue prints which persist between server resets. This means players who have been on a server longer will be able to build AK's and all the aforementioned items while you'll start with a rock. How is development?The developers maintain a development blog which is a great layer of transparancy. However updates seem to be generally quite slow and the direction the game takes is constantly changing and seems to favour militarization and new weapons (which seems to conflict with the core values of the game).Conclusion.I wouldn't recommend this game it's made a lot of progress but it's still about a year or two away from being a complete game. Additionally it doesn't really capture the ""survival"" aspect that it campaigns on and it's too far gone in the wrong direction. It would be great if your weapons maxed out at a much lower level to keep player interactions tense and to give more meaning to building a shelter.",Rust

2014-01-31,0,0,1267,True,Recommended,This game is addicting.At first my friend and I build a shelter harvested a bunch of resources and had a nice little camp set up with a tower and everything. Then a couple of guys invaded an airdrop we found and decided to shoot us on sight.This was the worst mistake they could have made since they had no idea how vengeful the two of us were.We regrouped and the two of us synced back up to start building a new place. We got very lucky and got a random airdrop that had C4 and explosives and we happened upon research kits to learn how to make both items permanently.The next day cycle in game we went on the hunt and found where these two jackasses and their friend were located. One of them left all of the doors open to their cabin while going in to regear. I instantly jumped inside tracked him down and shot him in the head twice to kill him. The other two came in to help him as I killed the guy again as he spawned.My friend killed one of them three times in a row before I finally got pinned down between the three and killed. My friend got away though.Then we waited...Once the next cycle came in game the three of them had logged off and it was just my friend and I left...Bad news.We took two C4 charges with us as that's all we could make at the time and found their base again. Instead of trying to blow through the series of doors crafting more and more C4 and hoping that we were able to get in I found a structual weak spot that lead us right into their main room. Two charges later and we were in. They all three were asleep inside and all they had were in large containers. First thing we did was kill all three of them in their sleep and chopped their beds up.These three had a stockpile of equipment and materials that was at least 5 days worth of full harvesting of air drops and resources from all three. My friend and I took all of the important stuff we could (C4 Explosives material to make them both high grade weapons research kits and building materials) and then made a run home to unload our haul.Then we came back to raid what was left and what we didn't want or couldn't carry down on the ground so it would despawn and the three it all belonged to would have nothing coming back into the game.We are now fortified more heavily than anyone on our server and we keep finding those guy's camps and raiding them forever since they decided to kill us for no reason at the start.

2017-11-11,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,Game is unplayable solo. Community is cancer. If you like building and strategy this game isn't for you. If you like being spawn killed roof sniped or your house sleeping bag and all your other belongings destroyed while youre either dead or offline then this game is for you. Your only chance of surviving the initial couple minutes of spawning is to join up with a group. I really wanted to enjoy this game but it pysically and mentally stresses me out.If you have a group to play with and a high tolerence for cancer this game is perfect for you but for solo players like me it's not worth it,Rust
2013-12-13,0,0,12,True,Recommended,So playing the game for about an hour and a half I've come to write a review.Now the sole reason I purchased this game was to play with friends in the sort that'd we be able to travel together and do whatever we wanted. This is however not the case.Let's start with the positive aspects (I do realize this game is in Alpha this is for the game at its current state 12/13/13)So joined into the server US Central 3 along with 2 other friends. We expected to be able to group up and start to tackle this game together. My wishes did not come true. You are spawned very spaciously across the map. Some might take this at a positive and some a negative. I found this a drawback in the case that at the games current state it has no minimap or compass to show you where you're headed. Unless you've been playing this game for a long time and can figure out all the landscapes and where to tell your friends to go you wont be grouping up for a LONG time. For the 2 hours I played this game we were unable to find eachother for the entire time. I found this a bit dissapointing as most of the time I was traveling and being beaten to death by another newbie with a rock. This is also another reason I found the start to be very annoying. Everyone is out to kill you you're lucky if you find someone who wont kill you and in the end they probably will end up smashing your head in. I have read that you can follow and try to meet up right under the sun or moon but after attempting this for awhile I found it to be no use because we still could not find eachother. I would say my last issue is the server lag. But I still need to hand it to this game. It's in Alpha and a damn good alpha. Being a huge Garry's mod fan I know the features and content coming out in the future will greatly improve this game. I still recommend the game because I know it will be perfection when it's finished.,Rust
2013-12-14,0,0,418,True,Recommended,"""Naked men run around trying to get wood"" if that's not the tagline of a new age ""atlernate lifestyle"" sitcom I don't know what would be. The game is fun initially but you'll quickly lose interest as everything you've worked for is stolen while the assailant dances and laughs over your naked corpse. As the game currently is I cannot reccommend it though that is not to say it will not improve and be worthwhile for anyone interested. I understand many people will love this game and think the brutal unforgiving aspect is fun but when even the ingame chat is filled with rage and hate from it's unforgiving nature I don't see it lasting long in it's current state.I will be checking back periodically to see if improvements have been made and will gladly change my review. I hope this helped anyone reading and if you need to decide for yourself go ahead but be warned....you will rage.*RE REVIEW* Additional 20hrs In Game since Previous Review. I have through much trial and error along with a alot of frustration discovered that this game is alot of fun past the initial experience. It takes time to warm up too and understand that the PvP is what drives the games difficulty and inevitably endears it to the player base. While many features still need to be added and alot of improvements need to be made I can safely say that I've enjoyed my time with rust and shall continue to do so. Give this game a chance love it or hate you've helped shape the future of a gaming genre by adding your feedback and playing along with the fun albeit frustrating and flawed world.

2013-12-14,0,0,495,True,Not Recommended,99% of people who play this game are complete mingebags and so are the developers who abandoned other more successful projects to play around with a different engine and con people out of more money through various pricing schemes. On top of that the game will never be as good as 7 Days to Die and there is tons of completely unnecessary male nudity in a game that children play. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to have in this game yet Garry Newman felt he should express his true homosexuality in this way. This 'game' is a stain on the otherwise mostly positive reputation of Steam. Further this game is never on sale which makes Garry the only uber greedy developer on Steam even more so than the COD franchise.,Rust

2015-06-29,0,0,97,True,Not Recommended,TL DR Good concept crappy gameplay horridly optimized.This game is an amazing idea with a mediocre implementation and a terrible developer team. I have 90 hours in the game and have been playing since the start. I have also been an active community member and tester since then. However Garry (the developer) in his infinite arrogance has decided to stop properly supporting Linux though support is still advertised. The game was totally broken on Linux for weeks until a Unity update fixed Garry's mistakes.For Windows and Mac OS users the game will technically work but it is very poorly optimized. I have a GTX 680 and a 4.5 GHz 4th generation Intel i5 and I can barely get 25 FPS at full settings. Fine whatever. The problem is that I have to set everything to minimum to come anywhere close to 60FPS and even then the framerate is highly unstable.Now about the gameplay. Crafting and loot spawning is illogical (empty cans are more valuable than full ones and more useful full cans don't turn into empty ones when emptied animals all produce wolf meat even chickens pistol bullets cost as much as 5.56 ammo and many other problems). While the game is very much an endless grind occasionally punctuated with excitement those moments of excitement can be quite gratifying.Basically if you run on Linux you cannot rely on being able to play this game Garry might break it at any time. If you run on Windows with anything but a top of the line machine you can barely play this game. In either case this game is not worth $20. Buy ARK Survival Evolved or DayZ instead.,Rust

2015-03-28,0,0,165,True,Not Recommended,If you decide to buy this game there are a few things you should know. I was a huge fan of legacy and spent about 60 70 hours in that version alone. Legacy has been replaced with a new version wich is what I will be reviewing. The new version runs like absolute horsesh*t (even on an overclocked GTX 770 I could barely get 50 fps on fastest). Yes it's an early access title but it's been out for almost two years. TWO F**KING YEARS and the optimization is still this ! I know the performance is mostly to blame on unity but why for the holy mother of would facepunch one of the largest names on steam choose the unity engine of all engines. And to make matters worse right about when they dumped legacy was about the time when the performance was improving! The load times are ridiculously long finding blueprints is a matter of getting lucky and finding a supply oil drum that contains one (ninetynine times out of a hundred it doesn't). **UPDATE 13/10/2015** The system for the blueprints has slightly changed now. You find either blueprint fragments or whole blueprints now wich is better don't get me wrong. Though it's still not perfect it's still a matter of luck. **END OF UPDATE** The supplydrop planes often bug out and become invisible and finding your friends is almost impossible without a modded teleport server since there's not a road (has now been added) and there are very few landmarks to help you navigate. Also the animals are absolutely ridiculous. Deers will often run right through large rocks and stay there preventing you from killing them and the bears and the wolves are faster than you survive a large number of hits have hitboxes and chase you if you as much as f**king sneeze 50 kilometers away. The animals become exponetially worse at night as even with your torch you can only see around 4 5 meters in any direction. *UPDATE* Now the bear is EVEN MORE POWERFULL. ing 8 arrows! 8!?!?And another thing It's almost impossible to actually have a base that can survive. If you're lucky enough to even get a base going unless you're playing on an abandoned server it's doomed. Never get too attached to a base cause it never lasts and even if it does the server probably wipes every week. It just makes the game feel kinda pointless.And I haven't even started on the community good god. 9/10 when you see another player he will open fire or chase you with a rock/axe. Everyone is just in a KOS mode so expect to die A LOT especially when you are naked.Old version of rust 7/10New version of rust 3/10,Rust

2015-12-27,0,0,995,True,Recommended,Ignore anybody complaining about hacking I've played so many hours on this game on both legacy and the new version. The new version is so much better you can't even compare the games and I've only run into maybe a couple hackers throughout my whole history on the new rust. Anybody complaining about hackers probably played on one of the official servers which don't have people monitoring them and they rely on VAC bans or a lot of reports to deal with hackers. If you join a community server like Rustopia which is vanilla you will find active admins who also take the initiative and ban anybody suspicous. This includes everybody with a VAC ban on record.This game is ever evolving with weekly updates and a great dev team which is very responsive. Are you finding you might not have the time to grind out resources to build a giant base which you hope would be able to outlast a raid while you are offline? No worries! There are modded servers! On these modded servers you can get increased gathering rates. Since most servers wipe weekly I find it difficult to outlast all the clans as a solo player. And you really can't on community servers. But that is why you join a modded server. With kits and a couple hours of grinding you could build a castle for yourself.It's not just the gameplay itself which makes this game so great. The player interaction is key. Being able to engage in conversations with random strangers using your microphone or having rock battles and calling them scum Rust allows you to be free. I've read some people complaining about 12 year olds screaming on the mic this isn't an issue. If I ever run into somebody I don't like and I find them annoying I kill them. Guess what? They won't be annoying anymore. Rust can and will be a great experience for anybody whether you enjoying the survival aspect (yes there is one) or the shooting. Rust is for everybody and I would recommend it to everybody. This is a game you want to buy for your friends and you can play together. This game can be a lot of fun if you give it a real chance. Yes you will die yes you will probably die a lot. But after all those deaths you will learn and eventually you can be the one killing. Can you survive this wasteland? Can you make it to the top and build the biggest and the best structures? Will you come out a legend or a mere peasant?,Rust
2014-03-24,0,0,442,True,Recommended,Rust takes you to an island where you must fight to survive. All you have from the start is a rock small enough to carry a few bandages and a torch. You must act quick gathering resources and food while avoiding deadly beasts and other players. Hopefully by the end of the day you manage to scrounge up enough resources to build yourself a measly shelter and door along with a small campfire to cook any food you manage to hack out of the unlucky animals that cross your path. Make a sleeping bag and either stay holed in your shelter until morning or brave the night with your torch. It's a harsh world out there where you can't trust anyone at first glance. Can you survive?,Rust

But then the next session might surprise even me. wonder why?..read onhttp //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 733536008When starting off in single player The freedom and randomness of this game is great in itself but leads to a sense of paranoia and worry about what could happen your new base could be raided within 5 minutes you could be captured by a large clan you could even go and claim an airdrop to find nothing left of your base..http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 852274524Saying this game is harsh isnt even half true its the Players that can decide what kind of experience you have. Life in this is tough and the majority of things causing that is of course other players. The freedom of the game's world allows many different scenarios to play out not all of them peaceful.. The game has c4 rockets and explosive ammo in it. and all but c4 can be used efficiently in pvp. this definetely promotes raiding in the game which is fine because c4 is so expensive in vanilla servers. Its just not fun when the raiding is Targeted at someone unless it is damn justified!Lets start off with the cons first so there will be a happy ending!http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 852277240Cons Not a fan of the whole cannibilism thing but survival game amiright? Runs badly on many pcs that i have seen takes a lot of settings to smooth that all down..Youll need to have a look deep into the settings if you have issues which is a hassle.. Needs many new features and the ones that are confirmed just wont come to the game soon enough! Like a true survival game its still in alpha stage. Foundation raiding is a plebs raid. Basically someone in the current state of rust can go to someones base with a some explosives and only blow up the bottom of the base which menas after a few rockets everyhing wil just fall down in front of them...including loot. (I would prefer it if the foundation(s) of any structure had more ""health"" so that this cheap shortcut could be avoided.) Animal AI is laughable you have bears that stand still walk in circles get stuck in an animation and more. I am sure that fixes are in the making for this seems about time. Heli Aimbot at least make it reload it is human too under all that metal! Maybe add more variation to its movements and even attacks while you are at it.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 813344385Weapons 9/10 From Bow and arrows to using a light machine gun its safe to say that theres quite a bit of variation here. Luckily the best weapon are very hard to get a rocket aluncher alone will take a lot of farming just to collect the raw materials to process into the piping itself. I like the balancing a lot.Optimisation 6/10 If you have a bad to average pc the game will let you know big time. its pretty unforgiving and givees you bad frame rate freezing and sometimes even crashes just loading in. luckily it has 6 graphical presets before you launch. The trick is to launch it on the lowest settings first and then slowly go up the presets each launch untill it becomes worse. then you know how your game will run. I really hope they smooth this down and make the game more ""lenient' of bad pcs with less RAM.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 852277207Updates 9/10 Updates every fortnight by the devs shows that they listen to the community a lot and keep the game running well and add new content where they see fit. the issue i have with it is that its normally a graphical or technical update where not much new content is added. I feel like the content in the game has kind of plateued and isnt going naywhere for a while. But with whats in the game now its not bad at all.Exploration 8/10 so much to see visit shoot raid climb and light on fire.just to list a few you can expect to see these abandoned man made structures on every map. Environemntal Dome Water Facility Warehouses Airfieldhttp //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 854408325All of these will be dilapidated and overgrown becuase its the general theme of the wasteland of rust (Hence its name.)The Whole enviroment is supposed to be grown ovwr taken over by nature and humans need to start from scratch to survive scavenging though detritus to survive nature itself.At least thats what it could be if there were more updates!The many envioronments are honestly concept art worthy (They have lots check it out.) its a very clear display of why the game is called something as short and simple as rust.One little wish of mine is that it had at least a skeleton of a backstory but thats not a big deal to people that rocket each other and eat their charred flesh afterwards.. (Unmatched elegance.) Community focus is very heavy in this game and joining a clan or a ""band of misfits"" will save your life 9 times out of ten. espcially in high pop servers where someone is raiding every 30 seconds..but obviously it also shows but cruel people can be..Raw Betrayal stealing griefing trolling and even slaving have been experienced by me in this game.. The toxicity of the game is not to be underestimated...Its very important to look past this ugly side that 99.5% of survival games have. Because to have multiplayer there has to be many different people and not all of those people are going to be nice. Especially in situations where you meet randomly and you are both armed..although i cant blame the game for this just telling you what you are getting into )http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 853137322Final Thoughts This game has kept me entertained for over 550 hours and counting. which is on and off now due to updates server members (Blacklisted Bastards.) and interest in other games. Ill be honest it isnt as surprisinly enjoyable as it was when i first played it but the reason for that is because ive simply done the majority of everything to do in the game. if nothing i said above has interested you all that much then maybe some of these things will...Ive built bases joined clans tried every weapon taken part in huge raids built Armoured bases had sniper battles explored every unique location (excluding caves since its just a few caverns and thats about it.) made stealth bases underwater Taken down the ""boss"" with friends farmed for hours on end participated in cage matches (with bets included!) Stolen supplies from countless peoples personal airdrops killed a bear with a rock killed a bear with a LMG with explosive rounds Nice contrast there.) But most of all ive had fun with friends while doing it!If you have any questions about this game or feel like i missed mentioning something please leave a comment.EDIT The devs have completely ruined the game for me to the point of a complete unistallation. the newest wipe as of 5/5/17 has ruined raiding and made it 10x harder to survive and thrive as a solo player. It has suddenly become blindingly clear why modded servers get more people than vanilla servers (In total). untill some big changes are made. i wont even gaze in the general direction of this ""Facepunch experiment.""TL DRGame is completely Ruined nowNow if youll excuse me im getting sniped by something who has a better rendering distance than me.

2014-02-21,0,0,1507,False,Recommended,"After logging in 250+ hours in this game I feel that I can give a decent review of this game..First thing you need to understand and it is obvious is that this is an early realease game Alpha stage. There are a lot of ""quirks"" in the mechanics and gameplay but overall it is fairly polished.If you enjoy hardcore in your face paranoia PVP this is the game for you. The PVP is insane which is not always a good thing. The problem as with any open world PVP game is that the KOS (Kill On Site) mentality runs rampid.... Don't bother joining a server with more than 15 people on it unless you expect to get killed while neked and holding a rock.To be successful on larger populated servers you HAVE to join up with other people Lone Wolf does not work. It could I guess with A LOT of patience an slow play but to me it isn't worth it to play that slow. But there is good news for people that want to play solo or in a friendly environment... There are a few player created PVE servers out there (My two favorite are Slipy's World and Lewy K's PVE Land). PVP is turned off on these servers and the higher damage C 4 items are either nerfed or removed.... You just have to look around for a server you like it took me a couple of dozen servers before I found one I liked then I created my own (64.20.17.130 28045).The gameplay itself is pretty simple and after an hour or so you get the basic ideas. Kill animals for food and materials gather wood and stone and start building your fortress. The controls are pretty good context menus are available for most things and the flow is simple to understand.For $20 this is the best money I have spent in a long time on a game and I look forward to what Facepunch has in store for the future.... As a note avoid the Rust subforum on the FP site.... Trolls run amuck and the environment is very hostile to suggestions and change. This is not a reflection of the game or its developers just a bunch of kids with too much time on there hands. ) )Still fun game to play )",Rust
2013-12-24,0,0,11,True,Not Recommended,"Overall if you want this game just wait. The game is virtually unplayable in its early access form. The server browser is almost impossible to use and you can only join ""official"" servers which are the laggiest things in the world. There are community servers but they are not joinable. The moment you get in the game you must figure out everything for your self. It doesn't help that there are already people with gus in the game but that is besides the point. When you join the game you are thrust into a fight for food. It is almost impossible to make a kill and when you do you have to ""cook"" the meat which i'm still not sure how to do. There are radiation zones which are there for absolutely no purpose. There is no reason that a random patch of grass is ""radiated"". Right now the game is filled with hackers which i've heard are trying to be removed. The game is a good idea and will probably be good in the future but right now it is unplayable.

2014-02-16,0,0,81,True,Recommended,A naked man is walking through a forest illuminated only by the pale moonlight. He s trudging towards the flickering warmth of a campfire surrounded by a handful of wooden huts. His demise from malnutrition or hypothermia is only minutes away. Or so he thinks. The owner of the huts isn t exactly charitable. When the naked man begs for food he s ushered into a shed at gunpoint and locked inside. The dying man screams demanding to be let out. The jailor ignores the cries. The dying man continues. Fed up the jailor opens the door and executes his naked hostage. You were shot in the head by a 9mm the game tells me. I respawn in another inhospitable location with no food and no clothes on my back. This is the nature of Rust. Everyone is probably your enemy. All that matters is staying alive just another few hours and you ll probably have to dabble in a little murder to achieve that. And build some forts. Building forts is pretty vital too.,Rust

2015-09-24,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,"Honestly I think this game is all but dead in the water.Rust currently offers nothing extra to this genre despite nearly two years in ""alpha"" and one complete redesign that seems to have simply set it back more than anything. Facepunch is a very small studio and I applaud what they did to help popularize this genre. However with bigger and more fleshed out games like ARK and H1Z1 approaching goalposts that Rust can't even see yet I don't think there's much hope for it.The worlds are very empty and boring. Wildlife is rare and even more rarely is it dangerous. Legacy Rust actually did better than the current build in both respects and even that is still uninteresting compared to newer games in the genre.Worst of all the game is still very poorly optimized. Despite maximum settings being visually underwhelming they will tank most computers. Even on the flat and ugly medium settings you'll need a decent gaming rig to avoid perfomance hits. As it currently stands...If you're looking for a survival game with a heavy crafting/building element you're better off going with ARK. ARK also offers a much more interesting ""Player vs Environment"" experience.If you're looking for a post apocalyptic survival game with a classic town scavenging mechanic and/or zombies (a la Day Z) get H1Z1.Best of wishes to Facepunch but I think Rust is a textbook case of ""too little too late"".",Rust

Though that has happened to me and im sure other people the game can be fun especially with friends but the support sucks so much and the perma ban is so stupid i paid $20 for this game that i can no longer play because they have accused me of cheating its insane. The kids you meet on here all think that everyone is hacking because they get killed well guess what it happens when youve played for a good amount of time on here and have so many hours in and your good at fps games so get over it and respawn and try to kill them back. I hope this helps some people who are thinking of getting this game just be aware you will more than likely be banned if you kill someone from over 100m away with a bolt action or if you shoot someone in the head from like 20m away and the support will do nothing for you so dont waste your time.,Rust
2015-11-28,2,7,2464,True,Not Recommended,Abysmal game balance and a complete waste of money. Entrenched players pick off new players with rifles and AKs. As a new player trying to figure out things prepare to die nonstop for no reason or benefit to the player killing you. All you have is a rock and a torch against entrenched players with rifles and AKs. Game tutorial is almost none existent and spends a great deal time going over how bad the entrenched players and game balance is. Had I read the tutorial before purchasing the game I would not have spent a single cent on this pointless game. The game has potential however given its length in development and only catering to entrenched players. I see this as a niche game catering to people who spend their lives gaming.

2016-02-07,1,7,174,True,Not Recommended,Very punishing group based survival FPS game which relies on basebuilding. The graphics are good and the building mechanics work well. Getting 60 fps may be hard sometimes which does not help with the competitive gunplay. The gunplay takes time to master there aren't a lot of different guns but they are all quite different. This is probably a disadvantage because when you finally after a lot of hard work get a good gun you will quickly lose it because you suck at it. Don't even think about playing alone unless you are on a small freshly blueprint wiped server. Even then prepare to have your kicked and lose everything you own. TL DR When starting out what you can gather and build on your own in 2 hours you can do in 15 minutes with a group. And time is of the essence because every minute someone can pass by and shoot you to pieces while you are gathering or building. You do need to gather a lot of resources obviously this goes a lot faster with more people. With some friends around you will also have a lot more protection. Just because of this i don't recommend this game when you want to play alone. You will lose. Everything. Again. And again. There is no lack of players. Since many people keep playing this game i guess there must be something rewarding in avenging your earlier failures onto innocent usually naked others. Unfortunately unless you have a good group being able to kill people who are not naked takes too long to accomplish. Don't think you can go and make some friends in game. Everyone is extremely hostile and backstabbing. Even so if you bought this game and don't have anyone to play with i recommend you to try to find some other players to team up with anyway. Try the chat try other places like Steam groups forums reddit etc. It will be hard but easier and ultimately more efficient and rewarding than trying to survive on your own.Playing with a group is much more rewarding because you will have an advantage over the many players who try to play alone. With some luck and a lot of blood sweat and tears you will be able to have a great time. However even here the game can be relentless. I was with a group on a freshly wiped server. We played for 2 days created a large 'secure' castle with a 'secure' loot room killed some people got lots of loot. Was fun for while it lasted. Came back on day 3 the loot room was completely robbed empty. It was either cheats or luck that allowed them to find out loot room. happens. But this was the third time in a week that a new base of ours was raided empty. One of our other bases was completely taken over all the armoured doors removed and replaced. No one wanted to continue playing after that.Rust can be fun when you are playing for a short time with a friend or two preying on the weak until a stronger person or group steals everything you have. You will get tired of and even angry at the extremely punishing experience.Recommended for playing with a large group (several experienced people online at any given time) building an extremely secure base (there is no overkill when it comes to security in Rust) and pwning because together you are Alpha and Omega. I'd love to see different factions in this game that will benefit from working together so that even newbies and solo players have a reasonably safe place to settle. Or a karma system that will provide penalties to the strongest and most evil of players. Get negative karma when you kill and loot someone and extra when its your own faction or someone who is not carrying a weapon. Being able to spot evil players from a distance and get extra positive karma when you kill them. Etc. This game really has a lot of potential but needs careful balancing of forces. The upcoming update will revamp the XP and Crafting system which may lead to some more balanced gameplay. /TL DR To enjoy playing Rust for a longer period of time you really need the advantage of larger and better numbers and better gear. Getting the gear is so hard that you also need friends for that. However the community is incredibly hostile and finding friends in the game is really hard. You will need to play a lot and lose a lot before you can grow strong enough to have some proper fun. The best moments are when you kill people while you have a disadvantage when you really feel like you were smarter or more skilled than your opponent. Or when you actually get to defend your base or fight to get in other bases. But these moments are very rare. Overall i can not recommend this game because it relies on group play too much and at the same time does not facilitate group play in any way.Note there are community servers that are smaller and have other restrictions or types of gameplay that could improve your single player experience but since they are unreliable my recommendation is for the base game as it stands in Early Access.,Rust

2017-06-10,2,7,206,True,Not Recommended,"This game has gone from amazing to a trainwreck. VERY Fast. I'm going to give a completely honest review whether you chose to agree or not is up to you. PROS Massive Multiplayer World. Amazing Environments with seemingly no end and plenty of different landmarks to explore. Crafting. This is probably the best crafting system I've ever seen in any game. Collect resources Smelt resources create MASSIVE structures with refined materials. Gun Crafting Making Clothes Setting up Oil Wells. WHERE DOES IT END?! No Hackers. At least nowhere NEAR as many as there were before. This is such a massive improvement that I've decided to include it as an actual feature. Guns. OHHHHHH so many guns. It may not be realistic but this game has dozens of different guns to select from and most of them are really fun to use. The only problem with this is most of the better guns are locked behind extremely difficult materials which are extremely difficult to obtain. and now... the cons. The main reasons as to why I will likely never be returning to this game. Before I begin I'd like to strongly urge ANYONE regardless of opinion to please keep an open mind with the following criticism. CONS Massive World. Yes I know I JUST talked about how this was a good thing and how beautiful the environment looks. HOWEVER There are only so many times you will be walking through a desert or a forest where you get tired of walking through the same old biome and sure a few things will be different everytime but not enough changes to make it less boring. The sheer scale makes it nearly impossible to get anywhere in a decent amount of time. (We can craft oil stations but not makeshift vehicles?) Lag. 'Nuff said really. This is a multiplayer only game and it has issues with lag all the time. Not to mention most servers have resets every week which is nowhere near enough time to enjoy the full scale of the new world that's been created. Appreciate the effort though. Glitches. Also 'nuff said. At the time of this review it's currently in Early Access so I can accept this to a certain extent but some glitches are almost game breaking. Whether it's a teleporting wolf a bullet hitting you from nowhere or getting stuck in a part of the landscape. DO NOT make me reboot your game to fix YOUR issues. Developer Abuse. This has been proven on multiple occasions that the developers of this game promote youtubers who play this game and give them good reviews. As a result these youtubers receive developer tools and subsequently abuse them whether to grief someone's base or spawn infinite guns. This is borderline unacceptable.**Garry Newman himself stated ""If you don't like it don't play it"". Right blame the player for your mistake. But by far my BIGGEST complaint with this game the one that made me quit not too long ago Rust Legacy. Yes this. I'm going to seperate my rant for this below as it will take some time to get this off my chest.For those of you who are unaware Before the ""experimental"" version of rust with the good graphics existed there existed a version of rust that was significantly better. The graphics were worse but it was overall far more balanced.In this version of rust there were only 8 weapons in the game the map was static (not procedurally generated) and the anti cheat wasn't as effective so there were more hackers. And yet this version was better! Wanna know why?In this version of Rust given how much entertainment and value you can get out of it ANYONE on ANY PC can run it. On the new Rust I struggle to run it with a GTX 960 and 8GB of RAM. The map in Rust Legacy was also massive so there was truly nothing wrong with it. Everyone and my friends loved it.Then the developers of Rust F**KING GUTTED IT. As of this review the current version of Rust has removed functionality for Legacy. So now If you liked Rust before and you didn't have a beefy PC? TOO BAD. Now If you would've preferred a map that's familiar and a community more well kept TOO BAD. You get ""New"" Rust which instead has a map too big for it's own good and about 5000x more bugs/glitches than Legacy had.I cannot in all good conscience recommend this game. I loved it. Before Garry gutted Legacy I might've even kept this positive. But instead they chose to remove the one good staple this game had and let the rest of this buggy mess drag on with TERRIBLE updates. If you need more evidence look no further than the dev blogs they publish on the steam forums. They're LITERALLY littered with trash.God have Mercy on anyone who considers this game better than it was before. 1.5/10",Rust

2015-11-20,3,8,106,True,Not Recommended,"I bought this when it was first released for early access.During that time I have committed to the game and can confidently say I am familiar with the experience it currently provides. Keep in mind the experience may change as more patches are released but this is my thoughts and feelings towards the game presently I will update the review if they change. I will not talk about the specific mechanics of the game during this review just a general tackling of the game's holistic experience. This game brings out the worst in people. Fact. You will be thinking ""oOoO that sounds interesting.."" well it is not. You will be on the recieving end like the rest of us. It is a Clan game and not a solo survival game with other people around you. You lose often if you havnt joined a clan of about 10 people this game cannot be mastered by you and your mate laboring hard for 100 hours. Trust me we've tried. ""Losing"" in this case refers to being dirt poor almost all the time because your base only lasts about 4 game evenings (about 8 10 hours of peak time) before it is annaihilated by a clan. Worse still and bringing me back to the first point people tend be intentionaly hurtful to your experience of the game. Raiding and stealing is fine and expected because that it part of the game. BUT to destroy your base and then build a container around you decorated with signs marked with insults so you read them all before having to console 'kill' yourself just to respawn is sadistic. Keep in mind immediately after coping with that you have to start all over again. Starting all over again means giving up those 8 10 hours of for the most part hitting rocks and chopping trees before you are inevitably raided again.Why do people lock up others? or build spikes around where you sleep? or plant sign posts with rude pictures and offensive words on them for you to wake up to alongside the ashes of your former base? SImple because every other player has had this happen to them. So in order to stick at the game like the brave soldiers we are we embrace that way of life and as soon as you can raid another person you feel the urge to take revenge and laugh at the sadness that the victim will feel when then come back online. Even though the person you're raiding often isnt the person who f***** you.Dont buy the game if you value your time and sense of wellbeing. Pick a different one. Care about yourself You and your mate should play a better coop to pass time. But if you do play rust remember it is a CLAN game find a clan quick.Alternatively if you are one such potential bad guy then this game needs you! come join the clusterf*** of genuinely unpleasant people.",Rust
2016-04-26,0,0,177,True,Not Recommended,"Note I have played many more hours of Rust on another account I do have expereince with the game.I am shocked at the practices that this company is getting away with. I played Rust towards the beginning of its popularity and now coming back and seeing that gender and race are random and cannot be changed has made me give this review. The reason that I bought Rust was for the survival elements and I still think it accomplishes as being a social survival game. I bought Rust to help the game devs work on this game to update it faster and add new features. This game is still in Early Access and I don't see it leaving Early Access soon either it is progressing but what ""features"" they have added are not always features. Specifically as I mentioned race and gender being entirely random with no way to even re roll your character. We all put up with having the same stock white male model originally because it was Early Access and new. I don't think anyone expected it to last very long. Now we have the same amount of choice (none) but by giving us these attributes without any say in the matter is a ridiculous practice for a game company. They have implemented a feature without giving the users access to it. I feel like I have been ripped off and I cannot believe that people are still buing this game with the practices that this company has shown over the past 3 years (!) of development.They want to make the claim that like life you are dealt these things with no say in the matter and while that is true video games are an entirely different concept. People play games to escape the world this means playing a character like themselves to connect with the character or playing as a different character and being able to role play as this character. By making this random they are going to effectively make many people upset like myself for no reason since they have the ability to give us a choice even if it was a one time choice that would be acceptable to me and I do not know why there is not a choice. I bought this game expecting that updates would give us these choices down the road since these options are a staple of any game within the genre since I would consider it a role playing game since it is set in a world unlike our own.The reason it is such an issue is they are insisting on the realism of Rust but the main reason it is not realistic at all is that we are forced to view our characters in full everytime we go to our inventory screen. This completely breaks any immersion for me even with a basic inventory screen would not break my immersion since it is so internalized but seeing my character is just awkward and results in this disconnect with the character. It feels that the game devs are attempting some sort of psychological experiment on the users by implementing random forced race and gender and seeing how users react. The way that humans work (besides transgendered individuals) is that people have no reason to be uncomfortable in their own bodies to hardly any degree. Usually we want to improve ourselves but that is direct with ourselves we still want to be ourselves just a better version. By forcing these things they create a disconnect between the gamer and the game. Even if the gamer doesn't want to play a game with a character like themselves they usually have a mental image of the character that they do want to play as. This disconnect results in many being directly affected to different extents but still affected. The devs could fix this in many ways but their stubbornness regarding the race issue (which has been the same for about a year) has made them to do nothing. I have no faith in this company or Garry Newman I am actually shocked that he thinks that the Rust sales grew 74% with female models and forced gender was a combination of both factors. It was probably bought by many who thought they would have a choice or just didn't care since they could view the nude female character models. The dev team seems to be proud of their unwillingness to change and they have alienated many previous buyers of the Early Access by making these choices. I wish i could stop myself from buying this game those years ago since these changes to me are as they state in the developers notes ""changes that you think are wrong"". Just know Rust team I am going to be dissuading all my friends and others on the internet from buying this game in the future and I will never trust Garry Newman or Facepunch ever again. You have lost a customer due to bad business decisions and I insist that you change Rust but I know that this will never happen for I am a single man.Also I wanted to thank everyone who read all the way through this!",Rust

2018-11-14,0,0,437,False,Not Recommended,"Don't waste your time in official servers full of hackers and a very toxic community.On my 6th day playing in official servers I had actually already seen enough to write this review. Strangely Rust is actually quite a good game! Yet yes I have given it a thumbs down due to how easy it is to access multiplayer hacks and most of the rust community and players are not very friendly. The anti cheat system is always being compromised and In the long run this will be Rusts biggest downfall. Another ""mild"" downfall is that you don't get to choose your character/gender which to this day I stiil believe you should be able to choose it. Your character is picked with the number of your STEAM ID. Also don't play Rust if you don't have much time. If you don't play constantly your building will decay and players will steal hours if not days of your supplies ""Very easily"" by a hole in your decaying building or wall. So you have to upkeep your supplies all the time which takes up valuable time. Sadly once raided you literally have to start all over again.To unlock your achievements you must play in an official server but they are all PVP. If Rust had an official PVE server even just one for the slower players (like myself) I would have definately given this game a thumbs up. But by being forced to play in a server which is PVP and with a toxic community that comes with it (You cannot trust ANYONE!) I have given this game a thumbs down without thinking twice. I saw so many crude racist sexist and rude comments in the servers that would have made a construction site worker blush! And yes I do swear so Im not shy of any foul language but I do have morals and limits.On a positive note I will still host a private server with my friends but for anyone else who wishes to purchase this software they do have community PVE servers games but they will not unlock all of your achievements since they are not ""official"".",Rust
2017-09-12,267,151,0,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a psychological horror simulation based on the classic novel Lord of the Flies. You wake up naked on an island full of sadistic prepubescent 13 year olds with endless free time who have been given infinite access to semi automatic weapons ammo and cocaine. Armed with only a rock and (I'm not even joking here) your flacid flopping about your only objective is to provide schadenfreude for the little maggots by letting them murder and humiliate you as you struggle hopelessly to feed and clothe yourself in their custom built torture arena. Somewhere between a form of masochistic BDSM and outright cucking Rust is certain to be a hit with anyone who derives pleasure from being humiliated and degraded while naked.

2016-02-11,0,0,251,True,Not Recommended,"When I first started playing this game I was in love.The game mechanics are great especially for an early access game. There is so much content that I could have spent hundreds of hours playing it easily. It was a survival game that didn't rely on gimmicks and seemed to have a decent community. I don't think I have ever been so wrong in my life.People will constantly raid your home which is fine I guess but even after they raid you they will continue to attack your home for and giggles. This community is sick and toxic. For every person you meet that will try and help you or even just let you live you will meet 50 more that will kill you on sight. People will claim this is realistic but that is crap humanity got to where it is today by working as communities and helping one another and people defend this by saying ""its Rust"" but so ing what. I took this as a game that would allow me to build my house gain materials build up a community and sometimes raid but that is wrong. The people with all the guns will defend the areas which allow you to advance keeping all of the power with the ones who grabbed it early. This game is amazing and I wish it could have been better but the garbage community has taken this game and turned it into a creepy deathmatch. I can tell the developers are looking for ways to fix this with some sort of xp/morality system and I hope they can find a way to do so but probably not. Trolls will always rule this game. I can recommend the core game the mechanics the idea it is wonderful but the game as a whole is unplayable unless you are someone who just enjoys killing random people.",Rust

No matter what you do in this game you will be killed.If you ignor this however this game is great but it will make your life miserable.With the new update this game is definatly not worth playing now people can just build over your walls and put ladders on your building.

The longer the ""seed"" has been going the harder it is to do things such as roam or fight which in turn drives people into their homes instead. Some communities are taking great steps to try and fight said lag by weekly wipes or population control upping the decay factor and it works! It is just a great battle. But it is something that you have to know about before you step into the world thus accomidate for. As with most games.. hackers can become a problem just make sure you get on a server that has active admins and a community that has no tolerace for hackers and you'll be ok. Like This game is sooo addicting! The new things that the dev team introduces the blogs the communication is great! Sometimes it doesn't work and it is back to the drawing board but you know what? They keep testing and trying Rust is an old game but it isn't forgotten by far. Compared to other games I've tried the building is easy and the 'oh don't do thats' of the game are common sense. Ie Don't eat raw meat.. it'll kill ya. Or Don't go into water at night you'll freeze. And so on. Solo players? I've met some along the way but it is the same epic story each time. ""I die. Alot."" Just expect to die. Alot. This is the way of the world were packs and clans rule but each reset that happens.. you'll get better and being a solo player gets a touch less difficult the better at killing people you are. lol",Rust

2017-03-17,4,35,117,True,Not Recommended,P.S. I'm making this review because there's far too many ''joke'' reviews who are recommending this game so I felt like giving actual feedback.It's a pretty awful experience overall with a few good ideas and solid mechanics scattered all over the place. Open world survival games are a dying breed (thank god) and this one does nothing special even setting aside the whole PvE aspect in favour of the PvP which is almost the only reason you would buy this game anyway.First of all the crafting system isn't bad at all nothing new or innovative but it works and it's comprehensive. Base building is relatively straight forward once you understand that you need the blueprint and hammer and the game offers solid options to defend your property from random people. Organized raids on the other hand can only really be defended by actual people inside the property. PvE is a very small portion of the game and is only useful for gathering food and crafting materials. The looting system is quite interesting most ressources are simple to obtain (like wood stone cloth paper) while others will need combining or sometimes special loot caches (fuel is usually stored in red barrels some suits can be found inside crates as well as weapon parts etc).Now to talk about the biggest aspect of this game PvP. It isn't entirely awful but it occupies too much space within the game. The weapons feel weird and sometimes the accuracy of certain guns is ridiculously good at long range. The melee combat system is also hilariously terrible. As a new player you will be attacked constantly by random people with much stronger weapons than you have access to. This makes it especially annoying when trying to find your friends on the map usually making the process alot longer than it needs to be. You should also be given the choice to end your life when you're downed. Most of the time it ends with someone trash talking you because you didnt manage to kill a gunman with a rock. The community is quite unpleasant (it's absolutely terrible but by the genre's standards it's just slightly below average.)Rust has built a pretty large fanbase over the years being one of the first in the early access survival craze. I feel like a big part of that is the fact that FacePunch have been pumping out regular content updates and keeping players updated on the game. For that I have huge respect for the dev. team no matter what I think of their game. Their loyal fanbase has kept the game in the top 10 most played games daily on Steam for a long time and it's apparent to me that it is this loyal fanbase of players who have kept Rust relevant without much mainstream publicity.The graphics in Rust are quite good for an early access title but the game isn't very well optimized especially for DX12. Framerates are rather smooth once you find your optimal settings but failing to do so will result in terrible drops which are very annoying when trying to fight another player. The sound design isn't bad either (the music can be distracting sometimes).Overall this is what we came to expect from early access titles which is very little. The game is too heavily focused on PvP which makes playing solo a worthless experience since groups are rampant and it also makes finding your IRL friends more of a chore than a game. I do not recommend this especially if you intend on playing in a very small group (2 3 people). Don't buy Rust thinking you will get a survival game it's plain PvP with soft looting and crafting with the usual ''first come first served''.,Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,378,True,Recommended,so if you haven't heard of it there's this new open ended building / player vs player verses environment modern game called Rust. You start out in the game with a rock torch two bandages and are unleashed into the world. Sometimes there's a bunch of people with machine guns camping where noobs spawn and slaughter all of you. Sometimes you'll be lucky to only spawn near a bear a wolf and a zombie that will chase down and kill you. And then after you died 4 5 times you might be lucky enough to actually run away from your spawn point at this juncture you would like to seek out a boar or deer to bludgeon to death with the rock you have been given for food (chickenbreasts). You eat the food prior to starving to death and get poisioned and die. Next time make a campfire and cook the breasts. Once you live past spawn again you may finally collect enough wood for the trees wood piles and some stones from randomly placed rocks you may be able to make a hatchet from there you can build up to making houses walls doors metal doors windows with bars in them massive structures tower as high as the mountains. The game is always very tense when others come into your neighborhood. If they have a gun out I would recommend just immediately running the other way although sometimes I've felt like they were friendly and then been gunned down by an m4 machine gun. The game is intense it's brutal and it's heartbreaking but it's pretty f****** awesome. y'all should check it out,Rust

2014-01-22,0,0,33,True,Recommended,And so I booted up the game for the first time and attempted to play. I started to get a wood from a near by tree and I found some stone early in. As I wandered around looking for a place that I thought might have been a nice place for my house I saw a large building made of wood and metal. Going up to the door I could hear footsteps inside and doors opening and closing. Using the voice feature I yelled out to him a greeting. His footsteps froze and he became quiet. When it seemed obvious I was no threat he opened the door and shot me in the face.I now have a large house and routinely harrass him by building wooden barricades in front of his door and yelling at him. I don't think he knows why I hold a grudge on him but it still makes me feel better. I love this game.,Rust
2014-01-23,0,0,218,True,Recommended,This is a great addicting fun game. However there are a large amount of hackers that are running rampant without the developer's taking much action it really spoils the game when you place hours into the game and an individual flies through the air c4's your house and aimbot shoots you in the face. I'll update my review of the game when the hacker situation is taken care of which will hopefully be soon. All future work on this game is meaningless unless the developers can control their server environmentUpdate 2015 (Almost two years later) I put maybe another 80 hours into the game about 8 months ago and a lot has changed since my initial review. The game has a new engine and has been revamped from the ground up. Rust probably has the most impressive realistic building system on the market now and is pretty decent in terms of being a shooter. They are including new items systems and features into the game on a monthly basis.With cheaters being under control now the game is really blossoming. The developers wipe server progress every month now so all your in game possessions and buildings will be wiped clean but you will retain the blue prints you've learned that allow you to build unique items. Rust will get better and better into the future the gameplay is unique with building survival and FPS elements being rolled into one game perfectly. I think this game will take off once it launches and will soon be ported over to consoles. It's a shame though that Facepunch is moving so slowly in developing it. I've owned this game several years now and have seen it grow tremendously but it's still a long way from being finished.,Rust

For example the pvp update now the game plays like cod and they also ed the building system.

2014-06-07,0,0,254,True,Recommended,"LEGACY REVIEWWhen I first saw this game I thought it would be really similar to DayZ. BUT ITS NOT! ITS BETTER THAN DAYZ. This game spawns less guns and things are more scarce. Rust also has a great crafting tools. When I found out I could craft 9mm ammo I was so happy.....Thats when my bandit life started. Speaking of bandits there are three types of people in this game Bandits Survivalists and friendlies. Friendlies are really rare in this game which is fun. Bandits like me are total d*cks they well C4 your house for the smallest thing inside of it then kill you THEN BOARD YOU INSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE WITH NO WAY OUT!!!!.(thats very funny to do to other ppl) You can also team up with a bunch of friends to make a group and make base out of metal and then get it raided by bandits!!!!!!! The main areas where you can get guns ammo med kits and rad pills are Big Rad Small Rad and Factory and Hangar. and Civ towns.Great Pros of the game+ Dynamic br&gt +Big Metal Rods+Hard Wood+Don't have to listen to my girlfriends problemsCons of the game Lag Minor to Severe Frame Rate DROPOverall grade 24/10 would definetly this game.POST LEGACY REVIEW So I was pretty sad that the legacy version was discontinued as most of the players were sad aswell. Played it until it was RIP in peperonni. But onto the the actual post legacy review. The game has completely changed many new features were implemented New guns clothes caves new building system and more. But however I feel like this version isn't as good as legacy ever was. In my opinion Rads are a huge issue for anyone with not a large amount of water and rad pills or a suit. Rads in legacy felt balanced. In this version u step anywhere within rad range you gain rads so quickly . I once tried out to see how fast i could last near a rad town with just the max amount of rad protection I had. Note I did not have a rad suit. I was dead within 30 seconds. If i didnt have the protection I had most likely I would have been dead within 10 25 seconds. I also feel like they could put more promising loot in barrels. Instead of just blades pipes and rope. Like every time I get more rope from a barell I feel like saying ""Yay even more rope to noose myself with""Overall upgraded grade 7/10 would take a moment to make sure id this game",Rust

2014-02-20,0,0,1720,True,Recommended,I've spent an fair amount of time in the game thus far. I've actually enjoyed it. At first it was kinda chaotic trying to find a decent server that didn't brutally destroy me right out of the gate. But there's enough quiet servers that you can join and learn your way around on. Once you know how to survive the game can get interesting. Of course interesting can be violent if you are a diehard PVP gamer or interesting can be cooperative &amp productive if you like working with other players. Altogether the game is summed up by one word survival. Its up to you how you want to go about it accomplishing that.Early on you should aim to get a hunting bow &amp a hatchet together grab some food craft a sleeping bag and build a shelter somewhere safe. From there you can learn your way around look for buildings supply crates resourceful areas basically take your chances finding better equipment &amp getting stocked up. Sometimes other survivors raid your shelters. You may have to decide wether to be more portable or to try to heavily reinforce your shelter and hold your ground. But its all truly up to you. There's a big growing evolving world to enjoy. You can spend a lot of time finding that perfect place to survive.The game itself is still early in development. Its known to have bugs occaisionally crash sometimes even glitch in some places and kick you from the game (you can rejoin though). But its clear that the developers have a grand vision and the ambition to continue to improve &amp evolve their product towards that vision. With their native support for Linux this game has real potential to become one of the ushers of a new era of Linux based gaming. I'm actually looking forward to seeing first hand the evolution of Rust because it could potentially redefine what a survial game really is. In this age of Battlefield's Moba's Zombies and RPG's this could be the flagship game for the outdoor survival genre.,Rust

2016-08-17,0,0,1026,True,Not Recommended,I have played this game for a while now on the toronto developement server and feel like this game is heading is the wrong direction. This game was extremely good because it had a very good pvp aspect along with good raiding mechanics. Now they added an xp system that encouages big zerg clans to just farm all day. The xp system makes it hard to get off the ground because it takes forever to get any weapons to defend yourself and you just get door camped all day by the zerg clans. A big reason everybody liked rust was because you can play anyway you wanted. Whether you like to farm build screwaround or pvp. Now you have to farm to get levels in order to get any guns to defend yourself. The recent crossbow nerf made me the most mad. It now takes 3 headshots to kill a geared guy up close and 4 from a distance. This literally makes it impossible to kill them this makes absolutely no sense. So you cant get any guns to defend your self and all the primitive weapons now suck.This game is just encourageing zerg clans and turning off all old legacy players and all solo players. I honestly thinks this game might go under if you dont make it more appealing to the bandits who like to go around and kill people for their gear. Also the helicopter is pretty much only a clan thing since you need to exploit if you want to take it with less than 5 people. However i understand this is still in alpha and i will continue to play it my opinion may change. Also the ing hackers ruin this game they need to be ip banned or something.,Rust

Playing with someone is much easier than solo but watch who you trust as that can often end up with a raided base and all you got is your tears as they despawned even your burnt human meat. Roof camping is advised for maximum success at PVP.(Up untill the recent patch RIP roof campers.)Range of servers means you can adapt the game to yourself for example a solo only server or a 5x resources server for people with less time on their hands.

2014-02-04,0,0,106,True,Recommended,In this game you play as a geologist who lost his clothes. Coincedentally there are many geologists around you who also seem to have lost their clothes. You must use your knowledge of rocks to take control of the surrounding area in an effort to find your clothes whilst at the same time protecting and maintaining your rock collection. You may team up with other geologists to find the best rocks or fight off others in an effort to keep the number one rock collection. In the hours I have played this game I have become one of the greatest geologists this world has ever seen and I do say that my rock collection is quite impressive. You will come across many a geologist who will be jealous at the sight of your mighty rock collection and in turn you must destroy them so they do not interfere with your studying of the minerals in the game. Eventually it will turn into all out war and you will be forced to do the unthinkable in order to protect that which you have strived for so long. 10/10 an Emotional Roller coaster the whole way.,Rust

This game is a ton of fun with a very impressive Alpha that is currently active and available to the public to play. It promises allot more and with doubt it will happen. Seeing that its from the same Great Creator of Garry's Mod. It has very distinct qualities that puts it apart from any other game you compare it to. It has Crafting It is Online It has Building and it has Nude bambi's running around armed with a rock heading towards your shack of loot or your head. Its a game where you need a group to survive be too friendly and you die. Be to mean and people make you a target... well lets say ""More"" of a target. Try to have a fair balance between Saint and Bandit but most importantly Have a good group. Communication is vital. Use Team Speak to talk to your team and only use in Game chat when you need to talk to someone you don't know. Otherwise everyone is in on your little secret and might just want to come give their Lead opinion. Sound is one of this game's best and most prominent features. You can hear the environment around you. You can hear people moving and sneaking and also gun fire explosions and so on. Use the basics to get by get a group and use your head.

Gets you and your friends to bond moreCons Game is only fun with friends (Unless you're a solo player) A lot of admin abuse in servers (Look for non admin abusive servers) Game gets repetive if you die a lot and finding stuff can be a pain in the *** sometimes. No official map but if you're expierenced like me you could memorize the map so easy. Game gets laggy when you shoot if you have a mac computer like me (Don't let that bring you down if you set your options to the lowest you won't lag a bit)OVERALL! The game is amazing! The game wasn't meant for mac but guess what? I pwned in it. 104.2 hours of playing this is fun. I dream about this game every night (No I'm not a no life I play basketball have a girl friend and my social life is amazing). I have a guy in my friends list that uses a Mac Computer and only used his track pad for shooting and right clicking and stuff talk about a bad right?

2014-01-31,0,0,50,True,Recommended,"I've played this game for a while now and I have to say it never fails to surprise me in the wonderous of ways. New content is always on the horizon with this game but even as it stands it is more than functional and entertaining for many more hours than most $60 games that are fully developed. The community is really the backbone of this game and I know what you're thinking ""I've seen online gamers in games where survival is a concern and weapons provided. They always start killing each other and turning insane."" To that I say ""Yes! Yes of course! That's why it's so awesome!"" When taking a stroll through the woods you never know if you'll meet a friendly beggar or a mentally derranged cannibalistic cave person. The variety and randomness of encounters and the various different ways that players can populate and dominate the enviroment makes the game fluent at develop it's own role playing type stories for the player. No imagining required no immersion breaking views or actions. You'll have so many stories within just a day of play whether you want them or not.To give an example of the possible hilarity and awesomeness of this aspect here's one of my more recent stories Spawning out in a section of woods unfamiliar to me I was looking for a place of refuge. I found a building inhabited by about five loud half naked men. The guys seemed to know each other and they were all using their microphones to discuss the progress of their survival. ""I'm gonna build a hachet to kill some punks who walk up the road!"" one exclaimed. I wasn't spotted and after that comment I hid near their base. I decided to have some fun so I tried to get their attention by making babbling sounds over my microphone. They didn't seem to hear me. ""Yea well I got some metal fragments guys! Oh yeah!"" They all seemed incredibly impressed by the metal. Suddenly from accross the road a man strolls directly into their base (which only features the one entrance/exit) armed with armor and a shotgun. He immediately begins blasting away at the unarmed group sending half naked men scattering further into their base turned trap. I heard the panicked screams of each man as the shotgun rung out. Eventually it came down to one. He apparently hid himself in a corner of the base and began hysterically screaming ""No! NO! The metal fragments! No! Don't kill me! The metal! The metal fragments! No please!"" Bang. Silence. Imaging this man cowering in the corner of his base after watching every one of his friends systematically massacred is simply incredible. Bawling and screaming for his life and the preservation of the his metal fragments I about lost it with my laughing. I was an audience to the beauty of this game's random player interaction.Not everything ends so murderously but everything always ends satisfying. If you want a game that lasts do yourself a favor.

Suddenly my friend had found someone in the hangar with his shed. He started beating on the door and the guy asked for help in the chat. (Now here's the best part of the story that I wrote being stoned.) I finally arrived on the scene in the chat in writing that this guy had killed my brother and justice was to be made . Some people have asked me how it had happened and I told them that we had just arrived and were looking for a place to live when suddenly a guy attacked us (the guy living in the Hangar) and killed my brother because I could not defend myself. And the best time of the story is that three people arrived in the hangar with a Full Kevlar and guns. They talked with the guy because justice must be rendered. The guy said he had never killed anyone (and he was right) but he decided to leave the shed and attack one of the people came to help me. Finally three guys went in pursuit of the guy to finally kill him. It was a solid RP that I made from scratch to kill someone at random.

2013-12-24,0,0,707,True,Recommended,This is a review to anyone considering purchasing rust. I will not say that yes you should buy it or no you shouldn't buy it. I will however explain the aspects of gameplay that will help you make your decision.Rust is an amazingly made game and it has a wonderful concept behind it. You start off with nothing but a torch a rock and some bandages in case you run into trouble. From there you go around hitting trees and rocks with your rock to gather resources which you will use to build yourself a house. This is all fun. This is the part of the game that really makes the game enjoyable. It's a survival game but very very polished and nicely made. I give the developers 100% of the credit to making this game good.The problem is running into other people. Now I'm going to use DayZ as a comparing example. In DayZ it is true that most people in the game are bandits and will simply kill you without uttering a single word to you. The same is true in Rust. The prime difference however. is the size and capacity of the servers. In the DayZ mod which I used to play frequently you would have 50 people playing on it. The maps were also massive no matter which you played. You could play as a hermit and hardly have to interact with people as long as you stayed out of Cherno or Elektro. The problem with Rust is that the servers go up to around 200 or 250 people. That's 4 or 5 times as much as DayZ and the map is quite a bit smaller. Everywhere you go you will encounter people and you will die. I wouldn't say that the community is horrible no worse than DayZ that is. I just think that you encounter people much more and therefor die much more which is still a problem.In conclusion do I regret buying Rust? No. Do I hate it? No. But do I think I might wait a little bit longer to play it? Yeah. I think Facepunch is doing a wonderful job with the game and give them kudos where it is deserved. I would just suggest smaller servers or MUCH larger maps allowing for people to spread out more.,Rust

2015-10-27,11,10,16,False,Not Recommended,So why this game is anti fun and a complete waste of your money and time? I have around 70 games in my library and rust is by far the most frustrating one I have. Now I'm not talking about bugs like when you have items in your inventory which stuck there forever or game crashing while trying to connect to certain servers. I'm talking about game mechanics itself the fact that being afk your character can be (and WILL be) robbed sodomized and killed is NOT entertaining. After spending hours or days gathering resources and making a bunch of crap you will have to disconect from the server and that's where the most interesting part kicks in. Every player on the server can do whatever he wants and usually that means stealing all your loot destroying or hijacking your structures and killing your character (the last one is merely important but losing all your means you spent all this time for nothing have fun doing it all again lol). Unlike some other multiplayer games where it mostly your skill which matters in Rust you will be bullied around by some douches who's played for a longer time than you have. You will be shot on sight you will be robbed again and again even though they don't need your petty resources it's made for fun. And eventually the same scumbugs will be ing about how there are very few people left online. If someone wants to tell me I'm noob and should l2p go f*ck yourself I've played a lot of games and this one is the gayest. Imagine playing Diablo and having your character standing around on a monster location after you saved. And having all this loot on him disappeared. Would you buy this game? It's not something they tell you in the trailer huh? But back to Rust I built a house with stone walls floors roof metal door with a lock. Well guess what there is always someone who's spent more time in game and has some OP When you have a rock they have guns when you have guns they have freaking bazookas or simply wait untill you afk. If you build a house with hardened walls and doors they will bring some C4 and will blow your hut up then grab everything they want your sleeping character in the and kill him.

You have an option to enable and disable almost everything.How could you not enjoy naked people chasing pigs with rocks?Even better by the fact it's made from Garry Newman one of the only reasons I bought this game in the first place.

So it's not player's fault if dev's are not taking seriously their job developping their game.I really don't think this will EVER get out of his Alpha status it's too easy to get people paying for it without having the responsability to fix things.And for thouse wondering i'm not hating or bitc*in' i'm just expressing a huge frustration i feel over this game that had promessed so much and showed so little . i hope steam in the near future will limit a game alpha's status way too much people take advantage of people investing in an early access.Of course i could stop playing but i do comeback from time to time to see if it gets better stopping to play wouldn't be of any help. writing an opinion about something i bought is in my opinion.I'm sure i can expect a lot of trolls attacking me for talking bad about ""their""game.Again RUST Dev's finish one thing at once then go ahead with another project.also adding a sense or some sort of background story and limit that silly fact of people just making holes in your home and killing you would be nice it's just useless to play now.I trully wonder what kind of player rates positively this game or what is their mental age.",Rust

2015-06-26,0,0,2725,True,Recommended,Realistically this game is not for everyone. If you like RP games this is not for you. If you like mindlessly murering people and destroying their bases pillaging their hard earned loot and trash talking them as you grief their base this game is for you. Pro's 1. very active devs and regular updates ( every thursday unless otherwise posted )2. Unique gameplay and concept3. polished raiding and PvP not slow and buggy like Ark or other more PvE games4. Friendly user interface that's easy to understand5. Allows for varying playstyles depending on what you prefer.Con's 1. rather toxic community of you are unfamiliar to rust. You will be called lots of not nice things2. Solo this game isn't that great. You get steamrolled alot it's just the way the game has turned out. you really should cosider haveing 3 or more friends if your going to succeed for the wipe.3. PvE elements are not really a threat other than the heli ( which is great ) although they are currently working on new PvE events and threats. 4. Obviously game is still in alpha and performance can vary at times with lag spikes. They have vastly improved over the last few updates but still need to be ironed out. I thoroughly enjoy this game and it truly is one of the best games i've ever played. I would say if you have friends who play this game or really want a tough solo challenge definately give it a shot.,Rust

Watching it grow from a being a very basic zombie survial to becoming it's own massive wasteland survival game has been an increadible thing to watch. I was very glad when I started playing this game to experience such a masterpiece being unfolded.

2014-02-18,0,0,117,True,Recommended,Find a good server make some pals and all is good. Found a sweet spot for our base in the boons. Thought no one would find it. After being there for a few hours gathering and crafting we had a random guy walk into our house (didn't close the door like noobs) and informed us we should close our door P He then left. So far in this game I've encountered a lot more players than similar sandbox games and only 1 guy shot on sight because he thought I was someone else. Not bad ratio at all.The UI is clunky not terrible but not great either. It's workable once you know where the wrinkles are and how to avoid them. Not nearly as bad as dayz mod inventory. Overall a fun game could use a larger map with more players and more towns. Also the resources seem to spawn in the same valleys but leave many other valleys empty. Would be nice if the resources were a little more spread out and random in all areas. Not bad for an alpha and pretty addicting. No doubt you can get at least 20 bucks worth of gaming out of it.100 Hours in The game became stale and the server to player ratio was ridiculous. Seems like if someone failed on a server they'd give up and create their own. So no there's 1 sever for every 2 people playing. Also found that you have to dedicated your life to this game if you want to keep your home and belongings. It's not a game you can easily jump in and out of. Still a fun game but after some time you feel like any progress you make is no doubt going to be demolished and you'll be starting from scratch again next week.,Rust
2014-01-25,0,0,967,True,Recommended,Rust is a very enjoyable game its quite an addictive game because you always want more guns ammo bigger base. This game has got some aspects of dayz in that there are zombies and survivers it also has alot in common with minecraft in that you have to craft everything and make bases. I would highly reccomend this game as I cannot get enough of it.,Rust
2014-02-07,0,0,202,True,Recommended,"Rust is one of the most addicting games I've played in years.Rust brings a lot to the table. It's almost too much. Rust has far far exceeded the expectations of the developers and I'm struggling to figure out why. They should have expected this game to become huge. Here are the reasons 1. It brings that whole ""crafting"" and ""building"" addiction from minecraft into a legitimate engine.2. It brings the abject horror of surviving in a harsh cold deadly environment filled with people you can't trust from ""Day Z"" (They even borrowed the zombies.)3. It brings big time first person shooter aspects into becoming the king of your server. (I believe they borrowed the spray pattern from CS GO?)It has EVERYTHING that any casual or hardcore junkie could ever want. Unfortunately this also includes the bad things that come with everything just listed above.1. Who doesn't know about griefing by now? If I had a dollar for every time some troll blocked me out of my base...2. It brings the idea that a group of friends. (5 10) can pretty much own any given server if they're well coordinated so playing alone gives a huge disadvantage.3. There's hackers. All in all you have to keep in mind Rust is still in ALPHA. This game is absurdly good. I'm just sad they didn't believe people would agree with me.",Rust

2014-02-20,1,3,124,True,Recommended,For an alpha release this game is great. It has big potential. You can build a base craft items hunt and allot more. You can friend other people in the server and form alliances or go solo and most likely die. 10/10,Rust
2014-01-15,0,0,202,True,Recommended,A lot of people have issues with the game but honestly it's not that bad. Just picking the right server can honestly make all the difference. The bigger servers are plagued with hackers and people who will kill you on sight. Even if you do get established you're liable to be raided. Playing with friends can alleviate that problem and make for some epic raids and gun fights. I personally enjoy playing on smaller servers and building with friends. I actually run a server because I enjoy playing it so much and hated to see other admins abusing their power and servers that did nothing about hackers.If you get the game find a low pop/instant craft server and you'll have a ton of fun. Once you get started and growing it becomes quite addictive. I'm actually working on a guide w/ videos to help people get started and learn the map. More maps are coming new items areas a chopper all sorts of things. I'm really excited for this game and will stick with it until it's release. Also make sure to check the wiki and other sites for help on crafting and other things. You are dropped in with no knowledge of what to do or how to play so it'd be good to watch a video or two to get acclimated.,Rust
2014-02-24,0,0,701,True,Recommended,UPDATED REVIEW RUST I felt since Rust finally updated i would update my review. I am not changing my recommendation to this game because i still very much enjoy the game. So let me start off by saying the old version of rust was definitely a fun piece of art to play.. but between the hackers and admins who abuse their power i found that i needed a break. I have returned to rust to not only find that they experimental version is now officially in rust and the old servers are now known as Legacy. So lets jump into the review! The new rust game has updated graphics and more options of gameplay. It now has bone shivs you can make along with hammers. The loot system is well more generous and instead of searching for wood piles constantly you can hack away at trees and get your resources... Oh and the trees disappear!! So im still trying to figure out the building system. I sort of liked the building system a bit more in the old version of rust because it was pretty basic. The newer version is a lot harder to find animals which means you actually have to go hunting and searching. The animals are more hostile and dangerous. Now... as for the gameplay in general i come across some lags and it appears the frame rate drops at times. I can understand due to early access although i didn't have this problem as much in the old version. Also the trees pixelate a lot and it seems the graphics are somewhat unstable in certain areas. The map is gorgeous and huge though. It has to be 100x the size of the original map and on top of the size it has snow covered mountains valleys deserts lakes oceans all of which you can swim and hike on. It even has health conditions such as being cold or being wet will affect your stats in some way. They really made it more survival and with more creativity from what they show in the actual screen shots of Rust on here. I would say the finished copy will definitely be worth the wait.So to recap everything i said this is a great game that needs work. Still would pick it up again. I just hope the developers pick up the slack and start moving a bit faster. This game is a gem and they should treat it like it's their baby instead of neglecting it. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________This game not only is a complete survival game it has the basis to keep what you make in the game and let you create an own town. If you craft weapons you can create a alliance and wipe out players and take their supplies. Highly recommended to play with a mic due to the team work needed to complete the game. It starts you out with basically nothing... No map no weapons no clothes. The only thing you can rely on is yourself. Trust no one. As you make your way through the game and get used to crafting makeing weapons and hunting you'll eventually get good at pvp. It is literally the greatest survival game ever made. Enjoy it. Buy it. It's only in alpha trials so the servers bug out a little. Other than that the game is exactly what anyone would want in a survival game.,Rust
2014-02-21,0,0,76,True,Recommended,Having read previous reviews of the game i found myself extremely paranoid of this vast island. I found a pig and repeatedly bashed its head in with a rock until i got myself some chicken breast from it. Night was falling fast and a naked man with a rock was getting dangerously close to me. I ran as fast as i could and hid on top of a mountain. There i made a small shack and a fire to keep warm from the cold night. Fearing i would be spotted I packed up my things and started adventuring at dawn. Falling down the mountain i found another player sleeping. I bashed his head in with a rock and found the best things in the game. Guns ammo medkits armor food etc. The player had no idea who had killed him and so i was off the hook. I followed a road or should i say the ONLY road and arrived at a hotel. There i made friends with a small group of people and soon enough i was known as the most powerful player on the server. Nobody dared attack me and they all worshipped me as a god. This was only about 25 minutes into the game at that point. I still had no home to call my own. I started to build a couple walls and a roof but i still needed a door. I needed more supplies to build the locking metal door and so i went to look for supplies. A shirtless man appeared holding a rock asking for any donations from me. I offered him some of my food and told him i would gladly make him some clothes and if he were to help me with my house he could have himself a room. As soon as i finished typing this a man shot me in the back of the head with a shotgun and i lost everything i had. I was then insulted repeatedly and everyone realised that i was in fact not a god and that i was just some inexperienced new guy... A friendly man approached me and gave me some of his wood and cooked chicken. We then broke into a house and stayed there all night long. When i awoke i was killed by the friendly man and his trusty rock. Amazing game that brings a lot of laughs and taught me that if i kill a bear deer pig and probably any other animal i will indeed get raw chicken breast.And also never trust anybody.Especially the naked men armed with rocks. Overall 20/10,Rust

2015-11-12,0,0,339,True,Recommended,Undoubtably my greatest game expeience of all time and I hada few belive me...You and your friends spend hours trying to estabilish a safespot to have a place where you can store your materials research new item blueprints to gain protection against other players.While you are trying to develop your base other teams of players will do the same. If they are more eager to gather materials to farm blueprints or build extra defence lines.If they will feel ready they ll all gear up and attack your base... They will probably destroy your walls steel your materials even if you are online and there at the window with your ak shooting bullets at them they might get in or just sneak through the defence line if you were careless enough to leave your base's back badly protected.You will then hope they didnt get permission to your building and you can repair your base easily or you will have to get your pickaxe and hatchet and start farming again.Why this game is incredibly good is the basic concept. You let around 200 people to a island where they are not bound by any restriction they can attack their teammates group up with random peoples or decide to craft a guitar while their mates are farming and annoy the neighbours. Rust will keep you in a constant tension in the good way. Even if you are in the middle of a forest and trying to cut down some trees near your fort you ll encounter people who might be new without firearms or a fully armoured wonderer with a rocket luncher in can be a raider horde trying to take down a crazy huge base or just a lonewolf sapareted for the time being from his buddies and adventuering the people who you meet can be extremely friendly speaking for minutes agreeing to team up or form an allience or just be some aggresive barbarians shooting without warning. They can be English people from the UK having no trouble in understanding you or some buddies from Russia Germany Spain who rather prefer to talk in their own language.How you play is up to you. Your shooting skills base building talents charisma are not measured in a menu inside the game their reflection can only be seen on how well you get along in the game.This is the game of the endless possibilities and even if it is crashing sometimes or you have lagg or suffer of the developers' newly implemented and not yet ready idea in the game you will want to get back to the island of Rust again cause no other game can give you the same experience.,Rust

2016-12-09,0,0,5815,True,Recommended,I see a lot of people complaining about how Rust is hard for newcomers but there are very many simple solutions to their problems. Such as dying and losing their things. You can stash things in boxes in a bush or even a stash which is made for this exact situation. YouTube videos could help a ton for new players. Also many people complain how the community is bad and yes the community can be pretty bad however there are some pretty awesome things that go on for newbies like servers devoted to new players where the people are very welcoming for the most part. I personally play solo and have learned how to be successful mostly from YouTube. I play on rustafied which is one of the largest servers out there. So if you've seen a comment about how Rust is almost impossible to play its not. Practice is the key to surviving.,Rust

It might be too early to write a review for it since it is currently in Alpha and is Early Access but so far it's proven to be really great. I recommend to play with a group of AT LEAST 1 or 2 more people other than yourself it'll make scavenging and building so much easier.

2014-01-31,0,0,1311,True,Recommended,Rust is often and probably somewhat accurately described as the love child of Minecraft (gathering resources crafting building bases) and DayZ (looting towns trying to not get killed before you even see your enemy).Surviving and thriving in this game is hard the environment and especially the people playing it tend to be harsh and you will die a lot at first but once you found some helpful people to team up with (or even better convinced your friends to run around naked on this apocalyptic island together) you'll have a blast. Between hilarious encounters and sheer panic you'll live through many memorable experiences. So far the game is about 10% complete according to the developers but it's already very playable and a lot of fun. Patches with new content are coming out about every week and the community is having a visible influence on design decisions made in them.Bonus points for fantastic music by the Swedish Dark Ambient legends Atrium Carceri!,Rust

2014-04-14,1,3,297,True,Recommended,If i have to describe Rust to a person who don't seen it so far i would say it's something like minecraft but it's texture way better than minecraft and it's played on one map which is like australia everything can and will try to kill you. And of course next to the natural habitat lives you and hundred more like you who even gonna try to bash your head just for your rock. This thens feeling makes this game unbelievably fun to play. Ohh did i mentioned that if you log off in game you just fell aslepp so others can kill you while you are away this makes the game highly addictive.Well keep in mind the game is still in alpha so a lot is about to change but seeing the devblog every Friday makes me belive this game is gona be 10 or 100 times more fun by the time passing it worth every penny you spend on it.,Rust

2015-07-25,1,3,382,True,Recommended,A game that really has a potential and you get really in to it once you have survived your first night it's almost impossible to stop playing. Making friends through the game isn't really the best thing ever you will most likely get killed and spawn back on the beach again!I recommend the game if you have a friend to play with because the world feels really dead you don't see players that often just roaming around and at night it can get a bit scary.Rading ofcourse! One of the best things is ofcourse raiding when you accomplish to raid someone you feel like the king of the world raiding is a big ego boost!As you may have already known the game has a lot of bugs and glitches though that is expected when it is a Early Acces game.The game feels like it has alot of potential to it and in my opinion it is worth the 19 99 You will not be disapointed!,Rust
2014-01-17,0,0,886,True,Recommended,Rust is the best survival game i've played and the building is very interesting. With various building parts and different decorations you can build a really cool base. The graphics are good but I would like to see the game better optimised.Unfortunately I think legacy Rust was alot better then the new one. I have no idea why I just do.The pvp was simple and much more fun. Also I really miss the zombies and rad animals.But Rust is for sure worth buying ),Rust

2014-05-10,1,3,128,True,Recommended,I find this game to be rather great aside from all the lag I get. but that has nothing to do with the game just my bad graphics card... I totally recommend this game if you don't like minecraft or blocky mining games. The graphics are decent definitely not bad. The world is very smooth and the funny thing is that the game isn't even finished and it's already as if it is. In summary this game is going to be great not that it isn't great already either.

2014-08-16,1,3,698,True,Recommended,"Update 11/9/2014 It's been a while since I've updated this and with Experimental/New version doing a lot better I will write about that. Some of the people who don't recommend Rust have been using the Experimental's older versions to say why it's so bad like doors not being able to be placed in doorways. You can still play the legacy/version I've reviewed too. The Experimental is now considered the normal version but it's still not as close to baseline and they've been running into Unity 5 issues. Btw to those of you who say that DayZ cares more about its players DayZ is constantly updated but never optimized or do they fix bugs. Update 9/28/2014 I know have 400 hours only a month later as I've started playing a lot again. Anyways some crazy stuff has happened lately. First I had started a shop across the street from Tanks. My guard was a part of a group called Tuna and we went out to get an airdrop. We were grabbing it when I heard a gunshot and I was at 1 health. I jumped under cover used a medkit and shot the dude up. I reloaded and I had one more shot to kill him when we realized who he was...the leader of Tuna. My friend didn't realize that so he shot him. And let's just say Husky leader of Tuna was already trying server domination. I realized that we were in deep crap when Husky started raging at us when I tried to calm him down Frozen my friend and now former member of Tuna was blowing holes in the Tuna base part where he didn't have the door code. We all came to him and some dudes wanted to join in and we started a full raid when Husky turned on /remove and shot almost every wall of that 40x40x25 base exposing us. A bit later we had escaped with more crap than I've ever got out of a raid. Then fast forward to today and my friend Quart and I are settling down after making so many enemies on the server with Husky. He tells me ""I hear someone outside!"" and I run out there (It was dusk) with an M4 and ask who it is when I narrowly dodged a pipe shotgun shot to the head (Automatic death basically) and I pumped him full of 15 bullets. He rage quit afterwards ). On the server owner's second server I was playing with Quart again and Dyzin (the owner) and Dragon were in a battle with some people. We tp'd and I eventually found a decayed door and placed another one in its place. The people had no idea where I was at and I heard them at the side of the house. I snuck out and from right behind I pumped them full of .556 and hid in it again. This happened 4 times when I sniped them and they eventually all rage quit.Rust. A game that so far I have 306 hours on. I've been playing it since it first came out and let me tell you that I don't put 300 hours into bad games. Just don't play on an Official server...Before I tell you about my favorite experiences I'll tell you about my first. Anyways I spawned in and as I had watched a video I hit a tree a bunch of times. Then I realized that wood piles give you more wood and beat one of those down. I later hit some rocks and created a stone hatchet. I started exploring and that is when I saw a person. I ran down to them and there were 3 other people with him. They started yelling at me with a mic to get out but as I was leaving this dude started attacking us all. I killed the guy and then they suddenly started blaming me for killing a group member. Next thing I knew 3 guys were on me with rocks and the other shooting at me. Now this is probably my favorite. About 150 hours or so into Rust when I had started my group which has now been failing my second in command and I were trying to find a server to move to as our clan was left serverless. We built a little two foundation and I went down to eat a sub. Coming back up I heard a gunshot and saw my friend run into the house and close the door. I asked him what happened and then the sound of 6 hatchets answered. Grabbing a shotgun and handing my friend an MP5 we opened our metal door and then closed it. We then got ready and opened the wooden door at the entrance. Let's just say if that wasn't spraying and praying I don't know what was. We then closed the door again and took the stuff of the 2 guys we killed. Let's skip ahead 10 minutes...30 guys are now banging at our wall and our wooden door won't last long. We quickly use the server's /remove command and place a metal door. We then opened the door again to find they were blocking the door off with walls and another foundation. We killed the rest and had to make stairs to the roof. And that was when 3 kevlar guys joined the crowd. Anyways let's just say a lot of crazy things happened that night.Another good experience is when we finally started dominating. Standing on the roof I was on guard duty that night. I saw a silhouette. I told my group members when suddenly I started getting shot at. I took cover as the roof was really just the second or third story that we hadn't finished. I aimed near where the gun was firing from and shot it with my bow. I then got another hit and the person died. We quickly collected our stuff and now we had finally gotten a 9mm. Throughout the night 3 guys would constantly bombard us. It got the message to the server and most kevlar users wouldn't even mess with us. On that same server we later discovered that a man with kevlar was payed to attack us by the men we had dominated as mentioned earlier. We had one really bad con next to our saferoom that was hidden by a wooden door. We had a window with window bars and the stairs would block it. He kept on shooting us through there and we got wiped out and when we came outside he took all our crap. Later on that same server (again) I took a stroll in kevlar with my two friends one in leather and one in kevlar. We patrolled the area and the kevlar friend went to hangar (we were in Ecko where our base always is). The leather one split up with me for 2 minutes until he was killed by someone with a silenced shotgun. I went over there and got killed. Yes I lost kevlar 2 M4's a shotgun leather and more but I was used to losing stuff. On Rust you get raided just dust off your pants and craft the stuff again. Someone KOS you? Go back and kill them later. I always like to threaten those kevlar KOS and then they just laugh but then I'm the one laughing when I'm standing over him and his 5 kevlar buddies and just messing around I get my friend who happens to be 13 to teabag them.Well there it is.

This game started off rough with an uncomplete game (still amazing) yet the developer desided ""you know what lets make this game so much better and not make anyone pay extra for it"" so they did just that they scrapped the first game and completly remade the game without asking players for a single dime in return all they wanted was feedback. With such a small team of devs it continues to awe me that they are still able to push out a new update every single week if this isnt great service I dont know what is.

2014-01-27,0,0,376,True,Recommended,Rust even in Alpha stage is a really fun game to play I've made so many friends from playing this game. You'll meet friendlies enemies and straight up holes. Sometimes you may get shot dead out of no where or mugged by a random person just don't let that ruin your opinion of the game. Rust is a lot like the real world if it came down to survival of the fittest there are people who will help you and there are people who would rather kill you and take your shoes. Anyway Rust is in Alpha so don't expect an amazing fluid game with no bugs or glitches at all at least its more developed and better than DayZ standalone.,Rust

Saw a house with a couple of kids in it and I asked them for supplies. They came out with guns and told me to turn around and look up at the beautiful sky. They shot me in the back and I heard them laughing with their mic. I respawned again near a hangar where a guy started shooting me cause he said he owns the hangar. I manage to make it into a warehouse and find a bolt action rifle with little ammo. I meet a guy with radiation boots.

2015-03-22,0,0,312,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game that stays fun for hours and hours but it does not run well on Linux. While playing on absolute minimum graphics settings on a good computer the new version of Rust barely reaches 30fps. The game is choppy and the fps drops even lower when near alot of buildings on high population servers.The game is marketed as Linux compatible which it is but it is not Linux playable.Rust legacy runs very well on Linux but this is dying out as most players have moved over to the new Rust version.Edit 4th August 2015 All of the Linux performance issues seem to have been fixed and the game now runs just fine!Edit 11th April 2017 Undownloaded workshop content causes major performance issues on Linux. Restart Steam to trigger the workshop content downloads and it should be fine after that.,Rust

2016-07-02,0,0,590,True,Recommended,The best Early Access game that exists. Why? Because it is being CONSTANTLY IMPROVED. This is among the few Early Access games that ive seen be improved weekly. Garry Newman and his team really are making this game into something great using community feedback and experimentation. The game as it exists now is fun intense and rewarding. While it might be a grind to get resources it is worth the time spent. The biggest downsides to this game is the lack of optimization graphics (which to ME arent a big deal at all) and some slight bugs. But Garry and his team are working tirelessly to improve these issues and expand the positives. You must buy this game. Even if you dont like it now i guarentee that in time it will be a great game.,Rust

There are pve servers but there is no way anyone can kick/ban if you still go kill someone. I have witnessed that myself.

2014-12-09,0,0,307,True,Not Recommended,"The legacy part is unplayable because of headbobbing why they add that to a game is beyound my understanding.The ""new"" rust or experimental is also unplayable because of several reasons i will list now.They are trying to adjust things in the game but they either set things to 1 or 100 its never the right thing in between.Let me give you an example The gathering system you either get 2 stones per hit or you get 37.Same with the hatchet on trees. Either its 100+ you get per hit or its 14.The developers of this game are way out of touch0onf how the game is.The main reason the experimental rust is unplayable is because of cheaters and bugabusers. Like when they just walk through the walls to your base and take over your base you spend the last 2 days making. Without you can do anything about it.Another reason to dislike this game is that when ever there is a patch you have to find a website your self to see the changes they dont use the NEWS section on steam because they want website hits.And when there is a server wipe they also announce it on some 3rd party site you have to find your self.The old experimental without blueprints was sooo much better the only downside it had was the buildings hp regeneration.",Rust

2015-04-29,0,0,52,True,Recommended,Great game altogether! The game has a great multiplayer experience. On one hand there can be players who are kind and try to help you as much as possible then on the other hand are the players who love stealing other peoples' items/materials etc which can be very entertaining at times.Gathering materials can be quite frustrating at times but once you achieve building a house securing your area and establishing allies the game gets very exciting.Raids are a great part of the game as well. I tend to partner up with friends and allies grab as much C4 as possible and raid every base in sight. Some bases may have few materials but most of the time you'll find heavily fortified bases that have too many materials and weapons to count.To conclude good game buy now.,Rust
2015-08-25,0,0,91,True,Recommended,It was a warm crisp day I was crafting doors for my recently built shack I went outside to gather more wood when I seen 2 guys come out the forest sprinting towards my beautiful home. In a panic I pulled out my pistol and aimed it at them expecting to be seconds later 2 bears followed them out from behind the trees so immediately I discovered they were being hunted! So i waved at them too come into my home As they were only a few feet away another bear came running out the rocks from the right I my pants and scurried back to my porch as I turned around to cover my fellow danglers One of them had already been downed and ravaged too peices I cried a little bit and started shooting (my 6 bullets). The other guy was soo close! so I pulled out my bow and arrows and gave him some cover fire! He made it too my porch we both got inside my shack and shut the door we waited... and waited. Then opened the door it all seemed clear I let him go first he told me it was clear we went over to his friends corpse to get his gear. Then all of a sudden 3 wolves out of nowhere! came running at us my new friend didnt realise as he must have been on the loot screen I thought to myself I can make it they will focus on him! So I ran! I got too my house safely turned around and my new friend was done for. I closed my door and sat by the fire wondering if I would ever meet someone.,Rust

2016-07-08,0,0,52,True,Recommended,Read this review *very carefully* this game is absolutely incredible all of the mechanics (though there's still bugs as it's in Alpha) are very fluid and fun to play with. The chance encounters you'll experience with other players will be anywhere from downright awful to unbelievably fun. BE WARNED Garry Newman has convieniently left all information out about your Gender AND Race this is PICKED FOR YOU RANDOMLY and has some unnatural fixation on sex organ size to boot. This is fine it's his game he can be as politically biased as he likes but no where on this storepage is there any mention of it.,Rust
2013-12-13,0,0,208,True,Recommended,Let me start off by saying that this game has excellent mechanic's and I do recomend this game to people who like the servivle genre. Now that i got the praise out of the way let me name some things that you may not like 1. over half the userbase are complete s that will kill all fresh spawns for bandages and a torch for the LOLZZ. 2. The game has a pretty severe learning curve that can make you very confused and aggravated. 3. The spawn system needs some work mostly to fix the problem of spawing you in a rad zone or into a pile of zombies. But even with these faults the game is still very fun to play with friends and I would strongly recomend you make sure you have people to play with it makes the game much easyer.,Rust
2014-03-07,0,0,675,True,Recommended,"Rarely have I experienced a game that I enjoyed even when I lost. Every moment is filled with immeasurable possibilies and interactions. I reccomend this game to the people who look for quality not quantity. For feeling not material. For to enjoy this game even when one dies is raided betrayed or loses ""progress"" one must extend their understanding of quality in a game to more than just having items. It's the relationship you create with the items the npc's and in this game other players. Something like that I probably should'nt be writing a review this late in the night but basically this game is like the definition of open world something along those lines.",Rust

I killed him with four shots from a revolver. As we were waiting for his backpack to unlock he came back. So I killed him after he killed my friend. His backpack finally unlocked. As I was collecting his gear He came up next to me and repeatedly shot me in my eye brows. I died. I was lying on the ground dead crying all over my now sweat drenched body as he takes all of my gear. He asks me ""Why did you kill me?""

Building is arguably one of my favorite things to do in Rust you can build almost anything. Caves are my favorite place to build. When you kill someone (even a noob) you feel satisfied with yourself. My favorite thing to do is go deep on some zergs A large group relying on number to accomadate for there terrible pvp usually they have huge compunds i just pretend im a slave and then go deep. Now with the component system is my favorite. I think it is fair for solo and for multiple players for an even start. ),Rust

This may cause some frustrating moments but over all this is just a little bug like there are thousands in other games. The buliding system for bases is great as it includes stability and gives you a lot of possibilities. This game includes a ton of different items and many monuments to gather loot. The new component system is still beeing balanced and it works pretty nice so far.Facepunch planned to include caves in one of the next updates they're probably coming along with the new harbour monument.If you're new to Rust you maybe should first try to play on a community server with low population to learn the basics of this game. YouTube tutorials for beginners can be very useful too (make sure they're not outdated!)The game definetly sucks but in the way it is supposed to! It is one of the most unsocial games on the market ) Therefore make sure you have some reliable friends to play the game with it's going to be way more fun than playing solo!I definetly recommend this game.

EVERYONE in the community are ""toxic"" ""cancer"" or it seems has all the time in the world to play so they have everithing and on thoes who dont... countless times i was shot in the back wile hitting a tree with my rock. or they will drop stuff on the ground and when you go to pick it up they will kill you. NOONE on this game helps you unless you have a friend that already plays and you join him/her. You start in the game naked and with a rock and torch. you need to survive. against other players with guns who dont even try to talk. they all just kill. i have been lucky enought to have a decent home and a good amount of food and crafting matereal. i had to go to bed to work the next day when i got off to log back in all was gone and i was killed. when you log off your body doesent go away it stays in game. as with your hut or house and all your recorces. so if you have a full time job or a life outside of steam... dont get it. you will waist hours of your life on what is an addictive concept... and with them TALKING about bringing in PvE it MIGHT tone down everyones trigger fingers but its doubtful.. thoes that can play all day every day make it in this game. thoes who cant run around hitting the same tree dieing and repeating... do not waist money on this game Long story short. also note its been in early development for 4 years though i regularly get updates... their is a few good thing i need to mention after all the bad. the game LOOKS amazing! and gameplay is for the most part very smoothe and apealing to the eye. (OCCATIONAL server lag fps drops nothing too bad given game is in ealy access)I thought this review a must due to the TERRIBLE community that plays it... I couldnt emagine anyone that wasnt a teen ie someone who has to work and stuff being able to play the game successfully unless you get into a dead server then its just boring hitting trees and rocks because their is no pve unless you consider killing a deer pve. not every player is a jackass on here.. but 99.9999999999999999999999999 percent are and will just kill you and not care. you may find one person to help you on here as long as that snowball you through through hell makes it to the other side. so in other words its a snowballs chance in hell to be ""good"" at this game. it comes down to how much time per day you have to spend. i personaly only like to play for an hour or so at a time and take a break and thats not near enough for this game. you need to go like 6 hours at a time and be able to regularly log in and check your well being in game... its terrible.",Rust

Frankly gary im dissapointed you decided to stop working on the great game you had going(legacy rust) to make a game that i can only conclude was made purely for kids under 10 or auts.

The thing that has me kept playing is the interaction between you and your fellow 'survivors'. It's interesting how players interact with each other some of them nice most of em close to pure evil. The 'not feeling safe' vibe is thanks to that very exciting and makes you want to keep playing and making your base inpenetrable.

But once I got some of my friends who I knew wouldn't kill me to play things got extremely fun!

Yeah you might get raided while sitting in your loot room gripping your only automatic weapon realising you only have moments to live before a larger more powerful group forces their way through your hard earned house due to you calling them p*ssy a** b*tches.

2014-02-14,1,4,844,True,Recommended,Rust is a game where you start out naked with close to nothing and you run around radiation towns open fields and mountains gathering resources tools making friends finding food making a home and all the other things you do in a typical survivor game. However the game gets interesting when you start making basic weapons killing zombies (or as replaced now mutant animals) and raiding radiation towns you start getting higher/better gear and you start PvP against others raiding other player's bases and homes or defending your own base/home from other raiders. It puts your creative mind to work when you're finding a way into someones carefully constructed base to looting all their gear and weapons or how to completely make your base impenetratable by raiders. Engaging other players in this game can also be very creatively executed. The gunplay in this game is also particularly unique. Unlike most fps games today the gunplay mechanics in this game requires skill and practice for the average shooter to get used to. One of those games that takes time getting into and can get intense real quick.,Rust
2016-01-31,7,20,1,True,Not Recommended,Spawn killing simulator where people as soon as they spawn will fight to cannibalize each other's with stones. Disregarding the actual premise of the game and turning it into a death match fps where the most edgy player wins this is a good example of how a community can destroy it's game because of memes.I probably sound salty but the bait description of the game just gives you the wrong idea of this product.ust not my kind of game was expecting something else.,Rust
2015-03-14,12,96,159,True,Not Recommended,"First I should say that I was given this game for free by people in the game industry and I've been in the game industry myself for 8 years. I shall try to be as unbiased and factual as possible but obviously some things are anecdotal.For whatever good intentions anyone might have had at FacePunch Studios Rust carries the unmistakable impression that it is an R&amp D Tech demo which keeps going through one iteration after the other while also managing to pull lots of money out of people. As an 8 year veteran in the game industry I say this is a scandal it is a scandal and not treating your customers as customers in any adult sense.As far as I can tell they (FacePunch) operate as though this whole thing was a joke. It shows in how they do their ""release cycles"" it shows in how they built the original iteration out of stuff straight from the Unity Engine it shows in the numerous reports I've read about how they haphazardly ban people from their forum for saying negative things (even in a polite fashion!) it shows in how they still proceed to market their game it shows in what I've seen in them forcing control of people's rented servers (nobody should have that right..nobody not them not DayZ not anyone) and most of all it shows in how one can almost feel the complacency from FacePunch Studios I could be very wrong but it really does seem like there is at least an indirect mentality of not being in any hurry to finish this game since they already have people's money.All this aside from the technical points I made could be mistaken views on my part but it seems increasingly unlikely as time goes by.TL/DR I do NOT recommend Rust to ANYONE. Avoid it as much as you can until they have something to show for it ..and even then I still think you should avoid it. In my view their behaviour so far has voided them any further support unless they make great efforts to make up for it.",Rust

2017-09-14,7,103,1874,True,Not Recommended,After over 1k hours I'm ready to review Rust. It's a garbage game plain and simple. With every new update the game progressively gets worse and feels less like a pvp/survival game and more like a constant grind which rewards giant groups and constantly on solo players. The component system and twig updates were the last nails in the coffin and as you can see from Steam charts this game is dying rapidly. Even servers wipe every 2 days at this point. 8/10 if this was 2 years ago 2/10 now.,Rust

2014-05-10,0,0,201,True,Recommended,Overall a great game! You for sure will get your money worth of laughs crys and outrages with this game. A lot of people are starting not to play while waiting on the major update that is soon to be coming but with all the mods that you can currently through at the game there is tons of ways to keep your self busy. The $19.99 is worth the money to invest into the game and company. Just like what everyone has stated it is a alpha game but hey at least its not another dayz game. They are taking a different approch. Building any super tall building will cause a fair amount of lag and servers that don't do decay you'll notice that same lag due to the shear number of items in the game. Sometimes that lag is just worth it when your trolling someone.,Rust

After dying 5352542442526 times you finally get back to your house to die again because someone placed a bear trap hidden in pumpkin patch on your door step.

2013-12-21,0,0,181,True,Recommended,Fantastic game even in this early state.One warning I will give is that the PvP side of this game is pretty intense so if you are seeing this game as another Minecraft then this might not be the game for you. If you like PvP and being forced to survive in a harsh world then this is most certainly the game for you.Every time you run across another player you have to make that life or death choice between approaching and forming some kind of alliance (there is real strength in numbers in Rust) sneaking by or of course you can just line up your rifle and take them down.,Rust

2014-08-21,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Run round naked hit guy with rock then take THERE rock and repeat 10/10 Now for an actual serious review ! Rust is ... frustrating in some parts increadibly so you can grind for maybe 2/3 hours to build a house then eaither a hacker or just a very experienced player will come along and kill you and you will of lost that progress becasue they normally bash down your door afterwards so you'll have to repeat the process it can take a while to get into a good streak becoming lucky ( I find luck is a major part of this game like most survival games) and possibly finding a few people to cooperate with which there are many. To be fair apart from it being in alpha and the Devs are working to rehaul the entire game (to my understanding) and some minor bugs and others stated above this is an amazing game for its genere. The survival elements while still basic to some degree (Chicken ... from pigs .. come on your killing me here ) ) has so much potential wether that be scabbling for limited resources or fighting for land and dominace over other groups of people it actually makes you feel like your survivng something with the fear of loosing everything. Now for experienced players the early game will be a breeze knowing what to craft and how to easily get the things they need but for me when i start anew its a challenge and somthing i find truley unique and hard to find in other survival games. If you can get past the bugs some hackers and the Post Apocolyptic Fallout That Removed Everyones Pants this is an amazing game to dive into solo but even better with friends!,Rust

Rust is really fun but of course the game still has some fixes that they have to improve on. I hope they will make the FPS better and optimize the game. Beside these things the game is a really fun and enjoyable with friends or without friends. I really think 31 99 euro really worth the money for this game. I want to give 8/10 on the rating level.This review was a long time ago and i want to update it. The game is getting better and better. They also started optimizing the game really good. I really enjoy playing with my friend but alone is also really fun. I played with my friend for 10 hours straight but it did not feel like i played 10 hours. The game is so fun that you will not realize that 10 hours has passed. Right now the game is for sale until the 5th of July 2018 and it only cost 7 99 euro.

2016-10-21,2,2,1678,False,Not Recommended,Alright this is like the third time I've edited this to fix some mistakes and make it better but this is all I have so far.Rust is a painful game but it is very rewarding after awhile. You'll have lots of fun though with teammates and the game doesn't break your back when you try to do a move on a group when your solo your teammates will for sure help you by either being a distraction or you being the distraction. I've played this game since the graphics update and I still don't like a lot of the features that Rust has made but they for sure made it better. The only thing that I hate about this game is toxic annoying little kid zerg clans it just pisses me off to get offline raided by a 12 man zerg that lives right next to me on the first day of the wipe! Military crates are balanced but can be a little overboard sometimes and getting 4 elite crates without any key cards or weapon in military tunnels is for sure broken. If you go there as a naked you come out looking like you just raided a clan. The one last thing that I hate about this game is the players and the game itself. The community will non stop talk left and right if you kill them or they kill you but some are actually pretty nice and pick you up and they let you do whatever you need to do! The other half of the players are toxic they are the type of players to just door camp you just because you downed them in a fight and come back in full gear and tons of satchels or a bunch of c4. I do not reccomend this game if you don't like high risk high reward type games.,Rust

2015-06-18,0,0,822,True,Recommended,"Hey all. Before i post this i am of course expected to be trolled by many players..... )So ive played Rust now for Approximately 4 weeks. the 1st week i spent on a Community server called TheDerps. not a bad server but it was very quiet. me and my friends got to learn the game mainly on the building aspect of the game but we only created small huts and houses not knowing too much about the PvP side of things and how easy it was to be raided. So after loging in one day we found someone god knows who had raided us and left us pretty useless to the point that we had to start completely fresh (we left the server) LSo we joined another server and me and my friend built a nice fort on Happis island in the middle of a lake. Armoured every wall and foundation. After 4 days of hard work some Admins of a server carried 999 C4's and blew our fort up whilst we stould inside of it in less than 5 mins. (We wundered why the server was soo quiet) After my 5 mins of moaning about them performing this act on us we decided to leave the server as i was banned from the server for calling them out to be cheats lSo i joined another server again it was quiet. I wanted to get a good fort built up before people that maybe of had blueprints for C4 or rocket launchers could take advantage of me. Alone i made a very nice fort. ud probably of needed atleast 100 C4 to get to my stash. (i was proud) DNow again this server was quiet and i had to be on my best behaviour with people. i was kind and helped people when i could. every now and then if my friend logged on we'd perhaps raid people that had something half decent. This turned into being a problem however as people left the server once raided. I can kind of understand there frustration but what am i supposed to do? run Radtowns pointlessly and stash more and more weapons i don't need?I grew bored of this server and thought id try out a server with a bit more population.... (this is were my problems as a new player to the game came into play)So i thought id try out a procedural map for a change as Happis Island was kind of boring me (i wanted to be suprised at the map at every turn) I was shocked at the amount of buildings on the server as i walked up from the beach. This wasn't overly a bad thing at all. So i see stone and start hitting it. after my 1st hit. Bolt shot to the head. I was a bit shocked that someone with a Bolt rifle is shooting people that have litterally just stepped onto the server. ""Welcome to Official servers pal"" so i respawn and ask in the server chat if theres anychance i could join a clan or make an application anywere? i wasn't successful. People were very serious about taking slaves or laughed at what i wrote. (is this a clan based game?)Again the next server after about 20 mins. I joined and before i could even hit a tree i was shot by Bolts / AK47's / Thompson's. Im thinking why are they wasting there ammo on someone that is litterally no threat to them? I joined an American server and spent 3 4 days running radtowns and dying finding blueprints. And at every turn (even though i was naked) i was getting gunned down by people for no reason.After 4 days of playing a procedural map as a new player i came to the conclusion that this game isn't at all beginner friendly and if you ask for some leeway in the server chat they just gun you even more. This game could possibly be the best survival game however something needs to be implemented that will make people think twice about killing anyone. For example.Naked people can have guns hidden in there inventory out of site making you still a target for anyone. give players weapons hanging around there shoulders or C4 carried on there backs like backpacks?Killing soo many people within the space of time will make your character slightly psycho expanding on that.... making them shout randomly very load or twitch. This will make people aming off or at night when trying to hide a nightmare for them.I was told this idea was implemented in Dayz. making people less hostile to everyone around them and making them think twice about killing people whenever they see them. 1 last idea.Give weapons a Threat count? soo if players have maybe armour on them in there bags or even equiped. it increases a players threat. making them more likely to be shot by other players around them. If you are shot carrying C4 / Armored items / Weapons / Ammo etc (each individual item has a threat count) then when your shot it won't effect the opositions mental state. Where if a player kills somebody that is naked with nothing worth any value in there inventory or equiped it can seriously effect there mental state making them likely to shout / twitch perhaps even commit suicide because there effected that much by guilt.Good game but make this game more beginner friendly )",Rust

2014-01-31,0,0,120,True,Recommended,I've been playing rust for a few days and I recommend this over Day Z if you're looking at both. I chose to buy Day Z at first but after a frustrating 2 hours dying of hunger looking for a friend.. I died to a group wanting everything I found. I gave up because it was so hard to find people you were playing with. Rust (also cheaper) is so much more enjoyable because I can hunt for food. I can build my own shelter (which zombies won't come through the wall!) and I can make my own weapons. I have found a friendly server which is a plus where we all help each other except for the occasion person who joins the server to try and kill people.,Rust

2016-02-24,0,0,3185,True,Recommended,The best game ive ever played i think my hours on this game say enough buy it its worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!10/10 greatest game ive ever played in my lifeNewest thoughts...The game has been through a lot of changes since i created this review....The game is still a great game but only for people who want a challange. To be good at this game you must have time and i mean alot of time. You have to constantly gather components to create your tools and weapons. You also have to grind bps to be able to craft these items. You get bps by farming barrels which takes alot of time. You must save up a ton of scrap in order to get the bps. After you manage to get the bps you need to be constanly gathering. You must build a very secure base or you will be raided. With a secure base comes a high upkeep. With this upkeep you must put resources in your cupboard. This means the bigger the base the more it takes. After you gather for your upkeep and bps you are finally near end game which means you can now go raid. Raiding is the best part of the game. Raids can be very intense and very thrilling. Now that you are finaly done with end game you expand your base and try to become the dominating clan of the server you are on.This game is not for the light hearted but if you enjoy putting time and grinding a little this game is perfect. It is full of epic gun fights and epic raids. But be warned raids bring out the salt in everyone.Raid on,Rust

2014-07-14,1,2,333,True,Recommended,Well Rust is quite a good game besides the fact it's in early access. The guns are not extremely over powered because of their kick is very high as it would be in real life but you would still loose hand rock vs pistol. I like how The developers are taking a new lead to this game and have been doing alot of updates and changes lately but one thing that I haven't seen in the devblog is a way on how to make the player base more friendly. This is a big deal with gameplay in Rust because it is extremely hard to find someone who doesn't shoot you on sight ( Even If your a new spawn with no gear sometimes.) This is getting to a ridiculous point it has turned a survival game to an all out free for all where people shoot on sight. now a days the only way I find someone who doesn't shoot on sight is when I have a better weapon than them and I tell them to run off and maybe give them food. but sometimes the urge is to strong in some people and they go for the kill anyways. The only benefit from this player base is killing a bandit who killed you as a new spawn and absolutly burn their soul in embarrasment. Maybe the devs can't fix this but we can I and my friends have made a pledge not to shoot on sight unless we know that person is hostile. can you guys please band together on this one for me it would make the gameplay alot better. At Rust's Current state I give it a 7/10 The player base needs alot of work!,Rust

2014-02-26,0,0,15,True,Recommended,Overall a great game. You start out running around for resources then you build a crappy wooden shed for your first home. Then your adventure begins. You craft your first gun/bow and you feel like a mega bad But let me tell you something. No matter what you do in the end you will die. It always ends like that. Then your adventure starts over again. So in other words this game is a SUPER HD Minecraft texture with a sprinkle of DayZ on top. I rate 9/10.,Rust

This is my ideal game and although this game is in Alpha it is funner than allot of the games on Steam! My favourite this is the action of a gunfight or being raided/raiding somebody and getting into a CQB combat experience. There are no limits to this game and the face that Garry said that it's about 10% done makes me feel excited for what's to come of this brilliant game!Edit 2 years later and this game is still sick.,Rust

2014-06-07,0,0,617,True,Recommended,Rust is possibly one of the best games I have played in a long time you just need to look at my game time for proof. Facepunch are doing an oustanding job to work with the community and provide a absolutely great game. There is plenty of tension I've definately started shaking with fear from bandits blowing through my door or a 5 team with M4s patrolling down the street towards the radiation town I'm hiding in. From when you place your first foundation to that heart breaking moment when you die the experience is brilliant I would reccomend to anyone.,Rust
2014-04-25,0,0,52,True,Recommended,In the two days I have owned this game I have expereienced diplomacy tribal dancing and chaanting heartbreak and betrayal heated firefights pretending to be Robin Hood and a covert base raid. This game is what DayZ should have been the gunplay is fantastic the crafting is deep and immersive and most importantly the community is fun. never before have I been able to have amusing and lengthy conversations with other armed players without beig shot at. In conclusion if I had $50 to spend on DayZ and Rust I would buy two copies of Rust.,Rust

2014-02-15,0,0,169,True,Recommended,"Being a avid DayZ player going in to the game for the first time I wasn't very impressed seing that this game was initially made to ""Out Do"" DayZ. However withing a few hours I was hooked! I couldn't stop playing or my player would die whether he was in an unsafe spot low on food or water or needed more materials for a stronger base so in a large sense I cared... This early alpha game created a surge for me to put down DayZ and build die live. Upon crafting and running about for multiple days it struck me I had suddenly realized ""I've done it all"" Then the game started to get dull fading away from my intrest more and more each day. I discovered there wasn't much to do after that the game needs more continuum which seems difficult to add because on the contrary it already seems so full which poses the question ""What more could possibly come by the time it's done?"" And well that could be many things I'm excited to wait and find out. I'd recomend this game for sure but the Rust community is quite a downfall (mostly immature people from my knowledge) That may however be fixed in the future seeing that the ability to chat to the person who killed you usually doesn't lead to happiness... 7/10 Game of the Day",Rust

In general play a more or less adequate people alone are you will not survive it is necessary to search for a command such as you cling to beginners or have any players who reached then.Game mode is also very interesting as the shooter can be correlated with the raids and increasingly for survival.The whole trick of the game is to show the players how to actually difficult to start from scratch but to achieve the objective either you get everything for example a bolt AK 47 armor jacket a huge reinforced house and a bunch of friends and well wishers simply or cashing a lot of enemies you live in a room of 1x1 and eat human meat.Just a great engine which created all this beauty mountains sea lakes passes meadows and woods course.Everyone who is going to try to play good luck! Отличная игра все очень просто и легко.Есть свои системы строительства крафта. В основном играют более менее адекватные люди в одиночку ты там не выживешь по этому надо искать команду из таких же как ты новичков или прибиться к уже достигнувшим чего либо игрокам.Режим игры тоже очень интересен можно соотнести как шутеру при рейдах так и в большей мере к выживанию.Вся фишка игры в том чтобы показать игрокам как на самом деле тяжело начинать всё с нуля но при достижении цели либо ты получаешь всё например болтовку ак 47 бронежилет огромный армированный дом и кучу друзей и просто доброжелателей либо наживаешь много врагов живешь в комнате 1х1 и ешь человеческое мясо.

I'd highly recommend joing a Non PVP server your first time playing as just getting ruthlessly killed countinuously on PvP servers is no fun. Survive your first night collect some wood and minerals from deposits throughout the woods build a fire and structure and adventure through the amazing game that is RUST! This game has amazing potential and I cannot wait to see what is done over the next few months. The game is in early alpha and is buggy and has some stability issues but is WELL worth the $20 right now. 9.5/10,Rust
2014-08-04,1,5,260,True,Recommended,What can i say that hasnt been said before abour Rust. Rust holds a deep foreboding truth. ya know the kind of truth and insight you get right after you from masterbating to creepy porn or after you have sex with a fat chick. After playng rust for any decent amount of time you start to wonder if you are the good guy or the bad guy. I mean im having a ridiculous amount of fun but at what cost? Its completely possible that that naked guy i killed who had an hour and a half worth of farm on him decided to get off the computer and commit suicide in real life. Yet all i could do was laugh with giddy excitement at having stolen his hard earned loot with a simple well placed headshot. This game brings out the absolute worst in people. It will make you rage more than you ever have but BY GOD you will have the most fun and the highest highs you have ever had also. I recommend you play this game with friends find 2 trustable people to play with and you will have an absolute blast.10/10,Rust
2015-03-06,0,0,3120,True,Recommended,It's in alpha still so we've got a long way to go.The idea of the game is fantastic and what they've got so far is excellent.However if you're looking for a full game that can hold you attention for more than a few hours you might look elsewhere.Currently when you start a new character on a server with a decent amount of people (You don't really want to run around on an empty server either that's no fun) you'll see quite a few buildings some very large. What you'll probably notice about most of the small (3x3 or less) buildings is that they've been broken in to. This is the hardship of a new player on any of the servers. As soon as you've made your first home there'll be a roaming band of people with guns and ammunition to hunt you down and take your stuff.The best way to survive this onslaught is to try and upgrade to stone immediately and have a sleeping bag in your hut along with some extra tools. Then you'll want to try to upgrade to metal immediately after that. Anything less than a metal house will most likely be demolished by the time you log back in next.TL DRThe game is great but the lack of protection for new players and general difficulty in protecting your stuff ruins it.If they increase the defense of wooden structures to the same level as stone and then stone up to metal and metal to an even higher level that'll fix the game. (in my opinion).If this were a full release 4/10For an Alpha with a brilliant concept 8.5/10,Rust

2014-01-20,0,0,287,True,Recommended,What to say about Rust. Unlike the trailer the first day is hard. As is the second Third Forth and all the days you play in it. You need Wood and stone to get off your feet. To survive long enough to get wood and stone you need food Finding food and killing with just a rock is a task and a half.However Once you have your little shed nestled in the trees or mountains and you finally get yourself going this game is just fantastic. Somethign so simple as surviving becomes so enjoyable you just forget that you've been playing for so long. Yes there are hackers Yes there are bugs but it IS in alpha and for an Alpha this has so much to do. Even with as simple as starting with the worst hatchet and the worst gun having to run out of your safe home to fetch resources as fast as you can because you're neighbour with an assault rifle doesn't like you because you know that it'll pay off when you can shotgun him halfway accross the field when he tries to kill you. (personal experience here folks)Seriously ignore the bad reviews get the game and try it. It's just mind blowing.

2014-01-11,0,0,281,True,Recommended,Rust.What to say really. You start out with nothing except obstacles before you. Find resources find food make shelter survive. Games like this really bring out the worst in people. When you die you lose everything since it stays where you died. The majority of your deaths will be from other players. Simply because they're little boys with magnifying glasses and you're an ant that can scream and run. In the case of Rust that ends up being a metaphor for them having shotguns and automatic rifles while you have a rock or hatchet. Sometimes a bow. It brings out the worst in people because those people delight in needless consequence free cruelty and in this setting can justify it as 'survival'. That being said you also get to see some of the great aspects of humanity. The coming togetherness where a group of individuals struggles against the odds to actually help one another and build towards something. There's a really neat connection formed in a joint struggle such as Rust. As many a**holes as I've met I'm met more decent people if not outright friendly and helpful ones. As much as this game will you off I have also found it to be fairly addictive. There is an amount of masochism involved in that opinion but it's a game experience you don't get many other places. Even in its alpha stage it is very much playable and really has very few bugs or glitches that I've noticed. There is still the occassional a**hat speedhacker but Valve is theoretically cracking down on that with VAC. If you buy this expect to be defeated time and again simply because some little boy can do so with little effort. But also expect to meet some people that will genuinely want to work with you and help you to create something together. Besides it's awfully satisfying to cornhole a naked man with an arrow as he runs away his attempt to bash your skull in with a rock having failed. If you do buy it and I would suggest it to a lot of people just make efforts to have an ingame buddy or 5. You won't get far on your own. And if you want to keep it make sure it has a metal door.,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,205,True,Recommended,Rust is a game made by Garry Newmann and his new company in where you are placed in the world of rust and are forced to fight for food rocks and the materials within them and your own life. Now the game is in Pre Alpha so its a little rough and Rust may be having an issue with hackers but i assure you that it's Garry's first priority to try and solve this problem. the game is amazing with blueprints that will give you awsome recipes to things such as flashlight modifications for your guns. the game is about 20 dollars so it isnt too expensive. But this game is made for friendship and if you got a buddy who likes survival games as much as you do then this game is made for you both. In my opinion this is my favorite survival game greatly surpassing Dont Starve. I would recommend Rust to anyone who like survival games,Rust

2014-06-29,0,0,72,True,Recommended,"I guess I've played this game long enough to offer my opinion.There's currently a huge overhaul underway. The game is almost being rebuilt completely and it shows. Should the rebuild pan out as they intend it to Rust will be better than ever. That being said let's talk about the game as you can play it right now.Ever wonder what would happen if you got dumped on a radioactiee landmass with a bumch of hyper violent idiots chicken pigs and mutated chicken wolves? No? Well this is a game that simulates that exact situation. You will be murdered for no reason you will be murdered for plenty of good reasons too.Here's a story that will best sum up how this game tends to go and why I love it so damn much I gnerally play Rust with two of my friends on a less densely populated server (let's say 10 people on average). Our favorite spot to set up our fortresses in is called French Valley (at least that's what I remember the name to be... I sometimes call it Steve French Valley). We get pretty well established mainly because everyone else is fairly far away from us at least far away enough to not want to attack or bother us. Of course paranoia starts to get the best of the three of us. You see Rust gives you two options for building wood or metal. It's much much harder to destroy or break into a metal structure than a wooden structure. The three of us get to talking and decide that it is now time to start pursuing airdrops.Airdrops are a core part of playing Rust. As soon as a server has the requisite number of people online Airdrops with awesome supplies start to drop at certain intervals. Airdrops may contain C4 guns supplies or blueprints to learn how to make new things. The best way to get the blueprints for metal structures tends to be through airdrops.Back to airdrop hunting we're mining rocks in French Valley when the ominous roar of an airplane starts in the distance. We all whip out our guns and start running to the airdrop. It looks like the airdrop is going to land a bit past some mountains and hills in the distance. On our way we find an extremely well established fortress. It has at least 5 or 6 buildings with plenty of spiked walls and gates to keep people out. We don't bother stopping because the airdrop is the only thing on our minds.Fast forward a few minutes. Damn the airdrop to hell! The crates landed out of reach on some cliffs and mesas that are unreachable. We search aimlessly make no progress damage some limbs and finally give up. We head back. Our walk of defeat takes us right past the megafort that we passed by on our way to the crate hunt. We decided to scope out the fortres a little more this time around. Maybe they are online right now. Maybe it's abandoned. It turns out there is a guy there. He seems pretty nice and offers us some free stuff and sends us on our way. Pretty nice experience considering that most encounters in Rust end in death.A couple of in game days pass and we have gathered a few airdrops. We've erected a metal building or two. Steve French City is looking good.Out of nowhere this other guy runs into our camp and starts trying to talk to us... in what seems to be Korean... We're a bit bewildered but he is harmless. Maybe a tad annoying but mostly harmless.BrrrrrrrrrrshsshshhbrrrrrrrrrrAirdrop inbound. We whip out our guns and look toward the sky. The aridrop is coming down right above our base three crates this time. Honestly it couldn't have been more perfect... well except for the random guy that apparently didn't speak much English hanging around our camp. We quickly talk it over and decided not kill him unless he takes hostile action against us. Remember that while we are discussing our plan of action the crates are drifting lazily downward on giant parachutes.We decided that each of us should stand near or under where the crate will drop effectively laying claim to all three crates. Solid plan right? Wrong.My buddy Chocolate Gidddyup stood directly underneath the fall crate. Apparently the physics in Rust are better than I imagined.Splat!I realize what has just happened and quickly loot my crate throwing all it's contents into my pack. I start running toward Chocolate Giddyup's corpse and find the random person standing directly over his corpse. At the time it seemed like he was looting his body. In retrospect I'm not entirely certain what he was doing. Regardless he chose to stand far too close to my fallen comrade. I start barking at him to back away.""Stop! Back away now!""Then I realize that he might not speak any English. Over our chat the three of us decide to murder the wayward traveller for the sake of Steve French City. I whip out my rifle and start taking shots at him. And I missed almost every shot. I clipped his limbs a few times but our unfortunate traveller starts booking it faster than we can keep up.Want to know where he ran towards? The goddamn mega fortress in the distance. We all realize what we had done. From that point forward peaceful relations with the mega fort turned hostile. On numerous occasions we were murdered ruthlessly. On numerous occasions our poorly placed windows were used as entry points for burglaries. Steve French City fell on hard times.Moral of the story don't stand under falling objects.TL DR A falling crate killed my friend and helped spark an inter city conflict 27/10 would play again.",Rust

2014-04-15,0,0,122,True,Recommended,If you enjoy survival games then this game may be for you but there are a few things to think about before making the purchase. While the game is relatively bug free from my experience it is missing many features that you take for granted in most other games. While it is in alpa still so there should be more imporvements on the way. The other problem is the heavy reliance on PVP as a game mechanic. Between other players killing you and stealing your things most of the time spent in game is either protecting against this happening or rebuilding adter being raided. Overall it is a fun game and I plan to play more but there are certainly areas that could be improved.,Rust

2017-06-29,0,0,576,True,Recommended,I understand a lot of people are returning this game I believe due to it being Early Access and to me that is not a good excuse.I devoted 300hrs of gameplay of mining farming building raiding and finally PVP which I can say is still getting worked on but a lot of stuff is getting worked on it is in Alpha for christ sake.I cannot tell you how many times I woke up in the middle of the night of a nightmare of rockets or c4 raiding my base because I love the game so much but getting raided isn't bad it is in the game you must rebuild the next base even stronger and better such is life.It isn't about getting raided and leaving the server cause you don't have patience to do it all over again that is what a sore loser does and people like that don't belong on this game. I understand getting raided or offline raided is annoying but it is RUST and you will grow to be ok with that. Let me just say real quick I am a comp CS player in Open and the PVP to me is simple and easy. I can't tell you exactly how to be good at fighting but it just takes time and reading the updates on aimcones.Lastly if you aren't into the whole KOS kind of thing then find a nice roleplay server they aren't half that bad as people say they are because most people look down on roleplayers due to that fact they are different and to those people they are just people stuck in the way of HS bullying and it is pathetic. I am not a roleplayer myself but I do not put hate on someone who likes to do that because they are the ones who keep the game interesting!Anyways I hope you enjoyed this review and may the odds ever be in your favor.,Rust

If you don't know about Rust it was in Early Access for a couple years till they decided to switch to a re done version and have worked on that ever since. Things were going well everyone was happy the game was going in a great direction. Like I said somewhere in 2015 things just seemed to get worse. Weapon nerfs things changed to remove a lot of raiding options other than c4 solo players basically got ed in the hitboxes that suck etc etc and now this year They implemented an XP system to replace the Blueprint system which allows you to learn new things to craft. So instead of Rust being a fun ""open world"" multiplayer survival game now they're going into RPG and MMO territory EXCEPT in these types of games there are other ways to level up aside from hitting a tree with a rock. yeah. On top of that the devs had allowed a Twitch streamer (you know the website full of intelligent people Twitch) to basically be a main admin on EVERY server. I think they revoked his access after he ed up ALREADY by wrongfully banning people he didn't like. Yup.

Now for $20 I just got one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had in a very long time. Teamed up with two friends and my brother and we went from being naked men running around dongs dangling from small rad to big rad. After the end of our first play session which was over eight hours we were the top dogs on our server. We had full kevlar gear and all the guns we could ever need and the research kits to make ammo. We would get into firefights all the time because people now came after us and it was so intense.I've had two days to play this game and I've already put over thirteen hours into it. That's more than I can say for almost all of my library. If you're thinking about picking this game up stop. Grab your wallet surrender your cash and satisfy GabeN and Garry Newman.

Step 2 is to kill a ton of animals and mine a ton of rocks because we need at least 6 c4 and then we need to add doors. Step 3 when they are not on we take back our base and then steal theirs. Or we can just find a new server but that's not as fun""Another time my friends and I were kidnapped and forced to fight to the death with rocks. As a three time world champion I won a free shotgun.One time my friend was held at gunpoint and mugged... for his rock.You will experience things in this game unlike anything you have ever experienced before.

Even though there is no zombies you can feel the survival adrenaline due to the fact you can get shot at any time by anyone. Never trust other players unless you know them in real life.

2016-07-02,0,0,572,True,Recommended,"I wish I could give this game a ""Maybe"" in all honesty. You've read the other reviews mine is no different. Humans are generally a species in reality let alone in a world where the worst of vices are possible and even praised. GENERALLY a community why? Because humans are the key element in this games community. Don't solo this game unless you are a masochist. This game makes Dark Souls look like Candy Land. You will die you will lose everything you've spent hours if not days building. Merciless and unforgiving. Period. This game will come crashing down upon you in waves of anxiety and paranoia. You will never feel so anxious and nervous like this from any other video game. Not for the faint of heart or weak of mind. There are hackers completely obvious and even blatant hackers. Choose your servers wisely the official Rust servers are a hit and miss. Some haven't had admins for what appears to be months if ever. Play with friends or online acquaintances. This is essential if you aren't a masochist and want to feel like you are accomplishing something in this game. You CAN find decent people. Look at the world chat talk to people see who is the obvious arrogant piece of and those who seem to be in the same boat as you. Once you find one helpful person it will be easier to find others maybe the person you just encountered has some friends or online acquaintances and your alliances will grow. This is how I was lucky enough to enjoy this game second day in. Avoid being an . Why? Because being a decent human being in Rust sets you apart from the rest of the people. people are in abundance on all Rust servers there is no need for an additional one. Disregard s. There is no need to let them get the best of you. Remind yourself that this is a goddamn video game not real life. The opinions and actions of people inside this game are irrelevant and stupid remember this. No need to go cursing people out and just making yourself look like an If they are hacking report it. If they aren't hacking but just generally being douches ignore them. Spawn elsewhere or take a break from the game. Avoid clan servers. They are boring and futile. You will die or you will join there is nothing else you can do on a clan server. Maybe look for low population servers there are plenty you wont run into as many people therefore the possibility of running into s is highly diminished. Don't be like me go to YouTube watch at least 2 3 videos on how to play Rust. Then go to the Wiki read more information there. You will get answers in game but usually everyone is resentful. Again you may run into a nice person but save that person some time and frustration and teach yourself the basics of rust e.g. resource mining building a base blueprints SLEEPING BAGS / SPAWNING (IMPORTANT!!!!) LOCKING DOORS!!! (can't emphasis this enough If you don't you'll lock yourself in or out of your own base) the difference in a properly and well placed base vs. a poorly placed and developed base HOW people raid you how not to attract attention from s etc. WARNING This game will lure you in and consume your soul mind body and time. Days will fly by only for you to realize you haven't slept or eaten since then.Last but not least purchase this game when its on sale.",Rust

2017-06-26,0,0,44,True,Recommended,"Short VersionEnjoyable I suppose when you're not getting mugged or and shot everytime you spawn(or within 10 seconds of being *awaken*) yes anywhere!Long VersionI don't even think this game has a story....apparently it's post apocalyptic with no backstory as how you became to be....or how the world happened...Gameplay is fun IF you're *not* being shot or mugged to death everytime of course! Can role play in this game but you would need to be in a fairly large group/clan for that to work in your favour or else expect it to not work as well...there are not RPG mechanics but I guess the RPG genre tag is for you having the possibility to role play your characters? Definitely fast action and many adventures await! Basically you craft build your house/base or well before that gater resources then build. Then gather more resources and build again improving the base/house then go exploring or if you wanna role play I guess now should be a good time....or well I guess you can start at the very beginning to role play but whatever. After adventuring for a while you come back with cool new stuff you build and improve again then decide to go raid some other people's home/bases because you now find grinding for resources boring and tedious so what better way than to raid someone else's base for the possibility of a better/quicker haul of loot?So you go on and raid someone else's base only to see that they have 10 layers of walls to break through....you break them all and proceed further into the base. You break everything including the chests because they were smart enought to lock them. If you're lucky you will see the owner of the base sleeping you go ahead and kill him in his sleep. Job done base raided and looted. Now you go back home build and imrprove and rinse and repeat.Sometimes you meet another player hopefully you see him before they see you as always in a PVP game trust no one(unless you've teamed up with someone beforehand(before even loading Rust) in which case those guys are fine to trust but they can always back stab you if they wanted to since friendly fires is always on and presumably at 100% as well hopefully that will never be the case assuming you guys are good friends and or just wanna team up for the sake of it because lets face it going lone wolf against an entire clan/group is suicde....) it's always a trap! No matter what! Even if it's a *girl* gamer who is trying to seduc you to be more trusting remember there are no girl gamers G.I.R.L Guy In Real Life....never fall for one....ever!Graphics side ok looks awesome I guess with everything turned up including antialiasing 1080p. With my SLi 770s I am only getting 45 frames per second on average.....because it would appear this game does natively support SLi. I reckon I could get around 60 to 65 fps if both cards were working at it's peak efficiency. If running 1440p144 which I tried doing you will need more than 4GB of vRAM as shown in this here artwork...Game supports up to 7.1 channels! Definitely a plus especially since this is PVPVE and you want the most of where things are! Not much comment on the music as it's basically ambient music I guess to chill with....but sounds are definitely directional even in stereo mode.....oh there also appears to be two stereo modes in the audio options I am guessing one of them is for headphones? Or 2.1 setup which is not listed on there? Others being ProLogic 4.0 5.0 and 5.1 channels surround sound.....now for some other comments/issues I have about the game.....The Code Lock needs a change especially when you have lots of door to go through to have this on when you have a massive and I mean really huge massive base that you want doors at! Maybe instead of seperate interactions have both the guest and master code on one screen and a checkbox or something for ""same as master code"" if you want to keep the code the same for both guest and master but clicking a few times just to do this is very tiring(because you click to change master code then hold e and click again to unlock then you hold e and click to change guest code then you hold e and click to lock back again sure all this can be done on one screen right? If you don't want to give guest code ok just leave that field blank) especially when you have 1k or more doors to go through....There appears to be a bug whenever I chuck a beacon grenade it *might* just pre emptively explode before you get away at a safe distance hence killing yourself.... Why aren't there driveable cars/vehicles? Or a way to instant transit between bases/places? You can teleport to other players but not fast travel to a place??!It would appear this is also another one of those games where fraps and steam overlay doesn't play nicely the others being Trine 3 and Killing Floor 2....whereby if fraps is running steam overlay simply refuses to run....so if you want to check out other windowz you need to tab out.....There also appears to be a bug with some breakable wooden walls in that there appears to be no way of destroying them as they get replaced with new ones or there are many layers of wooden planks that needs to be destoryed before we are able to pass. Whilst destroying these planks the frame rate drops to 10......and if you destroy it with explosive rounds you basically crash the game as my friend did that.So you can stack over a million resource item like stone but you can't stack doors........how exactly does that make sense? It's not very consistent is it now? You either remove stacking or have EVERYTHING stakable.Also I don't get the attack chopper what's the purpose of that? Is it only just to kill us players and nothing more?! All this without even a backstory of some sort just feels like a cheap way to get rid of us.....if we don't die from animalls self or other players first....Oh and did I mention it's still in ALPHA state? It's not even in beta stage yet!!!??? But ehh not bad for an alpha state game I guess.....Anyways this game is best played with a friend or two or in a group or a clan because lone wolfing it you're just asking for it unless you're a masochist and like dying a lot or failing a lot too...or if you're a really SMART player I reckon you should do fine solo...... I'm not much of a PVP kind of person so I rarely play any games to do with PVP got this game to play with another friend who basicallly pressured me to play with him as soon as I got it he disappeared from my friendslist.....what a ....made me spend $20 no $25 since my currency is AUD on a game I *would* have had not played(effectively wasting money on it and yes I've already asked for a refund but steam says "" off"") until another person came along friended me and said ""Hey you wanna play some Rust?"" And I go ""Oh yeah sure I would have had not touched or if I did I would have maybe clocked in less than a few hrs and then be done with it!"" And so that's how my Rust adventures began...

2014-03-15,0,0,411,True,Recommended,"Phew what a game...It keeps you on the edge 100% of the time. My co players nodded approval when I said 'playing this for too long can give you Posttraumatic stress disorder...'I play on a small community server so the number of friendly/helpful people ist relatively high 30 40% of the players perhaps. From what I hear about larger servers this is considered idyllic... The fascinating thing about Rust ist that while the gamedesign is still barely existent everything what makes a game interesting unfolds by itself because of nothing other than human nature. As a sandbox game in it's most literal form there are no missions no levels no achievements no bosses just a landscape with a few different types of farmable resources and an in comparison to other crafting games limited repertoire of things to do with them.So... when you think about it everybody could just mind their ways farm and craft and be happy with what they've created... In an ideal world even everybody would help each other out enabling everybody on the server to indulge in their own and the community's achievements. Haha nope. The complete opposite is the case. People immediatly start drawing borders and start labeling other people. There will be no server where you won't be spammed via worldchat or voicechat with messages like ""are you friendly? don't go there! the russian/german/french/swedish/kiddie/hillbilly/something awful camp lies there! team up with me to fight them!"" or ""GET THE F*** OFF MY TERRITORY OR I SHOOT YOU!"" or as in most of the cases you'll just get mowed down with an assault rifle and then get asked if you're a trespasser or not.What to do? no missions? Take your buddies and go searching for loot in the radioactive structures along the road. Want to experience a sense of achievement? You'll never feel as exhilarated like when you've survived a massive raid on your house with all the attackers lying dead to your feet. Need a bossfight? Now and then you'll find a server with this one guy behaving like he's the spamming you with stuff like ""don't you f*** with me I've got 30 people under my command ready to unleash a tidal wave of whooping (they'll phrase it differently) on you!"" But just this time it's not some guy pretending he really has that kind of man power. Nothing better than to manage to round up all the fed up people who hate him for having to give him all their stuff everytime they walk into him and his gang and get them to raid the hell out of him. How to tell if noob amateur or pro? watch the players when an airdrop occurs a horde of noobs run up to the gliding down crate and wait for it to land to catch it with their faces. The gifted amateurs sneak up to the noobs wait for them to empty the crates and then ambush them. The pro waits until the amateurs are looking for the noobs then raids their base and then says in public chat ""hey *insertnamehere* when you've killed and looted *the other two guys* meet me at the spot"". Then he waits until the gunfire has ceased and kills and loots the remaining survivors in the smoldering ruins of their base.ah yes and naked people with tiny peckers and rocks everywhere.

2013-12-25,0,0,56,True,Recommended,"I read alot of the reviews before trying this game... granted it is in alpha but the polish is decent. Runs well and is fun to play. The players you tend to run into however are the primary negative. You kill a zombie and get something then get killed. You find stone (finally) then get killed. It tends to happen extremely often and so ""griefing"" as it were is extremely prevelant on servers i have played on. This however is actually the only drawback that i have really found. Someone with a shotgun chasing down people with rocks because they have nothing else better to do.Tends to negatively impact new people to the game since it becomes a fruitless and hopeless endeaver...I still continue playing it despite this however hoping that i will eventually be able to pass this point and be able to give the game the review it actually deserves. The whole concept was well designed and gameplay elements are easy to catch on to. Also because of the language and themes people discuss in chat I would not recommend this title for kids. Adults however will enjoy the survival and building elements and I urge anyone who does buy it to check out the Basic Survival Guide... ( http //play rust.wikia.com/wiki/Basic_Survival_Guide )Trust no one... and attempt to play with people you know.

2014-11-02,0,0,121,True,Recommended,Edit The thumbs down is in place due to the fact of not existing a neutral rating since the game is in early acess at the time and is being Remade so i do not know what the end result of the Remake of this game will be so a Thumbs down will have to serve its purpose for now. When the game is finally at its close to final form i will revise this review and change it accordingly please take this review as a statement of its current state at the time (2014). Unfinished game in the works i advice you to only get this game when it reaches completion stage.If you wish to support development however that is a total different story. The developers are remaking the whole game into something somewhat new and improved so we can definitely see the developers comitment to the game which is very good and it means the game will eventually be finished and not end up as another unfinished forever alpha stage game. If you intend on supporting the developers on the making and improvment of the game buy it.Edit I actually decided recently to gather some friends and play some rust again The New Rust and i just have to say i was not disapointed.The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is majorly improved i think this game might have a bright future ahead of its self.Besides i can clearly see the devs passion for their own game because the game has been given a major overhaul i believed until a few days ago that rust was still in need of work and that rust legacy was the only playable part of the rust game but i was wrong. You see the Rust (new one) is becoming something more and when look at what they made to the game the changes and everithing they added i see so much more improvment in this game than in any other survival game.The game doenst feel clunky at all even though it still has its quirkness and i feel the devs are heading into a much more modern look on the game and that is so important that we do not fall into the traps of old engines and dated mechanics that unessecerly diffult your playthrough *Cough DayZ *Cough. That being said i can assure you i had not had such a wonderfull time in game in a long time like i have been having on this one i can see how much work and sweat the devs are putting on the game and it shows in the gameplay oh and did i mention the new giant map and Gourgeous graphics and breath taking lighting effects?I will change my previous statement and say that if you buy this game you will not be left dissapointed if anything you will find yourself praising the devs from update to update even more.This is a good game with a good team behind it.Overall i recomend you buying this game the only advice ill give you is bring some friends along and that will easen your time in game you will be able to watch each others backs and you will have double the fun. Note Iam not sure about this but i have been hearing from some friends that the rust legacy servers have become rather empty so the New Rust experience is definitely the way of the future.,Rust

2013-12-15,0,0,22,True,Recommended,This game is superb. The whole survival concept is pretty cool. The crafting system is slick and easy to use. It does take a while to gather resources but it's worth once you build a masterpiece. The main map is so huge that it feels almost endless in itself. Go explore the coast a mountain range a valley or even a radioactive village. It's great to camp out with friends and build a villa with them. I would recommend playing with your Steam friends because most people on Rust are complete kosing jerks. This game does have a lot of grievers on just a warning (there are also many generous nice people). Sometimes it feels like you have to hide 24/7 to avoid being randomly killed/raided. Despite these issues Rust is a great game. I just feel like the guns and explosives don't belong in such a survival based game.,Rust

2014-02-16,0,0,623,True,Recommended,"Im just going to pull a quote from my Facebook that I posted out of shear anger to review this game For all those gamers who play RUST. Or any other game for that matter. Anybody else sick of ing bandit raiders hackers spawn killers and just general s? I've tried to be friendly the whole time I have been playing this game and I'm just ing over it all. It angers me so much. I have delved my ENTIRE weekend and more into this game only to be ed over by hackers. The one reason I actually BOUGHT the game in the first place. I used to use a cracked version and I simply couldn't anymore because there where so many ing hackers. I'M SO OVER IT. And just in case any hackers read this I hope your all know your ruining an absolutely beautiful well crafted surprisingly crisp Alpha for so many people. And I honestly hope you ing burn in hell for this It get's me more mad than anyone can conceive. I don't often spend money on a game let alone $20 on an Alpha. And I did for this one because I loved it so much. And then people not developers or bugs or any of that. PEOPLE. come along and ruin it for everyone just so they can have a ing laugh. And I know yeah I'm just ""butt hurt"" and I am But I am also just generally depressed for the future of our ever expanding population. I know hackers probably won't ever be stopped someone will only find another way to get around/combat this or that piece of code but I just hope that one day people will stop of there own doing. I hope that maybe you might share this post. Because I know there's certainly more out there like me that feel this way.For anyone that has ever been wrongly screwed over in a game. Goodnight all.I love this game so much! But until the hackers are gone. I simply cannot play it. 10/10 FOR 99.9% OF THINGSE. 100/10 FOR HACKER PROTECTION. Please fix.",Rust

2017-08-03,0,0,459,True,Recommended,"Rust is a good enough game as it is. If you like multiplayer ""survival"" games that features base building and PVP/E the I would recommend this game for you. Pros Intricate base building system. Rewarding loot system. Game is constantly improved as developers continue to work on the game. Easy to learn fast paced gameplay. Gunplay is like no other very smooth and rewarding. Always something to do in game.Cons The community is awful. You will most likely find no mercy from rival players. Unoptimized for weaker builds. The game is still early so this is a given and it is being worked on extensively. Has a heavy emphasis on cooperation. You'll have a harder time playing this by yourself than with a partner.All in all I've thoroughly enjoyed this game in my 300+ hours playing it I've had a lot of fun playing alone and with friends. It can be infuriating at times but sometimes the spark of randomness you can get from the community can be extremely hilarious. The game can be intense during gunfights or raids which is my personal drive for playing the game but can also be very frustrating when losing a battle or siege (which happens more often than I'd like to admit).Overall I would give this game a solid 8/10 as I've been a long time fan of it from 2013 I'm sure I have some level of bias.",Rust

This is difficult when hatred is rampant among the angry caveman community but assuming you haven't joined a server with 50+ active players at all times you may be all right. Get a gun get armor get medical supplies and keep them on hand whatever you do. It may seem tedious but in this game gets real very fast. Not everything works quite the way it should but enough does that the game is very fun. If you have 3 4 active friends on your server you'll be better off.Good rock. Ahem. Good luck.,Rust

2014-08-06,0,0,1108,True,Recommended,Alright lets get down to business.This is Rust a MMO for all intents and purposes. This game has alot of potential but as it stands can still be rather fun to play. Currently in the developement we have hit a rather long patch of contentlessness but keep in mind the devs of this game are being very transparent about their wook on their website so there is no lack of information for the community. That being said lets get down to where this game stands today.This game is basically a sandbox pvp survival with a few interesting twists. We started off with zombies as our main enemy/resource and have now changed to irradiated animals which are also placeholders like their mobs before them. Your mission is simple survive and thrive. Other players will be fighting for the same resources you are and will likely kill you for them as well. Your only hope of survival is to kit yourself with plenty of food armor and weapons. This is where things get fun.The player interaction is very diverse from person to person. There are alot of bandits and every player has killed another one for one reason or another whether it be out of self defense or out of greed. There are however alot of....shall I say interesting sub cultures that pop up? One of them being the religion of The Master Torch. There are also people who try to pull off things like RustMart and it is exactly how it sounds. Others try to creat small player towns to invite others to join as there is deffinately safety in numbers. At the end of the day though most players first experience in the game is cold hungry and scared.First day.Your first day in Rust is going to be confusing. What do I kill? Where do I sleep? How do I get better? Those are some of the many questions you will ask. You will need to find a pig and kill it for food and cloth in order to make armor food and later on a bow. Your next task is getting wood so you can craft fires and shelters as well as the base components for alot of your weapons. You will also need metal which you get from rocks as well as rocks themselves. These are the most basic of materials you will need as you progress through the game the fun part is keeping them without being hunted down.Survival.You will need to avoid bears wolves and players to keep the things you find. Harder than it sounds. The most unsetteling feeling in this game is hearing gun shots in the distance. That simply means there is someone that has the means and probably the will to murder you for your wood and resources and you should get out of that area ASAP. You will need to make a house not a shack and get yourself a metal door as well to keep others out of your things. Wooden shacks and doors can be broken by tools while metal needs explosives.Breakdown.This game is great as it is but without the other game mechanics added that have been planned by the dev this game gets old after you reach the top of the food chain. Its deffinately a fun play but I would hold out until the next content update at the very least as that will be changing the base code of the game and allowing the devs to once again put out content updates regularly. If alpha games are not for you wait to see where this one goes as this is VERY much alpha right now and will change drastically over the next year.,Rust

I started off wanting the old legacy back but in actual fact I think I speak for most people when I say the new Rust is a lot better. If I could play this Rust (with the building guns features etc) on the legacy map then I would switch in a heart beat but the fact every world is unique and generates new seeds (much like Minecraft) is pretty awesome to explore.The developers work extreamely hard to release more and more content each and every week. Every thursday patches come out and they are all filled with a lot of content. This game is without a doubt the best survival currently on the market so if it looks like your kind of thing and you haven't already got it give it a try! you wont regret it.Graphics 9/10Optimisation 10/10 (Run 60fps on higher settings and it looks amazing)Developers 10/10 (they couldnt really do more than they are they have released 75 updates since the experimental came out.. that's a lot) 31/08/2015Verdict 9.6/10 Highly reccomended.,Rust

You can make some friends around by sharing a small thing or make enemies by cutting a single tree near their houses. People raid each other's houses at night so you need to find a solution to slow them or stop them. We've a little settlement to protect each other.

2016-08-18,1,2,1426,True,Recommended,"Three years ago I downloaded Rust not knowing my life would actually change...My first exposure to Rust was VERTiiGOS biggest rust raid cam ever. I was then exposed to many youtubers however I always LOVED the raid cams. I wanted to build the biggest base ever! I would wake up in the middle of the night with an idea of how to build it and write it down. I thought about it over and over embedding it in my brain failure wasn't an option. I download Rust (I was very stupid didn't understand anything about actual game mechanics) and joined the first server I saw. Looking back it was highly modded. I started off with the name ""Bow n' Arrow Master."" First day in game built a mini base log back in the next day raided. So I began to ""hide"" loot rather than build an actual base. I then moved into the old caves never built in them just had a lot of boxes etc at the bottom. I would literally farm for 8 11 hours a day my furnaces never stopped running. Before I knew it I had a neighbor another very active player who joined every day 30 mins before I got on. He kept killing me non stop when I was trying to transfer loot or farm so I raged HARD! To this day if you go back to vettiigos early videos you can still see the comments I left trying to mass recruit to pick axe raid the guy. (Had zero blueprints didn't know how to research) After a while the guys base was my dream base. At least 25 some stories tall all armored first three floors jaw dropping. So I kept going over trying to be friends. At this point I randomly said ""amigos si or no"" and he responded ""si."" I learned he didn't speak a word of English he was from Spain. We became friends by using google translate and some very basic verbal Spanish. We would literally stay out in the open standing still full geared with farm switching from Rust to google translate. We had a bond protected each other. We moved in together from hatread to love. Eventually one day the server ""wiped"" (didn't know that was a thing) and everything gone never talked to the guy again because I didn't know steam friends were a thing.What I wholeheartedly believe makes Rust special is the memories you make. You can work with anyone across the globe put in work and build memories unlike any game on the market. I see people who quit Rust and comments say stuff like ""Man I miss the good old days never forgotten."" Rust gets your heart pumping words can't describe the feelings you get. That's what Rust lacks now. People would rather roof camp than interact. Clans are successful because all members combined efforts for the same goal no update will slow them down. When I see people say Rust is dead it literally breakers my heart all the rages all the hours of farming all the laughter memories nothing can take away! LONG LIVE RUST!!!",Rust

There are a lot of servers to pick from with different rules sets so finding one you like should be easy. Just stay away from the official servers unless you want to learn the hardway and be harrassed by hackers.,Rust

2017-01-23,1,2,214,True,Recommended,"Amazing game. It has maybe the most toxic community but you do SIGN UP for this sh*t when you buy the game. If you do buy the game that means you're into that kind of stuff. The game is all about gathering some friends building together a base and then raid the sh*t out of everyone else and counter raid. Of course you can spend time on other servers with different gameplays ( such as Battle Royale which came from Arma 3 and is now the most part of the gameplay on H1Z1 ) or you could just hit up some modded servers to gather faster build faster raid faster. Don't be downvoting the game after you've spent 1000+ fu*king hours on it just ""because"". I repeat you sign up for this sh*t. Play it enjoy it write a good review for those 1000+ fu*king hours that you've had fun on and when the time comes and you've grown tired of the game just let it go just hit the fu*king *DELETE LOCAL FILES* and go live a happy life. All in all it's an amazing game with nice gameplay and ideas ( personally I freaking love to build stuff in Rust ) and you should buy it ONLY IF you're into it. Be adviced it's better when you don't play alone and kind of sh*tty when you are a lone wolf. But have no fear! There are servers for lone wolves aswel.",Rust

2014-01-05,0,0,127,True,Recommended,As an Early Access game Rust may push away certain audiences as the game is incomplete with more than a few bugs hackers and an apparent weakness to DDOS'ers. However putting the $20 into the game allows one to mark the significant changes that are made as it shifts and evolves with the community. Patience skill and luck is needed to survive the onslaught and to establish oneself in this open world survivor crafting game.The game really shines once you begin to understand the lay of the land the tendencies of people to loot specific areas and how to exploit peoples kindness or their ego. Crafting and building a house is risky and rewarding. It's fantastic to see how well a bit of thought goes in protecting valuables and one's own sleeping body. The combat is beyond satisfying allowing for constant replayability and the hilarity of clan based raiding or griefing will keep you coming back. Finding your first pistol or C4 charge will give you a huge buzz. Decisions of whether to shoot and kill that player to gain their gear while possibly drawing other players or to conserve ammo bring a similar feeling to DayZ.However the lack of things to do beyond PVP or crafting may push people away as the frustration of constant deaths and being unable to establish themselves hinders the full enjoyment of the game (Seeing things from the other perspective). The atmosphere isn't one of creepiness or desolation rather one of open exploration and 'should I kill this person' which again may be offputting.The game is constantly evolving and new things are added often. The developers are constantly in communication with the community to add new and improved features. It's definitely worth the $20. As someone who has tracked it since closed Alpha I will continue to jump on with my mates and pick a few fights build a few forts and get involved in a fantastic indie development title.,Rust

2015-05-03,0,0,84,True,Not Recommended,This game is pretty fun for the first few days. However it becomes extremely evident how limited it is after that. If you are a person that enjoys playing alone or in a small group 5 people I would highly suggest not playing on an official server. You have ZERO potential to make a meaningful stand against the 20+ member gangs that go around and raid everything in sight.You either have to join these gangs or simply play on a low pop server.I can see the potential this game has but it's at a really tricky spot at the moment. The game has little balance and less administration (on official servers).Is it worth the price at this very moment? No. Can I see the developers improving this game in the future? Yes.If you have $20 to blow and just want a few days of fun this game is for you. If you think you're going to get more than a weeks worth of replay value I would highly advise you to wait it out and continue to follow it's development.,Rust

2016-07-07,0,0,1518,True,Recommended,This game is more than just a survival game. This game creates friendship and gather people together socialy. I've created alot of friends during playing this game and it at that point where this game is a day thing for me just like being on Facebook and other social media. The game itself could use some twigs here and there but overall its just a great game with the survival and the intense pvp action there is. You will never feel your heart beat harder in any other game (you with a bad heart you might skip this and watch youtube videos with the gameplay). Anyway this game is my most favored game and the best game I've ever played in my lifetime (22 years old). The only thing that's down side of this game is the KOS and that made me reconsider how I play this game I'm now the most friendliest guy on servers and often create alliance and yes have been betrayed a few or several times but that's just what it would be in real life you never know who to trust. I play on modded servers cause of the grinding level on Vanilla servers are just too harsh for me as a grown man with a full time job which means I often fall far far behind other people (Not that its a race for AK's and compounds it's just a bit unfair for a solo player). The new XP sytem that's coming out today (7th July 2016) Is gonna be the greatest update ever cause solo players don't have to settle near a monument to get blueprints anymore and hey maybe people will giveout free tools for a solo player in order to give both side an advantage. I highly recommend this game.,Rust

One thing is the same we all want to win. And that's what makes Rust so unique. Everyone who you meet is differnet whether it is where they are from how they speak or even their personality. So you may have one partner who is a chill American while the next is a stressed out Asain. The thing is it's always fun no matter what. So just remember to have an open mind when you join that first server and remember this one thing. Rust never stays.,Rust

2016-07-09,3,2,457,True,Recommended,I love this game I really do. But the #1 issue is with KoS. Everyone and I mean everyone kills on sight everything that moves. Even if you just spawned on the beach get ready to get capped in the head with a bolty. I don't know what started it but it's because everyone else does it. Everyone does it so to stand a chance everyone new has to do it too. But we can change that as a community we don't have to stick with that mentality. Especially with the XP system rewarding you for being nice STOP SHOOTING NAKES give them a hatchet and reap the rewards instead. It's going to benefit you much more. #MakeRustGreatAgain #NakedLivesMatter #NOKoS,Rust

2017-06-29,0,0,785,True,Recommended,I would say I really like Rust I'ts fun it's fast paced and it's multiplayer which means you can make your own goals or story you would like to make. For example You could decide to be friends with a rust player or you could make him a slave. It's up to you to make the story and what you do in it. It's a highly addictive game and offers hours of gameplay in one sitting. And although I think it's done well and I like it I don't think it's a perfect game. There is way to much game changing updates that could change the way you play and the game is still in early access even after Legacy. I really do like Rust and have not been playing for too long but even through my almost a year of experience I can tell you it's not perfect. Those looking for help on your first day good luck. Rust is a game where you learn how to play by yourself. And if you are intrested in a friendly community you won't find that here either. Most players kill on sight and will raid you for and giggles so just try to have common sense when building in Rust and where to build your base. Even though it's not perfect and still is in early access and can kind of run like I love it to death. It's one of my favorite games to play on a boring day and can also offer hilarious moments. This is what makes the game great and makes it a thrill to play. And It's not top quality but it does it's job. I would totally reccomend this to players who are looking for a game to get together with friends and laugh your asses off (Or rage if you are being raided.). I hope you find this review helpful!

2014-01-23,0,0,77,True,Recommended,It's one thing to survive in a large open world against zombies and other people constantly on the move and grabbing resources. It's something else entirely when you have to buckle down in a base and defend it whilst trying to pull off equally effective offensives on anyone labelling you their enemy.At the moment Rust's PvP seems to be the focus of the game and they've pulled it off well. Actually surviving is easy to do alone or in a group.My first experience on Rust was me trying to find my friends while I had no clue what I was doing. It got boring after a little bit however after my second attempt I found them. It got really fun after that. Playing with a group of friends will bring the best out of Rust along with finding more people to either Journey with or Destroy because they bashed you with a rock.Is Rust worth $20?I'd buy it if I had atleast a small group of people to play with I wouldn't end up purchasing it for this price to play alone.Rating 7/10Main concerns about Rust?A lot people tend to be immature about the game and not so much 'take it too seriously' but just be pissbags in or out of Rust because you've killed them or raided them. It seems to me that it's difficult for people to admit defeat and not to everyone. For example I was based with some friends about 4 5 others. I was the only one on when we were raided by what seemed to be 15 or so people (but was apparently 8+). I kinda laughed and pointed out that it was 'cute' that it took over 20 minutes to get into a base with one person defending it. On the other hand people whine about dying at the hands of someone who said they're friendly and then just make an argument out of it involving other people.It just gets annoying to watch people all the time but on the other hand it's hella fun blowing their brains away.Anyway here is one moment I've had in Rust where I've killed someone (it's rather amusing to me) https //www.youtube.com/watch?v XtXWETDfDLI,Rust

2014-07-07,0,0,222,True,Recommended,Very very fun game to play with friends.... but if you don't like games that are timeconsuming and frustating sometimes you'll probably stop playing after a few hours.This is a game based of the sourceengine so it can run on low systems too very well but obviously the graphics are not that good. But that's okay in a game like rust because the important part is the crafting building and fighting.But in this game you gotta watch out for a LOT of cheaters abusive admins and for the most time .. if you don't like this game is probably nothing you should try DBut it has a huge potential.... like the devs say this game is only 1% of what could be and it's already very good.So I definetly recommend trying it... Have fun playing it D,Rust

2014-01-29,0,0,761,True,Recommended,In my first day of the game I was mercilessly hunted taunted trapped and killed by various groups of individuals some of them naked some of them clothed.Oddly it was a lot of fun. Once I figured out how to craft things and how to hunt down my own poor victims the game got a lot better. It takes a bit of getting used to and the hackers are a massive problem that needs to be rectified as soon as possible. My best experience would probably have been solo raiding a massive base escaping with just over 10 HP and then being hit with a rock by a newly spawned player and losing everything. At least it made his day.PROS Player interaction sometimes scary mostly fatal.Crafting lots of weapon options for people to steal from meLarge map with all sorts of crazy stuff Bears zombies wolves chickens rabbits pigs and naked men.Price Well worth it for $20. CONS Shooting on sight not the one.Hacking Every server I've played has had at least a few hackers or so come by makes life difficult.,Rust

2014-02-01,0,0,61,True,Recommended,Rust is a peculiar game. The best way I can describe it is like if Minecraft had a brief but passionate fling with Fallout 3.Your first day as the video helpfully demonstrates involves running naked around a large irradiated field hitting pigs with rocks to mine their bodies for cloth blood fat and chicken fillets.You can then plonk down a crude shack and a door and live in bliss until someone else runs up with some C4 and blows your door off to steal all your precious chicken.You can then make bigger houses. Huge towering tributes to your own vanity that survey the far reaches of your domain.The feeling of invunerability is strong at this point but you're always only so far away from someone blowing the doors off your mansion and stealing your stuff.The first time I ever met another player it was like hostage negotiation with every move being scrutinised for hostile intent. Happily he just wanted to test his microphone and gave me cloth trousers for my help.Later I gave him a laser sight and he paid me back by having all his friends kill me and steal my precious chicken resources.We have a blood feud now.All in all I recommend the game because you will all get stories like this. You might be the aggressor or you might be the victim but this game is pretty much a 1 1 simulator of what would happen if you ended society tomorrow.I would like to see more stuff be implemented in the game like some sort of discoverable reason for the island to exist or what happened to make it like that or your purpose there.All in all intriguing and addictive.,Rust

2014-06-18,0,0,1299,True,Recommended,I bought this game in early january and I must say it was a great purchase. There is a lot of potential in this game and it has a variety of good qualities. I loved the constant weekly updates and even though that isn't the case now I understand the developers hard work on the experimental server that is currently taking place. So since I have over 300 hours of gameplay I'll run through the specific reasons as to why I love this game and why I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a new experience as well. 1. You spawn in with the bare essentials but the resources to make yourself efficent and ready to survive are very close to you. 2. the map is big enough and small enough (if that makes since) to have a enjoyable and easy to understand experience as you try to find towns and create shelters hidden from other players. 3. You can make your own group to survive and explore for both safety and to raid people. 4. As I mentioned in number 3 you can Raid people who have bases I mean how awesome is that?!? to me its pretty awesome... but along with the pros there are cons and I'll spell those out for you1. lack of care for hackers in public servers. There is a abundance of hackers in public servers that even face punch's anti cheat can't get rid of and it needs to be addressed.2. if you are on a private server be aware of admin abuse. Its happen to me quite often but its never truly sucked out the enjoyment of the game since I can just change servers.3. lag spikes occur. I understand it could be mainly due to the fact that this game is early access so I'll make the judgement call on that when its out of early access.Overall its a great game even though I have been killed many times due to kevlar geared jerks who shoot first and ask questions later.....wait no they don't ask questions.,Rust

2014-02-02,0,0,390,True,Recommended,"Bears bark likes wolves and taste like chicken. 10/10 would cook bear chicken meat again.That aside the game is really fun in it's current form and with the redesign on the way and getting closer to completion it's looking to be a very interesting game! Base design is simple yet extremely useful and allowing for some pretty complex designs gunplay is a little tricky at times but overall fairly good (most servers I find have insta P250's so not a whole lot of weapon variation in shootouts but more shootouts in general leading to a ""shoot on sight and take belongings"" mentality). Crafting is done in a great way no needing to arrange recipes you only need to have the correct amount of materials and the actual blueprint learned for rarer items to give players some endgame content.A lot of item variation which will likely spiral upwards when the new version comes out of redesign but there are some items and clothes that share models. The art style is simple yet detailed allowing for a good looking game without sacrificing a lot of performance. The same audio is used for a number of animals but overall offers some good sounds and is quite useful when listening for gunshots and their origins. The music is a bit repetitive and there is little ambient noise but it is an early access game after all. For an early access game very promising. Check out the dev blog and get a good look at the upcoming content as it's looking terrific. Gameplay is smooth great base customization and lots of raiding.Visual 4 / 5Audio 4 / 5Gameplay 4 / 5Content 5 / 5OVERALL 8.5 / 10",Rust

2014-08-27,0,0,377,True,Recommended,One of the best games that can be a bit addicting! The only issue with this game is the hackers and Garry Newman failing to updating the game. That's why there is another game coming out that he just made called Experimental Rust. Good graphics but I hope I can get used to the whole concept of the game and what not to the new UI (User Interface) Hud and what not.The only thing that makes me upset is that it is generated and it's easy to get lost. Yes you can use your things around you to help you but like I said it is a random generated map! So you would need to know the map before anything and that is a huge problem! I wanted vehicles to be added in the game and hopefully it happens...Only time will tell! You can keep updated for the latest info on the new developing rust coming soon. Possibly will be fully developed and ready to fully play in September... I just wish there was so much more for this game! If they added a 3rd party anti cheat into the game then there probably wouldn't be hackers! I mean Garry made a fortune from the develope this game and made a lot more then what he made with GMOD!I would give this game a 10/10. If it had better anti cheat.But honestly the rate would be a 9/10 (Your hours will go by with this game but your fun gets ruined by s)The new rust coming out... I would give it a 7/10 by far considering there are still bugs.For $20 it is a worth to buy though.Buy at your own Risk ),Rust

Suddenly we heard footsteps and someone starts breaking down our wooden door. My friend then kindly requests them to stop it and leave us alone. They don't stop. We then grab our amazing hunting bows and open the door. Arrows fly through the air and shots are being fired. We then close the door again and ask them what they want from us. ""We want your stuff"" is the answer. We ask them what they want and the reply is ""animal fat open the door throw some outside and we'll leave"". My friend opens the door throws some of the animal fat out and shuts the door. ""Thank you!"" we hear as they leave us alone. This kind of interaction really made my day.

2015-05-14,0,0,559,True,Recommended,The only thing this game needs is a better Anti cheat system and I'd give this game a 10/10That said there are plenty of awesome servers in RUST but there are some that abuse their admin powers by teleporting people around and by giving people items (like AKs) and ammo. But I've only experienced this on one server so far. Other than that. This game is gold I never really enjoyed the survival genre and games like DAYZ have left a bad taste in my mouth. But this game this game changed my opinion completely. I never played RUST in it's earlier development but the game I've played is amazing and well done and Gary has been pushing the updates out left and right for this game. That said this game is probably close to full release. Pros+Crafting system is easy to learn+Looting system is simple. Break barrels get blueprints and loot.+Air Drops adds an interesting dynamic+Gathering isn't tedious when playing solo+Easy to get a base going when playing solo+KoS is not a main tactic in this game. +One half of the community isn't toxicCons Some servers have crap admins One half of the community is as toxic as Dota Needs better anti cheat,Rust

At least you have a rock and a torch most of the times.The torch might as well throw it out trust me you don't want any attention when you are the new guy.The rock on other hand is good to chop trees stones and heads specially if the owner of that head has more stuff than you and if he's sleeping even better!Then you do an beatiful house and start getting stronger. After that you start raiding other people and get that loot. After you realize that has passed around 10/12h since you've been there and it's already 9h in the morning with work at 9h30 you realize that you really have to go.Return home open Rust discover you have been raided rage at the game a while spend more 12h to craft c4 to raid the entire server.

2014-06-20,0,0,67,True,Recommended,I got this game around 2 weeks ago with a friend. The first day we got the game we attempted meet each other. We spent 3 hours trying. As we finally got to a landmark we would soon after get shot dead and have to try again. I somehow made friends with a person along my travels and set up a base with him. Soon after my friend met up with me but when we logged off we died and would have to find each other again so i gave up on that server.On the 2nd server i played i met another person who was friendly (oddly enough the people who i randomly make alliances with are actually friendly and have yet to betray me). My new ally and i traveled for another few hours to get to his base which is in a great location that i won't reveal. So after many deaths and attempts we started expanding base and my friend came on. We spent about 3 hours the 1st day but gave up since he just had no luck... The next day he was late and i started talking with the ally i made from 1st server. He decided to join server i was playing on and only after 2 hours I got him back to base. My friend took another 3 hours to finally get to base and i yelled at him to make a sleeping bag. We got another ally thanks to ally from 1st server. So my group is 5 people strong.A key goal in rust would be to trust nobody because of paranoia. Anyone can be armed with any type of weapon so nobody wants to take a chance to meet a skilled player who is just gathering without anything on. So a common event when you meet a player is avoid them or kill at sight. A good amount of reviews says the game is not noob friendly and it isn't. The main goal at first is to set up a base in a good location where you can easily find but not near much people. The next goal then would be gathering supplies and building up your base. If you get a friend you know in person to join your other chances of gaining allies online increases. Then your pace of gathering and hunting increases. And finally you can live out the rest of your life in rust without as much worries as other players. Helpful advice The landmarks in the original rust may be really helpful but never build a base close to them because those bases are often raided compared to others that are hidden a good distance away but can still reach the landmarks within a few minutes.,Rust

2014-03-23,0,0,247,True,Recommended,"I was fairly disappointed with Rust not because of the game itself I think it s a great idea but the servers are SO FULL OF hackers it get annoying really fast. In the current state its difficult to recommend this game I know it s an early release and it is still alpha the game is enjoyable and there is a lot of things to do but here lays my other concern there is not a lot of resources on the map it takes forever to get enough rock to craft something useful (not to mention all the other resources) and it s so easy to get lost in the map I literally walked until I died of hunger didn't see a single animal boulder or player (on a server with 80 ppl connected) turns out I was on the edge of the map but there was nothing to tell me that resources should be scattered even at the edges. I also dislike the idea of people being able to create stuff in front of your door this happened to me on a PVE server just got locked in my shelter by someone that built a wall in front of my door... I am not sure if this is cheating or a bug on the game.also the people that play this... DAMN! they are ruthless sure I found a few guys that were ""friendly"" but mostly because they didn't have a shotgun (or gun) it seems once anyone gets a gun they just wat to kill other players... full of PVP no fun on exploring or crafting.I would still recommend the game because it is fun but be prepared to deal with a ton of cheaters and lose in a few seconds all the resources that took hours to gather ) so if that is not your thing stay away from this until its matured.",Rust

Maybe not something for the casual players or those that want a friendly chat and build but that's the whole amusment for me at least I go around being afraid and on my toes and the slightest sound makes me jump in my chair and get ready to fight to keep my stuff!

2015-11-06,3,2,68,True,Recommended,"Sit down ladies and gentlemen let me tell you a story.Once upon a time a lonley noob logged onto his first server the great London III Test server to be precise. I never left this world but instead began my time mingling with the local flora and fauna once mauled by a bear in the dead of night as I was escaping from angry Russians with Assualt rifles and another gunned down by an angry helicopter as I inspected by loot stolen from the corpse of an unsuspecting man.I started with my small 2 x 2 hut which lasted the staggering time of 27 minutes before I was beaten to death by angry men with rocks Note to self I really must get a lock for that door. They took my Wilson torch stone hatchet blueprints and hammer then disappeared into the night.Lurking around on chat I found an active community whom deemed me friendly I joined them only to discover they were actively at war with another ""clan"" the lonely noob was cast into a great battle and was soon geared and ready for combat!It ended in a hail of gunshots and looked like a scene from Mafia as my body was thrown against a stone wall from the sheer quantity of Thompson bullets hitting my frail body. I respawned in my bed aptly named ""Liquids S**g sack"" and collected my meagre belongings they team assisted me in taking a small and poorly guarded home on the airfield for myself. I joined with a few other solo'ers as we crafted and reinforced our little part in the world we sent out supply runners and traded with the larger clans all whilst maintaining good relations with the other server dwellers.The day before the wipe everything changed. Darkness fell that night as usual I sat atop my tower with a team of three we waited for the sunrise but little did we know we would be cast into a recreation of the purge. It started small a few skirmishes here and there the odd burst of gunfire or stray arrow but soon out outer wall was slowly chipping away. The Russians had found us and they were determined to get in I moved around silently on our upper tower and peaked around only to be met by the sound of my skull crushing under the weight of a finely timed rifle shot. I respawned quickly at the tower sleeping bag and retrieved my equipment shaking I moved around to the lower firing platform and thats where I saw them several members scatted on the rocks I look aim FIRE! I direct hit his wails could be heard and my position was met by a barrage of fire. Wood splinted and the stone clanged as the air was filled with lead we had lost the base the encampment that has stood the test of time but in the end we were undermanned and out gunned.My allies fell and with no local sleeping bags made were banished to the unknown of the darkness.A messaged appeared in the chat ""We are coming."" Our saviours had arrived the local smaller groups had combined into a roving kill party to assist us. As I sit under my stone stairs bandaging my wounds the cackles of fire eminated from outside the rumbles of F1 granades the sound of whizzling lead and the thrum of arrows was all around. Dirty bloody and glorious.The fire fight died down outside I crept towards the sniping perch and peered out. It was done we were victorious. We lost some brothers in arms but the day was won I ran down stairs to greet my new brothers opening my airlocks and reaching the front door. The door flew open as the electronic lock pinged the team had assembled outside I walked to towards them and ... BANG. BANG. I fell to the floor screaming and bleeding. The voice chat icon appeared ""We are sorry"" they stepped over my body and began looting my gatehouse. So ended my Rust adventure.The treacherous ""allies"" will fall I swear this. The first light dawned on a fresh server wipe I look out upon my new grassy home. I smile. ""Soon.""TLDR Best Business simulator ever.",Rust

2015-02-21,1,2,2243,True,Recommended,For those of you that enjoy PVP and have you and your friends clash with opposing clans. For those of you who like to build monsterous bases in exotic locations. For those of you that like the adrenaline pumping though your veins as you heist everything your beaten opponent had on them when they met with you in the heat of combat. Overall this game has it all and given me endless of hours of fun gameplay. Each server offers a different terrain seed to build in and spar in with other bloodthirsty cutthroat players. Each world encounter gets your senses heightened as everything you've done since leaving the safety of your base is up for grabs upon your untimely demise. The risk / reward factor of this game alone makes it worthwhile. Despite having a few hiccups cause its still in alpha I'm extremely hyped to see what they do or how it evolves before its done.,Rust

That being said once the Devs have the issues at hand worked out and the game running smoothly there is enormous potential for growth in this game.Only a small portion of the map is currently being used and the content thus far is limited even so the game is totally adicttive and lots of fun.The intuitive crafting system drives players to gather and adventure around the current playable map which has rewards and dangers at every turn.The gane is also very socially oriented and allows for players to team up and work together to accomplish gathering crafting and building goals.Although it is frustrating that the game is currently experiencing issues to the point of unaccessability/unplayability those of us that have experienced sucessful game play thus far are elated.I am at least!!

2017-06-30,0,0,1403,True,Not Recommended,"This game used to be an obsession for my friends and I. We all have well over 1 000 hours a piece. Every Thursday wipe we would be on refreshing waiting for the updates to hit so we can start playing on a new wipe as soon as possible. We loved the game. Then came the much maligned twig update...No longer do we play this game. Not because the twig update makes it impossible for anyone to play without being in a large clan (if you want to play on a server that has a decent population). Not because bases were basically made irrelevant. Not even because the gamer base of this game is the most toxic of any game. We quit because the Devs who treat the people who have given them money to make this game like are s and are totally disconnected from what their fanbase want in this game. I mean they have already scrapped the game and started over from scratch once before so that should tell you the Devs have no clue how to make this game good. Do the Devs try and fix the HUGE hacker problem? No they introduce mailboxes to a game that is mostly clan vs clan and PvP...mailboxes...Do the Devs fix animals being able to glitch through walls or scale sheer cliffs? No they introduce a spinning wheel for...some purpose I guess.It is if the Devs think Rust is about role playing and being friendly and not about a harsh post apocalyptic survival scenario where you and your friends have to outwit everyone around you in base design or tactics. The Devs are clueless and the way they announce their updates is condescending to the player base. ""You don't want to RP and actually want us to fix this game? YOU. People can now easily build into your base you spent so much time making."" The Devs.Tl dr?

2014-01-31,0,0,37,True,Recommended,Rust. A perfect example of one of the most popular games like DayZ and Minecraft mixed together to form a survival world with supreme graphics using the Unity engine. In Rust you can either team up or go alone or maybe become a bandit. Be careful who you team up with because some people will decide to go ape**** and turn on you if you know what I mean. Besides the pvp the game itself is fun and so many things to explore craft and build your own foundation/home. The world is massive and there are sometimes rare airdrops for you to find some things in supply crates. 1 more thing You can also hunt for bears boars wolves zombies deer rabbit and chicken. Now when I first played the game it kinda made me uncomfortable along the way due to the lack of resources scattered around the map. But if you knew where to luck well your in luck then. The game is best suited with a companion or friend. Hope you guys find this review useful! 8.7 out of 10,Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,190,True,Recommended,During whatever amount of time I have spent in this game running through the vast forest and trying to avoid any unknown person I came across I learned one thing. Go In With Friends. It should be one of the golden rules while just starting in this game. I went in with a friend that had two others by his side. They found each other almost immediately after spawning while I was left behind in the desolate waste. I ran like most would do. I hunted to maintain myself alive until I cross pass with someone from my friends group. In the time I was searching my friend had made a large base organized a militia and started a war with a rival group (adding to this was that one group was led by Batman and the other was led by Bane ). All of Bane s militia was instructed to let me live and to lead me to their base. Even with an entire militia keeping an eye out for me I was still lost to them. The chat would explode with complaints of a self proclaimed warlord emperor. This person this Thug would enforce his laws add men to his side and protect them with his wrath. This Thug was a hacker. He was the first I had ever come across. And if I recall correctly he was the first to ever kill me in the game. Freshly spawned learning the controls and running around in the middle of the night and then I hear the shot a bolt action from the black skies. A flying man with a gun and a hunger for naked caveman flesh. After dying many times being trapped finding an abandoned house and spending one night then 3 men came whispering open the door as they banged on my door with rocks laughing. I was pleading to my friend to come to my rescue with some of his militia but to no avail. I was with no clothes and only had a hand cannon then quickly crafted a pipe shotgun opened the door blasted the first away then came in the others carrying one revolver and they took my newly found home. I was devastated and tried to kill them when I spawned again in the same location. They killed me again. Thankfully they missed my sleeping bag and I remained there empty. Tired of the same experience I left that server and found an empty one. I went in made my home and invited my friend. We started making our fort gathering supplies and looting the spawning sites. He invited one of his friends and we built together until the server was wiped. We came back to nothing abandoned that server.After the last server we found a small one owned by a fellow player. My friend the one I first came into the game with had built his base with members of his old militia. Finding them was again the main objective of the first part of the game. Until one random encounter with him completely by random. After that we built made allies enemies and stockpiled weapons and resources until we had a giant base with multiple people armed to the teeth manning the guard post. We raided made many player abandon the server because they ve lost everything. We were kings all we had to do was kill anyone that looked like they were organized. We were bandits warlords merciless thugs. We took what we wanted and never left anything for anyone to find only the hollow husk of what remained of the house. In the end my advice is to go in with friends. Always stick by them. Try to never cross them and organize yourself.It's a cool game and has TONS OF FORESKIN. 11/10,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,52,True,Recommended,"This game... Honestly is interesting and very immersive and to make it even more interesting it has the mechanics of DayZ and Minecraft into it and is more of a Survival aspect.Now one thing you should do first is read a Tutorial before you jump in because if you rather decide to simply download the game and expect everything to go smooth sailing then boy are you in for a surprise.Another thing that really stood out to me is the immense size of the community and just how many servers there are to join and how many people there are to meet as well as the building aspect of the game.Now I am going to mainly list the Pro's and Con's of this game.Pro's You will enjoy the game A LOT IF you know what you are doing. The Survival and Building aspect of the game makes it fun The amount of servers and different people you can meet is mind blowing.Con's You might want to make friends fast because if you don't you better prepare to eat some bullets. Sometimes there are hackers that join mostly the ""Official"" Servers and they F*ck up pretty bad.So.... This is my Review.I hope this helped and I hope to see you in the game as soon as possible.P.S Don't forget to watch a tutorial before playing this game.",Rust

Home sweet home here I come.Day 4. Air doesn't seem so fresh anymore. Probably because Rocky and Torchy are my only companions on this journey.Day 5. Some creepy cops came along and asked for my ID. I bashed their heads in with Rocky.Day 6. Creepy guy asks if I want a slave and gear. I steer clear from him.Day 7. I bash his head in whi st he sleeps. He should get more creative. Why make your lock code 0000?Day 8. Built a campsite and a sleeping bag. I'll need to fortify around it so I can live here.Day 9. Built first foundations of my house. Will finish with stone walls and a roof soon.Day 10. As I walk out into the wilderness I find a relative of Rocky. He calls himself Guru Rockith. He's a wise and floating rock. I must learn the ways of Rock jitsu from him. It's the only way I'll survive.Day 11. First trial of Rock Jitsu is to climb this mountain via this way that is the sheer drop way.Day 12. Creepy guy up there. Seems friendly though so I won't go on him with Rocky and Torchy and bash his skull in.Day 13. I am reminded of Newton's laws. What comes up must come down. Rock Jitsu is harder than i thought. Rock hard.Day 14. The creepy guy came back. Today I scaled Rock mountain. I have finished the first trial. Come at me Rock Jitsu.Day 15. I must go down without hurting myself at all. Trial 2 here I come.Day 16. I fell. I'm going to die here. Goodbye Rocky Torchy. I hope you have a good life without me.And so ends the chronicles of Charry the survivor of a plane crash. He met many people on the way. Nearly all seem to have fallen to their knees from Rocky's incessant bashing of their occipitals. Karma seems to have finally caught up with him.Rocky Survived as did TorchyThey were old but not out of it.Rocky became a supreme Rock Jitsu master.and Torchy became the King's Army Commander for the Torch Rebellion against the Rocks. Torchy and Rocky eventually wed after the war as they had defected both their sides to finish it. The war ended in an Armistice. Torchy and Rocky live happily in their cottage on what is now known as Easter Island. Charry of course did not know this as Easter Island was not yet named. His skeleton can also be found there right next to a cliff.,Rust

There are all types of servers with very different types of gameplay.3) Don't stay on a server that doesn't fit your style. You will enjoy the game more when you find the right server for you.4) Set up your mic/headseat.5) Make friends or die alone.In RUST everything tastes like chicken!,Rust

2014-02-18,0,0,163,True,Recommended,Have you ever played a game called minecraft? Have you ever wanted something more out of it? Say guns wild animals and a heart pounding sense of realism and fear as you fight to keep what is yours? Then look into Rust I personally love this game because it combines a few key features of two of my favorite games and it does it well. Take the randomness of minecraft and a similar building style and combine it with the sneaky survivalist approach of Dayz and you essentially get Rust. If your into free open world games that combines survival and building along with teaming up with your friends to protect what youve built from pesky bandits and defending yourself against all sorts of creatures then buy this game. Not going to sugar coat it this game can be VERY DIFFICULT but the challenge makes it very rewarding. If you die dont get discouraged it can be most difficult first starting out and even have head banging frusteration when you seem to be getting a hold of the game and you are killed or take a wrong step on a mountain and go all the way back to square 1. NOTE THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. But is loads of fun and challenging for even the most survival savy and you will be amazed at what you can do in this game and how you can start playing it and look up and its been 4 hours just like that. And did i mention (as of this review) its only in alpha? So if your into the challenge of a hardcore survival game and want to see what your made of then go and buy it now well worth the 20 bucks for me.,Rust

2016-12-17,0,0,1609,True,Recommended,I see all these reviews ing about the KoS community and how the game is nothing but a cancer. This couldnt be further from the truth. It's a survival game and everyone is out to do the same thing survive. If you're solo don't build next door to a big clan. If you and your friend are partially geared don't take pot shots with your SAR at a fully geared group with bolts and AK's. You have to lay low and farm bits at a time. There are still the trolls as with any game but they aren't that hard to deal with.I have played Rust solo in a small group and in a medium sized group. Rust is a fickle mistress. Some times she will let everything go your way other times you'll be rage quitting 6 7 times a day. The dev's listen to the community and try to better the game with frequent patches. In the span of a year they've tried the blueprint system xp system and the component system. It is still in early access and I can imagine there will be a lot more changes to come. Garry Helk and the FP crew are active in the online Rust communities listening and responding to what people have to say about the game.The game itself is great. Graphics are nice gameplay is fun and there are a lot of active servers up at all times. The modding community is pretty large and there is a lot of variance between all the modded servers.Vanilla rust is a game that will not hold your hand. It's not a casual game. If you're constantly dying you need to change the way you play and adapt. 10/10 would have the best (and worst) times of my life playing this game again.,Rust

2015-01-30,2,2,4684,True,Recommended,This is a great game in development. The team behind it seem to be headed in the right direction. It hasn't all been rainbows and lollipops. The pivotal moment to me was when they decided to make the 1 1 copy of the old version. That's when it seemed like this new Rust started gaining momentum. I started playing about a year ago and have logged a few hours on the old version. As you can see by most of the reviews the old version is what brought people to the game. That is about to change. With the recently made gameplay and fps upgrades the new version of Rust is ready for more play time.EAC (the ppl responsible for catching hackers) is also making progress on creating global redundancies to catch cheaters. In the old version cheaters are a huge headache (No EAC). Farming this service out to a company that focuses only on cheaters is the right idea.I've gotten back the money I invested into the game x10000000000 in entertainment. This game is a solid buy not only because it has an old version that is fun but because Rust shows a lot of potential. The team behind Rust is always engaged with the players on how to make the game better. Nevertheless other reviewers will say they don't listen or don't care which just simply isn't true. Buy the game and make up your own mind.,Rust

2016-10-03,0,0,2025,True,Recommended,This is a great game!! I love it cant get enough of it. As everyone else says it is a bit of a grind to start out especially if you are alone but dont get discouraged from buying. Playing on non modded servers or vanilla server can be very dificult and time consuming to gather resources and get a decent base going. But there are plenty of modded servers with increased gather rates instant crafting some start u out with guns and materials plenty of servers to chose from and you wont have a problem finding one that is fun to play solo or with a few friends and that isnt such a grind when u first start. Amazing game may be my favorite game ever!! I would recommend to anyone!,Rust
2014-03-30,0,0,98,True,Recommended,Amazing just amazing but I will warn you that if you get rather frustrated easily you may want to wait for this game to be polished a bit. It is great but the game is very annoying on the sleeper mechanic and in my opinion raiding is way to easy. But it also all depends on the server and the admins but overall I say buy this game and remember it is in Alpha still so it is still progressing.,Rust

2017-01-14,0,0,369,True,Recommended,I would say that i have a between medium and high end PC but i still have to run this game on lower graphics so if you have a bad PC watch out!So i don't know where to start with this game but i can say that progress on all servers gets wiped every month which i really like. It gives you a chance to restart and go on a different path when you try to survive. Other thing i can say is that this game is a true PVP since most people will shoot you on sight no matter if you're naked or not (naked means freshly spawned players with no or barely any loot). You will run across friendly players too which will sometimes be happy to become allies and start a group together and become neighbours. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun challenging and grindy game.,Rust

2016-02-06,1,2,454,True,Recommended,Rust is truly one of my favorite games. It is an intense multiplayer survival game. Facepunch has taken the best elements of Minecraft and the best elements of dayz to create something truly amazing. Rust achieves what many games strive for. It creates amazing action sequences that will make you think you are in a scripted call of duty campaign until you realize that everything happening around is real. Totally unscripted. You are fighting for your life. It is totally player controlled. Dying in rust will truly hurt you because you are fighting for everything you have worked towards not to mention your pride.I logged my 112th hour into rust and I have hardly felt time pass. You are easily sucked into this world and you get up hours later realizing that it is 4am and you have homework at which time you sit down to play more rust.The only downside of rust is the fact that if you are not playing with friends the game will be extremely difficult. It is still an enjoyable experience however but to get the full experience of rust you need to play with friends.Another problem is the wonky gunplay. I am not new to FPSs as a whole however I find aiming and shooting in rust to be quite awkward. This can take away from gameplay but not enough to warrant not playing the game.Overall review 8.5/10,Rust

2016-02-18,0,0,558,True,Recommended,It is really hard to write an accurate review of this masterpiece.Let me introduce this game in a simplified way first So on vanilla servers you start on a beach you have a stone and a torch. You are about gathering wood stone iron then some strange guy appears from the woods starts complaining about your size then shoots you in the head.Now to be more detailed +Great pvp experience+Great looking nicely modelled nice atmosphere (some says it is a bit unoptimized but i had no issues with it)+This game needs more teamwork than any others in this genre+Strategic needs you have to plan your next step (I mean it is not like a CS GO where you can count on fix number enemies coming from different ways you have to count on anybody coming from any directions)+Fast developement (I play this game for about 3 weeks right now and a lot of content have been added since) If you are alone you're ed as hell (In this game you HAVE to be in a team find other guys or team up with friends) Pretty laggy on official servers either (you can easily get mad if someone fires bullets on you but cant hit him) As i mentioned it is a bit unoptimized Most of the players are a**holesSUM If you have some friends to play with go for it you will not regret this co op adventure!Two useful advices If someone did not shoot at you shoot him down because you have the vantage. There is no ultimate base design or undraidable base just not enough C4!EDIT I play this game for nearly a year and it had amazing amount of updates a proud example of that the early accesses could work fine if they keep develop it like they did in the first weeks.,Rust

2016-03-08,1,2,163,True,Recommended,Actually a decent game!I played this game since really early stages back when they had zombies. It wasnt the best game out there then but I guess it was alrigth. After they revamped the entire game I stopped playing for a long while and when I tryed it out once again I guess I really didnt know what to do so it got boring and I rage quitted. After a long break from the game I wanted to try it out again so me and a coupple of friends started playing. As we progressed in the game I realised that I was just rusty at the game and that it was actually a pretty good game for still beeing in alpha. Now you can build big bases and have base wars etc. and overall its a good game and i reccomend checking it out.,Rust

2016-08-20,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Game is extremely hard on new players. Everyone murders you or steals from you so if you're a solo player don't bother. Game uses a levelling and exp system to limit new players weapons and has no intuitive tutorial on crafting. Several times I harvested materials only to not know how to use them and promptly be murdered so if you just start hit a rock or tree for around 2 hours just to level up.Might as well be DayZ all over again except you can't find weapons and gear you have to be punished until you can punish other new spawns/players,Rust

I have never been sucked into a game so badly that I end up spending 12+ hours a day playing it. I genuinly had to force myself to stop playing this game as it was destroying my health.

2016-08-20,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,Got this game 2 weeks ago as part of a Humble Bundle spent 22 hours of running around naked and trying to establish a small house gather stuff and just have fun. As I read other people who played more I understand there have been changes and it was probably better before. Now on the other hand it is unplayable for a casual player like me. Big clans and people grinding day and night totally destroy the fun. Players are super unfriendly and it's not gonna attract new players if things stay this way. Not to mention bugged animals and random bugs that make it even worse. I know it's early access but it's been early access for years and still doesn't feel like right. I played some other games like this and they offer some fun while Rust offers only negative experience.,Rust

My favorite feature is probably the fact that when you log out of a server u don't just disappear like in say Minecraft where you can just log out and get away with any stuff in your inventory if you're being raided. I also enjoy the realism factor in this game like cold and bleeding out it makes this game quite unique from any other survival games that you might play.

If you want to go ahead and buy it by all means go ahead. It is enjoyable the first week but the novelty slowly dies.EDIT Okay it's been awhile since I gave my original review. This game hasn't been updated since Feb I'm talking actually updates not visuals. The amount of hackers in this game is enormous. If you're lucky to find a server that has active 24/7 admins who don't abuse their powers then stay with it. I started Rust back up again and I can promise you every other person you run into is hacking in some form. If it's a lowered aimbot to fool you into thinking he's just that good or they're just straight up flying across the sky. The developers seem like they just took the money and ran with it. My opinion don't buy it. You're going to have a frustrating time and I don't believe you should throw away your time for this game. You'll probably hear from people ""Hey man this game is only in Alpha. You can't judge it yet!"". Well then I payed my hard earned twenty dollars for it I sure as hell have a say in it.

Not only that the playerbase is just god awful it is extremely toxic and immature. Players are extremely rude to each other aside from that the game is way too glitchy even for alpha stages. Animals pass through rocks/walls barrels all of a sudden fall through the earth while spazzing out across the whole entire map the game in general has potential and a neat concept but the game in this stage is just too much to handle.

The initial learning curve is high and it take awhile to gain any real footing in the world (which can all be destroyed any second) but once you figure out it's systems and how the community on your server works there is nothing like Rust. Play this game find some friend make your mark on the world it's awesome.,Rust

This game will allow you to forge new relations with people in game and with the server capacity there is always some form of war to get in or raid party for airdrops. The combination of skill and stealth for some of this game is needed which is why it is really fun to play and it can't compare to Dayz.,Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,76,True,Recommended,My experience of the little I've played is that this game is not ment to be played alone you need FRIENDS or GOOD/KIND people. I've read many reviews some hilarious others not so great. Well so far I just LOVE this game it has great potential and hope to see it flourish with all upcoming updates. I had bad times where I have died losing good stuff being assaulted 4 consecutive times by the same group of four guys and even though sometimes I just feel like quiting I don't. Just like minecraft/terraria you can have good stuff die and lose everything. Just don't get to attached to things in the game. Overall the game for me is great even in alpha state. You just don't see any other game that when you die and respawn you spawn on top of a tree in the middle of nowhere. 10/10,Rust

2014-05-19,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,I decided to give this game a try through the family sharing feature before buying I had some doubts because of gameplay videos I saw and some reviews that I've read through the internet in this review I'll input my first and only hour through the game's Alpha. I got into a server with about 20 people online not too crowded but not too full.I got into the server and ran through the woods and away from the road to hide from players immediately since that I saw that older players could be very aggressive towards naked people who just started on their server. After sometime I found out that I needed food I asked my friend where to find food he just told me that I could find some easy hunting animals nearby the road. And it was pretty true I could find easy animals gatherable stone and wood nearby the road I just killed 2 chickens and gathered some resources when I was just leaving the road a gang of about 8 pre adolescent men with heavy gear (no idea what it was) and guns shot me on sight. And now I'll show the dialogue between me and them after the incident.Me Wow you just me on sight I just wanted to test the game wtfThem We are Rust players what did you want?Me You are just raiders.Them Yeah Rust players are raiders what with that?K even after that incident people were telling me some stuff about how the game looks like DayZ and crap like that you just can't trust no one. K I was rebuilding myself and getting the hang of the game killed a couple of sleeping people for their medkits and so that's when I died again for a player who sniped me while I was on the road again to gather more stone.A while after that I found out that wolves chase you for about 800km before they stop following you that just sucked. A lot. After the wolf chase I had about 20 hp and little food left since I had just respawned I just let myself be killed and reset by the wolf instead of trying to survive. After that I just got shot by another player and Alt+F4 until the game gets 1.0.Basically from the first hour I could say that the game is about * Playing alone sucks 24/7. You just cannot get as high as people playing in groups while trying to survive alone.* Liking/not caring about griefing/being griefed.* Knowing that at any time you can lose all your progress because some group decided to wipe away all your stuff with dozens of TNT.* Being complacent about playing with people that are mainly on the range of 11 17 years old just like with COD Minecraft and DayZ.* Having a taste for running from wolves.* Knowing that the Devs are aware but don't care that there's a grand part of the community who didn't like some decisions about the development.* Wanting to know why the game is so stale and empty far from the road while the road is so full of game and resources this just helps the griefing from the pre adolescent gangs who won't give you a chance.,Rust
2014-02-17,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Though this is a great game even in alpha and I mean really awesome you can not get far without friends at the moment it lacks navigation UI so finding your way around is entirely up to you remembering landmarks but this isn't the problem. The biggest issue I have is the community people just killing others on spawn or worse greifing new people on the map. It is PVP I know this but with a map that is not so large and having 200 odd people trying to build and create their own little survival life having so many s run around and slaughter you before you can even get started does ruin it for me I want to be able to play it and have fun not mindlessly get killed minutes in or worse just after I spent hours collecting resources to build my base and then losing it all to a player with a gun... It is a hard game to get started especially when it's competitive nature holds little room for new comers but if you have friends at least 4 playing with you and you can all find each other and set up a little home of your own then it can be an awesome fun experience. 7/10 great for an alpha but it needs a 1 in game day invunerability or something to let you get started.,Rust

2015-07-25,0,0,305,True,Recommended,Rust! This game never ceases to amaze me. The development is very steady and the developers communicate quite a lot. It has very interesting mechanics such as more 'realistic' base buildings a neat survival element and the gunfights are really good. Playing Rust alone would potentially suck a lot of fun out of this game considering it takes time to gather resources to finally build your equipment. Without a squad you will get raided and often lose in one versus team situations. * By the way this game needs to be optimized.,Rust

2014-01-29,0,0,87,True,Recommended,This game by far is better than any console game to date and it is in alpha! That's pretty good and another thing to say is this has made more than half the money that Garry's Mod has made but in just one month. This game is fun solo and is even more fun when you are surrounded by friends. You may need to watch out for bandits though because whether you like it or not there are going to be those that just want to ruin the fun but the good news is that you keep your known blueprints even after you die. With that you can go get some supplies and almost get exactly where you were at before you were killed. I give this game a 11/10 kidding it's a 10/10 because you can't go past that.,Rust

There are no longer Zombies so this is not a zombie survival game and there are many bugs happening(yeah its the alpha but i just wanted to mention this.)If you are the kind of player who gets really of being killed and losing all the stuff he collected then this game is also something for you cause there are PVE servers.And if youre the kind of player that isnt that of when he gets killed by other players and has the ambition to start new and punish them back later then this game is perfect for you. )I promise firstly i connected to the game and was cause i got instant killed in the first 15 min. of the game. but if youre playing longer and longer build your base up and punish them back the game will bind you and you wont get away from it.

Since my time owning it Ive seen an incredible about of work put into the game. From untextured monuments too dark scary caves. This game is definitly recommended although it is best too be played with friends as the community is toxic and rather barbaric. From beating trees with rocks too sniping noobs on the dome this game is 10/10 for me!,Rust

2017-08-30,0,0,445,True,Recommended,out of the many years that i have played this game (2 accounts) personally this has been my favourite game of all time. I get so many laughs out of it i make so many friends and enemies out of the game too! overall the game is a challenge but its a game where the more hours you have the better you will get in vanilla if you have an hour on rust you wont just get a full kit straight away its a grind but it is also one of the most difficult but fun games i have ever played the gun fire is incredible the gameplay is incredible the graphics are good and devs are active as they have an update for us every week! sometimes they are big updates like the most recent when they added bradley the tank but some are just bug fixes and tweaks.,Rust

2016-06-11,0,0,207,True,Recommended,Rate 9/10. Only reason i dont give it a 10/10 is because this game is time consuming like crazy. If you aren't on everyday you will get behind Amazing gameplay it never gets old Build a huge base and fortify it and no one can raid you. Raid peoples bases and kill them while they are sleeping and take all their stuff. Auto turrets that stay at your base and if enemy trys to come in it shoots them down. You can build your base anyway you want it to be Make allies and help eachother. Make enemies and fight. Get revenge on someone who raided your base. MANY MORE!,Rust
2014-05-17,0,0,719,True,Recommended,I (and anyone else who owns Rust) can definetely see the potential in this game. I have read reviews about how bad some communities are as of raiding and mass murder this is true at times the community will crush your skull with a rock. However the community also will help you out at sometimes. As of gameplay the game is really realistic on some of the servers I play on I am really set off but this doesnt change the fact I get out of my house as the sun is barely up and go scavenge for food and wood oh wood you always think you have enough but you never do. I think even though this game is early access Alpha version it doesn't contain that many bugs the only bugs I have seen is a floating wolf and a flying tree. If you have this game and are sad that it doesn't have certain aspects (for example farming) do not worry for like I said this game is in Alpha version so many changes will occur. Now let's move into the genre of crafting being able to craft anything from a hunting bow to walls doors and ceilings this game is very advanced taking on a minecraft type game but without the mega pixels. You can find blue prints that you can study so you can build different items (like C4). Building homes is pretty simple but you will need a lot of wood. Start with a wood/metal foundation and then put pillars to support your walls/ceilings. You can defend your home by putting up barriers and spikes. You can lock doors and give your door passwords to your friends so they can enter. I would recomend you play this game with a friend so you can have someone watch your back however you can go solo and pone some noobs. All in all this game is very advanced for it's era and definetely worth the $20 I hope I see you soon!,Rust
2016-10-16,0,0,195,True,Recommended,This game is addicting. The graphics are amazing and just the entire cocept is incredible. Just make sure you join the server with the right community built around it and you'll play for days!,Rust
2016-10-25,0,0,978,True,Recommended,Rust oh rust what an amazingly annoying game i have a love hate relationship with rust. The community is probably the most hostile i have found in a survival game. even if you have your rock out 5 geared players will role up with guns will kill you then teabag you. but this is a learning curve this is not an easy game. its brutal and unforgiving spend 10 hours making a base to get offline raided the next. but that just makes you want to fight back with even more firepower then get your revenge this makes rust a game not for the faint off heart you will die you will kill making this the most brutal and hardcore game i have ever played. And i love it.,Rust
2016-11-03,0,0,234,True,Recommended,Very good game one of the best survival MP games to play with a few friends. But the community is very toxic and with that comes alot of immature racist players who kill onsite regardless of your gear. I think that the game is great dont get me wrong and is worth a slot in every gamers libary but they need to start giving out bans for racist abuse and imature players that dont deserve to be ruining a beautiful game like this.,Rust

2016-09-25,0,0,513,True,Recommended,This game is everything you could want in a real apocalyptic survival game. First and foremost it is in beta any complaints about server or client lag glitches and the like are just silly because that's the whole point of a game going through alpha/beta otherwise it would just be called a full released game. Gameplay The concept is basic but great you wake up with nothing but a rock with this rock you will have to gather wood and stone to start creating tools and then go out and gather even more resources to build your base or even to expand it. Now the community for this game has its ups and downs but this shouldnt be a reason for you to reconsider buying this game For anyone who wants a nice community with easy to gather resources and mobs that hit you for 3% of your health play minecraft. For those who played for 30 mins or an hour and got tired of crap server lag and crashes and glitchy gameplay just keep in mind it's in alpha and will get better. I have been playing this game for a while now and i really recomend it to people and i am sure you wont regret Rust. At its current stage it is very entertaining and i can only see good comming out in the futuregg8/10,Rust

2017-01-08,1,2,25,True,Not Recommended,This game is good at first you get resources you build a base make friends kill looters and raiders and have a good time.but it all falls apart when you make enemies in this game.A single enemy in this game can/will destroy everything you've spent that 18 hours on. All that hard work is for not simply because some autist ing bombed your base like it was Syria.AND SO YOU RESTART DO IT AGAIN AND THE SAME THING HAPPENSThis game is very rinse and repeat as all games of this genre are but not in a good way.Unless you have the time and energy to put 3000 hours into this game to make perfect base designs that are unique and to master bullet drop you'll get your spirit destroyed by people who literally have 0 real interactions with anybody and just play rust all day.Unlike a lot of other games this game isn't one where you can simply recover from a tradegy you will be forced to restart or atleast rebuild all your stuff and that stuff took 18 hours to build. its a timesink and its not even fun to play.SUMMARY IS THIS GAME BAD? No.IS THIS GAME FUN? No.IS THIS GAME UNIQUE? No.IS THIS GAME WORTH ITS PRICE? No.At a $15 price tag like most others in the genre this would be a mediocre game at best.

(When i started i couldn't play above 15FPS now it's more to 30) Some servers have a lot of hackers. (the official servers do a good job!) Official servers are sadly full more often then not..,Rust

2015-07-16,0,0,1563,True,Recommended,Rust is a very good game. The shelter building is phenomenal the combat is splendid. If you're clever you can take out 3 people with guns with only a bow. I love just wandering around the forest and hunting the various animals. It's a bit buggy but nothing gamebreaking at this point. I have been a big fan of Garry's mod for a long time and he's done it again with Rust. This was an early access game I was comfortable buying and the updates have been coming steadily. I am really excited to see what more they can do with this.,Rust

2014-02-13,0,0,46,True,Recommended,This game has a long way to go before it reaches its full potential but the fact that it has so much potential makes me recommend this game. If this game was released as a finished product right now a would strongly advise agianst getting it but it's not a finished product and you need to relize that before you buy this game. If you can handle a vast amount of bugs and hackers you will find a wonderful game underneath the problems but if you have a hard time dealing with things like that I would wait to buy this until it at least hits beta.,Rust

2015-07-17,0,0,2568,False,Recommended,great game has its issues but hey its early access its to be expected plus the players that keep complaining that the game needs change have slowed progress a few times let the devs get their game made their way with the bug fixes then they can see weather things are going the right way and weather players are happy with results but for the main part i think the game is awsome and just needs some light and some big changes but most released games nowdays are like that and never even recieve a patch so be greatful...,Rust

2016-01-04,0,0,702,False,Recommended,Hands down probably the best game I have ever played and I've played quite a few. I never thought that I would play a indie game which is also in early access that I enjoy more then every AAA title I have played. But Rust is hard to beat. With it's unscripted un predicable chaos. But at the same time easy to learn and hard to master controls and building techniques and my favorite no clunky annoying generic zombies that every other survival game tries to implement.This game is terrifying you spend the first nightfall naked afraid in an unknown huge randomly generated map where most other players have extreme trust issues and kill on sight. But each day you get a little better you learn a little more you gather a few more supplies to make your life easier and more enjoyable. Only to have your house demolished and raided at any given moment by players that are much more experienced than you. It's amazing.We all have spent years playing games with pre made storylines characters events etc. But in Rust you make your own.,Rust
2017-04-02,1,2,1763,False,Recommended,Rust will consume you. And then you'll just sit in your house or farm sulfur until wipe day. Love this game but after a point usually the point when I have a honeycombed and upgraded base and a good gun on my hip it looses some appeal and I often find myself on another server doing the Naked Guy Grind.Some sort of end game content beyond shooting down the heli or blowing in your neighbor's door would bring this game closer to a 9/10.But as the game stands now with it's bugs crashes and lack of a compelling reason to keep playing after a certain point I still give it an 7.62/10. And all of those points are for fun and beauty. If you want a beautiful game with hours of survival mayham (especially fun with a friend) and you don't mind the game's random crashes testing your sanity or the lack of a real end game Rust may be for you.I paid for it twice so my wife could play with me I don't regret it a bit. ),Rust

2014-01-12,1,3,62,True,Recommended,There are many scared and troll players that they will try to kill on sight so make sure you have patience with the others. Try to join private or community servers because in most of the public servers you will meet cheaters trollers or even bad admins who abuse their admin rights.It's really easy to start a new base but in this game you will need at least 1 friend to play with.Rating 8/10,Rust
2016-01-21,0,0,2325,True,Recommended,"I loved this game before the new update you didnt need the beafiest computer available to play it it was always fun... Ihave over 600 hours... I was soo devastated when I found out they were creating the ""new rust"" which is now just ""Rust"". I played all summer litterally I would wake up at like 10 A.M. and play till 4 in the morning... I look back on it and it was a litteral addiction... I would crave the game when I wasnt playing. Then the Rust came out and I liked it a lot but as we get farther into the future everything is becoming better. So with my computer which has an AMD Radeon 6670 I was unable to play anymore because with ""old Rust"" i would have over 30FPS and the current Rust I now get below 15. I dont know a lot about graphics cards. But if anyone reads this and knows anything about graphics card make sure you do some reasearch and find out what you have before you buy this game. I really wish I could play this game... I havnt tried opening rust in a few months but Im gonna soon cause maybe the past months the ""new Rust"" has been out they have made some optimizations to the game. IDK if people are gonna read this but i hope it helps! NEOTYKE",Rust
2016-12-27,1,2,3760,True,Recommended,The Ultimate Survival Game where you are put on the edge of your bloody seats killing geared and taking down the chooper. This game begins off like any normal game getting introduced to your character man or female waking up on a beach you look around usually hearing gun shots from basterds already fully geared looking at your hands and what you see is a rock and a torch VERY LEATHAL. Nocking trees stones and barrels you begin to get the overall way of the game and that is to survive and the only way to survive is by building a nifty ak47 shooting those geared boys down trully feels great until you get shot in the head from a roof camper.

2014-01-14,0,0,918,True,Recommended,You wake up alone and naked in the woods. The night is approaching and you're getting cold. All you have with you is your trusted rock a few bandages that you'd like not to use and a torch that won't last long. As you're thinking of what to do a pig runs by. All of a sudden horrific ideas come to your mind. Ideas you'd never have in any other scenario... But you're starving... And the rock... It's a good weapon after all. A few moments later you've got yourself some raw meat fat and cloth. But hey even though you're on the edge of dying you're not stupid! The meat has to be cooked and prepared! Once again your trusted rock is here to help. You manage to get some wood of a nearby tree. Not high quality wood but it's good enough to keep a fire burning. You set up a campfire and dedicate yourself to making something eatable. The night comes and you're stuck in the middle of the forest. Alone. With nothing but a dying fire next to you. That's when you hear it. You're not alone. You can hear someone walking. Someone is near. You grab your barely cooked meat and you're preparing for the run of your life. And then you see it. Two glowing eyes looking at you from the dark. You start running and you can hear the wolf behind you. You run faster than you ever thought you possibly could. Losing all hope you run in the middle of the road praying that a miracle might save you. And that's when it happens. You stumble upon a house. A heavily armored person opens the doors. He aims at you and you think it's all over. You're going to get shot and eaten by wolves. Moments later you hear the shot. It is the loudest thing you've ever heard. You fall to the ground frozen. But you're still alive. The person drops you some more cloth and meat and he closes the door. You can hear the last dying breath of the wolf behind you as he stumbles to the ground just meters from you with a bullet between his eyes. Once again you're all alone. The dawn is approaching. It's time to make your own home. Will you survive?,Rust
2013-12-25,0,0,35,True,Recommended,So far its amazing!You can build stuff you can fight other people you can form peace treaties you can do everything a sandbox survival game should let you do. The building system is good just like the crafting system. The crafting times are a bit annoying tho )I've been playing this game for about 30 hours now. I've built a big house well you can call it a fortress near the radioactive zone. I have lots of loot. I have almost every item in the game.This game can go in two directions up or down. The developers can either screw it up or make it a perfect game. I think that this game will someday reach the hype level of minecraft everyone will play it and invite you to play with them. I really can't wait for the upcoming updates. Please release a new update soon!,Rust

New and cool bases used to be the only thing that would make the gameplay different otherwise it's just hit the node and go to the rad town. I know i've started this review off very negatively but you have to understand that after almost 2000 hours I just can't enjoy the game anymore. This game is amazing and you can play it for forever. Right now there's only 1 friend on my list with under 1000 hours and he has 500. For the price you will get a long time of enjoyment from Rust. I would highly recommend the only reason I have only listed negatives is so you know what are the main down sides to the game.,Rust

2016-04-18,0,0,5862,True,Recommended,As a huge fan of survival games Rust by far stands above all others. Since release it has continued to evolve keeping the game interesting and changing the way you play. The game can be frustrating to the casual player though as pvp and base raiding is a huge part of the game. My recomendation is never sleep and always keep an extra set of gear.,Rust

2014-07-12,0,0,478,True,Recommended,II still remember the very first time I spawned into this game a young noob running into radiation while trying to get rid of the bear trying to eat me. Even though this game is on its second itteration since then (and heavily updated) it's still essentially the same game. I've had a number of hilarious moments with friends and sweat dripping late night sessions defending from the best aspect of the game the raids. It can get boring starting on your own so I'd suggest finding a group of friends and getting to know your neighbours. Your very survival may depend on it. Grapghically this game has only gotten better and new features are inbound monthly. It was well worth my original 15 last year and this games development still looks promising.,Rust

Still naked.The shotgun guy helped me up gave me some shrooms first thought they are going to kill me instead it were eatable shrooms.Alright back at 20 Health lets keep going down the road.Got shot again by a shotgun this time by another guy still was naked by now and played 4 Minutes.Respawned.A huge bear is right next to my spawn and killed me.Respawned.Saw a tree tried to chop it down a wolf attacked me and killed me.Respawned.Saw a rock wanted to get some stones.

2016-02-05,0,0,871,True,Recommended,This game is worth the 20 dollars or the 10 dollars if you are getting this on the Luner New Year sale AKA Steam being real sick and giving us a sale for a holiday 7/206958833 people celebrate in America and the UK combined. This is an addicting game at first and when you run out of content you can go on a modded server or legacy. I got this game when the new Rust was just coming out barely played it because of a laptop issue but still had it. I thought it was addicting then and I got between 9 15 fps the entire time. Once I finally upgraded this was one of the first games I played. It is a super fun game to play with friends in fact I think that is the only way it should be played. For the time I played it activly I was playing between 2 8 hours a day I had over 40 hours in the past week on serveral occations. If that doesn't prove it is a good game I don't know what is. I would reccomend modded servers A LOT. With regular wipes and increased gather rates it is a lot of fun to get started into and seeing all the different plug ins and what the community is like on each modded server. I have tried to play vanilla yet it is very challenging. Me and a friend (even though we didn't know what we were doing at the time) played on a vanilla server for 7 hours straight and made zero progress. We had one goal in mind on that playthrough get at least ONE gun blueprint. We came out with anything BUT a gun blueprint. In conclusion try out all the gamemodes and different types of servers there are in Rust and find which one fits your fancy. For me and my friends we spent time on a battlefield server had some fun with that but eventually settled down on a server called Rusticity. A fun server for all and I would reccomend it a lot. The server is good for trading BP's for supplies and it isn't too OP just a 3x gather rate and all the normal plug ins such as TP Homes and all that other good I hope this very LONG review helped you out in some way shape or form even though no one is going to read this.

2014-07-08,0,0,79,True,Recommended,I have played rust a lot not only with my friends but I have taken the time to play by myself. WARNING this is not a game for people who can't handle stress well. There will be times you want to murder everyone and times you want to shoot yourself. THERE WILL BE A LOT OF THOSE TIMES! However there is an addictive drug (not the Rad Pills) that keeps you up for hours thinking about the intensity that comes with this game. People will find you and kill you. People will find your home and loot you. Then you will be that person who finds others and takes revenge and you'll get that drug dose all over again. I enjoyed it very worth the time and money spent.,Rust

2014-02-07,0,0,176,True,Recommended,Overall I would consider this a great game especially since it is only in early access. I remember when I played the first release of the game which really was just a bunch of ugly rocks terribly textured grass lots of zombies bugs and worsed of all millions of shelters dotting the landscape. The developers have made a great deal of progress in the development of the game but there still are some problems. Other then the occasional bugs here and there the game overall is not for those hoping to be friends with anyone for any period of time. On most servers the second you join you are at risk of being killed. This of course is a surival game but not only against the elements but against mankind itself. If you are looking for another Minecraft don't bother buying this game since you will spend much more time shooting then you will building. Of course there is a great deal of building as well but only of bases where you can survive the cruel days and the worse nights.Game strengths Great Developer Dedication to fixing bugs and banning hackers in a somewhat timely fashion (most hackers have to purchase new accounts on a monthly basis) Great Enviornment for PVP (I love hardcore games like this) Endless nights in your basement where all you want to do is play Rust Great to play with friends (you won't survive without them)Problems with the game Lots of hackers.. Althought they do ban lots of hackers just as quickly new hacks come out and new hackers buy the game or repurchase it on a new steam account. Regardless of the efforts made to reduce the amount of hackers you will still encounter hackers on an almost daily basis but many of these hacks will probably be patched eventually. Regardless of the hackers I would say the game is still worth buying at this time.Overall Rating 8/10,Rust
2014-05-23,0,0,265,True,Recommended,This game has tremendous potential considering it's still in Alpha. Harsh mean raw survival and no pity to be found. Trust no one better to shoot on sight and apologise later. You spawn with a rock and a torch and have to go from there often the first thing you hear is someone else's rock (or bullet) hitting your head...learn to run and hide until you are at least armed with a bow! I do wish I could play on the official servers but they are infested with exploiters and let's face it what's fun about being shot from halfway across the map by someone you can't even see or playing against someone who can leap 5 times as high as you run 4 times as fast and with aimbot never ever miss a shot. So I stick to the community servers but it is definitely going to be a great game. I hope they get the anti hacks embedded into the servers.,Rust
2013-12-28,0,0,36,True,Recommended,very good game and the gun play is solid but only get it if you have people to play it with.,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,504,True,Recommended,Rust is a very unique and promising game. You don't know what will happen every day is different. Players create the world around you they use what they have for good or go around and become notorious bandits. In Rust your goal is to survive. Simple? No it is actually very hard because of the player aspect and when you are a fresh spawn things like zombies wolves and bears can make your life a whole lot harder. Later on after you get your first gun these animals arn't much of a hazard. Overall I recommend Rust to anyone who likes Minecraft a challenge DayZ and Arma II Wasteland.,Rust
2014-01-15,0,0,130,True,Recommended,Very good game especially considering it's in an Alpha still. I've had tons of hours of fun in this. However this game is also highly addicting in a somewhat bad way. Once you get lots of stuff you become very paranoid and are almost always required to check on your stashes or main base as if you were playing in null security space in EVE Online. And open loot upon death in PVP can be harsh to new comers who do not learn to keep things safe. The only major let down right now at the moment is Hackers as with most new Alpha games on Steam. This game has some servers plagued by them which is a big reason I launched my own server with a few active admins on it to keep them at bay and banned.,Rust

2014-01-15,0,0,1043,True,Recommended,Rust is a white knuckle experience full of terror pain and a real feeling of accomplishment. The feelings this game creates in me... Fear worry panic joy exultation accomplishment. You don't get achievements for playing a story you cant loose. I don't even know if you get achievements. You know what your achievements are? Having a safe place to live that looks sweet. Having awesome gear. Not being killed. Those are achievements. You arent playing some tunnel level made for 3 year old girls to be able to beat so every single person who bought the game can win. Player interactions? Tons. Best summed up in the dialog between Josey Wales and the Comanche Chief Ten Bears. Sometimes though you have to remember you might not be Josey Wales you might be the nameless guy who didnt make it though Comanche territory. Josey You be Ten Bears?Ten Bears I am Ten Bears.Josey (spits tobacco) I'm Josey Wales.Ten Bears I have heard. You're the Gray Rider. You would not make peace with the Blue Coats. You may go in peace. Josey I reckon not. Got nowhere to go.Ten Bears Then you will die.Josey I came here to die with you. Or live with you. Dying ain't so hard for men like you and me it's living that's hard when all you ever cared about has been butchered or Governments don't live together people live together. With governments you don't always get a fair word or a fair fight. Well I've come here to give you either one or get either one from you. I came here like this so you'll know my word of death is true. And that my word of life is then true. The bear lives here the wolf the antelope the Comanche. And so will we. Now we'll only hunt what we need to live on same as the Comanche does. And every spring when the grass turns green and the Comanche moves north he can rest here in peace butcher some of our cattle and jerk beef for the journey. The sign of the Comanche that will be on our lodge. That's my word of life.Ten Bears And your word of death?Josey It's here in my pistols there in your rifles. I'm here for either one.Ten Bears These things you say we will have we already have.Josey That's true. I ain't promising you nothing extra. I'm just giving you life and you're giving me life. And I'm saying that men can live together without butchering one another.Ten Bears It's sad that governments are chiefed by the double tongues. There is iron in your word of death for all Comanche to see. And so there is iron in your words of life. No signed paper can hold the iron it must come from men. The words of Ten Bears carries the same iron of life and death. It is good that warriors such as we meet in the struggle of life... or death. It shall be life.,Rust

2016-07-10,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,The game is almost impossible for a solo player to survive. So I would recommend playing the game only if your content with having to find other people/friends to play with each time you decide to play.The community is also very poor. Most players will kill you on site with little to no reason other than that is how things work in rust. Everybody kills everybody for items/territory and so on unless if you are lucky and run into the exceptions.It is still being developed and not considered a complete game but the ai for the npc animals within the game is currently very broken (bears instantly kill you if they are in range and 90% of the time there is no escaping them unless if you manage to finish them off first/boars and other animals can cross mountains and cliffs extremley quickly which makes hunting them very difficult and you need them to craft a furnace and other important items without it you cannot make metal.In general rust is a fun game but only if you have a dedicated group of people to play with which makes it not for all even if you like the core game itself not bringing the community into consideration for this argument.,Rust

You begin with basically nothing and it take ages to get resources and usually someone with a gun will just kill you before you can ever make true progress. Maybe if you have a group of friends you might have a chance but even a group of newly spawned people are powerless against 1 guy and his gun.

2014-03-17,0,0,44,True,Recommended,I thought it was a total minecraft rip off at first but this game is actually somewhat better for those who prefer a game that is more about survival rather than crafting blocks and houses. Of course you can still make your own shelter out of limited types of materials but the main goal if this game is to survive. For those people complaining about getting shot instantly next time try reading the server name before joining. There are some servers that don't have pvp enabled which are good for first timers. I can't wait to see how it grows once they release the password for dedicated servers to the public. I will certainly be a contributor in the future as long as they don't disappoint.,Rust

2013-12-17,0,0,68,True,Recommended,Rust more like 'Trust' because that is what you will lose after a few hours of playing this game. Brutally hard but incredibly addicting and fun and its only in alpha! Can't wait to see what they add to this already amazing game .,Rust
2014-01-22,0,0,544,True,Recommended,"You spawn in half naked. Your only worldly possessions is a rock torch bandages and a snack. Then you manage put together some basic cloth clothes killed a hog and got uncooked chicken gathered some ore and wood built a camp fire and settled down in your basic shack/shelter for the night in your comfy sleeping bag. The next morning you wake up in an unfamiliar place in the middle of a grass field. You're naked. Lost everything you owned. And you're left wondering what happened last night.It's like a bad acid trip in real life. That'll sum it up for most new players who at least make it through the first night and have not been killed in the first few hours. Climbing the Rust Evolutionary Latter is something that most players are going to have to do more than once until they get the hang of the game or until they've managed to form alliances with other players. It sounds like a bad review so far.. but I love this game. Here's why It's PvP/PvE and like most PvP games the majority of veteran players are going to be the ones that make it hard for new players to get established that's just the nature of most PvP gamers. But once you start to get established built a nice fort with some defences and formed an alliance or two it starts to take off. You feel an attachment to the creation you built. You start to collect resources feverishly to replenish your stores and to build even bigger. While exploring and collecting resources you are always keeping a mental note of good places to build a second compound that's better hidden and with better natural defences. Single player right now is fine. But co op is where it starts to shine if you can manage form alliances. Cooperation with other players to help build your compound defending resource planning (limited to simply ""what is more important to build right now"" at least) and expansion is much more fun than roughing it alone.And that's where the rub is with new players that can't find the fun in the game. Because they're either playing on an official server that are filled with griefers roving bandits and just general unfriendly players who shoot on site (I admit I've done it once or twice... a few times). Or are on a community server with a shady admin. The trick is to find that gem of a server with a decent admin low enough population where most of the players aren't obnoxious kids who think they're playing CoD still.RUST is going to be what you make of it and how fair the Admins are. Yes there are improvements to be made and some flaws but it's an Alpha. The developers can only do so much to try to control player behaviour. And you can only blame the game so far because in the end it's just that there's so many bad players and they are everywhere no matter what game when it comes to an MMO. And that's where I am with the current server I am playing. F1 &gt net.connect rust.wichitalan.com 28045I'm not an admin there but I'm hoping that the majority of people who will and are currently playing are of the level headed type. So far so good. Only the occasional skirmish robberies and retaliatory raid to keep things interesting.",Rust

2016-08-19,0,0,901,True,Not Recommended,This is a re written review concentrating on the recent changes in Rust. This game is currently not recommended. Some time ago I had a positive review which is rare for an Early Access to get a thumbs up from me.The new XP system has made this game a huge grind and time consuming. I played loads of it on my week off but I did not feel rewarded for it. It is a MINDLESS grind right now. I completely do NOT recommend it in its current state. You spend a lot of time into gaining levels and get extremely little in return. No thank you if anyone thinks this is fair please do re evaluate your time and think if it could be spent more useful (even in gaming) because it can. Facepunch I do not think that XP system is a complete disaster therefore there are three ways Rust can become playable again 1)You go back to Blueprint system a boring move and it will still consume some hours from players to get better gear but there are at least chances to get cool stuff early on and working together actually PAYS OFF.2)You boost the rate of the XP gain around 5 times. I have to spend more than 3 hours to get a metal hatchet/Waterpipe (W pipe available earlier from the get go)?!? That is stupid and does not balance anything only consume our time!3)A friend of mine had an idea that the first 10 levels are available to you from the beginning. There isn't anything extreme there some clothes basic gear primitive weapons. And the remaining level gaining rate is being boosted 1 5x or 2x. People get stuff earlier but it is better than spending 6 hours and maybe getting something that you can actually use for more advanced farming and ancient method killing which is bullcr p!!!Thanks to anyone who might or might not have read this. I will be waiting for changes to occur and if anything positive comes out my review will adapt as well.,Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,104,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival/open world FPS game where no one can be trusted. If you have played DayZ mod or SA you will enjoy this game. If you have played Garry's Mod or any true sand boxy buildy game you will enjoy this. If you have never played anything like this you will most likely enjoy this but make sure you look into it. Currently this game is in earlier alpha so there are a ton of bugs be aware. Do not expect anything spectacular it is a good start but after a while it does get dull and boring there is very little varitiy. Also play with friends not very fun alone. Overall I give this game a 7/10 for an early alpha. Buy it try it possibly like it.,Rust

2014-02-15,0,0,152,True,Recommended,Rust is very addicting going from starting out naked with nothing but two sticks and a rock to building a fortress and toting a fully automatic rifle and doned in full Kevlar the game is really fun if you know what to build when. It also helps to not be as agressive and know where to build your base. Obvious danger zones would be around the irradiated buildings because these drop random items like weapons bullets materials and even blueprints to learn new things to craft. So they will most likely always be fought over. The idea is to keep yourself in a somewhat secluded spot and build defensively before going out and around looking for things. Bow is probably the best way to get build fast beings killing animals will be the second hardest thing to do. My one problem with this game currently is two things. One if you lag out of the game your body stays there and someone can kill it even NPC animals and you are out your items even though it was a game crash or disconnect. Second if you get an update you can kiss the server you were on goodbye because they probably won't update to the current version so now you can't go back because your game versions conflict.,Rust

Frst off I had to re purchase rust using another steam ID because of the female/ male permanent character sh*t. I am .. Sexist. Can't help it. Male and proud.Okay so talking about my experience.1. Saw the game on youtube and through friends felt it had the iest graphics.2. Bought it just to play with my friends.3. delete and refund on same day4. bought it again 2 days after5. delete6. re downloaded7. started getting to know the game better8. idea of wipe and losing resources on death was annoying AF so i quit (not a survival game type of person)9. got back again after accepting the fact10. liked the fact of having a friend to get small base upgrade to bigger kill every naked walking around even if they are friendly. (yes that pitty feeling goes away on your first kill and you turn to a b*tch a*s m*fkin assasin creed sort of sh*t)11. there are many mods in game (Slow pace slow exp and less gathering Fast pace fast + easy gun game etc.) try any option that suits your mood and play style.12. now love the fact that there are wipes just makes me want to dominate the server and feels like i was given a second chance if i f*ked up the first time13. best survival by farThose complaining about cancer players killing you on site are just not fit to play survival games. IF every one was peaceful i wouldnt need to build a base for protection.You might hate the game early but definately you will absorb its idea except the fact that you cant change your f*kin gender in game even though in reality you f*kin can.I would honestly say that the cancer community is what makes this game challenging and you know I am right.Would recommend the following youtubers as well they provide funny content and insane raiding strategies.1. vertigogaming rust2. faceless rust3. scudpunk rust4. shacky rust,Rust

I am keeping the game installed and updated awaiting the big changes when they release the new version. The game is still very promising and I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival first person games.,Rust

2015-08-11,0,0,4309,True,Recommended,Rust is by far the best value on Steam. Well worth $19.99 and an even better deal with the four pack for $60 because you will want all of your friends and family to play this with you. Best of all the DEVS and server ADMINS are all very active. Weekly updates continue to improve RUST to make it more beautiful and interesting. Considering it is still an alpah build RUST is by far the mos tengaging title I have committed hours of my life to. Congrats to the DEV team and thanks to the server ADMINS that keep this game engaging social and fun. Cheers to your success I hope it lasts for years to come.,Rust

2015-12-31,0,0,845,True,Recommended,"I'll start off by saying if you buy this game with playing solo in mind...It can be p#ss boiling!!That being said if your part of a group of friends playing this game then Rust has a lot to offer.Surviving Rust is harder than you think PVE is the least of your problems when players are competing for the same resources things get a little primal...kill on site is VERY common and if playing for the 1st time trust only your closest friends playing alone trust no one!!Once I got the hang of the game ""which didn't take very long"" it got very addictive very quick. The game in its current state is amazing and very excited when reading where the developers are headed. For this reason I would have no problems recommending this game to anyone interested in this genre and I personally give it a 10/10",Rust
2014-12-16,0,0,577,True,Recommended,Optimize/stabilize the graphics engine instead of putting new main menu screens and this game will do just fine. The lastest build pulls so much power from your computer that it feels like you're trying to run this moths latest blockbuster game using maxed setting on a avreage computer.,Rust
2016-02-08,0,0,51,True,Recommended,Basebuilding is fun and theoretically allows for a large variety of base designs. In reality you are forced to build in unituitive ways to annoy potential raiders unless you're fine with your base never making it through the night.Crafting system is simple and understandable but you are forced to farm blueprint fragments for a long time untill you get what you want and all the really useful stuff is in the higher tiers. You can eventually trade for them but...People act like rabid dogs essentially everywhere. Anyone you do not know from elsewhere is more than likely to kill you on sight regardless of what you try to communicate. Many will vandalize your base as well given the chance.Furthermore you will often encounter either psycopaths or people roleplaying psycopaths or someone spouting memes while trying to sound tough. Take extra care in finding a properly moderated server.Solo play is possible but severely limited at this point in time. As a single person you are almost unable to raid anyone while being an easy target for any group. Solo play centers around keeping as low profile as possible. Lack of any endgame or pve can make this boring in the long run depening on your preferences.Performance is spotty for most people. With a 4790k/780ti/16gb ram/SSD I get a fairly solid 60 fps 1080p (capped fps so maybe more in reality) so I can't complain.CONCLUSION Game is fun enough and I got my money's worth of fun. As primarly a lone wolf player lack of any endgame and being severely outclassed by any group play it has little to keep me interested for longer atm.,Rust

2014-01-14,0,0,44,True,Recommended,WORTH EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY.Me and 2 friends built a small home in a nice secluded area then 5 guys with guns roll up and kill a guy that I was teaching how to hit a tree with a rock IN COLD BLOOD. Then they told us at sun down we need to get them 100 wood every day for the rest of our lives. So for the first couple days we complied but slowly built up guns and ammo to fight back however the hustling turned into a trade agreement as our masters were giving us blueprints and awesome loot for our wood. Then they got raided and decided to become our slaves. They roamed the fields as the stalwart defense of BigDaddyCruiser. After about 5 days irl of building up a small arsenal we finally have full kevlar armor and machine guns. Now we roam the road forcing butt naked people to fight for our entertainment and reward the winner with an extravagent prize.There are endless stories I have about my adventures in Rust and I haven't even played a week of it.10000000000/10,Rust

2016-01-27,0,0,39,True,Recommended,Played the game over a weekend. Grinded like crazy for two hole days just to be killed while offline and have my base taken over by some guys. After that i found some friends (I call them friends because they didnt shoot me at sight which most players will do in Rust) who helped me raid their (my ex) base and we killed them all. I KILLED THEM ALL 3 ) And thats the best thing about this game. U never know can u trust person u just met or not so teaming up with someone can be double edged sword.Pros its exciting meeting new people not knowing if they'll kill u on sight or betray u later u can learn something (e.g i didnt know that u cant outrun a bear ) ) ocasional server wipes so no clan can get total domination and bully other great experience if u play with friendsCons U will get bullied most of the time (I feel u bro) Usually u'll be killed and raided while offline and thats really frustrating and u'll rage alot because of that (i feel u bro),Rust

2017-02-28,0,0,988,True,Recommended,Very good game after 700h it becomes borring to me and my few friends its not that hardcore its almost imposible to die because of the lack of food or water in 2h you can have big base after you make guns and some explosives you make few raids kill some people and thats it your game is over then you go on new fresh wiped server to do the same thing but in diffrent style..For me this game will be awsome if the ing primitive age does not last for like 1h lol It is to easy and i think game devs need to put more difrent guns and armors and clothes.. But i had almost best gaming experience in this game and when i think about this game i paid 20 euros to have fun 700 hours so its worth buying it i think i will wait like 1 year to play this game again maybe they will make it more intersting now every start its to repeative,Rust

2017-01-17,0,0,1185,False,Not Recommended,Don't waste you money.The game and concept in itself is nice however the community is absolutely terrible.Servers are wiped anything from a few days to months differentiting them are in most cases impossible without entering and hoping someone polite is online that knows. More often than not you will simply be met with childish replies.Within an hour or 2 of a wipe you have people running around in full armour and guns. Out of i don't know 100 deaths so far only 2 people ever actually said anything before instantly shooting me. Baring in mind 90% of the time you die within a minuite or 2 of spawning naked with only a rock to defend yourself!In an hour this evening i tried a new fresh server. I died about 20 times managing to collect enough materials to make a sleeping bag only twice! That would be 5 plants from the floor and hitting 1 tree.To summarise this is not the sandbox survival game it is advertised to be. 99% of the time your going to spawn 50 times before you even manage to make a simple 2x1 home. At which point some testosterone fueled 30 someting decides to act like a 12yr old and destroy it all just because. It is by all accounts a pvp game.I've tried about 10 different servers they are all the same. Spawn &gt farm a few hundred wood/stone &gt die &gt repeat. There is simply no balance when you spawn naked with a rock there is absolutely nothing you can do against the plethora of children that seem to think its amusing to camp the spawns with full armour and guns.The concept of the game is build a base and survive against raiders or raid other bases. I tried very hard to like it however the comunity is simply toxic. It is not possible to enjoy the game when you must repeat the first 30 mins of the starting stage over and over and over 50 times every reset/server due to players benig social rejects.Lets not forget that actual raiding outside of new playes small houses is none existent simply because it is far too expensive to penetrate the ridiculously sized bases that are made by the end of day 1. Therefore people are left with nothing else to do other than running around killing naked new people.Being able to differentiate between a new player that actually has nothing and a guy hiding a gun up his would go a long way to resolve these issues as of now you simply can not tell what someone is carrying .,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,96,True,Recommended,"With the current state of the game and the rampant hackers on literally every server I wouldn't suggest buying this game to play it only to invest in its potential. And let me tell you it has a lot of potential.Sadly a lot of that potential is being lost in the complete and utter lack of VAC doing it's job correctly and there being a serious lack of server side anti hack plugins.4/10 in it's current state. Great atmosphere pretty solid controls phenomenal building core but greifing and raiding even on PvE servers where that kind of activity is ""not allowed"" (Can only be enforced when an Admin is on and witnesses said raiding) is ruining the game.The developers know about this already however and they're looking into ways to circumvent people simply building walls over a base's defenses to break in and steal everything. I'm still unsure how they're going to fix the hacker problem however. Any server that's PvP enabled is simply unplayable at the moment. Fresh spawn killers and noclip flying hackers with aimbots are rampant everywhere .I still recommend this game though.

2014-07-24,0,0,1248,True,Recommended,For an Alpha it's a well put together game. Obviously it has glitches but don't buy an alpha if that's an issue. The game was fun for the 200ish hours I played but I won't be playing any more until the final version comes out. I just don't have the time to invest into the game. If you have a family or a real job expect to get raided at odd hours by summer break kids or people who have the time to play constantly. Overall I would recommend it.,Rust

2016-06-26,2,1,1272,False,Recommended,Review from 2015/2016 Game is great. I call it 8/8. Love the effort coming from the creators and love how I can draw pretty pictures of swastikas on signs and place them in random towns and around my base to keep the ni***** out of me swamp.If you play Rust and see a sign with a swastika and something such as RPD New World Order or IDK then stay teh f*** out me swamp kkkEDIT (After XP System Release 2016) Adding this after the XP System was released I feel that the system of player XP tracking gave Rust a new feeling that makes you want to play and grind levels as fast as you can to be the best on the servers and unlock craftables before other players. I love all the effort coming from Facepunch studios and look forward to see what they have coming up later on. I will admit that this update created hassles for many players including glitches and XP wipes however the game is still in Early Access so that is still expected. For anyone who hasen't played Rust since the release of the XP System I would definitely recommend to come on Rust and check it out. Edit as of 2017/2018 This game is still alright however in my opinion has become stale and harder to play as a solo or small group. To get anywhere in terms of progression this game has become slightly more of a grind less than XP however instead of just farming nodes you have to farm supplies for your base keep your base active with the resources and farm components such as scrap to get anywhere and be able to unlock blueprints to craft guns meds clothes etc. I enjoy having the test bench allowing players a preview of whats to come but my thoughts are based on main build. The game has changed since February to monthly updates on main build and besides adding in scientists that roam around roads and rad towns like zombies and adding in the neutral zone I feel the game needs to be drastically changed to have that feeling Rust used to have. It used to feel like a video game it was fun and I could stay up and spend my life away on it. Nowadays I get bored after a few hours it's become to advance for me. The game is great and has great potential don't get me wrong but it's a lot different and seems to be changing in the future. The graphics are great as it uses Unity engine with monthly updates on main build and I definitely would recommend this game over practically any survival game out there. The playerbase and potential is superior to any other game on the market.Also unpopular opinion but I think XP system was the best of the games potential. Components are garbage in my opinion but that's why it's an UNPOPULAR OPINION.,Rust

2016-01-28,4,1,1519,True,Recommended,As night begins to set in I know it's time to run but I do it ever so quietly so my footsteps are not heard. You may think I do this out of fear but fear it is not. And when I see a glimmer of light in the distance I feel hope but not for the reason you're thinking of. I follow the light not daring to lose sight of it knowing that I may never find it again. And as the light becomes closer I begin to slow down knowing that my presence may scare it away. The light that seemed to be moving so fast before now comes to an abrupt stop. But I know better and hide in the bushes before it sees me. You see there is a much more cynical motive behind my actions for I am not running from a predator but because I am the predator.I smirk as my prey seems to be blissfully unaware of me and the tragedy that is about to occur. But just as I am about to attack I halt and stay hidden. Not because I suddenly feel guilty or that I am in the wrong but because it gives me an adrenaline rush like no other to stay hidden in the dark and to stalk your prey unnoticed. Of course this comes naturally when you hunt the most cunning creature of them all.After I have followed my prey far enough once I have known my prey long enough and once I've proven that I am the more cunning one of all I decide it's time to attack my prey before daylight hits. I leave my hiding spot and reveal myself to my prey. Of course by now my prey knows it's too late to run and accepts its' fate that is rightly deserved. And at that very moment I do what must be done for the good of the country and.......... deport the illegal immigrant back to Mexico. #cantstumpthetrump #donaldforpresident #buildawall #deportillegals,Rust

2015-12-28,2,1,1857,True,Recommended,Hey there well I think I'll give this review a shot. So I bought this game somewhere in 2014 it was a lot different. The graphics and gameplay was not as good as it is now but the game has improved alot. Im not good at reviews! I stopped playing it but recently discovered it and gave it a try. Not knowing what to expect I join a server talk to people and ask their advice. Got some funny feedback but there are some people willing to help. After I knew what to do and how to make a house I ran around collecting recourses and met people on my journey. I realised they live nearby and showed them my house when it was finished. Then I logged off in my house but when I got back I was naked again and no tools or anything my wall was broken and my stuff was stolen. Basically you dont go to strangers and tell them where your house are. I have seen people build castle size bases with lots of spikes dont knock on their gate they will snipe you with their bolty (a powerful bolt action rifle) You can give it a try but I recommend doing it naked without any items in your inventory.So now to rate the gameGraphics 8 out of 10 Amazing graphics might want to lower itGameplay 9 out of 10 Very fun but once someone gets C4 and big weapons... well they raid you and take your stuffI think I can only rate those I'm not good at reviews!Hope you get the game and hopefully this review helped!,Rust

2013-12-15,0,0,45,True,Recommended,Great concept and execution. This game has great potential to be one of the finest independent games out there. Only problems I have encountered is that there tends to be some hackers in some of the servers teleporting and having unlimited ammo and the fact that the majority of the community are so hostile and will shoot and kill you on sight! Honestly on multiple occassions I was just settling into a new house/s I had made (after spending a long time scavenging and getting materials such as wood and stone) and the next thing you know I get killed and raided this has happened to me multiple times. Even when you respawn and have nothing but the basic starting equipment people still tend to shoot you. Hopefully the community becomes better but all in all the game is pretty epic and has solid gameplay.,Rust

2014-03-03,0,0,310,True,Recommended,There was an era of gaming when death meant severe consequences ingenuity meant survival darkness meant vulnerability.Rust captures everything that made games of 15 years ago so much fun. You have a lot to lose based on your decisions. There is no one there to hold your hand or there might be it just depends on the server you join. Making the wrong decision can mean hours of back tracking. You're thrusted into an environment that doesn't have rules. You use your every tool to survive.The game is only in alpha now but it's already one of the most fun and intense games I've ever played.Get ready for frustation elation innovation and mostly procrastination.,Rust
2015-04-20,1,1,698,True,Not Recommended,"(Old version)A couple months ago i would have told you this is the greatest game ever made and i had wet dreams about it every single time i tried to sleep so i never sleeped and played rust all night instead and this was before the release of new rust but i see it for what it is now. A dead game filled with cancer ridden punching bags constantly bullied in school who go on this game with a non exisitant anticheat flying around double doming you laughing as they smack their keyboard screaming like the little bchillz fan boy skids they are ""yer dead"" Every server has a misleading title (russians) under the wrong category dead or simply filled with hackers.If their not using hacks then their editing ngc files so they cant see walls ceilings doors etc and quite literally walking or suiciding into your base by placing a sleeping bag making it quite useless to bother making a massive base because the second you log off you will have the constant discomfort of someone glitching into your base no c4 needed no nothing and walking away with everything you ing grinded for. Somehow if you actually manage to find a server after hours of looking the chances of it actually having good plugins or active admin/admins that aren't little kids that don't know much about the game is very low. big waste of 20$ oh and i obviously don't need to go into detail on the ""new"" rust because that is even more of a joke then the keyboard warrior hacking squeakers screaming profanity at you as you hear their parent beating them in the background. Worst part is this game had lots of potential and what did they do? they threw away everything left it to die said they would never update it again and started over again with new ""rust"" i still had faith this game could do bug things even after the countless months of it looking the exact same with minimal updates and a poor anti cheat servers i would play daily out gunning guns in every single fight would all the sudden turn into double doming gods the next day running across split town in 3 seconds. It was so easy to get cheats for this game and so easy to get away with it it's sad but hey who knows maybe it wasn't hacks they probably just have a good headset.

Just last night my team and I raided multiple homes of their goods. Now that being said I do wish there were more stuff to craft and more premade towns to explore. The map is a good size but there's only a small part of it that has the towns that spawn the good loot. And there are some glitches like wolves inside the ground attacking you. But this game if played right is one of the best out there and I can't wait to see what they have in store for it next.,Rust

2015-12-15,0,0,82,True,Recommended,The game is good for those who are extremely competative because people in this game will walk over their best friend's body just to get a simple item. In this game you can not trust anyone and if you go in solo you are going to have a bad time. People will gladly waste rare ammo just go kill a new player with no gear and you will not stand a chance if you got not have a gun or at the very least a crossbow. If you are into base building raiding pvp etc then rust is your game however I would not recomend playing unless you have at least several other friends. Final thoughts Rust is extremely competative and will show no mercy to anyone old or new but if you think you can handle such a brutal game and pull through to beat the competition then Rust is the game for you.,Rust

2014-07-15,1,1,300,True,Recommended,Enter a world where everything wants to kill you. Rust is a survival and crafting game. Your worst enemy is not wolves starvation bears or radiation but other players. Kill or be killed. Loot or be looted. Survive thrive and don't die. In rust body language is key. One accidental pull of the hatchet could mean a shotgun shell in your head. Good luck to all who want to survive in rust.(Update 11/25/16)Besides massive changes in the Rust system over 2 3 years much work will have to be continued on the game though some of my most enjoyable gaming experiences have existed on Rust Island 2013 and Procedurally Generated Maps.,Rust

That speaks for itself.It's a very brutal and unforgiving game but that's what makes it so rewarding. it's hard not to get upset when hours of work gets destroyed by raiders. but this is what makes the good parts of the game more enjoyable.Also the devs release updates weekly and are very connected to the community.,Rust

Absolutely fantastic game and its not even finished yet. I am usually a solo player but recently i have been teaming up with some buddies and it really takes the game to a whole new level. Getting geared up and running through the forest/mountains with your buds while your heart is racing because you don't know if you're being watched or not what's around the next corner or if a bear is looking at you like a steak dinner.

2015-02-21,1,1,295,True,Recommended,Update as of 2016 Still getting rekt by clans of 6+ people on most servers. Being a lonely player sucks a little bit. I thought I'd find some people to play with but everyone seems to be a jerk in this game. (No offense to anyone) Useless to build a base with armored stuff because once you finish protecting it servers will be wiped anyway.Saltiest community since Call of Duty. I was called names and stuff for being raided. Dindu nuffin' and I was the moron. Oh well. I heard that so many players did my mom as well. MOM WHO'S MY FATHER ?!? WE'LL NEED A DISCUSSION LATER ...Still this is a fun game! Lots of possibilities. Need a little bit of polishing and optimization every now and then. I mostly get 40+ FPS using a GTX 770 with FX 8130 overclocked CPU which is still good for an early access game. Game is now smoother than the legacy version which was a lot uglier than we we have now!I'd like to see the crafting with blueprints back though.

Nope they are not. Bears bears everywhere. Ok you respawned in the middle of nowhere. You hear noises and you get a blurry vision just like you took drugs. Boom radiation killed you. You found some cool guys you wanna build a base. Everyone collected goods and ready to build it. But some guy shows up with a fine a$$ gun and shoots you all. But you are ambitious cuz you paid 30 dollaz to this bad boy. Seriously when you die it tooks about 15 minutes to find your friends.

2015-03-30,1,1,685,True,Recommended,So all and all its really a sad game. As far as i can tell its a open retelling of that Movie No Escape from the 90s.

There's lots of different things you need to do such as Building a base Finding a Group Getting End Game gear Looting Towns Raiding Pvp'ing with other players Gathering Resources and more. The game is of course still in it's Alpha stage and is no where near what the final product will be but from what it is right now I reckon it'll be one of the best survival type games out there. I'd rate this game an 8/10 as of now just due to it being a little too easy and too much Pvp based however even more variety will probably be shown in future updates.,Rust

2014-01-11,0,0,28,True,Recommended,At the moment the game isn't very fleshed out. However from my experiences so far it quite like Don't Starve played out in the style of DayZ. While there are no Tim Burton esk style monsters you will start off gathering resources building huts and then making homes. You have to worry about food confort health and radiation in this build which can all be done rather easily. Building an actual home is an actual challenge which is good but will be annoying when you start off. I think you should only get this game (ATM) with either a few friends or if you are able to put up with slightly boring gameplay (to start with).,Rust

It's at the point where I tried to find a modded server with 10 100x the gathering rate so when this t happens I won't even give a Recap Loved the game (Notice the past tense please) Lag will ruin you atleast once a week Hackers are on every official server and the Devs rarely do anything about them.

Tons of communication from devs about updates (hour by hour via twitter) and a roadmap of planned features that just look great.Game is fully playable already as in you can entertain yourself for hours with the content already in place.Generally hacker free with a decent anti cheat system.This game is for pessimists and created by a pessimist.

2014-01-16,0,0,137,True,Recommended,I recommend this game fully. The game is ridiculously fun especially if you can make friends on a server. That ontop of being able to form your own super houses and always having the suspense of losing everything is what kept me playing even after being raided multiple times and having to restart from scratch. The constant updates keeps me from getting slammed with the game all at once so that's just an added benefit. Overall the gameplay is suprisingly stable for it being in alpha and I have brought some of my friends into the game as well because of it.,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,22,True,Recommended,"I like the game even though i stopped playing it because i don't want to play it too much before it gets released. Bearing in mind that it's really REALLY early Alpha and just a few (in relation what the finished product will offer) items you can craft there are for example just Torches and Campfires as a Light source and you can't even stick the Torch to the wall or anything to get decent light at night in your house. I would only recommend to buy the game if you plan to play it later when it's finished anyway and want to have influence in the Developement process and want to see how the game is growing. I played it for near 15 Hours now and im at a Point where i say ""Im finished with it there is not much to see for me any more"". If you're searching for a playable Survival Game i wouldn't recommend you to buy it because it's nowhere near finished. Also i want to warn you that the game in it's current state feels more like a KoS (Kill on Sight ) game if you are not playing on a pure PvE Server with just a few people (max 20) you will meet alot of other Players and they will try to kill you guaranteed. I made once the Mistake and helped a guy screaming for help and let him in he tried to kill me luckily i won but that is just one example. Also the spawning system is not that great in the first night(s) you need to find pigs/Chicken or you will starve and you got absolutely no influence where you spawn. I must admit it took me atleast 5 lifes to get really started because you need to be in a decent location with Animals around and stone/wood logs. Having no (ingame) map doesn't help also even though i actually enjoyed it after a certain point. With time you really can recognize the environment but i used a map of Rust which i found on the internet (and which i will link at the end of the review) which helped me to somewhat know in which direction i need to go and what kind of resources are in certain areas and just to know where i am in general. I know that all sounds very negative but i can see where the game is heading and the atmosphere is actually really great. So if you want to have influence in an upcoming Survival title with alot of Potential and/or want to try it now since you will buy it later anyway go for it.Links https //rustmap.net/",Rust

I don't like taking games too seriously and the xp/bp system made it so I could have fun without having to worry about my gear too much. Now everytime I die it feels like a punch in the face because all my gear needs components that can only be found and not crafted.Some people like this kind off high risk gameplay and I get that it just isn't for me.

You spend several days building and harvesting and the typical grind to have it ruined by hackers and script kiddies without a life. We built a pretty secure base with everything max upgraded 5 work cabinets also sealed off in heavy armored sheds covering all the surrounding area of our base and they built stairs right over the ""Unauthorized"" building area (which was not tampered with nor did anyone but myself authorize on it). And they came right over the fence built more in our base and when we shot them it did no damage. They were able to tear through the heavy metal platting on our house in about 30 seconds. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A GAME AND PUT SECURITY INTO IT THAT IS WORTH A LICK &gt &gt THEN ADVERTISE ""Our game sucks we have hackers but good luck anyways.""

But to play it you need to be skillful. If you have never played FPS Shooter games you should have no problems as the guns in this game have their own handling. It Requires medium PC(Even and an Intel core i5 GT540 can play it) so you can shoot and aim more accurately and enjoy the game more without FPS drops. Recomended is to play this game with a lot of friends and not alone as you'll get borred REALLY easy. A lot of updates to come and a lot of stuff to change in this game. I highly recommend this game.,Rust
2014-07-11,0,0,35,True,Recommended,I've enjoyed playing this game right up till the part where I was raided twice on a 'peaceful' server. I think the fact that they have not released a dedicated server for those of us who already have the hardware to run one is a pretty poor choice in my opinion. I know I'm not alone when I say that some people would only like to play with their friends and trusted people instead of on a public server where hacking seems rampant. My hopes is that once the game gets closer to release they will open the dedicated server code to everyone.. then and only then will I look into playing again. It's a bunch of fun don't get me wrong... but playing a game all day then taking a quick 20 minutes to eat dinner and coming back to your dead body and burnt down house isn't so much fun. I have my fingers crossed for this game.,Rust

2016-07-29,0,0,154,True,Not Recommended,This game at a time was one of my favorite games on steam. I used to love playing this game alone and building my own base collecting my own items etc. In the past few months this game has completely turned from being a game of survival from animals and natural events to who can build the biggest clan. As a solo player it is IMPOSSIBLE to load into an official server at the beginning of a wipe and successfully survive as a solo player. Due to the new xp system you would think that this would cause an easier way of obtaining these necessary blueprints but instead it caused clans to be the ONLY way to survive. Sure it is easy to make a bunch of tools and have your clan recruits and slaves to farm with it while you get the xp. As a solo player you have to grind for these items/xp towards getting these items. Also nerfing spears? Bows? Crossbows? Headshotting a naked TWICE with a bow is absolutely ridiculous. Every player that is in a clan in the rust community all started out as a lone rust solo player. Those of us that choose to stay solo are at a major disadvantage and I really hope that those of you at facepunch can see this. For the time being I recommend all of you solo players out there to find a clan if you decide to continue playing this game because without one you will be eradicated within the first 4 hours of the wipe. Good luck.,Rust

If your work horse can support the running requirements then grab it if not grab it then build a new rig that will,Rust

2017-03-17,0,0,959,True,Recommended,Although this game is still only in Aplha I would still consider it to be one of the greatest games I have played. There is tons of content with more being added every update. With lots of PVP and some PVE there's always something to do. If you have copious amounts of free time then I would say this game is definitely worth picking up.,Rust
2015-12-27,0,0,218,True,Recommended,I've played Rust for 153.1 hrs and I love it. I've met friends built giant structures/bases hunted and been hunted and have killed so many fresh spawn. This game is unique and wonderful in many aspects. The community is great constantly getting updated via playrust.com a reddit with many contributers and a trello with many upcoming / potential items to be added in game.I recommend this if you enjoy a) seeing small everywhere. b) love spending hours building and protecting bases. c) want to meet new people / make new enemies.,Rust

2017-01-19,0,0,3239,True,Recommended,Rust is a very beautiful and fun excape from reality! Its also a Survival game! Survive at all costs! Surviving means pvp and stealing from the rich even being rich and fighting off the people trying to steal your juicy loot. Moral of the story is its a hardcore survival game don't even trust your mom! Ive been screwed by people I have based with for years. Just remember its only pixels and we all only play for fun!

At night you are crouched in your small fire lit hut hoping you hear no formidable bangs on the door.

2015-05-28,0,0,66,True,Recommended,"The rewrite is a significant improvement over the first iteration of the game. Crafting is a much more pleasurable and customizable to your taste and preference. Some of the weapon additions seem to have gone a little over the top however (e.g. Rocket Launcher). Overall it's been a lot of fun to get back into.However it is poorly optimized at the time of this review (Alpha) and you can expect to have to tone down the graphics rather significantly to maintain a smooth frame rate. On a 780ti 1440p the ""Beautiful"" graphics preset needs significant tweaking to maintain 60FPS.",Rust
2014-11-05,0,0,200,True,Recommended,Rust is becoming the game it always should have been it was never fully completed (much like DayZ Standalone) but with the new experimental development (Now the main branch) it is clear Garry and the crew are trying their hardest to make this game the best it can be.

I love rust and it is great game. However its really sick that this is even a option and I dont know why the devs keep posting more and more gruesome pics of human meat. It is one of the stupidiest i have ever seenI payed money for a really cool game and when the new version got announced i thought that they would make the game better but it seem i was wrong.,Rust

You'll gather some stuff finally craft a house and armor. you'll find a gun blueprint or a body with one on it then it will happen. The second you hear a round fire off and it hit near you you will begin to shake you will be begin to panic like someone is actually trying to chase you down and put a round in your head and then when you get away you will expierence an uncontrollable bliss like sense of relief.

Of course there is and boring part of the game resource extraction. But it is always possible to vary the shooting and so on. True RUST has over work and work.

2014-01-03,0,0,84,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game but of course because it is in development it still has some problems when it comes to servers so can be a bit annoying when you get lots of stuff and a great house and then you cant join the server or it spawns you on the other side of the map.,Rust

Then all went wrong a speedhacker opened our door butchered both of us ... We watched him butcher us as we can't do anything to avoid him. All 5 10 hours worth of stuff that we collected were gone. If you are thinking to buy this game just please don't buy it until they implement an Anti cheat system. I can't really recommend this game at this state but its still playable with friends. 07/01/2015,Rust
2014-02-17,0,0,345,True,Recommended,By far the best Alpha game I have played. Very addictive. Brings in aspects of Minecraft and games like WarZ into (what is currently) a good balance of crafting resource gathering and raiding resulting in a fairly quick paced game that has a tendency to generate high levels of paranoia. There is massive potential for this games evolution. I plan on playing many hours in the near future.,Rust
2015-06-06,3,1,29,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival styled game and still in alpha. so far the game has come far in every aspect and it's fun to shoot other mofo in the head and scream hail satan while you smash their heads in with rocks and dance naked around their bodies,Rust
2015-06-07,1,1,433,True,Recommended,Rust was not at all promising at the start as it was still in Alpha most of the server's were filled to the brim with hackers but now Rust is a completely new game as it focuses it more on survival as most items are crucial to you surviving when i first starting playing the new rust it became more realistic as you needed clothes for warmth and if you were to swim naked you would come out freezing as would normaly. One of the biggest changes to Rust was the rad zones before on the old Rust rad zones were always the most heated zones as they were always being contested now there are simply no rad zones there are barrels which are spread out throughout the map and there is always the occasional air drop every know and again there also made guns more rare which i love because starting as a fresh spawn in the old Rust and trying to get resources i often found myself dying over and over again to people in full kev but now i just mostly see naked men with bows running around. All i have to say is that the new Rust is what a wanted from the old Rust as it improves all the features from the old and makes its a loveable game again.,Rust

2013-12-15,0,0,77,True,Recommended,Essentially Day Z+Minecraft RUST to put it simple. This is one of the more functional early release games but it too has some of its own flaws.The quick acquiring of modern weapons and explosives causes the game to quickly deterioate into Search and Destroy. Survival is no longer required at that point. This is why the community is suggesting a more primitive weapon layout.. because you really just can't go out into the wild and craft a modernized M4.,Rust

2014-05-05,0,0,140,True,Recommended,In the beginning there was a rock. Then a hatchet. Then a stronger hatchet. Then a pickaxe. The point is that the game is incredibly fun to play alone or with friends it'll allow you for up to 70 hours of fun gameplay before you start getting too used to things. Eventually like all games you'll start to get bored with it but for 70+ hours of fun its worth the money and hopefully they'll release some more updates soon with new content that'll allow for even more hours of fun.,Rust

Start completely naked with a rock some bandages and a torch one has to go through the wilds to build up supplies and create a home. Everything out there can and will kill you such as other people bears wolves and hunger. If you have trouble getting started just go to a lower population server but if you are looking to fight or die trying go to high population servers. Have fun and most of all survive!,Rust

2014-02-10,0,0,8,True,Recommended,One of the most stressful games by far in a good way that is.More like Dayz and minecraft you must survive and craft build and survive.When i started to play this game i quit the next second because of how many times ive been shot in the headwhen i spawn in but once i started to play again i didnt die as much.You need to learn the basics of the game to actully survivrYou cant just go YOLO and actully survive trust me ive done it before.Rust is going to have to be a 8.P.S.I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!!,Rust

This game is still in the ""Alpha"" phase of game making and is already utterly fantastic. ""Hit things with rocks get chicken."" The basis of the game... Already amazing. Ontop of this you get to run around in a seemingly endless wilderness of rolling hills and grassy plains. Craft anything from bows and arrows to M4's and Bolt Action Rifles. Truly stunning graphics and customization to reduce any kind of lag. So many servers to choose from no matter where you live. I'd love to see more games like this in the next few years.

2014-10-03,0,0,374,True,Not Recommended,good game idea with a lot of potential with challenging and engaging early game. with that said it needs some sort of enviromental hazzards or enemies since bears and wolfs don't cut it. once you have your base setup and a good food supply there really isn't anything to do but mess with other players. i believe this is part of the reason there is such a huge issue with hackers running rampant the lack of late game goals and limited manipulation of ones enviroment leave you little to do once your dug in. maybe if the rad zones where also npc strong holds with better drops and npc's with guns and buildings that need c4 to enter it would give the game the challenge it needs to compete with titles like life is fedual and 7 days to die. the idea of roaming canable tribes that could attack you at your own home (triggered only to attack while someone is logged on in the building would be prefered) would make the need to fortify more important the ease of late game survivability makes the fun meter drop greatly the longer you play. as it stands it has just become a play ground for people with modded files and everyone has to build their homes with the latest hacks in mind instead of what would slow/stop a legit player from getting to your items and i feel that the mix between super challenging early game (which i personaly like but many players don't seem to) and boring late game has led to the rampant use of hacks which in turn drops the number of players willing to play on offical servers and takes away the possibility of a competive player without hacks.,Rust

2014-06-27,0,0,158,True,Not Recommended,"RIP Off save your 20$.This game was fun at the begining when it suddenly became famous in January/february but since then there were almost no updates all the updates were small and stupid.And now they are trying to ""remake"" the whole stupid game so it's like a new alpha this game developers are very bad when will the full version will be out? in 2016???? haha rip 20$.feels like this game had no updates for 6 monthes and every update there's usually a reset which makes you lose your progress.Update NOT EARLY ACCESS LIES 2013 IT CAME OUT FAIL DEVS NAZI COMMUNITY Recently started playing this game again Found a sleeping dude on the grass killed him got a rifle. Was on my way to my house a little kid asked for some food ignored didn't have. Shot a warning shot then his friends which are kids too ambushed me and i got killed. Got abit off respawned made a pistol and killed one of them. His friends started chasing me back to my house. Due to a lag spike in game one of them managed to get inside and get me killed. The door was closed so he wasn't able to exit he cried and lied that he would give me my items back if 'll open the door. Started playing troll songs to him while he was begging for me to open the door. Suicided in the console spawned in my bed that he didn't break killed him with a rock. The kids got afraid then and stayed away from me. Logged off Decided to play the new rust it forced me to install an unknown anti cheat. Got into a nice server had abit of lags even though i have a good PC and i put it on ""good"" graphics settings. Started to learn how to farm and stuff hit a tree with my rock many times it was giving me 10 wood per hit endlessly Saw a big mension 2 guys were staring at me from one of the mension's windows they decided to start shooting at me i began running away one of them started chasing me and killed me.

2014-06-13,0,0,133,True,Recommended,Edited 09 02 2015Many people are giving this game a hard time as to be fair it has not a huge ammount of playability after some time you can get sameish. But there is a huge ammount of development going on join the trello board to see daily updates. This is a great survival game and what I have read it can only get better. Removing the zombies was a little annoying but I understand why as well. Im always waiting for the next update and reading about whats comming. Thanks to a friend he purchased a server for us to play on so we can have a PvE enviroment without the random killing from other players. PvP in these games can be a pain.Keep up the good work facepunch. Highly recommended as a survival game a little boring at the moment for some but im gonna stick with the game and keep on trying the changes and keep help my mates massive tower 40+ stories high so far with a maze of doors even I get lost in the maze we have made.,Rust
2014-03-23,0,0,1135,True,Recommended,Great concept with much potential however I find that there are not many patches adding any truly progressive and exciting content. Game gets a bit redundant after about 300 hours I suggest playing with a group of friends or else you will fall victim to the rage. Over all I enjoyed the aspect of developing a strong team and raiding other advanced players when there was any actual challenge on a server. Currently though I find that Facepunch needs to start adding in patches with much more new and intriguing content instead of minor fixes. Looking forward to the completed product though and I could only hope they can eradicate a majority of the hackers swarming official servers.,Rust

2013-12-23,0,0,168,True,Recommended,Pros Playable. Hours of game play. Thousands of servers to play on. Thousands of people to play agenst/with. Sometimes friendly people to meet. Every meat is Chicken Breast so everything does taste like Chicken!Cons Many bugs. Doesnt get as updated as it used to. Needs more work. Community is a bunch of Jack*****. (Reguard the good and nice people. Theyre cool.)Personal Review Very good and interesting game. Yes it has some bugs and was made by FacePunch and Garry but it shows a lot of potential to to. Im expecting more updates and an even better game soon... hopefully. I love this game so far even though its hard at the beginning and later on is just about grinding for wood stone and other mats.I recommend this game if you want a decent survival game that has minnor bugs and a ehish Community. Good for the survival aspects but bad that you have to grind for more and more mats to do just about anything. Dont trust anyone... 8/10,Rust
2013-12-24,1,1,251,True,Recommended,Very addictive game for an Alpha game the game is very enjoyable. I am sure when this game is finished it will consume more of my time than my wife would like )You start the game naked with only a rock bandages and a torch. You progress in the game attempting to survive and salvage loot kill animals for food and when the opportunity presents it self kill other players for their goods.There are limited resources areas that you may find what you need to survive and only part of the map you play with other players has loot areas where there are ruins to explore. There are many different servers in this MMO type game.,Rust

( I know I should store my items) but could you make it possible to highlight your backpack if you were just killed to find it? I know other ppl can take my backpack which is fine but I was right near my camp and for the life of me couldnt find backpack. I hope you can tweak that! Decay. My husband is an actual carpernter and since this is a survival based game the decay is way way to fast. Untreated wood will decay in 1 month. The rate of decay is way to fast to maintain. Please tweak that.Other than that I have nothing else so far. Game is fun and addictingTip This game is wayyyy easier if you can find allies before joining a particular server.Thanks!!!!!,Rust

2014-02-21,0,0,39,True,Recommended,OMG... so funny game hard at the start but when you get some weapons it is fun. It is a BEAST!! game ),Rust
2014-02-21,0,0,96,True,Recommended,Rust is highly entertaining and fun in the fact that you get to run around a small/medium sized map killing scavenging and coming across the odd naked fresh spawns wielding rocks. The survival side of the game is enjoyable and it's fun being able to build big base's with friends and conquer your foes with either low quality made weapons or heavy duty weapons such as the shotgun or M4.If you are going to buy the game you must be able to throw all your friendlyness you possess out of the window and just gun down anything you see moving. The players will not give you a chance to survive so don't give them a chance.Furthermore the only thing that let's this game down for me is the new update which removed zombies added wolves and bears with unfair health and damage stats and messed up the whole roleplay of the survival game. I'm truly hoping in the coming updates they improve this.,Rust

2015-12-27,0,0,304,True,Recommended,I don't normally write reviews but because I was umming and arring about buying Rust especially as I already had Ark I almost didn't get it because of some of the poor reviews.Smooth nice radial menus to interract with things good graphics fun/crazy.The maps are procedurely generated so unlike Ark there aren't always those hotspots that pretty much make a player invincible plus the servers get wiped every so often. OH NO MY HARD WORK... right? Wrong. Once I figured out what to do within a day and I did end up blowing a whole day on it I had a stone building with 2 floors some guns and a furnace. To build you get 100 wood (you get 10 per hit with your rock on a tree) and make paper then build the building plan then you get enough wood to lay down wood panels now you build a hammer and with enough stone you go upto the panel click and upgrade real fluid.If you're a soft touch and can't take dying don't play this game! If you can go in with an open mind and enjoy it then do! A few ways I died Heard a guitar thought wtf? A guy and his friend were running round raiding together and his friend was strumming the guitar I ran upto the musician and struck him with my rock then got my spine blew out by a shotgun. Afterwards while I died slowly on the floor he crouched poorly strumming his instrument.I cooked a human I killed ate too quick and died from it not being proper meat.A guy with a santa hat came upto me with a shotgun and was friendly until I hit him with a rock.10/10 rocks have evil powers.A few kills I made once I got my building With a metal pickaxe I destroyed a guy farming wood.Someone came to attack me accidentally threw his spear I picked it up before he got it and chased him down.Blasted someone in the back with my pistol.Planted landmines round my house. Honestly buy it 7.50 is worth it I hate that I have other things to do today but I'll be straight on it when I'm done.,Rust
2014-02-22,0,0,86,True,Recommended,In my time i've seen plenty of games try to model a caveman's However Rust takes this to a new level and the next gen. Not only is the player character's bell end exquisitly sculpted you are also invited to the rewarding feeling of getting down to what you've wanted to do for all of your life. Savagely hit that with a large rock.But the fun doesn't stop there why not continue your brutal rampage by giving some local fauna a rock induced concussion.It deserves only the finest. Or if you're feeling particularily adventurous spice it up by firing shoddily made firearms at your bald naked peers.Over all this game truly knows what it is the players want in a malleable virtual island.,Rust

You've ed over so many people because of your damned Easy Anticheat who catches less hackers than it does regular players trying to just simply play and have a good time. I can no longer run this because of Easy Anticheat. Whenever I try to install it it simply cuts out and says I cancelled it which I did not. This happened on my old computer and since I have gotten one it has ran. It is now doing the same thing it did on my old PC which makes me outrageously angry. Which explains why I only have 16.7 hours. Overall Rust is not a good game to play with friends if you don't want to worry about being kicked off all the time.

But there's also down sides nothing is more depressing than logging on and seeing that your base was raided while you were asleep or at work.

2017-05-30,0,0,322,False,Not Recommended,Rust when it first came out was fantastic. Thew new Rust all in all is a great game but many features in terms of the community shine a very negative and hard to enjoy experience on the game. Pros +++ Nice graphics. Very well optimized. Great building dynamics. Great survival aspects (i.e Hunting Food etc.) Great servers. Weekly updates that actually add to the game and are also always small in size. Cons Scripts.Scripts.Scripts. 95% of gun fights you get in this game will consist of you being no recoil scripted by someone. Almost everyone uses them. The sense of raiding is gone. When Rust Legacy came out raiding would mean going to the enemies base and getting in a big gunfight and blowing through their base. Now everyone just raids you offline. Admins. Admins really do nothing in this game. If you report a scripter to an admin for using a no recoil script he's most likely using it as well. Guns are not only terrible but also ridiculously hard to find. Took my group of friends 3 days to find an AK body not even the gun. 90% grind 10% fighting. You will spend hours upon hours grinding away and gathering resources to be caught off guard in a 1 minute fight which results in you being killed by a group of 50. The total opposite to how legacy would play out much less time on the grind and more fun fighting. This game is made for people with no social life to even get started in this game takes days. Weeks to even get closed to being geared. Like mentioned above if you want to minimize of the time of the grind you need a group that hits double digits. Only get this game if the community of a multiplayer survival game does not effect you in any way. Rust Legacy adopted a type of arcade survival aspect which gave it such a large following. It didn't take so many hours and days to get a little bit of fun out of the game unfortunately this game does.,Rust

2016-04-23,0,0,67,True,Not Recommended,Rust Legacy was fun. While I see the benefit of a procedural map I preferred the set map. I'm not sure why Facepunch didn't give some map options... and on that point Facepunch has continued to add things to Rust but without players having any options. The most recent which has been highly publicized is the addition of genders. But a player's gender is permanently linked to Steam ID (and that doesn't mean it pulls gender from the Steam profile it is random and permanent). Rust Legacy was great because players had a great many options available to them. The fact that every server had the same map meant that if you encountered hackers or players started harassing you you could switch servers and starting over wasn't as bad because you already knew where you could pick up a few resources. Facepunch has reliably removed options for players since then and when features are added like unique avatars Facepunch doesn't want to give players any power over it. When development began on the current incarnation of Rust I thought I'd wait until it was somewhat more complete and start playing again. I tried to pick this game back up several times and each time I was disappointed by how poorly it runs how many hackers there are and the massive map on which I was not only lost but either very lonely or getting raided constantly. Facepunch sold this game to me by saying that they valued player feedback and we the players would influence the direction the game took. That statement is still on the website for anyone to see. That was clearly a lie. I have no interest in playing this game anymore and I've already requested a refund but I doubt that I'll get one since Facepunch is obviously trolling its players and if they're willing to do that why would they give me a refund?,Rust

2016-07-04,0,0,1502,True,Recommended,Ahoy sailors!Well... now that i have almost 1000 hours of RUST in less than 4 months ( that scares me specially cause i also work) i should definitely post a review on this awesome game.I started playing last March and it's been a hell of a ride from the 1st weapon found to the 1st chopper shot down.It has multiple layers of fun and the small bugs and glitches often help with that the exorcist bears the constructor eyeballs etc...It's a fast paced game specially if you are already experienced with the first steps after the wipes. (All servers wipe at least once a month on the 1st thursday)At first you will hate the wipes but as soon as you get more into the game you'll love them... OH the fresh starts!! )It's a harsh world if you go to high populated servers people will shoot first and ask after.Don't get attached to your precious stuff you will eventually be raided and lose it all. OMG NOT MY PRECIOUS M249!The ONE rule DO NOT TRUST ANYONE! (with a few exceptions ofc ))It doesn't have the best graphics nor the most complex crafting system the graphics are good and the crafting and bulding is user friendly and optimized.Thank God the inventory limits to slots and not weight... some players may prefer the weight system but i find it pretty annoying.Lacks more PvE! The chopper is the only PvE fight in game at the moment so expect PvP to be your main activity right after the gathering of resources.It has no vehicles so expect long walks in the bigger maps. Read somewhere the devs are planning to let us ride the 'now' wild horses.Who's gonna ride your wild horses Facepunch? That be me kk?The maps are procedural so there's no 2 servers with the same map and it changes every wipe cycle.Crashes some times has a few glitches (some are funny!) and residual cheating problems but every thursday we see new improvements and the Devs working actively in fixing and adding. It's Alpha folks!With the new XP system going live next thursday 7th of July 2016 some of the above might change. I think the game will be better leveled for all players and should go Beta pretty soon after this.Buy the game ) it's fun and addicting. I don't remember having so much fun and spend so many hours gaming since the vanilla WoW back in 2005. Check my plays.tv got a few videos there )Best regards Zaranza,Rust
2015-07-07,0,0,208,True,Recommended,I enjoy rust a lot graphically the game was nice playing on the lowest settings it could use a bit of tweaking but moving into higher again it can use tweaking for optimisation but apart from that the gameplay makes up for it.

2014-12-25,2,1,384,True,Recommended,Rust is pretty darn fun. Great sandbox style game lots of areas to explore and ever present danger to look out for.I know this game is a pre release so I do not expect it to be polished but there are a lot of graphical errors that tend to detract from the overall gaming experience. For example I watched my friend shoot an animal with a hunting rifle but instead of shouldering the weapon he looked like he was shooting his foot.This game needs a compass. Or a location function. Or a map. OR ANY directional functionality. If you have a friend who joins the server at the same time as you good luck finding them.This game is rough. You will die. A lot. If not from animals like bears and wolfs but from trolls and griefers. You will have finished mining and harvesting stacks of stuff only to find yourself getting hunted and killed by people who exist just to be on rust.Good luck,Rust

2014-05-08,0,0,216,True,Recommended,Despite me recommending this game it does have one glaring issue. The community. Honestly it is one of the only problems I have with the game. It looks pretty good runs well it has its fair share of excitement and it is VERY satisfying. I would predict that most of the people who gave the game negative reviews played primarilly on either large or official servers. Hands down a bad idea. Large servers and official servers have probably the worst communities I have ever seen in a game. It is a complete madhouse of people killing on sight and I can't sress that enough. If you want to avoid these terrible communities you're in luck! There are MANY small servers in the communtiy section that have great people on them. I have met many people on these small servers that want nothing more than to work together. If you want a great survival game that is pretty brutal and very satisfying PLAY RUST (but avoid big servers)!,Rust

Then you get use to people being cold blooded no reason killers you build your first shelter and maybe even a door. You run to the city for some loot go back to your ho... Someone just robed you. This idiot was literally sitting in front of your basic wooden shelter for 5 minutes and was bashing with his stone hatchet in to your doors to destroy it just to steal your... Wood.

2015-02-26,0,0,78,True,Not Recommended,Rust originates from Gary (of Gary's Mod) deciding he could make a finished DayZ like game in only a month. A year and a half later we still have a game in its alpha. Before I say don't buy this game let me talk about the good things that it does have. First (and most importantly) the game is being actively updated unlike many of the early access survival games. In fact a little while ago the game was completely rebooted in a newer gaming engine. So the game is always getting better and has a lot of potential to be a really good survival game. Now let's get into the bad. Like I said the game has a lot of potential but Gary is asking you to pay 20 dollars now for a game that could be really good in 3 years. As Gary has stated most games go through a development process that last several years but most studios don't start allowing players to play it until the end of the beta stage which ensures that you stay excited for the product. Imagine if only a moth after development began Nintendo allowed players to start playing a new Metroid game. The players would be furious that the game is so unfinished and would not be happy that they paid for the game now even though it's no where near done. Interviews with Gary show he has a hard time understanding this concept and he get's upset when players ask for more now. On a more technical level the game is obviously not finished. Glitches are quite common there is only one player model and map cheating has not been reeled in it the crafting system is still pretty bare bones animals are barely programmed (animals drop random meat and some meat doesn't actually do anything) the hunger system is (at the time I played the game last) broken textures for buildings look bad and unpolished and there is very very little PVE in the game. If not for other players you could easily survive forever once you get your initial base set up and your first gun made. Rather than the game balancing threats from a hostile environment and other players the game simple relies on other players being threatening enough to give you a sense of fear for your life. The main menu is broken as well. The game doesn't remember what servers you've been on and the favorite server list doesn't work yet which means you have to remember the name of your server in a sea of server names. There is also no easy way to turn down game volume making it hard to hear people you're steam chatting with. I also have experienced framerate issues unless I play on pretty low resolutions and as I have a pretty powerful PC I'm going to assume it's that the game is not properly done right. In conclusion this could perhaps be a really really good game one day but one day is not too day. I regret paying 20 dollars for a game that's barely been developed. With the switching of the game engine (which in theory is good since it shows that Gary is still working on his project) the development process will be set way back as well. If you like survival games and you think this one looks good put it on your wishlist and keep an eye on it. When it's much much closer to being finished it could be worth the 40 50 or even $60 price tag it will have but it's just not worth 20 in its current state.,Rust

2014-07-29,0,0,62,True,Recommended,This game has a lot potential. If you have a fast temper and no patience this game is not for you. You will deal with dying by KOSers getting raided and losing all you've worked for. That's why after my first 20 deaths (excluding suicides) I trust no one I don't KOS I just ignore or ask someone to go away then kill.

I am AWARE it's an alpha phase game but until these developers realize some of their content needs adjustments in it's gathering and holding of resources and the hacking plague that roams free in their game... it's NOT worth a pick up I doubt I would even return so this review won't likely be updated.",Rust

Ask them to enjoy it with you! Together it's much more fun.The first 2 ingame days maybe a pain but with friends you can easily build things up.If you are more the ""solo survivalist"" no problem! Search for a hidden place maybe behind some big or small mountains where its unlikely that someone in the next days will come.Build your little shelter for the first ingame week and begin to harvest wood to begin to build you dream survival house.Let's go hunting! First for animals then for humans.Better don't run up the streets the first week without a gun.Things can change very fast.A sunny wood harvest day can easily be a struggle when doing so.But check it out yourself!

2014-07-03,0,0,371,True,Recommended,I have mixed feelings about this game but it's good. Don't get attatched to your stuff. Or your server even the official ones dissapear. Other players are s avoid them at all cost. Don't buy this game if you don't have a mic you'll die a whole lot for no reason. If you want to play seriously find a no C4 or grenade server. Otherwise your will be taken from you.,Rust
2014-06-29,0,0,686,True,Not Recommended,Worst game every this could have been a good game but they messed everything up. Everyone is a hacker and people glitch nto your base infront of your eyes not playable and a game overall. they say that they are working on the experimental version while the real rust i so its impossible to play. DON'T BUY THIS GAME. look how many hours i spent you will regret it,Rust
2014-06-21,0,0,396,True,Recommended,Such an excellent concept and for an alpha it is suprising how playable it is.I have obviously sunk some hours into it and I have no criticism of the game.Only the players. And not the KOS'ers I love those guys.They keep me on edge and make the experience. It's the problem that noone seems to have a solution for and it is hackers. There is nothing more demoralising than farming a massive amount of resources and gear to only have your place raided by hackers. Raiding is a part of the game and it is what makes it exciting. You need to be dynamic in constructing your base so that it will give even an experienced raider a difficult time. But when a hacker (or even worse a group of them of which I had to endure) can drop a defender from huge distances with pistols and then can see the shortest path to your storage rooms it really cripples the experience.It has really disheartened me in continuing to play Rust. Especially when the experimental version looks really promising. You can go to active admin servers but you have to worry about admin abuse as well. Although the one I played early on didn't seem to have any problems with that.Still play the game. It is awesome. Just completely avoid servers with no active admins.,Rust

2015-01-20,0,0,376,True,Recommended,When I first saw Rust back when it released it looked fine but I really didn't take much interest in it. Perhaps it was because of my heavy investment in other games at the time but I didn't really notice Rust again until several months after as its release popularity rush was coming to a close. I watched a few videos and eventually mentally recorded it as a cool game that I might want to pick up some day. Some time later on the 31st of December I decided to purchase Rust.My initial Rust experience was quite fun but basically involved running around the wild terrain and dying constantly to naked men. However though I wasn't necessarily playing seriously I felt the game gave off a sort of mysterious vibe as if there was so much to learn and the path to mastery would be a fun one. Almost 51 hours later I have for the most part reached that mastery and I can confirm that the path in question was most definitely fun. However despite what others might say about a lack of content I still feel Rust has plenty more to offer.Despite being part of Steam's somewhat infamous Early Access program I can certainly say that the game is not a cash grab. Rust receives frequent updates the most recent of which heavily boosted the gameplay experience.To keep things relatively short if you're looking for a fun new game to play or are a fan of the survival genre I heartily recommend grabbing Rust. You won't be dissapointed.,Rust

To many hackers cant keep a base worth a damn even when built on rocks or in water which is also pretty lame that u can build there.

2017-03-20,0,0,201,True,Not Recommended,this game is simply consumed by A LOT OF hackerswhile building a base you need to design the base to be sort of anti hack while you need an auto turret at the top of your roof so to against fly hackto build an auto turret you need a computer and when you go for air drop for the computer you will be most likely killed by the aim bot hackersso all in all this is a game of playing against hackers more than playing against other players..if a hacker is active around your neighbourhood there's no way you can leave your base to do anything 'cause hackers wipe all the moving objects in his active area the best thing you can do is go offline and find something else to dothe worst thing is some hackers aren't even reportable (their IDs won't show up on the report screen)due to the inactive admins of official servers the hackers will loot all your materials and weapons before getting bannedwhile even though luckily they get banned like 3 4 days after your loots and your base are all gone you will build a second new base with hope that the hackers never come back maybe after 2 more days you will then realise the same hackers have came back with new accounts and even better hacks (like invisible ladders)this game will be most likely the best game I have played for like past 10 years but due to hackers this is the game I recommend least to the others,Rust
2014-08-05,0,0,1056,True,Not Recommended,Although I have played over 400 hours. many of them hours we're stress related or heartbroken from the countless hours of farming for resources and doing loot runs on big/medium/small rad which all the time can be lost in an instant. it's a time consuming game with little reward although It did have its fun times. But hackers/abusive admins and just general trolls ruined this game for me and my clan who with each clan members time together is over 4500+ hours (I would not reccomend this game for high blood pressure dangers!!!),Rust
2015-11-21,0,0,729,True,Recommended,There are strength in numbers I find this game playable only with friends. If you are going to be a solo player I highly recommend making friends in the game or not getting the game at all. In Rust your character stays in the server you chose to play in forever until the devs wipe it. You can get raided at any time during the day you can get raided while your taking a you can get raided while you are sleeping or you can get raided while you are online. Even so there isnt much you can do if you are getting raided by a squad of 8 people with a bunch of explosives. All of a sudden you realize all those hours you put into this game was just in vain Might as well grab a guitar and sing to those raiders while they yell kamehameha blowing your doors down. A part from the raiding playing this game with friends is just an amazing experience. SoupyMaster,Rust

Keep in mind that for this game you would have to invest ALOT of hours into grinding to truly grasp the what the game really is so if you don't have plenty of free time and if you are not willing to grind this game isn't for you. Optimisation really is a problem however it IS early access and the game will most certainly get better performance wise for launch. Currently having a small base in Frankfurt Hapis 2 cheers!,Rust
2017-07-14,0,0,3101,True,Recommended,This game is a perfect survival game with many different servers and game types like just starting from scratch with a challenge and a twist around every corner play an official server. Like the game but not hours of work join a modded server. There's even minigame servers and a game type called savas where you need to find crates to get weapons and armor. Usually updated and fixed every Thursday as well as adding new things to further develop the atmosphere. In my opinion this game can be full of good and bad memories but overall you look back at the good times and if you play enough there will be a lot of them.,Rust

2017-07-14,0,0,183,True,Recommended,If you like survival games especially CO OP survival games than this game is for you but here are some pros and cons CONS You will be raided and you will lose everything The player base is pretty toxic most of the time You will be killed on sight by a majority of players Those cool buildings in the trailers you won't be building them they are too raidable By the timem you log into any server even on wipe days people will already have AK's The game CAN be very grindy to gather resources especially when you are just startingPROS The combat system is very well oriented it feels accomplishing to kill someone. This game has a very nice building system to it and with very few limitations other than stability. Hands down the best crafting system I've experienced in a survival game vanilla crafting times feel right not too long but not immediate either. The satisfying Boom you hear when you shoot rockets into another base to get their lifes work from chests is the most gratifying thing in the worldTL DR buy the game you can always refund it,Rust

2015-12-14,0,0,713,True,Recommended,Yes and no I reccomend this game for a special type of player. Just like the game itself. This game really emersed me into a world of what people do because they can. With no laws stopping people from stealing and killing it realy brings up its satisfaction to the power hungry person. This game is not for people for the light at heart as it really reaches out into the darker parts of a persons mind that brings out the inner beast. I have met person after person and they all seem to lose all comon sense and morals in this game as it becomes a survival of the finest within seconds of your games start as you encounter raiders bandits cults and clans straight down to your typical of a person. Mind you they are not NPC's making the game all the more difficult and fRUSTrating. ) The game really has its perks as it is very unique to itself ive never played anything like it and the graphics dont mimic anything as it is all fresh content. The graphics are beautiful. Some may not have the best video card in their pc which is fine but you're missing out of a land of beauty. I personally enjoy all of the survival aspects as you can encounter hunger weather hazards biohazards and even feral animals that will hunt you down.My review is not all to be said about the game I highly reccomend it for a player that wants a new fix.

2016-08-02,0,0,543,True,Not Recommended,"Ever since legacy has been taken down I've noticed just how much worse this game has gotten. gunplayThis is honestly awful. pvp in rust feels like playing CS GO with &gt 200 ping. Even with rubberbanding in old rust it felt more fluid. animals They aren't a challenge anymore. It's either insanely easy or they phase through a rock. or maybe they start flying through the air after they die. researchcomplete crap now if you want to be able to make something ou have to either grind barrels for hours on end or pray that you get luckyLootingno more rad animals or zombies now we have the fun new mechanic of beating barrels for hours on end to hope to find something. Sure there's some crates but usually in a radiation zone. Thus you need the gear to get the gear. Also since you can't put up any barriers in rad towns that one guy who built a tower next to the airfield can snipe you as he pleases. RaidingMost salty about this. sitting at a wall for twenty minutes switching weapons to get loot isnt a good mechanic surprisingly enough. Raids heavily favor the raider it's not a metter of ""can I defend my loot"" it's ""How much time and c4 can i make them waste to get to my loot"" Furthermore raiding is no longer scouting out another player trying to find their loot room or peeking through the craks in their base or building up to raid from the second story. It's c4 the doors down till you get there.mapYAY random maps. Now we get to walk through the woods for an hour before finding any people or loot. Unless you are on a hugely populated server don't expect to find anyone. Also exp.

2014-06-23,0,0,238,True,Recommended,Rust is absolutely phenominal not just for the seasoned gamer but for the newcomers as well. Rust has wundefull graphics the landscape is perfect. Night time instills a real sense of fear could there be bandits around? Is it safe to leave my hovel for food and ammo? what if I run into a pack of wolves or a bear? During day I found hunting with my bow not only amusing but challenging in a good way I can remember going out with my group to kill some deer and some rad animals for loot and food. Food is very easy to aquire in Rust once you craft a bow its not hard at all to kill animals. Recource gathering is very interesting to do going out for wood sulfur and metal was always a priority. But another aspect of this game is encountering other players when I saw other players I felt mixed feelings of excitement and fear I didnt know if they were friendly people or bandits I did know however that they had things I needed and I had things they needed. It adds a unique style of gameplay as sometimes you are forced to harm other players for your own survival. Rust also has a very interesting raiding and building design. you can create your own home and it can be raided. Overall Rust is one of the best games I own and I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in survival games,Rust
2014-04-12,0,0,363,True,Recommended,One of the best Pre Alpha games out there!,Rust
2014-03-29,0,0,21,True,Recommended,This game is in Alpha I repeat ALPHA. This means you will occasionally run into a glitch or unfinished part of the game. Don't let that word scare you though. Rust is a game where you will have experiences of no other. The first time you encounter a firey light off in the distance and you decide to track down the player holding the torch you will get an exhilarating rush not found in any other game. This game has LOTS of potential. When Rust is fully released I reccomend it to any PC gamer. This game is gonna be bigger than Minecraft I assure you. Whenever you enter a server your character is now officially locked into that world. When you log out your player drops to the ground in unconciousness. This means any other player can come up to you and hatchet your face in. You better stock up on resources and build yourself your first 1x1 house and sleeping bag before you log off your first session of Rust or your progress is gonna be gone as someone will murder you in your sleep. Communication is key in this game. It will decide your foes and your allies. A mic is useful when playing this game but you can easily use the in game chat instead. Building a wooden castle constructing your first shotgun and ambushing a band of nakeds (term used for noobies) are a couple of highlights in Rust. Play this game. Now.,Rust

2014-06-23,0,0,235,True,Recommended,i am going to hit bullet point type reasons on why i love or hate this gameThis game is a love hate relationship at its finest On one hand i love hunting deer and getting chicken breast going on supply runs and getting so much junk i feel like i am a god the vast amount of official community and modded servers turning nudity on and watching naked bald howie long looking dudes bash each other with a rock over 4 pieces of wood and starting gear nice open world with plenty of space to live like a hermit beautiful handmade structures in which i have never seen anyone building onto them which is odd it is very addicting and one more hour turns to 8 easilyTo the bad Hackers first and foremost ruin this game. I have seen them fly shoot through and go in peoples homes even when doors are locked find my home and take everything. my crib was 40 minutes away and so secluded i even had trouble finding it but it was filled with items so a hacker sure got to it and c4'd 7 metal doors. get real. this shouldnt be so bad in official servers but without them having admin it is the worse people in this game that have made something of themselve i.e getting a nice house guns galore armor galore items out the wazoo treat noobs like I have seen hundreds of times them shoot naked men with rocks just for fun people tend to grief you not just raid and take what they want at first i thought i was going to lose faith in humanity by the way these people were acting. I once teamed up with someone for 5 hours only for him to shoot me in my back while i was gathering supplies my most recent house was raided by a hacker. 8 storage boxes empty when i logged back on but no doors gone the devs dont update worth a and think their dev blog of what we will do doesnt cut itAll in all i have fun playing this game but dont get attached to supplies or fellow survivors or you will get on,Rust

2014-11-17,0,0,132,True,Recommended,This game is as fascinatingly alluring as it is frustrating. You begin each playthrough full of hope. You wonder around (if playing with a friend trying to identify landmarks to meet up) and you collect supples. Then you are suddenly mauled by a bear. Respawn. You finally after several hours meet up with that friend you build a life together a small hut some food basic tools and weapons a sleeping bag to respawn. Everything seems so calm and the world is such a happy place. Then some comes along with a gun he happened to find somewhere and kills you both you don't even put up a good fight. Respawn. You still have your stuff so maybe you will still be able to survive. The with the gun kills you from out of no where. Respawn. He's standing over your sleeping bag waiting. BAM! Respawn. BAM! Respawn. BAM! RESPAWN! BAM! RESPAWN!!!!! BAM!!!! Rage quit. If you can manage to get your hands on decent weapons and are lucky enough not to run into any horrible people the game is rather enjoyable. The second someone takes advantage of their power over you all fun turns into hatred for that person. Not so fun anymore however this can be solved by playing on an empty server but there is a certain enjoyment to running into other random players. Overall I really do like this game but I can only play it in doeses because every time you die it's heartbreaking... 9/10,Rust

2015-06-28,0,0,54,True,Recommended,"I first got Rust nearly a year ago on my birthday. First I will tell you my first playthrough which happened to be on my birthday &gt I spawned with a rock a torch and some bandages.&gt I decided that since I was new and knew nothing about how to survive on this game I would just go and find some kind players to help me start off. I mean this is an online game! I'm sure that the community would be nice!&gt After wandering around for a bit I hear two voices. I jump out into the open so they could see that I was new and had nothing of interest. Using the text chat (I didn't know how to voice chat at the time) I told them I was friendly. They seemed okay with that answer and acted as if I wasn't there. &gt As the sun began to go down the two players started hitting each other with rocks while laughing insanely as I watched.&gt As I saw that they were just messing around and not trying to kill each other I decided I'd join in the fun.&gt I hit one. &gt The two players who had just been hitting each other for the last five minutes as a joke instantly turned on me for that ONE hit.&gt They started clumsily lashing at me with rocks.&gt I ran away but I could hear them both chanting to me through voice chat ""You can't escape!"" and ""We're gonna get you!""&gt One of them caught up to me and hit me a few times and I started panicking. &gt I managed to outrun them but it seemed that they had nothing better to do than trying to catch me so they were still looking for me.&gt Their crazed voices finally drained away. I stopped running.&gt I realized I was very hungry and would die soon. &gt Suddenly I saw a bear.&gt After playing Skyrim where I could kill bears with just my fists I thought that I could take on the bear with just my rock.&gt The bear killed me.&gt I rage quit.&gt I vowed to never go on another official server again.MORAL OF THE STORY You should never ever trust a pair of nutcases who hit each other for fun.The game is very fun. However it may lag if your settings are right up. I enjoyed the realistic survival aspect of it and I definately enjoyed not trusting anyone (loner me) because I got a thrill of suspense whenever someone was nearby. However I was part of a nice town on one server unti some people had a riot and killed everyone. This does show you cannot trust anybody in this game so if you was a partner it had better be someone you trust AND know in real life.",Rust

2015-02-06,0,0,67,True,Not Recommended,When I first got Rust it was a very fun and good Experience! Really enjoyed it. BUT!Then Rust got a update it s now probably one of the WORST optimized games I have played. I get 5 around more FPS when I put all the graphics on low than having them on high. I would not play the game on low settings either as it looks very bad. I run from 10 to 20 FPS with lag I have been waiting for what feels like months for a optimized update. I can run Assassin s Creed Unity on my pc but NOT Rust. It's disappointing i really enjoyed the game but now I can t even play it without lots of lag.I just think it is really bad how Rust is so badly optimized. I think it should be prioritized to actually optimize this game. Before doing anything else. What is the point of updating a game if people cant play it?,Rust

2014-05-12,0,0,87,True,Recommended,"This game can be fun if you find a server that has a low amount of players. Usually you will get constantly killed in the servers that have people who ""run the server"" or servers that just have an abundant amount of people on. The graphics are great although you have to turn them down a lot in order to reduce lag. Trust is not bad but do not trust other people without knowing they wont obliterate your shack house or base. Having a team is a good idea although if you have one to large you are more likely to be raided because of the people you took in. Rust can be upsetting but you grow better at the game as you play making it more fun. It may be a good idea to make your place in a hidden spot with spike walls and more than one door to enter your home. Invest in metal doors because people will hatchet wooden ones using a different code for each door you reinforce your entry with makes your place that much more secure. Rust is not completed yet but I am sure it will still be about gathering resources killing aminals zombies? and other players dealing with power hungryplayers revenge gathering a team and of course survival.

Official servers have so many hackers and no admins its ridiculous. You got to find a nice community server with active admins that don't abuse. Once you find one of those the game is honestly in the top 3 games ive ever played. Also buy this game with a friend(s). A lot of the community is just s who kill you on sight. Not all of them though I've met some pretty chill guys through this game. Also if you hear people saying how they aren't updating it its because they are completely recreating the game on a new game engine and its called rust experimental. If you check out their dev blog they are working their asses off on some pretty amazing stuff. So basically+very fun everywhere+devs are working hard+great survival crafting building and other stuff official servers suck the community sucks (nothing the devs can really do about it)10/10,Rust

2017-04-17,0,0,101,True,Not Recommended,I have played this game since dezember 2013 when it was totally different I used to love this game I bought to my friends but all those years I had trouble with FPS and only in Rust games like GTA V CS GO Resident Evil 7 Rise of Tomb Raider I used to play in 1920pixels on ultra settings with more than 60fps. Every devblog they said that they were working on optimization and we never saw good progress after some years playing rust I realized one thing that changed my game chooses small offices with 2 or 5 guys like facepunch are bad on this kind of work rockstar microsoft games big companys are much better to develop games today I dont buy skins or games on those small companys only from big ones because I know I will not have soo much problems like bugs glitches hackers bad optimizations and even more.I dont recommend it Rust today the best game on this genre is 7 Days to Die I was playing it in 1920 on ultra HD with 220 fps.,Rust

2014-02-01,0,0,221,True,Recommended,I like this game but it so happens that I lag A LOT. I even restarted my computer and I continue to lag.When you gather materials you lag. It's like you crouch and you get back up. Continuous lag is not good.Even though I would recommend this game because of the mechanics the lag was unbareable.Edit #1 I was playing yesterday and I had no problems with lag.Now a group of people has accepted me into their society. We raid. We kill. We conquer. And we raid some more.Definitely a better game than Flapping Birds. )Get this game and join the internet sensation.Edit #2 I was playing on the experimental server and I do say the graphics are much improved.Facepunch Studios is working very hard on this experimental branch. Things that I have noticed from the Old Rust branch New User Interface I love it even though it's still a working progress. Now that's said the option context menu is not operational and does not have content. However I believe it will be easier to use.The server load page looks so much better as well. To join a game click on the server and in the context menu click on Join Server.In Game interface I think it is also an improvement. The splitting of items in the inventory is weird for right now When you hover over an item that is splittable just hover from the top or the bottom of the tile ( decreases/+increases) and click and drag to a new inventory spot. Click and drag items from the inventory to use (such as weapons and cloth) to the hot bars. However there are some things that I have noticed No running animations for the rifle (which also doesn't reload when pressed 'R' or aim when right clicking). When in 3rd person mode (pressing F3) and using the hatchet when you swing it does a second animation glitch (sometimes). You can run while using the bow and firing the bow sometimes glitches. You can retrieve your arrows!!! Huge plus now! Wolves are now in the experimental branch and get wolf meat!!! So far so good. Keep up the good work Garry and Facepunch Studios!!,Rust

2014-05-26,0,0,18,True,Recommended,This game is a hit and miss for me after a few respawns and a few successful ventures i began to understand the game ive only played it for 2.0hrs but from that i can tell you 4 or 5 things. DONT join official servers its full of 8 year olds and 10 year olds that constantly have arguments on chat and do stuff like shoot there mates in the head becuase they wouldnt give them any metal ore The graphics are ok but them shadows! they are pixelated and just look so cheap also theres not much choice for stuff like aa its just a slider called render quality so id give the graphics a 6/10 The community... well as i said dont join the official servers but if you get into a server like abbatior there not to bad the admin will tp you too a friend no questions asked and the majority of people on the server will not try too kill you as soon as you join!So all in all its not a bad game but it does need improvements but hey? its in alpha at the moment (it has been for some time...) I suggest you do not buy it until youve played it round a friends or watched a video if thats your thing! because there are some really bad aspects about the game. so i think i would give the game a 7/10 would play again D,Rust

I am still learning the ropes of the new system and yes this game is most definitely an alpha but goddamn is it fun. Rust unabashadly originally copied DayZ and in my opinion both of these games still reign supreme in the Survival/FPS/MMO/Base Building/Kill someone and eat their flesh genre. Rust still has a long way to go but that makes me really happy because it has a great dev team behind it unlimited potential and I can't wait to see where the game goes in 2016.,Rust

2015-01-19,0,0,195,True,Not Recommended,Well I want to be honest and say that ever since Gary re made Rust it kind of went downhill. My friends and I really don't care about any new updates that are coming to the game and whenever we really play we pay the legacy version because it is actually more entertaining then the more recent version. So I would give the new rust a dislike and the legacy version a two thumbs up because of its simplicity compared to the new one.*UPDATE*Honestly after waiting a while and playing the new rust since the old one is kind of dead ( I realized that it is actually pretty good. Hackers are still a major problem kind of ruining the game for a lot of new players and making in so that you really dont want to even find gear because it will just be stolen. Here is a pors and cons list of the new rust. Pros +You can use signs+You can play the banjo+The Thompson is in the game+graphics are nice even though I cant play the game on high settings.Cons Hackers Hackers might steal your banjo loading screens for joining servers take very long.&lt this might just be for me.New Update to review The game is basically useless to me now. I have no reason to play it unless I actually feel like looking for a rust server on the original game. The new version of rust is completely unplayable for me and it usually takes 30min to join a server only to make me quit after it auto dissconects me for afk because I took to long to load. The old Rust is still my favorite but there are barely any servers that are populated and it is not fun playing with 3 people... I feel that the worst part about the change to new rust is the requirements. I used to play the game with 60fps which is amazing for me after the update the graphics requirement is a GTX 980. Great.... Now I can play the new rust with a solid silky smooth 10 fps on the lowest settings. Just what I always wanted to play this game on because high fps makes the game too smooth for me I like a good slide show when I play my games.,Rust

Being the butt naked world it's both fun to play it seriously and just for the sake of standing around and enjoying the environment. However after implementing the female gender my character has changed but I got used to that. Ever since there has been a lot of changes (blueprint xp component system) but it doen't change my opinion. I really recommend this game even tho you might constantly find yourself frustrated because of being murdered robbed and raided never give up and remember it's just a game. (Don't vent your frustration on your family and friends) Keep calm and move on. btw be sure to get a solid GPU to run this game lmao,Rust
2014-02-01,0,0,20,True,Recommended,"Rust is a game about survival. But that takes time. Initially it's just about death. It's about freezing to death and starving to death being shot to death and getting bitten to death occasionally mixing things up a little by slipping on a warm radiation coat and fading faster than your faith in humanity after being stabbed in the back by a supposed friend's hatchet. Sometimes you get gored to death. Other times bored to death. It's not easy surviving post apocalyptic civilisation with nothing but a rock especially when your enemies have guns and double especially in a game that makes you work just to earn a pair of basic trousers.Even this early into development Rust's mix of DayZ and Minecraft (the easiest comparison though Wurm Online is more apt) has won it no shortage of fans some of them not even psychopaths hackers and trolls on the hunt for new victims to murder and mock over voice chat. It's the kind of game that's less a shooter than an engine designed to tell stories. Those stories are mostly as ever in the field of bastardom but there's scope for some humanity amongst all the pranks and murder. It's also a world that focuses on demanding effort rather than promising to reward it starting players out naked and hungry and alone dangling the potential of going on to build forts craft weapons and finally savour the air at the top of the food chain.1Night is pitch black. To wander in the dark means likely running into danger but lighting a torch draws attention from anyone around.Crafting is the most important part of this though there are loot crates both in radioactive remnants of civilisation and regularly dropped from passing planes that provide free toys to play with and blueprints for advanced gear that unlike your inventory survives death. Early on the priority is making basic tools like a stone hatchet a bow a hut and a sleeping bag by beating supplies out of trees and rocks and animals... usually cloth for some reason. Later blueprints furnaces and workbenches offer more advanced gear like metal doors that other players can't so easily get through and armour capable of protecting against bullets and lingering radiation fields as well as keeping you warm and covering up your naughty bits.Building a solid place to call your own is by far the most important thing to focus on ideally backed up by friends because on default rules your character becomes an unconscious vulnerable sleeper rather than vanishing on log out. Not all servers use this though with some even going for pure co op. It's not a very fun mode to play though odd as missing the gankers might seem. Too quiet. Too much time grinding without distraction.As far as game completion goes all the basic components here are in place and fully playable including wildlife to hunt and be hunted by a range of weapons to craft and a decent sized map that's more than capable of handling over a hundred players in its valleys forests and ruins. Current stress tests are cranking that up to 300 for true Spartan madness.The basic goal underpinning the action ""Survive!"" feels somewhat unambitious as well as depressingly acting as license for a player base of social Darwinists to be on their worst behaviour2It's possible to raid player housing but it takes explosives to breach metal doors. Wooden ones just persistence.That said most of the details are very rough with much work left in everything from making combat mechanically satisfying to putting proper sound effects in to generally finding the balance between Rust's various inspirations. The map for instance is far blander than DayZ's Chernarus and mostly filled with generic forestry and plains and space left empty to give players scope to develop each server in their own image. This sounds cool but at the moment the primitive components don't offer anything like enough freedom to create interesting things. On a Minecraft server absolutely anything could be waiting around the next corner in all its blocky glory. Here it's almost always going to be a generic wood shack or tower usually long abandoned or fiercely guarded by a proprietorial player who thinks himself a post apocalyptic badass but acts far more like Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel.That side of things being so prominent also makes the basic goal underpinning the action ""Survive!"" feel somewhat unambitious as well as depressingly acting as license for a player base of social Darwinists to be on their worst behaviour. The same can be said of DayZ of course but in that game the setting and mood go hand in hand with the brutality ruthless scavengers picking through a broken world gone long past the point of no return. Rust presents something with more possibilities and in doing so often feels like it should be offering more to actually survive for. At least something more than finally scraping together the explosives to go kick over other kids' sandcastles.4No I'm totally going to help. Definitely not letting you die so I can have your stuff.Simply getting to that point offers plenty of challenge however not least because the resource economy is currently completely broken especially on busy servers. Survival requires food but you can easily starve to death without even seeing an animal to extract life saving chicken breasts from. (For the moment it's always chicken even if it's a pig though other foods are available elsewhere.) It can also take several lives just to luck into enough stone to construct the most basic hatchet for gathering supplies or a single piece of the cloth you need to construct a sleeping bag that acts as a respawn point only to lose it all after being spotted by a player with a gun or getting too close to a wild animal or zombie. Speaking of which yes Rust has zombies. Of course it does. They're not around in huge numbers though and thankfully not long for the world hanging on for the moment as placeholders for something that can't help but be better simply by not being more bloody zombies.Price and availabilitySteam early access 14.99Developer statement ""We are in very early development. Some things work some things don't. We haven't totally decided where the game is headed so things will change. Things will change a lot.""Provided you're in the mood for a player versus player game that makes you work to not simply be a victim and ideally have a few friends to band together and scare off passing opportunists Rust's challenge already offers enough of a survival experience to be worth a look. It's as primitive as its rock smashing cavemen in many ways and lacks both DayZ's atmosphere and the raw punch of its setting but the focus on building and crafting does make for a notably different experience. It's worth waiting for a few more patches though so that the developers at Facepunch can fix the resource lottery that makes getting started such a chore and even then you should take time to find a server where operators are watching for hackers instead of letting them have their fun.Rust is firmly a base for what might be a great game later on rather than a great one right now. It's seen best in quiet moments when players aren't around to troll and murder and crafting and raw survival take the focus. There's more than enough here to suggest great things in Rust's future as it evolves its crafting its combat and clears out the zombies to further find its own niche in 2014's upcoming war of survival games. It has the tools to become something very special and hopefully will provide players with enough to do the same.",Rust

2014-10-04,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Rust currently is undergoing a rewrite launched under 'Play Experimental' which improves the game dramatically. While it performs like sh*t for me it looks much better than the old version and has some improvement in gameplay mechanics.Rust is a game about survival Rust is a game about maintaining your existence and murdering people with less stuff than you. I can't really say Rust is a bad game but it's not really a game it's more of a hostile life simulator. After getting high damage guns (which is really easy) the game becomes less about survival and more about killing time.The other players are usually friendly mainly because you're equally matched. Over the course of my Rust adventures I've met a couple interesting people. One of them is a fireman who especially likes Rust because it kills time while allowing him to leave at a moment's notice. Another is an absolute as*hole who attacks unprompted.Most servers will eventually establish a couple groups as the overlords and everyone else will either have to join them or become friends otherwise get annihilated. One especially bad problem with Rust is that you can lose days of progress in minutes. All base designs have been done before and any good raiders will know how to deal with them.Overall I don't really dislike Rust but it has too many gameplay concepts that need to be refined or changed. So while I do recommend it I do so with a warning label.Additionally the game sharing a name with the older and more important programming language Rust has resulted in my favorite GitHub issue ever github.com .,Rust
2015-03-06,0,0,10,True,Recommended,It's a REALLY good game especially in its Alpha stage. I think the biggest issue is mob spawning. I.E. Bears and Wolves.It's a bit frustrating when you have low health and you're trying to cook buta random animal spawns and kills you instantly. But then again it's perfectly normal for a game to never be perfect.,Rust

2014-01-16,0,0,193,True,Recommended,Rust is in very early development but is so far a solid game.Rust is a game which is rather different but is in the popular Survival/Crafting genre. However difficult to play on the official servers once you find a server to settle down in Rust proves an addictive and entertaining game. The community behind the game is composed of s really. Most of the people you meet will kill on sight and if you don't wish for this to happen to you either play on a PVE server or avoid them. I personally love the experience of starting with a rock some bandages and a torch getting killed every time I tried to travel somewhere to joining up with friends building a secure base and getting revenge on all those who killed me as a newspawn.Rust for a game which is in alpha is mostly bug free some of the aspects of the game which appear to be bugs (such as the fact you get chicken from everything) is nothing more than a lack of features and it is actually great to see that the developers are working on something more important than this.Rust is a game that I would not recommend playing on a PvP server unless you're either fearless or in a group of two or more.I find that rust was well worth the money I spent on it and I will continue to love this game throughout it's development.Thank you Facepunch Studios!,Rust
2013-12-25,0,0,25,True,Recommended,The gameplay is really fun especially in PvP situations early stages are boring however and it dosen't feel good to get backstabbed by someone or get your house griefed.

Also some tweaks to the PvP system to make it more fair like a radar to know if someone is about to backstab you can do good.,Rust

However once your first house has been built and upgraded it becomes difficult to make your home truly unique. What I would like to see in Rust for a near future update is just some small features to allow very different aesthetical looks to be added to buildings weapons and even tools! Things like colour wear on the damaged areas designes carved in and different styles to your every day item in Rust! Keep up the good work Dev Team,Rust

Right up your enemies. Then you make plays As your heart rate rises and the addrenaline pumps throught your mind. You make sure and do tings.. The tings are groups. Not zergs Just some of your friends. You raid together build together.

Also can't forget the inconsistency between clients each player having different recoil and collection of bugs related to said recoil is really annoying.

There are lots of PvP'rs who enjoy killing the scrubs who are on the server so having a group to work together with is valuable.It does take a decent computer to run keep that in mind before you purchase the game.The game gets a 9/10 from me keeping in mind it's in early Alpha.,Rust

2016-02-15,1,1,437,True,Recommended,Probably the best multiplayer sandbox survival game out there. Definitely has its own original feel to it and updates are always and consistently coming out making the game better with new things as well as patches. Good aspects Heaps fun awesome experience with intense situations and adreneline pumping. You can get yourself into crazy situations and it's really fun when playing with friends. It's very balanced in my opinion with the resource farming and getting geared up so you and others won't find it really easy to get over powered in the game. Base building is fun and you can have various designs techniques and variety of different styles in general to choose from. Fighting and shooting in the game is very good and is not buggy at all. It gives a very satisfactory FPS feel to it when in combat. Negative aspects If you can't handle a big loss then this game is not for you. If you get butthurt easily over petty things such as a player killing you and you loosing your gear or you getting raided this is definitely not for you. This game is time consuming in base building and acquiring good gear so be prepared to have a lot of time set aside for that. You can easily waste 30 hours of game time if you base build incorrectly causing you to get raided or don't know how to handle a harsh world where no one can be trusted. Need to be smart about how you go about things. People can be cu nts in the game and you need to know how to deal with that. In general other players and people can make the game ing frustrating af. Game also requires decent hardware.Overall this game is really good and in general if you can't deal with a big loss or don't have a good pc or not enough time to set for the game it isnt for you otherwise amazing game and would defs recommend. EDIT (Final conclusion of my opinion on this game after a plethora of updates over the past 3.5 years) Ok so initially the game was good with the Blueprint system. This system was very original and I haven't seen any games at all with this type of progression system. Then it went to complete sh it as there was a transition from the BP system to the XP system(unoriginal asf). The Dev team then realised that the XP system was trash so they then altered to a newly implemented component system. This system was also not good (in my opinion) yet it was significantly better than the XP system.And now at this moment in time they have what I would call the perfect system. Its a combination of the Blueprint and Component system and it really makes the game more challenging yet items are still attainable and the game still maintains a balance.,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,Right now I do not recommend this game. There is no way to play offline some people do not respect others. The game do not make getting food easy as well as not giving you enough resources to make a basic shelter. The game is still in the alpha stage but as of right now its not solo friendly and surviving without someone else is almost impossible.,Rust
2014-01-31,0,0,86,True,Recommended,Lose alot of hours easily to this game like minecraft the gameplay is great and the crafting system is well done. I've had a lot of fun on this game in the short time I've had it the only bad thing I can say about it is that there are a lot of servers where admins abuse their power hard but that's neither a fault in the game or the developers.,Rust
2014-05-21,0,0,40,True,Recommended,"I would recommend this game if you are looking for a game to just explore. The First Day Trailer does not do the game justice because it seems like you never get anything. That is not true... I will admit that it is difficult starting out but once you start your house it gets a lot better. You can literally build stuff kinda like Minecraft but not as ""blocky."" The one flaw with this game is that the people in the servers aren't very friendly to new people so I would suggest going on a server with as few people as possible. The other flaw is that there is an occasional pause in the game but remember it is an Alpha game so it is still being updated. Hope this review helped and hope to see you guys on Rust. )",Rust

2014-10-06,0,0,39,True,Not Recommended,this game is very good i enjoyed playing it very much but the people who play this game are horrible it is centered more around griefing other players then actually surviving you honestly cant leave a server for more thean 3 hours without finding your home destroyed and all your hard work reset even when you have the strongest house possible this game is also full of hakers and cheaters it is incredibly unfriendly to new players and after you find all your stuff gone or missing it rely makes you not want to play anymore i belive the only way to properly fix this game is to have a properly working anti cheat system in the game and remove the abbility to steal and destroy other peoples stuff when they arent even playing the game or remove any way to destroy other peoples hard work it isnt fair most of all when your not even playing dont get me wrong you should be able to kill other players and take whats on them but not when you take everything they own the game should be centered around surival not bullying otherwise a good game ruined by the people that play it,Rust
2014-02-09,0,0,142,True,Recommended,The game is excellent but it is kindof laggy....i think it is because the game NEEDS a render distance option for optimized personalization to each computer and its clients.Other than that the game is VERY addicting and i think its tottally worth the 20 dollars.Honestly at first i started to regret on the game because of the lag and the slow paced movement in the game ... in fact i have too open up my console and insert some commands to make the game less laggy here they are just type each on in the console setting (F1) grass.on False grass.forceredraw Falsegrass.displacement Falsegrass.disp_trail_seconds 1grass.shadowcast Falsegrass.shadowreceive Falsegfx.ssaa Falsegfx.bloom Falsegfx.grain Falsegfx.ssao Falsegfx.shafts Falsegfx.tonemap FalseIt might sound like im making the game sound horrible..but im actually saying the opposite..the game is phenominal..and i can tell the creators of the game really want the best for their players.For example when the creators of the game took off zombies the game started to make mor sense...think about it an urban survival game with zombies....wtf?Ppl still complain about player killing player on sight...im actually totally fine with this...why you may ask? i say this is fair because it would be like that in real life and u MUST learn to socialize with human players...think of it like a challengemy honest game review would have to be 9.5/10,Rust

2014-02-26,0,0,54,True,Recommended,Really Really good game for its value. This game costs 14.99p and its fully worth it. Its an epic exploration strategic emence multiplayer survival game. The best i have ever played. They removed the zombies which i was over pleased about as they just were a insignificance rarley showed up andeven if they did they were a 2 hit kill push over. This game is about wilderness survival which is why they replaced the zombies with red bears and wolves. The re bears and wwolves are supieror to there brown colured counter parts and there for give better loot however they are significantly harder to kill. I have played on many diffrent servers and seen the game in many ways each one of them was dashing. Id definnitley recomend this game if your thinking to play single or with friends as its fun on both accounts.,Rust

2016-11-24,0,0,1502,True,Recommended,I have played this game since legacy I loved it then and I still love it now. The game is updated weekly sometimes the game play changes dont work so the next week they are tweaked. The dev team are really on the case with making this game great. Right now they have just made a big change which a lot of people are complaining about because they have to work a little bit harder. The changes are aimed at stopping servers dying 2 days after the monthly wipe though. Now you have to earn the high end gear and playing for longer is far more satisfying than it was before. Facepunch are going all out to make this game better and better week by week so ignore the recent negative reviews. They are mostly from clan players who just want ak47's in the first 5 minutes to dominate a server.Graphically rust is looking really pretty these days sound is great and gameplay is very well polished. If you want a game where anything is possible then this is it. Build a base get raided revenge raid your raiders......... hit people with a rock shoot them with anything you like..........Its a sandbox an action packed never the same twice sandbox. If that sounds even slightly interesting to you just give it a go. 9.5 out of 10 and still improving.,Rust

2015-04-05,1,1,131,True,Not Recommended,"This ""new"" Rust is honestly unplayable. There are no mineable rocks (which are a necessity in order to get basic tools) to gather from and when you do find one a guy with an automatic rifle comes 'round the corner and mows you down generally laughs at you and calls you a or some spiteful word and then you respawn and begin the hunt again. Generally I have high hopes for survival sandbox games such as Rust if the developers can pull their heads out of their fix the core of the game such as optimization latency issues and just balancing the crafting to a sane level. Then there's also the problem with the community. The community is just terrible. Next to everyone will just shoot you or kill you on sight without the slightest reason other than to just get a rise out of you. There's also a major problem with hackers which are so much more present in this version. In all honesty I can't reccomend the game to anyone. There's still way too much that needs to be done.EDIT They put in ladders and have yet to figure how to ing balance them.

2017-06-21,0,0,33,True,Recommended,"This review is more like a beginer's tips (This will help beginers have more fun.) Don't go on servers with a lot of people . Why? Because It's going to be really hard to find stone. I reccomend going on smaller servers (not empty) with like 50 people. And don't go on servers what are always full because then you will be placed in a queue before you can join the server. Use your mic . Why? Because if you meet someone he/she will usually kill you. because they are a s s h o l e s (&lt True lol) But if you tell him/her (with your mic) something like ""Please dont kill me I'll give you my stuff."" Then you just give him/her some wood/stone and he/she will leave you alone. Get a stone hatchet and a stone pick axe as soon as you can. Why? With the hatchet you can chop wood faster and It gives you more wood. With the pick axe you can get stone faster and It gives you more stone. Not every rock can be mined I can't describe which ones can be mined but you'll experience it yourself.If it helped please upvote it. Thanks! 3Ban4n",Rust

You are most vulnerable when you are offline as the character sleeps where you disconnect so your own house can be a safe haven or a trap. One of the best in the survival genre.

2017-06-21,1,1,154,True,Not Recommended,It's fun but only if you're truly committed to playing this for long sessions with people you know. Basically deathmatch set in a huge map accompanied by hunger and thirst meters as well as allowing you to build stuff. Not that there's much wrong with that but for something that advertises itself as a survival game doesn't really feel like one. It's very easy to overcome thirst hunger and cold so these features feel meaningless.If you're planning on playing this as your main game with a group of friends then you'll have some fun but otherwise I don't see much reason to play this. Putting so much work into a base and gear and risking losing it all in the middle of the night while you're sleeping in real life makes it stressful to play this game. Servers wiping everything to reset progress and clean up all the buildings seems counterproductive to the building and acquisition of loot.,Rust

2014-03-14,0,0,51,True,Recommended,"Rust is a survival game built by Garry Newman the creator of Garry's Mod. It's main focus is survival. It achieves this by throwing you the player into a world full of animals wolves bears irradiated towns and of course naked cavemen running around with rocks screaming down the microphone trying to kill you. (Naturally).Positives Good looking graphics I say that but there could be some improvements to textures and some optimisationGood sound designSmooth crafting and (maybe not so much) building.Lots of places to travel toLOOT!Negatives The actual survival element isn't great at the moment. While you can die of hunger and cold this usually doesn't happen when your futher into the game. The only hostile AI are bears and wolves. The main thing you will be surviving against is other players. The game needs more hostile AI IMOLack of content I know this is still in alpha but if you are looking to buy it I would have to say that there really isn't that much content currently. You can go from a rock wielding naked person to a fully armoured gun wielding badass in a few hours which also points out how easy it is to get the high end stuff too.The communtiy Perhaps the greatest weakness of the game. The community in this game is GOD AWFUL! If your not being attacked by a 6 year old with a rock who is screaming down the microphone being killed by ""Bandits"" being killed for just asking for help or just randomly getting shot even though you're a new spawn then you might actually meet a nice player. Be warned this will probably only happen about 5% of the time.Overall I think Rust has the potential to be a good game. The key thing to remember is that this game is still in alpha. Many things will be changed and lots more stuff will be added. While it has some quite bad negatives I still think you should ckeck it out. Just remember don't approach any naked people wielding rocks.",Rust

2014-01-21,0,0,319,True,Recommended,Rust is simply one of the most enjoyable experieneces that I've ever had. The game is in Alpha so expect a few bugs but nothing game breaking it's totally playable in its current form. My friends and I spent our first night in Rust learning the basics. We gathered resources and built our shelter town complete with storage boxes and a shared furnance (Stone Resources seem to be scare on populated servers) surround by wooden barricades. After two hours or so we finally had enough resources to create the basic firearms (Revolver Pipe Shotgun). After we had armed ourselves up with sufficent armor and weapons we decided we would venture further than usual from our base.We headed south and discovered a field full of endless resources! I spotted a stone resource off in the distance and rather than check around made an immediate mad dash for it. I begin smashing it with my hatchet excitedly telling my friends that things were starting to look up. Moments later a Shotgun blast echoed over my speakers and I fell to the ground...dead.My friends hearing the shots did the smart thing and fled! I was naked back in my cabin slightly irritated that I had just lost all of my gear that I had worked so hard for apart from some basic cloth armor and a stone hatchet anything viable was gone.After the frustration of my death faded I set back out to re establish myself and this time I wouldn't venture out so ill prepared.Frustrations aside once you get going and are familiar with the lay of the land (Where Rad Towns are and Resource Spawns) Rust is actually quite enjoyable to play.It's definitely worh the price of admission as I cannot stop playing it. It's a great game with a ton of potential.,Rust

2014-01-21,0,0,263,True,Recommended,You're thrown in to a wilderness with nothing but a rock a torch and some bandages. It's hard to navigate Everything looks similar. There is no map. There are roads but watch out they lead to radiation towns infested with zombies and those are the least of your worries. Day and night you need to gather resources like wood stone metal ore and chicken (All animals drop chicken breasts though there are no chickens). The most basic shelter is easy to construct but are also quite easy to break into. This leaves you scrambling to gather enough resources to make a more defensible shelter before you get robbed killed or die of hunger. The enemy here is everyone else. Teams of people in full kevlar and automatic rifles will shoot you on sight just for fun. You will struggle mightily to gain the most meager foothold and even when you do you can lose it all overnight. You see what you gather and keep in your home stays in the game free to be stolen at all times. If you log out your character falls asleep and you can still be killed. Why? Because in Rust you can't leave.,Rust

2014-02-13,0,0,178,True,Recommended,"awww man .... This game .... First of all i will need to warn you about one thing In order to feel ""satsifaction"" (That numb feeling you get from all games where you feel as if you've played for 1 hour but its been like 8 hours) from this game you will have to be progressive (i.e. Keep getting stronger making your base bigger etc). The game is no fun when you keep getting destroyed and have to keep starting from rock bottom (As a naked man with a rock D). SO if you don't plan on playing this game often every week then the game isn't for you. From my experience this game is really great (And having friends and microphones is a must). There is a certain thrill in robbing innocent travellers and taking their or protecting/raiding bases from or belonging to some people and talking in the process or finding a rare item in one of the radioactive zones or from a zombie you kill. A split second of joy when you finally realise that little bump up in your strenght on that particular server. Its just like any other game you spend time in it and get stronger (And during the process that hypnotising numbness is what you would call fun afterwards). From time to time something happens during your session which is legitemetly fun and you enjoy yourself. Once you get strong you just keep going (Expanding your base i.e.) Because you know that the game gets boring one you stop trying. I still dont get why we as humans play video games. But i will tell you this if i could only save 5 games from all the consoles because of the imminent doom of humanity This would be the first PC game i would save. It's addictive and limitless in the senses as there is no such thing as reaching the top you will have to deal with other players etc. And the time you will inevitably put into the game will facilitate the potential of some really funny happening (Funny Memory Once i lured 3 guy into a house that he didn't know was mine then i ran out when they got in and close the door behind me. They were locked in. They were talking for 5 minutes then they just raged quited and i took their from their sleeping bodies.)So in summary One could say this game is an addictive time killer which during most moments when you are mining rocks and lumbar piles or consistently running in and out of radioactive zones to loot stuff (Farming) is quite ordinary and non stimulating until (Which inevitably happens) a problem arises during your run (Some guy with kevlar with his guards down is near the area you are in D) or when you find a m4 while your looting (You'll know what i mean when you play the game). During these sorts of moments its fun and memories are made with this game. This game is probably the best progressive survival game out there (Better than DayZ perhaps) and its still in alpha (The stuff in the game is only 10% of the final product 10 Percent!!!!!). Be warned that depending on the server you choose you will encounter some difficulties as you rise up (I.e. Hackers or other strong players breaking into your house while your offline/online and taking your . It will take a couple of good attempts on a popular server or a one perfect effort on a moderately popular server to get strong and able to be dominant.P.S. Some tips Don't trust other players that easily And if you want to get strong Make a base next to large radioactive areas (Of course not where you receive radiation) and just keep running in and out and dropping off the loot you got on runs. Go out on a run for resources as well. You will be farming most of the game until you are either lucky enough or strong enough to target other players and grab loot off them.",Rust
2014-02-13,0,0,287,True,Recommended,If you let your friends drag you into the game and begin with a community of at least two friends by your side you'll probably miss the excruciating beginnings most people tend to mention about their first experiences. That being said I think the game flourishes most with cooperative survival as you and your mottley crew slowly build a kingdom to be proud of. And share. Maybe. From there it becomes pleasantly challenging to reach an end game assortment of guns and armor and once you've got all that and might as well be done there's some unfathomable appeal to owning not just a full set of the best armor but an entire closet one set for each day. So the replayability is wildly high for an alpha with limited content where most lose their appeal after you've acquired everything done everything seen everything in that given update in Rust there's an itch to do it all again. Also blow people up.,Rust

2014-02-13,0,0,555,True,Recommended,The best multiplayer survival game out there right now. Everything persists and decays on the server including the player at all times. Everything has reverted back to basics and the players in the game reflect this through desperate scavenging and making grim decisions Most play sessions feel like adventures and the adrenaline rush you get from PvP is quite killer in this game due to all the chaos (can't see names of players until they get close no in game map etc.). Teamwork and coordination is heavily rewarded due to no in game organization features (which is good) and the lone wolf types have lots of room to thrive in the chaos. The crafting is kept to necessities. Very well balanced heavily addictive and my favourite real PvP simulation game since Ultima Online! The devs are great at communicating upcoming features and squashing bugs quickly as well.,Rust

People are you will find some nice people who will help and some / nearly every player you meet is a . when you get some guns and feel all powerful yourself then you will see why they are and be one yourself P killing naked men because its funny to watch them run )... great game zombies have been removed replaced with bears and wolves covered in blood instead still get loot from them so no difference really ). worth the buy now before the price goes up !!!!!!!!!!,Rust

2014-02-09,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,At first I was skeptical about this game because of its heavily based PvP play. As I began to play the world and movement seemed fairly immersive to me for the game being in alpha. Though I haven't logged a good amount of hours in this game I do have some critiques. Firstly what is up with no options or tools for nagivating. If you have poor sense of direction like me you will hate this game. There aren't many memorable places you can go to to find out where you are at (Yes I am well aware of the online map). Seriously put a damn compass in this game at least. I know it wouldn't be that difficult to make one out of the materials you would be able to harvest in this game in real life. Also I'm sure the programmers and artists could put one in in about an hour if they really wanted to.I really wanted to like this game because all of my friends are getting into it but these reviews are here for opinions. I think you are wasting your time by playing the game in this early of development. And hopefully they do something about the map.,Rust

2014-11-05,2,1,2129,True,Recommended,Great alpha that has amazing potential a few hackers but if you have active mods it's completely bearable and still generally uncommon. It's a lot better to play with a group of at least 3 people. You will need a sharp mind and a quick trigger finger to outwit some of the smarter and larger groups of bandits which you will probably become in the end out of necessity. Very glad they replaced the leveling system. Rust is no longer the grind it's been since July. Now is probably the best time to get into rust.Steem Awards update Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war.,Rust

2014-03-06,0,0,42,True,Recommended,Rust.Rust is only in alpha but it does offer quite a lot even from it's early stages. I highly recommend watching tutorials for new people because there can be a lot of pressure on new people. I also highly recommend that you play Rust with atleast 1 other friend. The more friends you play with will add to the experiance.Rust really has it's moments. The feeling of building a house from the ground up is really satisfying. I have yet to experiance raiding a players house but I am sure I will soon. As well as the good moments in Rust it also has a fair share of bad moments. I know it's only in alpha but this is still worth complaining about. First of all being trolled by other players is common. If they place 1 pillar in your home it can stuff up everything. People raiding you for all your valuables can be common and it is very annoying when you die when you have really rare things on you.I am looking forward to how this game will shape out in the next month or so. Rust has a lot of potential and I hope it reaches it's potential.I recommend buying this game for sure!(By the way look up ways to increase frame rate),Rust

There is no reward for your work other than the enjoyment of the game. No levels or skills or even items that you can hold onto.You will lose everything you work to get.But if your quick and learn to play you just may get to have a few unforgettable evenings with friends blowing holes in peoples walls with c4 killing them in their sleep and stealing everything they have.I do recommend this game because i have some unforgettable moments building ramps up to the top level of peoples towers blowing a hole into their sanctuary and throwing every single item they had down 8 floors to my freinds outside as they carted it all back to our base.

2016-07-30,2,1,473,True,Not Recommended,Ah Rust a game where you can't even trust your friends. What a journey this has been for me. Building a house one night and logging on next morning just to find that someone had breached through my side wall. The fuel of rage coursing through my body as I interigate everyone on the 7 man server (excluding myself). Then just to get back what I've lost. Thats Rust. The rage you feel in your body is Rust. The fear you get when you open your front door at night and being paranoid that someone is going to blast you in the face with a Pipey that is Rust. But these are the good parts of the game. But now lets get into the bad parts. Could a game as breath taking as this have flaws? Surprisingly yes. One of the main things that people are going to be talking about is the new implemented XP system. I personally hate it. Grinding is a major turn off. Like all XP systems in games you need to prepare yourself for the grind because it will take around about 4 5 hours just to get a bow and arrow at level 7. See this game used to have these things called Blueprints. Honestly were my favorite because that was something I've never seen before. I never got tired of it. Finding 50 100 Blueprint Fragments inside a box was the best feeling anyone could ever have apart from finding an Assault Rifle inside a barrel. The XP system made this game feel like any other game. But sadly this game will probably never go back to the old Blueprint system. It's going to be like Legacy thrown off to the side and never mentioned again. Thank you for your time and hope this review helps.,Rust

2014-03-26,0,0,356,True,Recommended,"**Early Development Build all information below may be wildly different from now till release and beyond.**Would i still recommend this game? Yes.Rust had gone through a complete redesign. A gutting of the original game and completely repurposed new engine all back end things that players only notice small upgrades from. How has it paired up to its predecssor the ""legacy rust""?Pretty well in my opinion. Rust has the base building down very well as well as resource gathering and scavenging is overall pretty solid. New procedual maps make each server unique and different but does the survival aspect still hold water?Unfortunately Rust's survival is still very lacking. Your survival will be more or less surviving your fellow man more so than anything else. Sure in this swiming at night can and will kill you diving for more than a few minutes will also kill you and there are ways to be ""poisoned"" from eating spoiled meat but the survival versus elements is still very minimal.The current state base raiding is broken majorly to the point it is up to luck if you can get into someones base or not. With recent base building changes you can make impregnable houses which some would welcome this however many would not.Rust plays and feels very much like an alpha which early access is just that. Should you buy right now? Depends if you want a complete package with minimal hiccups and lower frustration i'd avoid this. If you don't mind wipes hiccups and frustrating bugs that will impede you in some places but want to watch the game develop this is a perfect one to go into.The biggest issue still remains from previous builds as well the ""survival"" aspect is rather weak. Base building gathering all has improved greatly but as time goes on we'll see just how great this team can pull off the survival portion of the game.",Rust

Stay under the radar don't be the one hated by the community you will be targeted and will lose. 4. Live in a very secret and suclided area. 5. Don't listen to people most people in this game are idiotic or have an ultimate goal to stab you in the back. 6. Remeber everything you see at some point it effects the whole community. 7. Don't feed the animals. 8. Don't be an absolute most people in this game have no heart show some people you're not an a hole. 9. Raidaition sites need pills. 10.

2016-03-01,0,0,367,True,Recommended,Well seeing that I've owned the game for just over a week so far and already have almost 2 days played I'd say that this is a super fun game. If you're easily extremely off then maybe it's not the game for you as I often find myself (especially in the earlier stages) dying after I start to get a bit of a base going with my friends. This game is definitely a game that is much more enjoyable with friends you can still play it solo it's just a bit harder. There also is no single player incase anyone is wondering it's entirely on multiplayer servers. You can make your own server to play on if you wanted and it's not too difficult. A big thing to keep in mind if you don't have a good enough computer to run games like Minecraft or Counter Strike at decent settings at a decent speed I would not recommended this game. I personally have a GTX 960 and an AMD FX 8350 and on highest settings I usually get only about 30 45 fps on a less populated server. This game will require some patience at the start but is definitely worth it. I plan to continue to play this game a ton and spend many weekends hacking away at wood with my rock and smashing many boulders. 10/10. I love this game,Rust
2014-06-27,0,0,2046,True,Recommended,Fun game if you have a good group of friends. Playing alone is going to be very hard. Dont give up right away though find a good server and some friends and build a base!,Rust
2016-10-30,0,0,482,True,Recommended,I must say I've been playing on and off since this first came out. (hence only 200 hours on record as of writing this) Yet this game is overall extremely fun. The fun of building and gearing up is great. There are always the raids which are fun but don't try to play this and have moral. You WILL get raided offline and the only way to cope is to also RAID offline.Trying to be nice to new spawns or presumed new spawn nudes will only get you sprayed in the face with an AK or hosed with a Shotty in the back. You'll also find people who rust is their only life and their only thing to do is to latch onto you and just grief you completely over and over until you find a way to evict them from the tower in front of your base they raided every other night just to destroy everything your group has repeatedly. Sure you could move but why?Still waiting to get out of early release to get some of the vehicles in game kinda tired of hoofing it across the map and then having to hoof it back in the dark. Thank god my headset with bass boost lets me hear everything from bears to helis from a distance. Of course walking/running everywhere you're probably much much quieter than you know driving a truck when they come out.Soo all in all take the good with the bad and overcome. Trust nobody unless you know them or they've proven their worth. Also big bases need lots of cabinets. Lots and lots of Tool cabinets.,Rust

It is still in Early Access so there are still major issues such as the need to unsuck the environment procedural generation or add custom made maps. You can tell the developers are committed to this game releasing weekly Dev Updates in their blog unlike other early access games which seem more like a pyramid scheme. Highly recommended!,Rust

Can get extreme lag to the point where you cant play .Your house is never safe from raids .Russians dont have their own server so they hop on uk servers . Most Russians shoot on sight .Not many uk people on uk servers due to Russians WAYS TO IMPROVE GAME . Give Russians their own server!!! .Fix the lag .Add in different meats other than chicken8/10,Rust
2014-02-09,0,0,49,True,Recommended,This game is already amazingly fun in its alpha stage. I've been playng this game for a week already with a couple of friends and it has become one of my favorite games on Steam.

2014-02-09,0,0,166,True,Recommended,I have nearly 30 hours in Rust and so far i'm loving the game. It may be frustrating at times farming for 30 mins and then some random gang decides you don't deserve to live. You can only run for your life and the majority of times you can't survive. But this is what makes a survival game so intense.If you want hardcore survival experience this is the game.,Rust
2014-02-10,0,0,66,True,Recommended,Possibly one of the most fun and addictive games I have ever played. Think Minecraft made realistic mixed with DayZ with stunning graphics and fun ideas. You play through surviving then you can go around looting old towns look for people's houses to raid and steal their stuff build your own massive house and more. A fun part is how when you disconnect from the server it leaves your body vunerable and killable so that when you rejoin you are DEAD D The hourly air drops with supplies keeps the game alive and an excitement to go for! Make friends with other players or kill everyone on sight it's all up to you!So much fun and can't wait to see what else the game has to offer. Still in Alpha and has some bugs here and there but even still it is really fantastic.Solid 9/10,Rust

2014-03-27,0,0,66,True,Recommended,"""You either die trying to survive or you live long enough to see yourself become full of greed and evil."" this is what you will expierence you'll go from trying to surive and avoiding people to ""the first person you see is dead"". You are set on a island where you and dozens of other players try to surive the land the wild ...and each other. You start off with nothing but a rock from there you collect wood find or craft armor and supplies and gather weapons. From there you try to find a spot somewhere where you know you'll be safe and hidden and try building your home there. wether bulding a small shack or a mansion the creative ideas don't stop. I built myself a mansion and surrounded it with spike walls and countless doors with locks. he wild life is dangerous(bears and wolves only) the first few days but once you craft some shotguns or something it becomes really easy. I hope the developers throw in a thougher enemy (dinosaur cough cough). but it's still all around fun. The greatest threat like I said that you'll face is other players. Will you try and make peace to other players or avoid them or attack as soon as you see and jack their crap. I usually avoid them until some guys built their house close to mine in which case I had to take action to protect my house and myself. This game is all about fun though and when your with friends it's all the more better.",Rust
2014-06-06,2,1,32,True,Recommended,Love this game. I've heard many complaints about some bugs in the game but what can you expect when you're paying Early Access for it? This game is totally worth the $20 and I love experimenting with so many things in the game. My favorite part is the glitch jump right by my wooden gate. I'd open the gate and get launched higher than my 5 story house only to land on my wooden spikes and bleed.,Rust
2014-10-29,0,0,171,True,Recommended,After investing quite a bit of time into this game I can say I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. Although I have yet to even try the developing mode I generally stick to legacy. It is a lot of fun to get a bunch of friends together to play and build a fortress defend it etc.... Although the devs decided to scrap it and start from scratch which is annoying. Overall good game stick to legacy for now since it is the only one that appears to be playable.,Rust

2014-01-18,0,0,242,True,Recommended,Rust in my opinion is an excellent model of PVP raiding survival building and hunting game. Not only does it offer a multitude of items and a diversity of things to do it also has attained an immense amount of positive publicity. It is only in Alpha.For New Rust the devs have been constantly updating the game and the community has been launching servers either vanilla or modded. The game is much more in depth espically with the new crafting system components and random terrain maps for each server.,Rust

2014-05-07,0,0,79,True,Recommended,This game has incredible potential and is a ton of fun as it stands right now. There are several things that ould make it more accessable to new players however. The biggest one would be the addition of a map. It is extremely difficult to pair up or find new players when they dont even know where they are in the world. New items smoother animations more varied terrian/ different maps would make this game perfect.,Rust

2014-04-04,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,Ok first things first this game is Fun with the building aspect of it but beyond that the game is $hit it benefits players that can constantley play and casuals get $hit on. You can't play the game for more then 10 15 mins on LOW POP SERVERS and you get annilated and things get stolen from you the enjoyment of the game is honestly just the building and exploring but you cant even do that cause you have to watch your house 24/7 to protect it which disrespects players that have a life outside of the gaming life which is a very negative thing to me I would return this game pronto if I was able to I feel so robbed. Note that even in PVE servers players can rob you and all you can do is watch them take it. They really need to make the house a safe haven not a hey we can robb this and take every little thing you own WHILE YOU ARE LOGGED OFF I understand this is a survival game and it's in Alpha it has a TON of stuff thats needed to get to be a deacent game.This game will benefit you if ya have no life or are able to play 16 18 hours a day just to protect your stuff. But take it from me as a gamer I defiently do NOT reccomend this game. Im a straight up Casual and I was super happy to build a base but to come back after my 10 hours of hard work on my base after i got off my job and EVERYTHING was gone.The way they should change it is make the homes indestructable or add freaking crates that you can add locks on that cannot be destroyed...,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,22,True,Recommended,This game is good for 3 kinds of players.1. SociopathsPeople who enjoy shooting noobs in uneven matches or who enjoy ruining other people work for sweet sweet tears in chat. They are probably not skilled enough to excel in pure PvP combat games where everyone is on equal footing teamwise and gearwise.2. Team playersCould be either group of sociopaths but even of normal people as being in group makes this style possible. I can see how few teams waging wars against each other and raiding their fortressses in more controlled and fair fashion. Still groups of sociopaths who kills everyone seems prevalent.3. Solo player vs. enviroment aka Robinson CrusoeIf you enjoy crafting building your existence from nothing survival in nature and exploring surrounding terrain this game is also nice for you. For your enjoyment you should choose empty or almost empty server or you fun will be most likely destroyed by others. PvE aspect of this game is not deep enough yet but you can get around 20 hours of fun for your money.Also be wary of servers named Friendly PvP or similar. It is either evolution of regular PvP where creators of theese servers hope to lure noobs to feast on or even if their intent is nice sociopaths are migrating here in hopes to get more easy prey.,Rust

2014-03-15,0,0,62,True,Not Recommended,"OVERALLOversold lie. Rust can be a fun game. It's a community game so most of the dynamics depend on playing with a good community that you agree with. If you want to run in a shoot on sight cut throat server you can find one. If you want to do ""PVE"" for whatever that is you can find a server catered to you. However Rust is definitely geared towards PVP and killing/raiding other people's bases and creating your own. I have some logged hours in which I had fun with friends. This was gifted to me for I personally feel like alpha games now have a bad stigma. THE BAD.Now let's go to the real The creators themselves have stated that they are still trying to find their 'vision' (at the time of this post). They probably have more under wraps that they do not want to reveal but all updates to this point have shown this to be true. Since they have no plan their updates are fairly useless and have not really affected gameplay. Polishing textures making stuff look better etc... The game has been virtually the same the past few months disappointingly. The more time goes on the more it feels like a scam. As an alpha game you expect the updates to be massive changes to the structure rather than focus on lower priorities. This is not to say they may not be working on important things but it has yet to be released.Everywhere there is discussion between the fan communities there is the same banter between constructive/deconstructive criticisms and zealous fans. ""Where's some real updates?!"" HAVE SOME PATIENCE YOU )#$*% IT TAKES TIME TO MAKE A GAME"" some feature is bugged and broken! fix it jerks!"" GIVE THEM A BREAK IT'S ALPHA CAN'T YOU READ ACEHOz GEEZ LA WEEZetc...Since it's alpha most of the loyal followers give them a free pass at everything as well as having infinite patience. The developers participation in dialogue with the community is fairly one way. There is a lack of transparency and warmth. In the end the developers' dearth of professionalism really shows. While it may not be a fair comparison the frequency and amount of updates in the patches in DayZ compared to Rust are quite surmountable. Rust could still be a great game but as of now I would be hesitant to give to these developers. This is 2014 lots of games are anticipated save your money for the big hitters.",Rust

2014-11-01,0,0,261,True,Recommended,Although Ive never played the experimental side of Rust (it launches but doesn't find servers). I have spend a number of hours running around in the legacy version. Sometimes with friends and sometimes trying to make friends but always building scavenging and surviving. After all that is the main focus of the game survive. To the uninitiated that can seem easy until your 5 minutes in naked in the middle of a field with only a rock when a bear starts chasing you. So you re spawn and try again. This time you manage to kill something but don't realise you must cook the food and you get poisoned. This is really just the begging and where everyone starts off and although it can start to seem daunting after you have the basics covered you can start to move on to the more fun aspects of the game. Such as building your first base interacting with people finding and looting crates and then battling for air drops. The server tends to play a large part in what the game play will be like and how heavily the admins police the server will determine if your experience is a good one.The content is great as well as the base building aspects and even the weapon systems and modifications whilst simple are still enjoyable. Personally I've been following the devlogs and cant wait to experience experimental considering all the hard work the developers are putting in. For now though im stuck in legacy just having a lot of fun and im sure you will also. 8/10,Rust

2014-05-30,0,0,143,True,Recommended,I am going to say that i like rust but not reccomend it to everyone. If people are looking for a complete solid game with minimal bugs then dont get this. Not right now anyways. At least until it gets out of alpha(If it ever does.) There are many downdides to rust but also many upsides. The downsides are that the game is full of hackers there are many bugs such as levitating animals grounded animals or just invisible animals. The lag is also a problem. This is mainly an issue because when i am fighting mutant wolves and bears sometimes a lag spike occurs the game does not detect any controls so i am just standing during the lag spike. You can probably guess what happens next. But dispite the load of stuff in the game that makes it kinda crappy there are many good sides to it as well. This game has the best player interaction i have ever seen. In one server I came across there were two factions at war with each other fighting to see who would take over the server. I joined in and it was like i was in a movie or something. One of our bases got raided but they didnt use c4. Our leader said someone amongst us was a traitor. On another server there was an arms race between two gangs to see who would get c4 first. These experiences are something that i never have had and never will get from any other game. I get off from time to time when i get raided and i end up quitting rust. But I always come back.,Rust

This looks promising. So walked around a bit saw people with more then me.. and well.. CLUNK.. had a shiny new more then they had ty. Mine chop wood harvest animals. build a wooden or metal.. sky scraper ( bigest ive seen is around 50 yards up) then when all else fails blow it up. Everything is destructable full loot random spawn or camp spawn if you made the right item for it.. toss a few zombies in it and boosha! Instant addiction. Not bad for an alpha build. Worth the money seriously.Epic moment.. walk up to some guy looting another players bags popped him with a shotty and he yells in voice coms "" Don't shoot i only got a hatchet and.. im jiggin"". m/ I let him live! ) Dont be half steppin!",Rust

2013-12-13,0,0,23,True,Recommended,After watching a PsiSyndicate video featuring Rust Alpha Access I immediantly fell in love with the game (without even playing yet) So I decided to go ahead and purchase Rust myself After a decent amount of time played I must say this is a incredibly fun game! Once you die about 2 times you get the hang of things and you start to understand animals zombies and the crafting alot more! A cool thing is about 70% of the people on Rust are most of the time friendly while the other 30% are crazy naked men... All in all I would give this game a 10/10 rating Garry has done it again! (not a suprise). If you are considering I highly recommend purchasing it especially if you like Minecraft Or Dayz!,Rust

2013-12-19,0,0,439,True,Recommended,"Rust which can only be described as ""DAYZ ON CRACK"" not only did FacePunch mast the basics of the game like NPCs and monsters not glitching and taking 10+HP for no reason other then pure lag. I have been playing non stop for 4 days and I love every moment. It really is different then any other zombie survivals for the fact that you can build bases craft items and the community for the most part are pretty friendly and will not kill on sight. Two major reason to buy are the price and the game dev's behind the game. Like I said I have been playing for 4 days and already they have fixed the major bugs with lag and some small bugs that were just annoying. To me that is what alpha should be like they are asking the community what is wrong and the community tell then and they will listen and make it happen. Also you can expect the randomness and the creativity that came with GMOD. But seriously being a player of Dayz for years I lost all faith that a zombie surival with online players could not be laggy and they really realllllyy made this game perfect. I have not rage quit once due to stupid bugs and just pure flaws. I am going to recommend this game to anyone that is willing to dump time into a game fall in love with it and enjoy the ecstasy of new updates that they will be releasing.On a side note if you ever are having troubles with questions or anything like that Here is the wiki http //playrustwiki.com/wiki/Play_Rust_Wiki_ _Main_PageYou can add me on steam I have been playing and know all.

2014-04-16,0,0,495,True,Recommended,"As I started with at $20 dollars and in alpha while I got many times my idea of value in terms of fun to value I m talking about it in ""past tense"" . As it is I felt like I fully explored and relished what is in the game to date. They'll need to build on this firm foundation to create longer term interest.The discovery of things to do in a persistent universe of a sandbox nature is an iterative process and depends a great deal on monitoring ""emergent gameplay"". The developers seem to understand this at a core level of priority... yet they're at a juncture of not really knowing where to go next. Should they develop greater NPC involvement? Should they try to make the game more about territorial domination that could give more purpose to geo political cooperation in a multi week basis? Should they more clearly define starts and ends to server cycles between ""wipes"" . Given the advantages players who have joined a server earlier after a wipe and also the ""solved puzzle"" aspect of the ramp up of pvp survival assets and skills being a large part of the ""fun"" (its the journey not the destination grasshopper) ""wipes"" are part of what has ""emerged"" in the payer experience. (the exception is those mods as describe in a paragraph above who set rules trying to emphasize the FPS aspect of the game over the survival and grinding aspects).Anyway I hope this review gives a glimmer about some exciting things I found in the game that many others long for in online gaming and as aspect of persistent universes motivating player cooperation and giving the sense of ""progress"" on an individual basis over a multi week period. I hope more developers pursue ways to find those sorts of player experience and Rust is a very active attempt and even a quite fine existing product in the area (for a few weeks of exploring the content at this stage) Be sure to experiment with multiple servers enjoying the different feel on each and quickly quitting those where you're not enjoying the environment the mods lay down or the state of interaction might be at if it has been too long sense the last wipe.Cheers.",Rust

2013-12-18,0,0,2326,True,Recommended,One of the most amazing games I've played in 2013. Probably the best it's sandbox features building ability constant threat of real danger and legitimate concequences for almost EVERY action truly makes this an experience unlike any other. In the beginning you are alone dreadfully alone in the world half starved and 3 items... a rock torch and 2x bandages. With these items you learn quickly to make better equipment slaughter your first pig/deer and survive your first night usually under the stars with only a campfires glow to realize how alone you are... That's right about the time you die without warning a shot rings out in the night and you realize that shotguns to the face are a quick trip back to a new random respawn. Try 2 you think you've learned a few things you start thinking ok... my fire gave me away I need to hide it better etc. and so begins the process of truely learning how to survive in the world of Rust and you're hooked. Hooked on the danger and excitement around every rock hooked on the friends you make and the enemies you hate hooked on the mission.... survive.,Rust
2014-01-02,0,0,445,True,Recommended,There is so much potention in this game. The problem lies in pvp as always the naked man is duking it out against the fully clad Kevlar guy swinging a machine gun in your direction and shooting your berries off. The great thing is you can hide in a corner of the map and scrape together a tiny base and maybe catch up to him.The problem's i see so far with only a few hours played. 1) The Loot from boxes that spawn in erradiated zones is O.P. So one second i am naked 2 buildings later i have a 9mm 15 rounds of ammo and schematics for a grenade??? that escalated quickly2) Airdrops now depending on the server admin these can be quite crazy personally i think they should be taken out of the game since they can contain some pretty exotic items... and the server admin can just spawn whatever he wants anyways without the drops.3) Not really a problem but a comment for anyone who wants to get into this game. If you get killed no matter how it happens by another player unless it is actually a cheat do not whine about it in chat. You are giving the kid exactly what he wants by whining. I know he had a machine gun and all you had was a rock but hey it happened and yes he is that big of a jerk start building somewhere else.(4) There is a building system and a research system i would love to see the players relying completely on that instead of the random boxes and drops. I Would love to go from rock wielding to machine gun toting in some kind of logical progression through crafting.(5) Resources are not random ie/ores and woodpiles. They can be farmed in the exact same spot every so often and they only appear on a small portion of the map making a 100 person server quite the competition.It is in Alpha maybe many of these things were put in to give us something to do as they flesh out the game and world. The controls are quite smoothe although rock wielding can be a bit tricky with the downswing delay... you get used to it.,Rust

2014-06-07,0,0,79,True,Recommended,This game has a ton going for it. The ELI5 verson of the game description is that it's a combo of Minecraft and Farcry. It's a game where your choice have real concequences. Because there's no plotline or written story whatsoever your Rust story is totally unique. (Side note all the characters look like Bruce Willis a little)Best part It's as close as you're going to get to being dropped in the wilderness and forced to survive on your own.Worst part Hackers. Hackers everywhere.If you buy this game (you should) heed this advice 1. Don't play on a community server right now. People are getting VAC banned but not soon enogh2. Playing by yourself is really tough. Imagine if you were one of a few survivors in a wasteland. It's really hard to trust anybody.3. Don't trust anybody4. Airdrops are rarely worth going for.5. Settle a camp by resources.6. Make friends!I would recomend this game to almost anybody. You do need to be older to thrive in the Rust community. This type of game requires a lot of people skills.,Rust

Progression is where its at. Take risks in RAD towns and find blueprints. Blueprints give good loot. You can then build this loot into guns Medkits etc. Then really you find your inner and and pillage everyone. Much fun to be had. 750/10,Rust

Even in its pre release alpha phase this one is gearing up to be an absolute kicker!Now yes it is taking a loooong time to finish but once you get into it and find your footing you'll see what we all can. My first few sessions were alright although a little ""huh?"" but the building potential is what hooked me and will keep me I believe...I will say this finding the right server (good community etc.) was the real key to it as I'm not much of a PvP player so finding mature friendly fellow players was a bit touch and go but once found wow GREAT FUN!Even though its still a lil' glitchy (alpha) the PvE experience of surviving and building a raid proof place to stow your loot cook your food and craft advanced materials and items is incredibly addictive and i find myself looking at my watch and saying ""Holy s*** its 6am!"" thoroughly enthralling!The building and crafting although quite basic is very engaging especially the ability to build your own tower or bunker or even clifftop shack anywhere you can find a patch of ground to lay a foundation. The build factor has had me spending night after night building bases of all kinds and there is quite a bit of room for creativity in your architecture if you think outside the box no pun inteded (you'll get that after seeing a few of the generic 'Box towers' most players build).The only downside for me is that there are a lot of bags as there is with any good mmo but as i said above once you've found the right server that problem is eliminated it can be a little hard to find the right server but your perseverance will be rewarded with hours and hours of fun.All in all I've had so much fun and so much to come I rate this one a hardy 8/10 Rusted metal fragments!PEACE",Rust
2014-06-01,0,0,57,True,Recommended,Really fun game especially with friends (once you find eachother). But i really wish people would treat this as the survival game I believe it is.

On the other hand in pvp I have been beaten to death with a rock for a tiny scrap of food on a fire gunned down by naked people for walking too far into a field and chased down by zombies wolves and bears all along the way.That said this is a very solid game especially for an alpha you get plenty of bang for your buck and its a hard game to put down I cant wait to see where it goes from here.,Rust

It is by no means an easy game. Nor a forgiving nor a friendly nor a casual game. It is not meant to be played a few hours a week. I'm not saying that you can't do it be my guest! But you won't stand a chance on an even remotely populated server. well.. you probably won't stand a chance in the beginning anyway it takes blood sweat and tears to even learn the basic fundamentals.Having said all that give it a chance.

2014-01-29,0,0,131,True,Recommended,I've played many games where the quality betwen playing alone and with a friend was big but Rust really took it to the next level. The first two week or so I played this game on a server with approx. 120 people online all the time. There was barely any resources the radtowns were always a battlefield for the various high end clans and gangs. Whenever I died I would die 5 or six more times trying to reach my base because some 12 year old boy or some guy with broken english would chase after me mock and humiliate me and then kill me even though I was naked and only had bandages and a torch. Needless to say the game was not worth it's cost.But then my friend joined we found ourselves a server with less players and started from scratch. Now 4 days later me and my friend are running through the map in our full anti rad armor looking hunting down animals with fully upgraded M4s and scavenging for metal to build our second house made entirely of metal. Making allies and enemies along the way the everlasting paranoia and the unsettling moments when we meet other armed players out in the open. When we go on raids in the night or when we hear footsteps outside our base. This game is already worth it's money just by having a friend to play with and it's only alpha!,Rust

2014-03-21,0,0,43,True,Recommended,Rust is a game that is in alpha development. Be sure to purchase it now in it's early release as it is just going to get more pricy as it updates. Rust is a survival game made by Facepunch Studios the creators of Garry's Mod. It is a sandbox RPG. The game has inherited attributes to Day Z and Minecraft. You have to watch out for your hunger how cold you are the wildlife that can kill you and other players on the server which may raid you. You can also craft weapons from hatchets to all types of guns. Being in early development the game is impressive. The graphics are of standard of an early release game the features it has make the game interesting and fun to play and the gameplay itself is amazing. Also if you are really perveted you can type a certain command into the console to turn of the nudity censor so you will see males that are naked running around unless they have put armour on. Being a game which you can do practically anything in that is what makes it so fun to play and what makes you keep going back to play it again.Rate 9/10,Rust

2014-02-17,0,0,55,True,Recommended,Rust is a good game but no better than that. If you join a heavily populated server you'd be lucky to survive even 30 minutes. Chances are most of the people are heavily equipped with the best gear. What makes it hard to survive is that people kill on sight even though they know if you're a fresh spawn. If there was a place in the world where all the new people spawn without the d*ckhead players entering then maybe it could be better. But other than that Rust is a very good game.,Rust

2014-02-27,0,0,478,True,Recommended,When Terraria DayZ Minecraft and Skyrim had a baby it made Rust. This game is awesome. Still in early alpha servers are at the will of the developers and admins and may sometimes get wiped or reset in order to upgrade to a new large patch but that doesn't often cause problems. Farming building looting raiding surviving Half the fun of this game is starting out and getting yourself setup in a nice wooden shack until you can safetly farm for materials to build a wooden structure you can call home. The other portion of the fun comes from interacting with other players although most others will kill you on sight make it an effort to not get seen unless you are protected or rolling with homies. End game is ultimately PvP at this point as the only features of PvE boast hunting wild rabbit chicken deer boar wolves and bears. Server built areas are prime for looting and you can score awesome loot from different kinds of chests found in these areas including top quality military grade weaponry. Of course once you have built yourself a fine establishment and have gathered enough resources found blueprints and crafted weapons munitions and armor you'll be ready to raid other player structures if you so choose. PvP can be brutal in this game as your inventory is dropped in a backpack if you die free for others to take. If killed you may choose to spawn at a random point on the map or if you have placed a sleeping bag or bed you can choose to spawn there making your base all the more important. Play smart stay stealthy and don't make yourself a target even then people will find you and kill you it's part of the game. There are no PvP servers if that isn't your thing but that takes the venom out of the snake imo.This game can be a huge time sync and with servers possibly getting wiped you just have to chin up and look forward to starting fresh if this happens. This game is a fully functioning and beautiful alpha. The potential is boundless and developers patch it roughly once a week. This game has nowhere to go but up. Outside of minor framerate problems (even with a decent gaming laptop) more gui and interface options are being patched in and the game will eventually become more optimized.10/10 haven't sunk this much time into a game since I first started playing WoW 10 years ago.,Rust

2014-06-22,0,0,6,True,Recommended,"Well the first time I spawned there was a little wooden house next to me. Being a noob I went up and started knocking on the door with my rock. Three naked men came out and they all started yelling at me. Only two of them spoke English and the one was kind of a translator for what sounded like gibberish to me. They commanded me into an area which they then built a shack around me. It was small with just one window with metal bars over it and an old wooden door. Every morning they would harvest me for work time. We would walk in train formation one of them me then another one of them behind me. This way I couldn't run anywhere or I'd be shot dead. I was forced to chop wood with a boulder (this took forever...) but every day I stowed away 3 4 wood and didn't give it to them.After they trusted me more I was given a pickaxe and told to mine under supervision. They would stand and watch me as I went off and mined the nearby areas. I collected stone sulphur and metal ore.Get this the idiots even let me come into the main house to smelt their metal for them. So I made metal sulphur and charcoal. While they thought I was smelting their metal I was actually crafting something that would be useful for my escape.After I smelted everything they sent me back into my shack and told me goodnight be ready for work in the morning. I waited a couple minutes to make sure they were gone. Then I used my lockpick and opened the door and crept over to the main house. I could see them through the cracks in the walls. I hit the door with my rock and told them on the microphone ""theres some guy beating your door in with a rock!"" and they open the door. I guess they didn't expect to get a shotgun to the face and all their stuff stolen.I now live on the cliff of a mountain in a beautiful home with everything I could ever need.edit They captured me again and forced me to test their chicken for salmonella and I died of food poisoning. I have no indication of where my home is or where they are. I think I'm free. I'm going to build my own home far away from everyone now.",Rust

2017-07-15,0,0,347,True,Recommended,Even though this game is in Alpha the gameplay is astoundingly real and quite humorous. There's always something to try out whether it's hunting trying a new base build crafting or looking to get the drop on other players. I'm sure they're working on more features because the potential for this game is pretty far ahead of other survival games.,Rust

I got it two days ago and have already put almost 15 hours in and it only keeps getting better! You barely need to use the wiki to figure out the crafting and resource managment which is really nice. If I had to pick out one part of the game that is the most fun I would say the structure creation. The fact that you can build components and design your own structures is really cool! It takes a lot of resources to make the components but not so many that it gets frustrating. The spawn rate of resources and findables is balanced. Easy to find but not just laying around everywhere. The developers added a nice little tool which allows you to research an item letting you duplicate rare drops by adding them to your crafting list. This ""research tool"" is a random drop from mobs. LOTS of servers with a really pleasant and helpful community. Many servers are working on building a solid player base before the pvp really starts. The server I like the best so far is Community&gt Multiplay Fair Rust Experience. Come and join me!",Rust

2014-02-25,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,I'll start by saying that the game does have a large amount of potential in terms of graphics gameplay and sandboxing however I wouldn't recommend it in its current state. Whilst it can be fun running around with a group of five+ people if you're on your own or even with just another friend you will (in 99% of instances) just get shot whilst trying to get materials for your base. In the event you do actually manage to get a base set up you log off log back in the next day and someones blown up your door replaced it with theirs and changed the passcode so your base is now theirs... There goes a day of your life.Aiming is also shocking and the recoil on some of the weapons is beyond insane. MP5 you fire one shot and the recoil kicks in... Well you end up aiming into the sky.I'll keep an eye on it but until a lot more development is put into it it's a no go for me.,Rust
2014-02-25,0,0,43,True,Not Recommended,A game with a lot of potential but there are no checks and balances. All in all the people with a lot of free time have the advantage.If you have to leave for work/school you might as well kiss your base goodbye. There isn't any room for the casual gamer here. On top of that in my experience at least this game seems to breed trolls. Unfortunately until there is a considerable change in game mechanics I don't see myself playing this game anymore. Escpecially with having a very busy normal life.,Rust
2014-02-25,0,0,314,True,Recommended,This game is a lot of fun for groups of people or even for lonely players looking for people to play with. Minecraft revisited nicer graphics and the PvP is much more fun. It can get a little frustrating to get raided a lot but you end up learning from your mistakes and building an epic fortress. It's still in Alpha and it's a huge load of fun. Can't wait for the finished version to come out.,Rust

Nothing seems to be done to discourage the behavior.Dont login for 2 days .. all your wooden walls and your steel doors are gone..(and i mean all . perhaps it's a bug due to todays patch but still.)Prepare to get shot 10 times even if you have only a rock.. It basicly comes down to any shooter. .. for people who like to camp there behind off...Personaly i was hoping for a more survive the enviroment kind of survival game.. not survive the players kind of game..It is fun the first few hours then it just gets anoying and to boring.

2015-09-13,0,0,352,True,Recommended,Like rocks? Rust has rocks!Like PVP? Rust has player killing constantly DLike building a base just to lose it the next morning? Neither do I but it happens!If you like a building game that is PVE don't touch this game! Here is why 1. Constant death from other players Naked men will attack you on sight Players will shoot you for existing2. Your base will be destroyed raided griefed taken over or have naughty signs made by other players on your stuff3. You will die from bears wolves cold weather etc.4. People will mock you knock you down and refuse to shoot you just to whisper sweet nothings in your ear before double tapping you. So why would I recommend this??? Continue reading If you enjoy PVP. a Full Loot System and the ability to build anywhere on a randomly generated map of awesomeness then this game is for you! Here is why 1. You start out with basically nothing and must gather find or steal resources from the world and build or steal an awesome house.2. The crafting in this game has an interesting system and you must find certain recipes to craft special items and said recipes are in pvp hot zones giving the game some battleground for fun. This also makes you work for the good stuff. (recipes stay on you even after death)3. The game gives you choices to be lethal or not. You may ask another have them give things to you if they don't you have some options Shoot/melee them till they are on the ground and loot their body Shoot/melee them to the ground then double tap them possibly after hearing them scream a little so they know you're twisted.4. You can build almost anywhere in the game and build how you want except a few resricted spots and the stability system. If your house isn't stable then it won't stay up if you build it by a pillar holding up half your house then once that pillar gets destroyed so does half your house when it collapses. You may upgrade the materials of your house to be more suited towards defense so it makes it REALLY hard for people to break in unless they have some massive fire power ( C4 Grenades Rocket launcher) You may lose your house often in this game depending on how well you build it how many friends you have with you etc. but build wisely and you won't lose it so often and you can take over other players' bases which is fun and rewarding.5. Killing other players in this game is very satisfying and is not some arcade shooter you shoot someone and they will bleed and probably die very very quickly if you shot them in a good spot. You may also eat your Foe after cooking it of course. Unless you want to eat it raw... and get sick...Rust is still in Early Access and now updates every two weeks with a developement blog every week. There are constant updates on their twitter page showing what they are doing.

Being able to craft create and shape your own world there isn't something that any game can offer you.A survival game that requires attention to detail and provides endless possibilities as long as your imagination keeps growing the limitation seem limitless.Build a house on the mountain side or a shack beside a huge fortress. The learning curve is a little steep an the game doesn't provide a more useful and insight guideline on how to craft certain objects.Lastly the removal of zombies from the game and adding more animals to the beautiful landscape truly sets this game apart from DayZ and Minecraft alike.8/10.,Rust

2014-06-21,0,0,260,True,Recommended,Probably the best game ever and it is only getting better. Now I understand that it is in early access and people who aren't reading the devblogs are crying that they never update the game just ignore those things because those people are wrong and this is how early access should be done. The devs of Rust ( Facepunch ) have already released a fairly complete game before they put it up for sale with most key features implemented they have now gone on to rebuild the game from mostly scratch using their own code specialised to the game.Now enough about the development and more about the game basically you can take it two ways it is either the most f*cked up kind of pedophile simulator or a sandbox playground full of little nubs just sitting there waiting for you. Rust is all about survival and mainly against the other players the community is pretty torn most people are friendly and willing to help however just like any community there are holes there to ruin it mind you no where near as bad as DayZ bandits. There is plenty to do in Rust and suits almost every gamer there is if you want to build go build a wall that stretches the whole map to keep wildlings out as I have. You want to kill go kill no one said you had to play nice. You want to raid go raid if you can get to it the loot is yours. You want to have a giant party in the middle of nowhere with 50+ naked people then go do that there is no boundries in Rust and there will always be a naked dude prepared to lay down some sick beats.Pros Sandbox Great PvP with excellent hit detection Good community and high player count Learning curve is well balanced easy to learn hard to master Has a great sense of humor in the community and you will always find something to laugh your off about The ragdolls are hilariousCons There are a few bugs which may kick you however none of these will ever occur in combat Some hats are unforgiving sh*t lords who kill you for fun Hackers were an issue but are now less common but eqaully annoying addictingAll in all Rust is a great game which really stretches your trust in strangers and is a must have for every one9/10,Rust

The only Steam game I've ever played that actually update a lot and added a lot during those updates. I've been with Rust for a while now. When I got it you bought it from a Dutch auction on playrust.net. I got it for about 25 bucks. I was the 16 103rd person to get the game according to my receipt. Says it was released on Dec 11 2013? Lies. It was in September as an ""early pre alpha"". It was different then. Less player oriented back then. More about zombies and stuff like that. And then the worst thing to ever happen to any Steam game EVER happened. They removed zombies and replaced them with red wolves and bears. And all the updates from then on were minor. Didn't add much. Until Experimental version.The game got so ed up they had to redo the entire game.If you run Rust from Steam it will ask ""Play Rust?"" or ""Play DirectX 9.0"". CHOOSE ""Play Rust"". DX9 version came a long way but ended. They redid Rust. Completely. And holy is it better now! You can shank all your friends with machetes swords and knives made from the bones of your fallen enemies! Eat them once you shank them! Then go hit a barrel get some blueprint fragments research a Bolt Action Rifle and then 360 noscope their asses! Build a house! Get raided! Raid somebody! Get stuff!

2014-07-06,0,0,3,True,Recommended,A fun game to play and it's incredibly addicting. It's recommended that you play it with friends since one of the best ways to survive in Rust is to ply with people that you can trust and rely upon.,Rust

2014-02-12,0,0,571,True,Recommended,10/10 would recommend! Here is why I like that you spawn in to the world naked and only equipped with a rock. Then you have to either fight or be elusive to gather supplies find/build shelter horde supplies then finally build a base... but the real reason i give this game a 10/10 is because once having built a full house with metal doors a random person walks to my front door. Who else would i expect but a Jehovah's Witness preaching the word of GOD. Thought twice about letting him in to hear him out but i did what any Redditor would do I grabbed my Bolt Action Rifle from my crate and shot him in the face. BAD DECISION! Apparently there was like 6 or 7 on the server who immediately decided to surround my house and demand i repent.... like i said 10/10 would recommend!,Rust

Pulled many overnighters just because its so adictive.It has everything a survival game needs primative weapons to using C4 to blow open other players bases to take their hard earned resources rabid zombies animals that want to rip your face off massive map and the ability to customise your own defensive structure10/10 love it!!!,Rust

2015-06-26,0,0,510,True,Recommended,I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. You don't need a ultra overpriced monster of a machine to play this game and it looks gorgeous. I have to say since Beta I have loved playing rust. The Devs are absolutely awesome and have been expanding rust in so many that enhance the feeling you get when you play. Although I have only played for 260+ hours I can gladly say that rust is one of the few games that get a bang for your buck. Although the game isn't perfect and has issues with hackers I'm certain the Dev's will fix the issue like many of the problems in Rust. I hope my review was helpful to any buyers looking into invest in this game the negative comments are mostly about hackers but like any problems it will adventually be dimished.,Rust

2016-08-14,1,1,22,True,Not Recommended,Thanks to Rust I'm never buying an early access game again. It is far from a survival game It's KOS on sight most of the time hackers destroy you're house that took 3 hours to build in 3 seconds gathering resources is a pain in the and if you don't have gun a right away than chances are you're not gonna make it.,Rust

2016-02-05,0,0,957,True,Recommended,Have been playing rust for about 2 weeks Of the time of writing And have already seen multiple updates (Farely large) inplemented into the game. The game's Development team is highly dedicated to insuring that this game is updated which is what i look for in most games. The amount of content there is to explore is exponentially rising by the weeks. Pros Hundreds (If not thousands) of hours of fun enjoyable gameplay for solo or with friends. A vast amount of building materials to make your creations more personal and unique. Great player base Although Fat neckbeards will most likely teabag you upon death. Cons Fat neckbeards teabag you on death. Game has a little work on the optimizing side of things but that is to be expected in an early acess title. Overall rating 8/10,Rust

2017-04-20,0,0,1830,True,Recommended,One of the best games on the market in my opinion. Definitely a one of a kind game. I strongly suggest this game to people who enjoy titles like day Z and seven days to die.,Rust
2014-06-24,0,0,64,True,Recommended,Best game Dongs/10.There seems to be alot of good features in this game you'll enjoy it if you have friends to play with but if you don't you're going to have a bad time. Rust allows you to run around a open world finding materials and building houses and guns to protect yourself at night. Now with multiplayer you are basically against players aswell.. they can build explosives raid your house and you lose everything. If you're really smart you can protect your house with alot of doors and keep intruders out. You'll enjoy this game if you like Minecraft. ),Rust
2014-06-17,0,0,54,True,Recommended,I love this game. I would recommend it to anyone who even slightly enjoys survival based games. For only being in early access with the promise of this game getting better is mind blowing. Here's a short summary You start off with nothing. No clothes no resources. All you have is a torch 2 bandages and a rock. Shortly after waking up in this vast wilderness you realize that this rock is your most useful tool. You can use it to gather wood stones ore and kill the occasional animal. With this rock at that moment of realisation you feel like the world is your oyster and there's no stopping you...That's where you're wrong.You realize you aren't alone in this unfamiliar land and I'm not just talking about the bears deer chickens rabbits boars and other animals I mean to say there are other people and crudely built houses.Perhaps you'll make friends or enemies the choice is yours. Will you survive?PROS Fun and unique in some ways.Great game to work and build with others as a team.Uses a fair bit of strategy to defend yourself from the other not so friendly players.HUGE MAP.Many things to do.Lots of different weapons.Lots of craftable objects.The buildings can be quite impressive.It's fun hunting for the constant air drops.CONS Many servers seem to have a problem with hackers.More often than not you'll get raided and have to gather everything again.To build a decent base for yourself it takes ALOT of resources meaning ALOT of your time is spent gathering.Has a fairly steep learning curve that takes a few hours to get over. (Wiki's are your friend)CONCLUSION Definitely get this game. It is a game I feel that everyone should try. Steam Summer Sale 2014 is around the corner who knows? Maybe you'll get lucky.,Rust
2016-11-25,0,0,449,True,Recommended,Rust is the best example of Early Access done RIGHT.The devs are very active and communicative with devblogs and patches WEEKLY without fail.The game is fun and interesting even when you don't expect it to be. Even if you're just farming wood or stone you must stay on the lookout for someone sneaking up on you to gank.The base building system is by far the best I've seen in any survival game. It's simple enough that any beginner can slap together a hidey hole but also deep enough to allow for some really cool and crazy builds.Rust is great and I can only see it getting better.,Rust

2014-02-22,0,0,449,True,Recommended,First thing you need to realize before you get this game is that you are going to get killed and your house will be raided... a lot. Once you get that out of the way it is a really fun game to play with friends. If you're going solo it can seem to drag on because you spend 80% of your first hour of gameplay on a server crafting.Difficulty of gameplay is directly related witht eh amount of players on the server. If there is nobody on the server it's pretty much smooth sailing. however if you get 15 to 20 people it is almost impossible not to have your house destroyed within the first 24 hours.One thing that the game is lacking is the amount of items within the game. Even though the game is still in alpha it still feels like it is lacking objective. Now I understand that it is an open world type of thing and that you can do what you want. But that is just it there isnt a whole lot you really do. Other than make a house collect blueprints craft items and kill people there isnt anything else to do.Personal Rating 7/10The rating isnt higher because after the first week of playing this game you will have pretty much done everything there is to do in Rust. However with the game still being in alpha there is still many updates to come and hopefully one or more of those will be that there will be MUCH more to do.,Rust

2015-05-31,0,0,519,True,Recommended,You are about to read a short story of on my experiences in Rust. A note to consider this might never happen to you. However I'm hoping that such a 'review' will help you decide to buy this game because never will you experience anything like what you will in rust in any other game. There I was standing. Thinking that I must be the luckiest person on earth. A player with full clothing (you don't see that a lot in rust) and a bolt action rifle in hand. You must be thinking 'how on earth is that considered lucky?'. But did I forget to mention that he was AFK. So exited I ran towards him with my makeshift spear and was about to rip him to bits until I saw his name tag. It read 'BDB'. It took me a few seconds to remember the name 'Have I ever met you before'. Then I remembered.Two days earlier I had met two complete beginners at the game. They were running towards me rocks in hand shouting 'FRIENDLY' to assure the fact that they weren't going to attack me on sight. I shouted the same word back to them but took out my spear to take precaution. After a few seconds of dark silence I thought I should offer them food. I would always to that to the 'friendly' so that i could make more friends than enemies. As they thanked me and ate some food they explained how they were quite new to the game and were looking for some place to mine some rock. I told them that I was making a Noob (as us gamers call beginners) shelter up in the mountains and was willing to teach them the ropes. I also gave them the rock they needed. After that we started to improve the base together and make it a home for all of us. I was also quite a Noob at the time so they also taught me things I didn't know. We became a strong trio who had a nice fortified base until the day where i decided to sep out the front door of our house at the wrong time.I told my two friends (one of them was away) that I was going out to fortify the base with a few more barricades. However the moment I opened the front door to our base I was shot done. Raiders. The screen read 'You were killed by BDB'. They were listening to our conversations and looking for just the right time to raid us. I shouted at one of my friends to take cover inside the base while I was given the option to respawn at my sleeping bag also inside the base. It was hopeless. My friend with just a bow to fight off pesky raiders with full protective clothing. I had nothing to fight with and the raiders looted my previous body and gained access to the house using my key. My friend with the bow fought hard and dealt a good amount of damages but soon enough the bullets had finally ripped through his skin. They killed me once again with my friend and renamed our sleeping bags to prevent us from respawning. BDB... never have i had so much hatred for another player in a game. BDB. Never did i see my two friends ever again. All because of that raider. BDB.I got my spear in hand and started to pierce through the skin of the AFK raider. Such joy filled my heart like never before. Revenge had never felt so sweet. BDB was no longer. I started to loot through his dead body and steal all the valuables. I equiped my self in my dead foes armor and help his gun in my hands. Though that wasn't the end. I was running away from the murder scene when the message from a very angry player came onto the message section. BDB was looking for revenge and considering the fact that he was apart of the the servers currently biggest (and strongest) clan there was no doubt he was going to get it.I was running as fast as I could from the dead body of the raider when I saw another player dressed in full burlap armor ( the weakest in the game). It was the same guy who had killed me prior to myself finding AFK BDB. I thought that now that was equiped with things that were vastly better than his i should probably take my second revenge for the day. So I did using 'only' two bullets. He was laying on the floor pleading for me to revive him. I thought to myself that 'I am better than this' so i had just taken his weapons for precaution. As he got up he thanked me and had also invited me to his base. Or should I say bases. He had two one of which was raided so after inspecting that we went to his second base. Both bases were fairly large and fortified so I had thought that he must have been in affiliation with another strong clan especially considering the fact that he was Russian himself.We had finally arrived at his second base. I was at the front of his base admiring it when all of sudden a bullet came flying across my head. I shouted at the Russian to take cover at a giant rock opposite the front of the house. Bullets were flying everywhere meaning the were clearly well stocked. I tried to shoot back at them but we were pinned down. The Russian quickly ran into the house through the front door and got shoot in the back while trying to do so. Fortunately he made it in and he was shouting at me to also come so he could fortify it. I considered whether I should trust him or not but then I thought 'I have also attacked a fair share of naked's for no good reason in my time playing rust'. So i eventually complied and ran towards the door while luckily dodging two. bullets. We made our way to the top floor where there was a window to get a good view on our opponents and started to discuss what we should do. We tried to look through the window and shoot them though every time we attempted so bullets would start to fly from our opponents guns. I decided eventually that i should try talking to them. I asked them to put there guns down. It wasn't the reply that had devastated me but the player from whom I had received the reply from. Chistine. She was apart of the the biggest and strongest clan in the server. The same clan BDB was from. Half an hour had passed. Much discussion had taken place. We had no hope in just running outside the base and trying to shoot them. Our opponent was obviously more trained than us and her and her other partners had more firepower than my Russian friend and I. Also if we had really been a threat to them they would have called for back up. There base was no too far from ours so it would be no problem for them. If we wanted to leave this situation alive we had to play it smart. Christine had told us to come outside of the house naked with no weapons so that we could discuss further. Many other random players hearing this conversation warned me not to trust her. I had already figured that out by myself. Now I could continue my story and start to talk about my mastermind plan and a big battle but not much really happens. Nothing really goes in my favour. I end up randomly dying and my both Christine and my Russian friend both join forces with me out of the picture. The End. Sorry about the flat ending. Also sorry if this wasn't what you'd be expecting from a review. Though I thought that this story would have done much justice to this magnificent game than a general review. Though if your still looking for a more traditional review...Here a some points Remember it's in early access If you don't like losing everything you worked hard for in a split second don't buy it It's a wonderful game as long as you learn how to deal with other players Honestly this game wouldn't be as great as it is if it didn't have this PVP lose everything aspect Aaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnddd I hope you enjoyed my review,Rust

2016-12-12,0,0,180,True,Recommended,"I had no idea if I should recommend the game or not but I decided that I would because although there are some shortcomings in the game. It is a solid game that is still being worked on hard by the developers to make it better and there isn't much bad with it.I like the base building in the game is is fun to have little rooms and upgrade the strength of the building to try and withstand the impending doom that is some nerdy kid with c4 and an ak wanting your wood.The animals are quite derpy you will find a lot of them will run through rocks and external walls which is annoying especially when it kills you but the developers are working on that so that isn't that major.The survival aspect is nice I personally wish that there was a single player option so that people like me can go and play the survival aspect only although for that to happen there would need to be a lot more PvE danger and harder to find resources because you can get a base and guns etc in a days worth of playing provided you don't get killed a heap by other players. Now the reason I say this is because although yes many people view Rust as a game that is PvP and there is no other way to play it there are many different ways to play games and I feel that having the option there would be nice. I also think this because Rust has all of the components needed for a great base survival game so it could make a great PvE and PvP survival game given the chance.Now even though I said that I would like to see a singleplayer PvE survival Rust game. I also play PvP Rust....I mean well duh that is all that is there right now but what I mean by this is that IF there was a PvE version put in I would play both PvE and PvP because the PvP is fun I'm just not very good at it. I find that for me when I play Rust I build a base get resources and I play very defensively building in such a way my base can only be attacked from one direction and I defend that direction like all hell and I will run around collecting heaps of resources to the point where I have so many guns armour ammo metal wood high quality metal etc like just heaps of everything more than I know what to do with. Then I defend...and no I don't mean roof camp I don't just sit there all day waiting for some naked to run by I go and get more stuff I craft make improvements to the base help out nakeds that run by with gear etc. Oh yeah and I'm sure you have figured out by now I don't play on those 500 player servers because I would just get rekt and yeah that is what happened when I first played I play on lower population servers that have about 50 players at the highest peak. I'm not a very good shot I'm 3/4 deaf and fully blind (exaggeration) so I'm not good at combat in general anyway so yeah I'm more of a defender than attacker but I still have a blast crafting and building and occasionally I get to fight back the odd raid or two which is heart pumping.The graphics and sounds are amazing in this game and immersion is fantastic with the music that plays it can put you on edge that someone is near by wanting to kill you and yeah it's great.The ONLY thing that I have negative to say about the game that is major is the fact that you get salty people that will kill naked people be a about killing people etc. I mean I like to kill people in Rust as much as the next person but there is no need to kill someone with a rock.....nor is there to be an when you kill someone that does have stuff. I mean yes good job on your kill mate. Loot him and be done no need for all the ""you're terrible thanks for the stuff go die in real life"" etc. Like long story short just kill the damn person don't be a salty prick about it. Plus I think that it is stupid to shoot people on sight if they don't pose a threat for example they are foraging or they are simply running by leave the bloke alone. Now if the fella has a weapon out and is running in your direction in a legitimately threatening manner then by all means. But you should at least try and talk to them first I think unless it is truely obvious they have it out for you.Now this has been a very long review but long story short Rust is a very good game and I do recommend buying it. There are way more positives than negatives. You are going to die think nothing of it aside from it is just another wipe that happens fortnightly anyway just start again don't be salty. You are going to get the opportunity to kill nakeds don't be an give the fella some gear and send him on his way. You are going to get the chance to raid someone. Have fun and just do it don't be an or a about it. Most importantly have fun with the game no matter if you prefer building scavanging or fighting do what you love and enjoy it.",Rust
2016-07-02,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,All this game does is reward the ugliest parts of a human being.It's literally impossible to even play on most servers due to the fact that the game literally breeds a shoot first ask questions later mentality. You'll get shot for chopping wood. You'll get shot for hunting for food. You'll get shot if someone happens to find you asleep in the wilderness. You'll even have your whole base torn down and get shot just because you logged off for more than an hour.,Rust
2016-11-30,0,0,1421,True,Recommended,This is one of my favorite games and I cant say enough good things about it. I have been playing this game since experimental came out (I dont like legacy). I absolutely love survival games and this is my favorite. I also love building games and this one has the best building system ever. and i love open world and open sandbox games and this game just fits the bill for me in every way. another big thing with me is immersion and realism. and Rust well its so fkn PURTY I just love that. the realism is amazing. gets better everyday. I also love the plugins and that is the servers i play and host. The only complaints I have are its one of those games that to play it properly takes ALL your time and unless you have no life then it dont really work. so when i play its in spurts. i wont play for months and then when i do you wont see me for 3 days straight lol. But this isnt really the games fault. then yes there is the community which is mostly toxic but that is that way on EVERY game pretty much. gamers are toxic . period. which really sucks because players can truly make or break a game most the time (tho this ones still fun even then just not as much so) but its not the games fault. the only complaint i have about the game that i feel is the devs or games fault is that it can only be run properly on a crazy monster system. we are talking thousands of dollars. That part really sucks. BUT at the same time its the price you pay for such a beautiful realistic game as this. and that kind of realism is very important to me. and Id never change it. so rather than complain about it i just plan to upgrade to a better computer as soon as possible to keep up with rust. yes the game means that much to me. I have bought 5 copies of this game for family &amp if it comes out on console i plan to buy that too. Yes I am mildly obsessed. sue me.some better optimization and more things added to the map (which they are already working on) and this game will be perfect.If you love survival games realism and especially if you have a ton of extra time on your hands buy this game!,Rust

2017-04-24,1,1,54,True,Recommended,"So after a few hours of playing Rust I think I am beginning to get the hang of the game. To the layman/casual this game is basically an alpha version of a ""live action minecraft"" the ideas are similar you start with nothing not even clothes and just a rock to hit against other items. Through a long process of bashing trees and certain boulders you get yourself a basic hatchet and pick and start mining away at resources. Then you pick some flowers and corn and make yourself a scrummy meal of ... corn .. and make yourself some killer burlap heels and a matching fancy hat. Then you make a lovely 1x1 room to hide in and set a campfire inside to increase your comfort.Then someone with an AK47 plate armour and a mental psychosis comes along and murders you for your burlap bandages and T bags your head.And you start again. And again.And again.Or if you're like me you get away with all the mining climb into the guys poorly guarded base when he and his friends are sleeping steal some of their C4 and make a whole in the ground half the size of denmark.Rust will one day be amazing just not yet. More work needed.",Rust

Great game for chilling or even to do some action you can play it with friends or even solo.

2013-12-17,0,0,249,True,Recommended,This game is probably one of the most addicting games I have ever played. Sure it has it's share of and Bandits just like in DayZ but the adrenaline you get when you bash some ones skull in is more amazing then farting when you have a stomach ache. The most amazing thing about this game is when you die you can just get right back up and start over again It's not like you have to travel 30 minutes to get a hatchet a noob actually has a chance in this game unlike DayZ and.... ugh WarZ. The amount of options and things to craft is unbeatable Even Epoch cant touch this. For being in an Alpha state right now I have to say it is probably one of the best games i own.,Rust
2016-06-24,0,0,1345,True,Recommended,The game is really good but it is hard to play not for anyone that is use to easy and forgiving game play I'm taking about open world survival.you will have to work really hard to keep your things raiders and people looking to bother you while playing but if you try find other players and work together you can be the biggest baddest wolf in town or lone wolf it make a few bases around and counter raid people on the move you don't really have the option to raid large bases by yourself like real life while lone wolf you will need to play smart set up in hidden area in rocks and water ways this style is very very hard but its a game with no end and you will have your moments your up.. but nothing gets your heart pumping when you are hidden away and a crew of 5 players are trying to get into your base and take all your things you worked hard to get it make you think and improve your defences for next time you get door knockers a lot of bad reviews on this saying the something bad community! lol yea well i love it its what make the game fun gets you all fired up and plotting your next move on them don't take any of it to heart its a game it is hard it will frustrate you but thats what makes it work in the most beautiful way you will never find anything like it on steam!one bad point controller support none come on devs please fix this it will make the game so much better! well to me anyway.,Rust
2016-04-25,0,0,100,True,Recommended,I got this game from the first days it got to steam in early access. I don't know why I thought I should review it now and here's my thoughts To be clear most of time I spent on this game was on legacy version of it and since it evolved now and got better graphics and of course way better gameplay mechanics it's better than ever despite its early access and its been more than 2 years and it's still in this condition. Early access is awful and even you don't like early access games you should make Rust an exception because no matter what you will have fun and enjoyable fun with this game especially if you play with your friends and that's guaranteed. There is a lot to do and discover especially with the new map which will be random unlike the old rust. The map now is huge and adventurous to discover Gameplay mechanics are also good and can be improved crafting system was awesome in the old Rust and it just got better.Its the one of the few good early access available.,Rust

2016-11-15,0,0,194,True,Recommended,Rust Well where do i start....This game is amazing the reason why people play survival games like this are not only for the graphics but for a game play this game is amazing. Yes there have been alot of set backs with the whole blueprint system and then the XP system. But this game is not ment for people who sit down and game for an hour and with all games that require time to play this game needs its own time to grow and become what every community members wants it to be a good game!Take it like this would you rather have a game where the devlopers dont listen to the community or a game that will have its ups and its downs but the devolpers listen to the community and actually want to make this into a great game. Well if not then this game isnt for you and nor are alot of games in Early access.Rust will all ways have its ups and downs but no body likes change and thats a fact but some times change can be good and Rust needs changes some of them wont be good and some of them wont be bad. But does that mean we must dislike it No! Rust will one day reach a point were it wont be able to change anymore and then we wil be sad that the game wont be able to change... So community members must put there vocies out there otherwise onced released all the people who dont like change will say that this must not be done because now its out of early access. If you read all this then thank you!,Rust
2016-11-23,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Rust is a hardcore open world survival game where you begin with sticks and wooden huts and then advance to guns and less dirty homes (metal and stone so much cleaner!). It's also a great game to mess about in there are so many fun things you can do there are also many mods and community items for this game. The game itself has a great atmosphere and is very realistic however the only problem with this game is that it's been three years and it's still in alpha. I know some of the glitches are funny and game changing updates are amazing but it's also frustrating to know that the game still hasn't been finished. Things keep changing in the game E.g. Items require a certain amount of xp to craft zombies are removed etc. Well ignore this. Just play the game form an alliance and conquer the world. ),Rust

2014-04-11,0,0,51,True,Recommended,Great game... the devs have a tiny bit to work on but its the best post apocolyptic game i've ever played since DayZ... the goal is to survive. the game has no objectives or hints. you start on your own and build your way upward to become a raider or bandit maybe even both. lots of things to craft and build. other players WILL try to kill you along the way (because they're annoying). my facourite part of the game is probably working together with friends to raid bases... good luck survivors...,Rust

2015-08-28,0,0,73,True,Recommended,In some servers there are hackers which may be difficult for players who want to build something.Its nice to play and really survival.Another point what mades me angry is when you have build a base and made a begin some servers are being swiped after an update.,Rust
2015-01-27,0,0,540,True,Recommended,"UPDATE AUGUST 2015 At this point in the game I STRONGLY advise you to NOT play on an official server but rather on a community server with active admins. This is because on an official server hackers are greater in number and make the gameplay significantly less enjoyable. I was just playing and spent 2 hours gathering resources enough to build a 2x2 stone base and a hacker killed me. Don't play on official servers.I have a very simple review. I don't care about where the game is headed or how greedy and careless the developers are (which they aren't). This is a review on the current state of the game as of January 27 2015. And I should mention that this game has been getting a lot of hate recently. Keep in mind that it's only because people who were so caught up with the alpha version are whining because the developers made it newer and not the same as what it used to be as is what happens to most games.Pro Both Rust Legacy and the newer current version are both fun with lots of things to do. Obviously this is just a survival game with no end in mind but it still occupies your time with hours of work and exploration and running from a**holes who want to kill you for the fun of it.Still a fun game though and even better if you grab 2+ friends on skype and play together.Con My only complaint is how awful the community is. When I say the community is awful I mean about 80% because there are in fact nice people you can meet. Most of these people are the kind who will kill you because they simply saw you about or will shout ""NI**ER F*GGOT C*NT B*TCH"" at you for doing something on accident or saying something not the least bit offensive.The fact is that in this game people WILL kill you that's basically what the game was designed for. That I don't mind because it's a challenge. It's simply the people who abuse the ability to kill everyone and are boastful and rude about it that aggravate me.This is not a pro nor con but keep this in mind when you are looking for a server to join If you want to have tons of fun but have the constant risk of dying over and over again join a server full of people. If you would rather take it easy with absolutely no risk of death or having to deal with incredibly annoying players yet at an increased risk of getting bored join an empty server or a server with very little people.",Rust
2016-12-02,0,0,801,True,Recommended,Great game real survival with interesting crafting system. 8/10Bear in mind that it is still alpha so there is room for improvement.,Rust
2016-12-02,0,0,2065,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I love the game and facepunch,Rust
2016-12-03,0,0,676,True,Recommended,only been playing it for a few weeks and i did over 250+ time spent on this game very good for an alpha though can still be improved with its optimisation and glitches,Rust
