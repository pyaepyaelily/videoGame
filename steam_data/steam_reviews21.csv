2015-10-04,0,0,834,False,Not Recommended,I'm reviewing online because that's the only thing that the devs seem to give any about and work on.All of the DLC released that has been made in the past year ing sucks. Its all just copy and paste of the last where you have to buy some stupid expensive warehouse buy some stupid expensive cars or planes and then make pennies shipping cargo. It is very noticable how lazy the devs have been when it comes to making content. They seem to care more about their bank accounts right now than making a product worth buying.There is a very odd cycle going on in the game right now aswell. Where the devs think they can make more money buy making their cars cost 1.5 million each. But in turn people see that the price is ing dumb and cheat to get money. So rockstar will make everything cost more. So people cheat more. This has left everything costing a ridiculous amount and now the only way to get new car and stuff like that is to cheat or to buy the money. If you wanted to go with route 2 then good luck because its going to cost around $6 000 dollars to buy everything.Another scummy thing that these bastards did was remove all of the new stuff from single player. So you HAVE to go to online and give them your money just to ride a flying car.If you are going to play this game for the single player then go ahead cause it was pretty good. But for online NOPE. Just a bunch of money trying to pry their way into your wallet,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-14,0,0,200,False,Not Recommended,I honestly love this game. It's a great game. People complaining about everything being too expensive are just whiners. It's how gta makes money with free dlc get over it. You just have to grind to get the money. The one thing I ing hate about this game are the players. I am coming from console and I haven't gotten the chance to play the heists but oh my ing God is it a miserable experience trying to get a heist going. It takes a long time to find players and they are impatient s so they leave without letting others join. If they don't leave you will get complete who don't know how to do heists or are there just to ing troll you. Also with the new doomsday heist how you have to do preps in free mode who the thought of that?! My friend and I make it to an area only to get ing bombed by an orbital strike which by the way costs half a million dollars. So just us trying to mind our business to do a heist gets bombed by a kid who uses his daddy's credit card. I love the game but I hate the players. They are more toxic then Call of Duty kids.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-20,0,0,288,False,Recommended,This game is just great that is if you have creativity which not everyone does. If you have a mind that can come up with things to do and don't mind a bit of grinding to get exactly what you want then this game is amazing. I would definently recommend it since it has so much replay value and pogression that can make the game last basically forever. My only worries about the game is that with the most recent update (Doomsday Heist) my frames dropped by about 30 40 and hasn't been fixed yet (happened with my friends too) and the fact that the game is becoming more grindy with what seems like every update. The fact that it takes around $5 million to buy 2 planes in dlc and $100 shark cards only give you 8 million which isn't enough for that price anymore. So even if you buy the shark card it won't last long with the increasing coast of the dlcs. But overall this game is great for the price and if on sale I would definently recommed the game since if you have friends the experience can the best longest lasting fun in a while.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,1189,False,Not Recommended,Enjoying this game has gotten more and more difficult over time. EVERYTHING has gotten expensive these days but the legitimate ways to pay for them have not changed.If you want to host one of the new Weaponized Vehicle missions (which is the only way to get discounts on the new vehicles) you have to pay a MINIMUM of $GTA 2 290 000. For the cheapest bunker and the cheapest Mobile Ops truck with absolutely no options. But unless you've dropped fifty real world dollars on a Shark Card there's no quick and legitimate way to get that money. Your best chance would be to host the Pacific Standard heist eight or nine times a tough and time consuming affair on its own.Once you've managed to scrape enough cash together to afford the bunker and the truck you will likely be unhappy to find out that all the fun toys they show off in this update weapon mods vehicle upgrades etc. are all hidden behind more paywalls. You can either wait for each item to be 'researched' or you can pay to have the research 'fast tracked' for a hefty fee. It takes about 8.5 hours per unlock time. Keep in mind that most of the items are things like weapon liveries and vehicle paint jobs. And you don't get to choose which items get researched when. Total . Paying for all the upgrades and focusing all bunker staff exclusively on research... it will still take about 6 hours per item.If you don't want to wait that long fast tracking research costs $GTA 225 000 per item. To pay to unlock every single item will cost you $GTA 10 350 000 for everything. That's over $150 USD's worth of Shark Cards. Or you can wait for about 380 hours for everything to be researched.Personally I'd rather just wait for a generous modder to drop some cash on me. That way I won't have to wait 17 straight days for unlocks (not counting things like sleeping or going to work) or literally spend my whole paycheck on Shark Cards.,Grand Theft Auto V

Play ONLY with friends (To many cheaters exe on public servers) However this means I can t do alot of the main grind elements to get money.

2017-06-18,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is honestly pretty bland. Funish open world but otherwise it's run of the mill. Looks beautiful though. What made this game great was mods and as I'm sure you're aware Take 2 and rockstar recently started getting mods removed and being well just a company. Then again this isn't surprising. They lie about the game being on sale to trick people into buying shark cards and all kinds of shady stuff over the last few years. They'll probably start selling mods too. I'll let you all in on a secret. Red Dead Redemption 2 was pretty ing boring. It's very bland riding a horse around desert for hours and is ultimately praised because we don't get much western cowboy type stuff. Don't feel bad boycotting the next red dead if it releases on PC. We actually don't need this company producing games and if GTA style games are really as good as people say someone else will come in and take over while avoiding the t that caused R*/T2 to get on.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-25,0,0,140,False,Recommended,"I loved this game when I bought a PS3 copy of it along with a new television in october of 2013. I finally finished a new gaming rig in March and figured ""Hey I could download and replay GTA on my new computer."" So I finally got it and just wow. The graphics frame rate and even some of the playability were greatly improved. I have to admit I will be buying a controller for it soon seeing as I hate using the numpad to control flying vehicles but other than that it is great now that I have it set up properly. The only issue I had when I installed my game was a direct 3D graphics initialization error that would cause my game to crash every 5 35 minutes and I would get massive frame drops and wondered why my PC was doing so poorly on what were mostly mid to high settings. It turns out at least for me you need no less than 12 gigs of RAM to run this game without any hiccups. I have read in some forums that people are getting away with as little as 6 gigs and it runs fine but I had to double my setup to 16 so as to guarantee no frame drop problems. My system uses a little over 2 gigs at full idle with my utilities running and if I subtract that number from the max RAM usage of 11.3 gigs I saw after a few hours of straight gameplay I get within 100 megs of 9.1 or 9.2 gigs of RAM utilized just by GTA. The ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT issue I was having was fixed after I turned down some settings and I figured after a lot of troubleshooting that it was my older graphics cards I'm using that don't support some of the technologies in this newer title (most likely some forms of AA or similar settings) so if you have a GPU from the Nvidia 700 series or newer you should not have any issues as long as you have an adequate amount of Vram for the resolution at which you wish to play. I use two GTX 650 Ti BOOST cards in SLI with 2GB of ram each and at mostly high settings they were only using about 1641 megs of Vram at 1080P. At any higher resolutions I would recommend at least 3GB of Vram and something as powerful or more powerful than a GTX 970. Good luck and have fun being mischevious.",Grand Theft Auto V

Some users have also reported micro stuttering during normal gameplay but I don't have this issue personally.This is honestly one of the best games out there at the moment and I can honestly recommend it to pretty much anyone and everyone assuming you haven't bought it yet though the Online portion of the game is somewhat plagued with script kiddies and pretty grindy but fun with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

That being said I paid full price for this game and I would pay full price for the next Grand Theft Auto to come out on PC and I would encourage everyone else to do so because Rockstar have gone all out in making this game and the level of value that they are giving the gaming community and their level of dedication is rare and should be supported and encouraged by us.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-19,0,0,273,False,Not Recommended,The game has been out for two years there's not much for me to add in detail.That said I'm constantly floored by how much detail they packed in. I'm a sucker for a good open worlder R* continues to be the diamond standard.I really wish there were a lot more missions though. R* built this huge open world but I've got a feeling we'll only see limited additions if any. This is because the emphasis seems to be on multiplayer. That's not my thing so I'm worrying my favorite franchise may be dead. Anon Multiplayer is a hugely expensive feature to add because of the amount of investment into network optimization and anti cheat you have to put in. Here's the short of it I'd gladly pay 30bucks for an equal (or better) expansion pack that did nothing but place a new (or sequel) story line in exactly the same world. No new features just a lot of new missions and story.Or a good heists engine for single player. That would work too.,Grand Theft Auto V

However in playing the game I have found it to be interesting to say the least. I have only been on for a few hours and have worked my way around the game a bit learning here and there. In the short time of playing it I really like it. I have dipped my toe into the ONLINE side of this game and it feels a bit odd however not as bad as everyone was making it out to be. I don t know it could be the hour that I am on or what. Who knows? From this experience so far I am happy with it. Things I m not pleased about Buying the Shark card from STEAM is T!

Like come on its been 5 years since this game has been released and there's still modders walking around and instead of them being banned they just get to be youtubers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-19,0,0,826,False,Recommended,"Everyone seem to be very negative about this game but you must give the game a chance.Pros The game looks gorgeous even on medium settings. The singleplayer itself has a good storyline and you will hardly get bored running around the city and doing shenanigans The Online is good when you make a private session and play with friends. There is a lot to do in Online and you can have a lot of fun with your friends running around the city. If you play GTA V for first time you will be very excited exploring the city. (It took me like 3 months to start getting known of the city even now I still sometimes use the GPS in case I want to go to some places)Cons In almost every Online session there is a cheater or group of cheaters and ruin other people's fun. Most acitvities in Online are dead. Every session in Online I see kids asking the cheaters for ""Free"" money.Conclusion The game itself is good but these days Rockstar charge too much for the game. Thank god I preordered the game for like 50 EU. The Online is good if you avoid the cheaters. If the cheaters put a mark on you simply change the sessions. You can also make a private session and invite friends to play so you can have fun or do some activities. If you don't have friends that is your problem. xD (The problems in Online are the reason why the game has such a negative aspect so I hope Rockstar sit on their and do something.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-11-30,0,0,195,False,Recommended,Honestly brilliant game! 170+ hours Story Mode + Great story+ Brilliant main characters + Multiple choice endings+ Brilliant graphics+ Story is 30+ hours or so It's quite a beefy game I couldn't even play without lag and it crashing when I first got it+ If you suck at particular mission the game eventually gives you the option to skip it Online + If you have friends to play with it's pretty fun plenty of jobs to do and places to go on the map+ Character customization It can get boring quite quick especially if you overplay it Cheaters and modders who ruin the experience for everyone else (stealing/giving money bombing killing teleporting everyone) Modders can get you banned Rockstar support is not that great As soon as you spawn in you will have a target on your back and probably be murdered within 30 seconds Money is a hard thing to get a lot of unless you buy it with real money Cars/planes/helicopters etc are very expensive,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-30,0,0,133,False,Recommended,"Reviewing the whole game not just the cluster**** that is online hence the recommendation The game itself is by far one of the best games ever released the open world is constantly in motion and everything from the graphics to the dialogue is perfect (or near perfect)Now to the Online experience it's not THAT bad like most people's reviews indicate yet having spent 100 hours grinding cash I've had enough. Every time you log in you will spend the first 20 minutes hopping through servers until at last you find one that has less than 5 players. Why? Because you have a much greater chance of actually being able to finish a mission (VIP work bunker stuff etc.). Eventually though the server will fill up with people and then comes the inevitable kiddy on his f****** flying motorbike firing rockets at you ending your mission immediately you get nothing. Time to start the mission over again better luck next time.There's nothing wrong with allowing this kind of action in a game (direct PVP) however the way it's been implemented encourages (and REWARDS) the griefing of other players. The only legitimate way around this problem making money in game is to cough up your own hard earned cash to pay Rockstar for ""Shark Cards"" which are pretty pathetic in terms of bang for buck. 50 for 8 mil? Are Rockstar so strapped for cash that we need to get Bob Geldof in for a Live Aid concert to raise funds for this evidently struggling game corporation? Bono can keep his traditional line in the charity single we release.Buy this game for the single player campaign and by all means play online if it's your thing just expect a lot of griefing.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-27,0,0,428,False,Not Recommended,Take 2 Interactive has firmly shot themselves in the foot with PR and a lack of connection with the community. Rockstar is not to blame for the downward spiral of this game Take 2 Interactive is. With updates that continously gear GTA towards promoting in game microstransactions (Which is hilariously enough made fun of in the game by lester on a set up mission for a heist!!!!). This is exemplified by take 2's press release entailing how they could pretty easily squeeze more money from their player base cut more wood so to speak. Well this forest is gone and you dumb ***es are solely repsonsible for it. Killing the modding community by using a cease and desist on OpenIV and making the entire gaming community feel like nothing more than dollar signs to you is a good way to destroy your crown jewel's popularity. I love rockstar and I am truly sad that their parent company is managed by a bunch of village idiots. Take 2 needs to perform so serious damage control if they want to escape this unscathed and if they want their Red Dead Redemption 2 launch to go smoothly.,Grand Theft Auto V

But now it's just all microtransaction's vehicle is expensive even if you buy the Gunrunning Doomsday Etc. vehicle you still have to pay for the bunker facility Etc. and the extra money for the MOC Avenger its a waste of money.Additionally hacker's is almost everywhere. I got banned once because of a hacker but when my account is back it just reset all of my character and it's stats plus i have to grind everything from the beggining again. The good part is they refunded every money that i have D. I give a 8/10 for story modeand 7/10 for gta online,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-09,0,0,872,False,Recommended,I love this game. The city landscape and pretty much everything the player sees perfectly rendered.The gameplay is really great not much to complain about other then the infrequent glitches that become annoying.Vehicles and weaponry are fun to use and I really enjoyed the ability to switch between 3 different characters within the game. Each is totally unique and nothing like the rest especially in consideration of their individual stats and ability.If you enjoyed previous GTA titles like Liberty City stories or Vice City then you'll love this GTA of the future. While I can not comment on the Online portion I used it sparily and when I did I'd get sniped as soon as I spawned in game. I prefer the Story Mode espceially now with 3rd party mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-29,0,0,544,False,Not Recommended,I wish I could rate the single player and multiplayer seperately because the single player is amazing a definitive gta experience. The multiplayer however seems to be designed to fill rockstars pockets with money via microtransactions unless you want to grind for months to get a single vehicle that some in the same lobby paid 20 bucks for and most of the multiplayer ways to make money have to be done in an open lobby so if you're just trying to make money you have to deal with all the who just paid real money for their jets and flying cars with rocketlaunchers to try and get anything. It's an absolute how. In recap single player good. Multiplayer how. I didn't even get into the fatal flaws with the main attraction of multiplayer which is heists if you dont have 4 friends that play regularly anytime you try to do one of these with even a single random player if that player disconnects or loses connection every person in that game is kicked out of that heist back to the multiplayer lobby where you have to drive all the way back to your apartment to try and start the heist again.

The worst feeling is off the wrong person and then having him crash your game. It can really ruin things and from a company like rockstar this shoud not be accptable.,Grand Theft Auto V

So thats it. bought the game for 3 consoles. played since it was released just to have my character and all progress deleted with no explaination.

It's great.Story is told through multiple main characters this time which makes them more shallow than we're used to. That said it's still a great story. Characters remain very interesting. All GTA games are standalone story wise so don't worry about catching up.Multiplayer was a disaster at launch but now it's the mainstay for most players. New content is really fun.

From perma banning users for being forced by hackers to recieve money (bans regardless of how long are non appealable and if you send them a ban appeal WHICH IS LITERALLY A SECTION ON THEIR SUPPORT PAGE you get an automated response essentially telling you to go yourself.) Along with the CEO of take two recently stating that there aren't enough microtransactions in their games despite the fact that they are currently charging $100 for enough in game money to purchase only a couple of the higher end vehicles which means that a couple vehicles are worth more than the entire game itself. But the final straw is sending a cease and dessist to OpenIV essentially destroying the entire singleplayer modding scene.Rockstar and Take Two are the very definitions of how to be horrible developers and a horrible company in general.

To be fair the same thing happened with 4 but I loved the MP in that (firetruck races!) and I thought I would like 5's too but it's all about GTA Online. You can't hop in and screw around with friends without dealing with disgusting pubbies. Events are a PITA to set up and the whole thing smells like free to play nickle and diming. It seems to be their main money maker now too so it's never going away.At least mods were cool.. but those are no longer allowed thanks to Take2.

2016-08-03,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,"Same old GTA. It seems to be less buggy than previous versions and the graphics look great. Unfortunately it's just boring. There is nothing new in the game and somehow the world seems small and closed in. It just desn't feel like the San Andreas I knew from before (maybe because it used to be really sparse?). It probably should have been a whole new setting since I felt kind of the same with GTA 4. The main characters all have some special ability but I don't use them. They are not necessary and just seem like a last minute half baked idea. You can interchange between 3 different characters but all that does is make the map more convoluted. For some reason you CANNOT DISABLE 3RD PERSON CAMERA AUTO CENTER. I cannot tell you how horrible this is for me. This was an option on all the other games why not this one. Screw you especially hard for that R*.Whenever I start the game I just can't bring myself to drive through Franklin's mansion neighborhood. It just seems like more work than the game is worth. I guess I ""grew up"" or I'm just sick of the same old game being rehashed over and over....",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-03,0,0,16,False,Recommended,Anything that can be said about how amazing this game is has already been said in much better detail by others then me but I just want to throw my two cents in.This game is a masterpiece. Every Grand Theft Auto game has redefined the definition of satire violence and open world gaming. The city is vibrant and alive and feels like it is based in reality by using over the top characters brands and companies that are all parodies of counterparts in the real life. The driving a key component is smooth and simple and fast something very few other games have been able to accomplish. The missions and story and seemingly amazing and it almost feels like I am playing through a hit TV series.The online is your virtual playground where the missions are just as good as the single player. The only problem with it is the people themselves but other then banning hackers (something Rockstar has lacked the availability to do) there isn't much any game this one or any other massive multiplayer game can do about it. However to me this isn't much of a big deal as I have ran into two different types of hackers. Ones that spawn a tank and around in it for twenty minutes and the other who drops bags of money on your head giving you between 2 20 million dollars. Overall not much to complain about here.In the end this game is a masterpiece that will go down in history as one of the best games created joining the ranks that only a few hundred games have achieved in the twenty+ years of gaming.,Grand Theft Auto V

Shooting cops buying a supercar investing in the stockmarket exploring the massive city driving on the freeway racing and betting taking a hike buying houses and flying jets this game has it all. Amazing graphics and even if you dont have a gaming rig it still runs fine. Super long story that is fun all the way through and even has hundreds of other things to do after the storymode with sports and side quests. I have played this game for 440 hours yet there is still things I have not done. The only thing I was not too sure on was that the driving is not how it would be in the real world. I have played it since it came out on the xbox 360 and I am still playing this game. One of the best games I have ever played.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,544,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V... now this is a game. I'd like to preface this that I played the majority of GTA V on PS4 and only got it for PC to enjoy mods. Do not take my hour count at face value I have well over 1500 hours in Los Santos. TL DR Singleplayer is where it's at don't bother with Online. The Singleplayer for Grand Theft Auto V is fun a touch on the lengthy side but you'd enjoy the 10 ish hour story. There are plenty of intense moments throughout though some of them can be quite annoying. The story itself is pretty bland I'll be honest you're not playing this game's story for the story at all. You're going to get a lot more kicks out of the free roam and doing your own stunts playing with the environment and discovering everything within.Onto Online... and this is the part of the review which comes so close to ruining the game as a whole... but at least it's mostly independent. GTA Online is... a massive P2W skinner box. It's a constant grind to get to the best cars weapons and assets. And it's only gotten worse with age. Back when I first played the most a P2W player could have is the Tank and even then you had to have put some hours in first. Now... there are VTOL aircraft motorcycles that fly around spewing rockets everywhere APCs that absolutely crush everything apart from the Hydra which is in turn crushed by the Oppressor. And they're all insanely unfun to play against. And might I add all the new cars all the new stuff? Insanely expensive $40 to buy a pretty bad supercar released now not even factoring in upgrades.If there's one thing you take away from this it's to just enjoy GTA V SP and not set foot into Online. If you want to play with the stuff locked behind there Trainers are a thing. Outside of that mini vent the map is great full of little nuances references and fun places to explore. Driving while not very realistic is very fun and enjoyable a welcome change from GTA IV's land boats. Overall 9/10 Graphics7/10 Story10/10 Gameplay2/10 Multiplayer8/10 Soundtrack10/10 Replayability/Return factor9/10 Value (SP)0/10 Value (MP)Overall 8/10 Would recommend,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-22,0,0,123,False,Recommended,Rockstar support is very helpful when you are troubled. +rep lulThe fact that Grand Theft Auto V (GTA5) and GTA Online feel like 2 different games to me and they come in one pack seems very critical. I find the main story to be casual rockstar script writing it does the exaggerate the feeling that it is unique in the sense of how things play out in terms of story route. If you get the game you probably should get it for the sake of GTA online solely. It feels uncomfortably worthwhile to say so that just GTA online is worth $60 USD its quite steep but to say the least the features and entertainment you get for just GTA online is of a significant amount. This has the environment where this could be a game requiring a lot of grinding. You could end up procrastinating a lot over this game. Load times are crazy. I mean sure keep items and feature prices steep no problem don't take it to the point where we need to become a pay to win player or have to pick up some unethical measures. Ping difference in combat results in troll results it's frustrating to be on the short end of the stick in that situation.To conclude get it for GTA Online or not at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you want to buy all the stuff in the gta online it would cost you thousands of dollars. I find Gta online updates boring as all they do is add more vehicles to bait people into buying sharkcards. I think a single player dlc or a map expansion would be amazing.(Ty for shutting down the librety city mod the open iv guys were working on D i kinda looked forward to that).

2017-07-10,0,0,665,False,Recommended,Personally I ve enjoyed GTA V for several years at this point. I ve played it since release and still believe it is a very well made game and has aged well. The story is interesting enough to keep you hooked and the online mode is something you can play for hours on end without getting bored. The only cons I have with this game though is the copious amount of modders that never seem to go away and the insane prices for some of the latest DLCs. Rockstar needs to get a bit less greedy and focus more on being more friendly and kind hearted in their fluctuating prices of the online economy. Other than those complaints this game is definitely worth the price on sale or not.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"Note I know what Steam says my playtime is. That's because I tried installing and playing this once through family sharing didn't work. I likely have hundreds of hours of gametime in reality though because I've played through the storyline entirely at least twice and played countless hours of GTA Online just grinding to try and get new stuff. Warning Long tirade ahead TL DR I personally went through hell and back just to play this fetid pile of dog vomit I'm sure many others did as well if they bought the physical copy of the game and when an update came along that finally brought my interest back in it somewhat TakeTwo go and pull a cease and desist on OpenIV which is one of the things that keeps this grindstone abomination alive and fun. TakeTwo should take turns choking themselves to death on a gorilla's chode. Wait a week or two and I guarantee modders will come back dropping more money than every only play then to give them a huge middle finger if you play at all anymore.I remember back in 2015 I picked up my pre ordered physical copy of GTA 5 for PC because I had played it on PS3 years ago and loved every second of it and I saw all the new features that were going to be added to the next gen/PC version of the game and thought it'd be great. I came home with excitement in my heart because I thought I was gonna get a great experience just like playing the game for the first time all over again only for the following experience with it to be a year long nightmare just trying to get the thing installed. The initial installation went smoothly and I didn't mind it but after that was all done I thought I was going to play but instead was greeted with a required day one patch. The game hadn't even been out for a few hours yet and there was already a day one patch for christ's sake. 5 gigs too so even more waiting to play my game. I thought nothing particularly ill of it at first but then soon realized that the installer was starting off normal speed and then slowly trodding down until it hit zero kb/s when normally I had (at the time) gotten around 1 to 2 Mb/s.I then spent the entire rest of the day trying to get this piece of crap installed all the way I looked up if anyone else had this problem and everyone else who bought the physical copy did (quality servers R*) so I looked up if anyone found a fix for it and tried every last one that came up and none of it did. Through sheer willpower I managed to basically force it into installing and then I fired it up with my hopes still somehow being in tact for a great experience.It crashed. Alright that might just be the settings my computer was really freaking old at the time so I figured I could probably run it with everything set on lowest and that'd be fine by me. Set everything to the lowest possible settings crashed again but this time after giving me the false hope it wouldn't because it took quite a while longer to crash.I immediately gave up on it uninstalled it and didn't give a crap about it for the entire rest of the year. Then my PC was upgraded to a current (in early 2016 that is) and pretty good mid range rig. So I then went through installation of GTA 5 again to see if it worked and it actually did. I was able to play with decent settings at a stable 60 FPS and so I beat the storyline fully again and went through with porting my Online character and all that stuff.But there was one problem it wasn't fun anymore. Online was a chore now because by the time I was able to play it again from the last time I played it so many updates had come out that increasingly made it take more of a grind. I hadn't been able to play it for around 3 years at this point so you can probably figure what the updates exactly were that did that. Singleplayer was alright but the storyline isn't nearly as interesting and fun to play through the second time as it is the first time.So I uninstalled it again bored with it and somewhat disappointed that GTA Online turned into a grindfest filled with cheaters and toxic scumbags when before you could at the very least drive down the street safely for a while.Then comes the Gunrunning update something that actually gets me excited. I install it well before Gunrunning releases and start playing the Online portion to try and get money and of course modders are there as always. They drop money on me and I don't give a crap I take it and buy a bunch of crap because I can't be bothered to grind for it anyways. Gunrunning drops and I immediately by the bunker but before I can buy the Mobile Command Center my money all disappears. My own fault really I should have anticipated that and bought a bunch of sell off cars so I could keep it after the inevitable cash wipe. So now I get stuck with a bunker a CEO office and some warehouses to make my money. All slow boring chores of processes that really aren't that much better than grinding the original missions themselves like all those years ago.And then they decide to attack OpenIV for no god dang reason like a bunch of bumbling that hate freedom and jerk off to the scent of money. Suck my balls TakeTwo modders are the only thing keeping this game from being a soulless abomination of grind. And you overpriced your Shart cards 8 million for almost 200 real life dollars are you high on meth? The PRE REQUISITE items that you NEED to even begin using ANY of the freaking new content in the gunrunner DLC totals up to almost 8 million. You think this one update is worth almost 200 dollars on it's own are you a bunch ants with cordyceps eating your brains?For the same price as that worthless Shart card I could buy a bunch of games during the Steam summer sale you ain't getting anything from anyone with a brain anymore. Hell you'll have hard luck getting moron microtransaction ""whale"" customers to fall for your schemes. What an awful game this ended up becoming.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-26,0,0,1170,False,Not Recommended,Great game. Never really played single player so I don't care about the single player OpenIV modding tool but its back now anyway so stop complaining.I have played over 680 hours online at this point in time. It has had its ups and downs. Moments when I wanted to murder my own freinds and family because of the rage it was causing (difficult tracks made in track editor which I thouroughly enjoyed). Theres a sense of accomplishment when you finally complete a difficult track. Sniping has been fun. Running my own business has been great. Owning a motorcycle club has been a blast.There is one reason above all else that makes me not recommend this game. Even after all the time spent on it and the fun times I've had.Modders/Hackers/Scripters!!!What ever you want to call your self you have ruined this game for everyone else!There have been times I have found it entertaining to suddenly become a toilet and have an arcade machine spawn on top of me. but mostly these guys just spawn in money ruining the in game economy spawn kill others glitch you out of your vehicle when you are winning an event or turn on god mode so you cant hit them. Insta kill is annoying. So is aim bot.The worst part of it all is that even after all this time Rockstar hasnt done a hpthing about it unless it stops them getting a Shark card sale.I finally thought they were trying to do something about it by closing OpenIV (even though it supposedly cant be used online) but no! modding online is still rampant and Rockstar dont't do anything to stop it. For now this game is dead to me. Sort your Sh*t Rockstar,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-06,0,0,405,False,Not Recommended,Don't waste your money!! I've spent a very long time playing this game on several different platforms. At least 2 500 hours on playstation and hundreds of hours on PC. All that needs to be said about this is don't expect to have fun on GTA Online. Primary reason is the fact everything way overpriced and other players have fun making your game not fun. I couldn't think of a more annoying thing that someone just driving around in an armored truck throwings bombs out the window at people who spend HOURS grinding for the little money rockstar is willing to let you have. I've played on the side of working for the money and i've paid for it working for the money is so much more satisfying than just killing people...maybe that's just me. You're better off just playing an amazing fallout game or just something else. Save yourself but at this time it's probably too late.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-18,0,0,73,False,Recommended,GTA V Single Player Review (spoiler free)I just finished the story of GTA V. I bought the game for 30 when it was on sale because I wanted to play a game with a great story with my XBOX controller. Basically this is what I got.GTA V is a great GTA but it didn't dig me as I was expecting it. I was hoping for a successor to GTA San Andreas and had really high expectations. I missed the feeling to start from the button and work my way up to become rich and so on. In GTA V the success comes too fast. In my opinion you get the nice house car etc. too early. I also didn't identify with the characters as much as in previous GTA titles. The radio stations are good but they also didn't convince me as a legit successor to previous titles. Also you can't eat in restaurants you can't buy street food you can't train your body. It makes no sense for me to buy cars. It makes no sense to me to train the pet of one of the characters. So all in all it has all the core elements of a good GTA but it is not the big thing I was hoping for.It is a good game. I am recommending it. It is fun to play. The story is okay. The dialogues are great. The gameplay is super. The graphics are awesome.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-13,0,0,89,False,Recommended,I bought this game for the story line and enjoyed the single player story line. It was unique in its style of character choice and it's impressive character development. For the single player I would recommend this game. Online however I was definintely intrigued at first and felt I really liked it. But the reality is I don't. Every session has someone who has modified the game or has hacked it. There seems to be no means of enforcing the rules against these hackers and it simply isn't fun. This is only of course after your game takes forever to load the online section of play. Then if the modder/hacker decides to manipulate the game where it crashes it on you then you have to reload the entire process.It's upsetting.For the single player however I would recommend the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-03,0,0,173,False,Recommended,Easily the best single player campaign story I have ever played in a game and that is saying a lot. Absolutely compelling characters from beginning to end perfect pacing and missions that are an absolute blast. It's like participating in the best crime action thriller ever made.The Online mode on the other hand is a different story. While it's definitely got great ideas building your own criminal empire in a massive territory going about your business whichever way you please there just isn't a way to play by yourself. PVP is not only involuntary it is also unrewarding as the reward for killing another player is minimal while the losses to yourself can be extraordinary. Extremely frustrating when you're about to jump into a plane to sell a shipment of weed when some comes along in a fighter jet kills you and destroys the product that took 4 in game hours to grow and be developed. It will feel like a lot of wasted time.That being said the game is worth the price for the single player alone as it will be a gaming experience that you will never forget and sets the tone for all single player stories to follow it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-13,0,0,70,False,Recommended,SINGLE PLAYER REVIEWI have nothing bad to say. The voice acting is some of the best in the biz. Being able to switch between the 3 characters is pretty awesome though it doesn't have much of an impact besides different storyline quests. They did an amazing job with the map. It's the perfect size in which it maintains a sense of wonder at the beginning of the game but you still find hidden locations later on when you can snag an airplane and explore. The driving feels good but the vehicle upgrades seem a little random without continuity vehicle to vehicle. My only complaint in single player is the inability to save vehicles permanently for later use. This doesn't make sense seeing as you drop loads of cash to upgrade a vehicle only to lose it if it gets destroyed.You'll still get 60 bucks out of this game for sure but given it's 2 year age I'd wait for it to go on sale just for the principle of it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-22,0,0,181,False,Not Recommended,If you haven't played it go for it. If you played it on any other platform don't waste your cash. Single player is a good game (probably the best of the GTA's outside of Vice City I consider Vice City to be the best GTA game) multiplayer *sounds* like it would be a great idea but when you make GTA multiplayer it just turns out to be a really really bad idea. And the architecture of the multiplayer system basically completely prevents Rockstar from preventing cheating . . and it's not even clear if they care about cheating in the slightest.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-07-22,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,Solo Wonderful!Online only if you have a bunch of friendsMy main gripe with this game is the long loading times when playing online It consistantly takes over 7 minutes to get into a session from startup even with SSDs. Sure it take 2.5 minutes to get into solo mode which is pretty long compared to other single player AAA titles from the same era (Witcher 3 Fallout4 Skyrim).Then you have to wait for the job queue to load.Then you wait for the heist setup to start.Then you wait for the heist to load.THEN you can start playing.It takes FOR EV ER to actually start playing the game to make money.

As in score I will give the single player a 9/10 but the online a 5/10. If you like to play singleplayer and to mod cars Star Wars cruisers and such then give it a go. Abow was my first review I got back with another account and goddamn the grind is even bigger and harder.

2016-01-01,0,0,1335,False,Recommended,"Im not the gamer GTA 5 was created for so keep this in mind when reading this review. I have no complaints about GTA 5 although I would prefer something with a lot less stealing and killing. I like the stock market feature and the cab runs gives me other options for making money with no violance and I wish I didnt have to wait for the Car Towing feature to unlock. Having the violance being part of the game is understandable for the games market. I will leave any debates about the violence to others. I could only suggest other features I would love to have in this game.Keep in mind I would pay for these features as program upgrades or add ons. 1.) Have a non story single player mode or free play I dont know enough about editor mode to know if this mode qualifies. I found it interesting but couldnt do much with it except being a super villian/Hero and battle an army single handedly for hours on end. Onlone mode is too intense for me. 2.) More side missions ( more on the side of short side missions ) For example More racing missions Bus driving missions Various Trucking missions and just more ways to make money while involved with the world population in some way similar to cab fairs or car racing ( Also similar to Triatholons Tennis and Golf ) For violence enthusiasts When in certain neighborhoods a prompt trigger gets activated when a person or gang member challenges you giving you the option to choose same as when driving by the car racing trigger. 3.) An easier playing level ( handicap ) for those of us who can't pass the missions by making the player harder to kill as a way to making the non story single player mode unneccerary or have the handicap feature available before all missions. 4.) This one is my favorite An upgrade or add on for an improved world A.I. (Maybe Artificial Intelligence Theme add ons for example). The focus on graphics are great. Wish my computer had the technology to run it at one of the higher graphics levels but I would prefer a higher level of A.I. in the game. For example the emergency vehicles still sometimes get stuck in the same spot doing circles and other hilarios antics have the population react in more than just two ways run off in fear or try to kill you. What about some one trying to stop me just to get a few angry words about almost running them over or bumping into them. Or instead of saying ""Cool car can I get a ride?"" but actually give one of them a ride for real basically more random characters with deeper personalities. Examples are endless.5.) Cash Cards for single player mode.6.) Be able to transfer money between characters.The multi character feature is innovative and fun unfortunately I won't live that long and have to start over making money for each character. I played for more than two hundred hours less than 20% story missions completed and made about $250 000 by mostly cab fairs and the stock market. Micheal was only recently available and have not played his character yet so you can only imagine how many cab fairs I must have done. Easily over 800 fairs. Its going to take me for ever to get far enough in the story missions to unlock the bussiness and property buying and vehicle collecting etc. Unless I find some kid to do the missions for me. At least I was able to purchase a garage for $30 000 to store my race cars and taxi cab. Still waiting to be able to buy the towing company so I can make money doing that for a change. The cab fairs are becoming repetative since I have taken it to the extreme.I could go on but time is limitted.From a leasure game player thank you Rockstar North for being part of the Open World concept.After thought Now that I have played over a thousand hours in the single player mode and some online my only hope is that GTA 6 doesn't take forever and has the option to run on lower range gaming systems like mine. Difficulty level in the missions was great once I found out I can pass a mission after my third try and still be able to progress in the game genius!",Grand Theft Auto V

The gesture will always be greatly appreciated by the community.Loved the game the first time i played it on my PS3 and I decided to replay the game on PC only because of the mods Take 2's decision to block Open IV is one of the biggest blunders in gaming history. I have never played the game online and yet i decided to buy it on steam just to try out the mods. I have done the same for both GTA IV San Andreas and everey episode before that. One of the reasons why GTA survives on the shelf from one release to the other is because of these mods. It makes a different experience for the gamer everytime. I seriously hope they hear us and reconsider their decision to block modding it one of the key ingredients to what makes GTA....,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-22,0,0,212,False,Recommended,Their is not much to say other than this game is still one of the exciting fun games I have played. I have played this game on both PS3 PS4 and I have now moved into the PC world of GTAV. With all the experience I have had with this game I can tell you it still holds and will probably still hold in the next few years. The only downside is I had to actually start from scratch again on GTA online since Rockstar discontinued the transfer process. However restarting your whole GTA online progress is still fun since as soon as you reach rank 120 what else is their to do? When I saw this game on the steam store I looked at the page and noticed that it had mixed reviews. Upon further inspection I noticed that the negative part of the review was due to the fact that the player could not mod which is not a justifiable reason to hate the game. (If you want to mod play a game that was actually meant for modding).,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-22,0,0,1133,False,Not Recommended,New Update did a terrible job of eliminating hackers and caused public outcry.The new vehicles and weapons released in Gunrunning are overpowered to say the least. Any player who isnt being given money by a person modding the game will be defenseless against APC Mobile Operations Centers and the like. Overall a negative experience when playing online.Story mode is fun for about 12 hours until after you complete the main story. Only when you've gained your riches do you find out that effectively none of the online content is in Story mode for you to play around with. Overall a negative singleplayer experience.Regardless to Rockstar's upsetting actions in the new update GTA V is still a unique game and has some upsides to playing it. I've logged over 450 hours on it and I'm still finding new things to do. Although playing online since the new update has been a hassle.If you are thinking of purchasing the game the choice is up to you but my experience has been generally negative.,Grand Theft Auto V

It looks like they did a good job with getting rid of the hackers and mods of course modders and hackers are not happy anymore but who cares let them cry they are just mad becuase they have no skill and can't compete with good players that don't cheat. If you want to cheat do it somewhere else in your own game not online this is what really destroys games. The game is actually playable now and that makes modders angry.

2017-12-29,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,Well what can I say. I originally bought GTA V when it came out for the PS3. The single player was great and the online play was fun until Rockstar said they will no longer provide the updates to PS3. Fast forward to now I figured I would pick up GTA for my PC cause the price seemed right and from what I read Rockstar had fixed the multiplayer modding. Well it would seem that it is still happening. When I was about to complete a mission all of a sudden where ever I stepped flames would shoot out of the ground (like the flames shooting out of a propane tank that was shot in the game). I was prepared to play the game and do the grind to get caught up to other players but not when modders make the game so unenjoyable. Hopefully Rockstar will have a better handle on their multiplayer ecosystem in future games.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,118,False,Recommended,"14th July 2017 It looks like Rockstar has convinced 2K to leave singleplayer modders alone for now. So unless anything negative happens with 2K getting too overzealous again I'll recommend the game.26th June 2017 Rockstar are supposedly in talks with 2K games about leaving singleplayer modders alone. Until it is officially confirmed my review will remain negative.Restrictive policies abandonning singleplayer in favor of a grind fest multiplayer that has earned over $500 Million while the CEO says they are under monetizing players. Since it isn't enough money they attacked singleplayer modding in order to push people to the multiplayer. GTA IV was incredibly fun with mods which were blocked in this game due to microtransactions and ""fairness"" (Most modding tools for GTA IV blocked multiplayer or just segregated modders silently). Rather than embrace the excellent modding community that has existed for most of the existence of the Grand Theft Auto and has vastly extended the life of the franchise they choose to attempt to eliminate it. They likely won't suceed in killing off modding but until their policy changes Take Two and Rockstar will see no more money from me. For the record I have bought GTA San Andreas three times GTA IV twice GTA III twice and all other PC titles once.Edited to fix me being an idiot and mistaking 2K for Take Two though 2K is owned by Take Two so still not buying from them",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-11,0,0,317,False,Recommended,Single player story is alright I'd give it 8/10 (When I played it back on the Xbox 360 awhile ago)Online 7/10The Community as a whole 5/10Online is on the other hand is a very mixed sided set of coins one side it has alot of stuff to do and you can do alot of stuff to fill your time. Flip side to that coin it gets old rather quickliy as it tends to be the same thing over and over again. With that said Rockstar does do a good job to add more content to try and keep you interested.The selection of vehicles is really nice and there is always something being added to keeping your interests going. Also the level of customization you can put into the vehicles is also very nice. Some vehicles could be considered to abused depending on what sort of lobby you get into.The online can be fun on your own but in my opinion it's alot better with your friends or a group of people who you are cool playing with as it gives you more chances of doing fun things and generally being able to do stuff together which on your own may seem more like a waste of time or a long boring process.What I would say if you are going to get this game for just the online then you need to understand that the game has alot of hackers on it who will abuse their exploits to grief/bother you in many ways they can for example using god mode to be un kill able or to have unlimited ammo and even some vehicles which have weird and wonderful traits etc. The community as a whole for the game is a mixed nag of people you will find people who are cool to hang out with and to just play the game but you will also find the groups of people who act very un mature and very unsporting towards eachother and yourself for no reason or whatever reason feel etc you will also find those people who will abuse jets tanks helicopters and other vehicles of that nature to kill you over and over again regardless if you have done anything to them or not and usually they will keep doing it until you leave or get a reaction and then keep doing it.Even though it is an 18+ game unfortunately you find yourself having to deal with people under the age requirements.Overall with that said would I reccommend the game? yes? I guess but you need to keep all that in mind and if you can try to play with your friends or find a group of people who can play with.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-04,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,Before we start let me just say that this game is really fun. If you have a bunch of friends to play it with I think this could be a good game. HOWEVER lets talk about the bad. First off loading times in this game are actually insane. It can take anywhere from 5 15 minutes to load into the world and you have to load into anything you do in the game. EVEN TAKING A SHOWER HAS A LOADING SCREEN! Rockstar has also made sure that it will take you a long time to get money in this game. You can get $20.000 $40 000 every 15 20 minutes in game modes during double money events. Another big issue is the modders. Rockstar doesn't care enough to deal with them so most servers have modders running around screwing up the server. Which wouldn't be a problem if you didn't have to be in a public server to do missions. All in all I think underneath all the garbage is a great game. 4/10 Would get chopper stomped by a modder again,Grand Theft Auto V

You repaet the proccess of what you have already done (Talking about Multiplayer). It just gets old. I bought it 3 weeks ago and I haven't been playing it much because its just boring nothing else to do. So I reccomend this game to those who use Mods.

2017-06-16,0,0,119,False,Recommended,This game is either a hit or a miss. I'm saying that it is a hit because of the singleplayer story. It brings a lot of excitement that makes you want to do missions after missions. Also because of the multiplayer. Multiplayer or online mode gives a lot of fun and excitement you do heist rob a store join a race or be able to wreck havoc in the featured adversary modes. Now with the miss. I'm saying that this game is a miss because of the money it gives you after a long time playing this game. This game gives you only a little amount of money after you finish heists or by playing other modes. I could say for you to be able to buy a low end apartment you need to play atleast 4 or more heists to get one. One also are the cheaters of this game they ruin the game for you and for others just to satisfy theirs. And the shark cards are ssshhhh*t,Grand Theft Auto V

The next morning I went to log on again and it said I was banned for a month with the character reset. Maybe they will fix their issues with steam/pc clients in the future but i wont assume it.

That's it there is no anti hack system in place and Rockstar fails to acknowledge or show that they are doing anything about it.Multiple times I've loaded in to a public lobby to have people spawning Planes all around the map teleporting other people (sometimes mid Biker/CEO mission) making them instantly fail or giving themselves(the hacker/modder) basically an AK 47 with explosive rounds which will destroy anything instantly.I pretty much come back to the game too see the DLC (which is great btw) but it is always the same.

2015-09-11,0,0,420,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a game set within the fictional state of San Andreas which is based on Southern California and its developers has done a great job of replicating real world locations. The game is very well optimized as well compared to the previous title Grand Theft Auto IV which was such a disastrous game to run.The gameplay is quite fast paced gunplay feels fun and satisfying. Driving in this game stroke a minor controversy as it felt a bit too 'casual' compared to the previous major installment GTA 4. The graphics are phenomenal for an open world game and the level of detail in the world is incredible and the city feels very lively with a variety of NPC pedestrians scattered across the map The story is fun and well written. There are three led protagonists throughout single player and players can switch between them. Each of every mission in the game's story mode is unique so they don't feel very repetitive. When the story is over there really isn't much left to do however there are a number of activities in which you can engage in single player such as racing hanging out with your friends hunting down the wild life and playing sports but they're not as fun as they ought to be. GTA Online is probably the main reason why people get this game but in my opinion it barely has any redeeming qualities and I don't know why people are buying the game just for this. Firstly the concept of playing around in a huge open world with friends just simply sounds fun and it actually is surprisingly. There are a couple of things you can play in Online mode missions heists races and adversary mode which has a variety of game modes. But that's pretty much about it for the fun aspects of Online now for the cons. Online is very very grindy and is just pretty repetitive overall. Let's just say that you have a wish to buy a vehicle that costs around 2 million dollars (just a reference) which is pretty easy to get in single player but it's different Online. You will have to repeatedly do the same missions / heists / works over and over until you get enough money and by the time you get the vehicle you will feel a sense of satisfaction for a short while until you find another vehicle you want to get. Sure there are micro transactions called shark cards which add money into your character but for the price it's not worth it at all. Another negative of the Online mode is hackers they ruin the fun of the game and makes it worse especially when the game itself isn't much fun.To sum it up I think the game is pretty good especially the single player campaign but I do not think that it is worth spending $60 USD just for it and the multiplayer is trash in my opinion but do buy this on a sale if you have money to spare.,Grand Theft Auto V

You log in yadi yada create a character that looks like it regrets being born. After you're put into a server after what felt like 50 minutes of waiting you instantly get killed by a degenerate wit (me) spamming stickies from a T20 (also me) you finally notice the little green notification requesting players for a heist you join either get kicked because you're a level 1 or they're just happy that they finally got players and start. You somehow manage to finish it you get your first 20k as it was only a setup you dont know how to spend it or what to spend it on so you buy a car and put all the upgrades in that you can. Gets blown up obviously. It's 2 A.M and you have exams tomorrow so you go to sleep.

(christ why hasnt anyone made a petition for that?) and my review will stay negitive until the following happens1.lower prices in the game2.take two aplogizes for royally ing up3.ROCKSTAR GIVES NEW PLAYERS A FAIR CHANCE TO ACTUALLY ENJOY EVERYTHING THE GAME HAS TO OFFERand before you say ""oh its just another person saying the same over and over"" and yes!

2015-04-14,0,0,194,False,Not Recommended,"My original review is preserved underneath This updated review is tough to make but it's on the basis that on balance I wouldn't recommend this game any more mostly because of Rockstar's attitude to it.By all means get the game for the singleplayer content because it's a fantastic story line and one of Rockstar's best. The mechanic for jumping between characters to progress their parts of the story or to give another angle on a particular mission they team up on is quite inspired.What ruins the game is the online component and Rockstar's attitude to it and the game in general. There's a lot of fun to be had in GTA Online initially but it quickly devolves into a grind. Rockstar offers in game money for ludicrous real world prices and as a result trying to save money to purchase nice content (more of which gets added every few months of course) requires either a ridiculous amount of grinding or spending the game's value again in ""shark cards"" to buy in game money.This relationship with GTAO's currency also means that since launch the only real focus for Rockstar has only been on multiplayer content and primarily focusing on buying new things in order to get you to buy more currency. The online heists were fun but no new ones appear to have been added (because that would mean you could get new content without buying currency). Having to pay ridiculous amounts of money for new content or grind like hell isn't really fun.Additionally hacking is rife in public lobbies and hackers will do anything from blowing you up teleporting you trapping you giving you money (which seems like a perk until Rockstar bans you not the hacker for it) and just randomly screwing around with stuff. Moderation is otherwise virtually non existant.Finally Rockstar seems to have a love hate relationship with modders invariably banning modders and their users from online parts of the game for using mods to enhance single player content.The Singleplayer is fun but it's not going anywhere if you want to play for that get the game on sale. GTAO is a toxic wasteland which Rockstar profits from and has no real intention of cleaning up to make a truly enjoyable experience. Don't give them money for that. Original review This story starts with a cat and how curiosity killed it....I've enjoyed playing through the GTA V story so far but the event that stuck with me the next day probably wasn't intended by the scriptwriters. Instead the fate of one cat set loose many questions.The event in question happens just after taking control of Franklin before you steal a couple of supercars. A couple of cats are hanging around in the back garden of the property you're about to steal the cars from. As a cat person I naturally approach the cats to see how they behave and if they could be interacted with. The simple answer was no Franklin clearly had no intention of touching the cats and after trying to get close to one of them a few times the cat got spooked.What I didn't entirely expect were the events that happened next. The cat bolted out of the alleyway by which point I was busy getting Franklin involved in his caper. However I was promptly distracted by a soft ""thud"" and the cursing of a truck driver. Looking up I saw the truck slowly pulling away leaving behind a small furry corpse that just moments ago had been at my feet.I didn't have much time to mourn at the time but looking back on it I can't help feel some remorse over my involvement in the (virtual) animal's death nor slightly affected by Franklin's indifference. It makes me wonder when such a dynamic event occurs how deep the simulation really goes. I know it's unlikely but I wonder for a minute if there was a family waiting for that cat to return. Would I start seeing ""Missing Cat"" signs in the neighbourhood? Was the truck driver emotionally affected by the experience?The answer to these is probably no but perhaps one day this is something a more deeper simulation will hypothesise.Until then the memory of the cat I accidentally killed will probably stay with me throughout my playthrough. There's probably some irony that a game that necessarily has you kill hundreds of human beings intentionally could affect me more by making me complicit in the accidental death of an animal.",Grand Theft Auto V

I don't recommend it for Online play at all. Purchase at your own risk. This game is also full of people that are too sensitive for this game. They report you for griefing if you kill them even just once. This game isn't for them rockstar should make a game that doesn't let you kill anyone and instead lets you only hug people. A hug simulator is more appropriate for these delicate flower people.This game is also full of hackers.

However the game still has an immense amount of problems surrounding their online moderation.

2016-12-20,0,0,601,False,Not Recommended,UPDATED STORY MODE excellent hands down one of the best story modes I have played. Now to what ruined rockstar and made them greedy and what ruined the game. BUT NOT DLC for story mode which also aids in this games neg. review.GTA ONLINE FIRST if you buy this game just stay away from online. From the start of gta online when they launched it A MONTH after the game came out it was full of problems then the glitchers came then the modders. FAST FOWARD Today modders are out of control soo much rockstar lets a machine decide now who gets banned. YES is does ban a lot of actual cheaters but at the same time it takes people that hasn't cheated. Support is useless you will just get a machine that says bans are final same goes for their phone buy instead of machine you a very rude person that will hang up on you.ROCKSTAR IS GREEDY Ever since rockstar added shark cards to online they have become very greedy if you look at everytime that was out when online first launched to todays dlc prices there is a huge gap will small payout increases.IN SHORT I give this game a poor review because of no story dlc online unplayable because of modders and ban machine poor support from rockstar and rockstar getting more greddy.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-08-31,0,0,429,False,Recommended,This game feels like San Andreas pumped up on Vice City drugs the hype is real but sadly so are the amount of modders.as i probably assume that Rockstar works hard to remove all these problems it seems that they might want to invest more into these issues instead of releasing new contents all servers long i see people asking for money and getting money drops. Aside from this the game offers a true experience story wise as well as offline you get to feel what its like to be part of a movie experience i can see all the love that went into creating this game and it is by far a masterpiece on the singleplayer experience. Sadly wished it was more but i am human and we always want more. As for the offline experience it has so much to do and should have focused on more story driven heists (which might just be my personal opinion) GTA V Story mode overall score would be 8.5/10GTA V Offline mode overall score would be 8.0/10 I can't degrade the game just for its attackers as the game is really promising and offers many fun. The community itself might need some improvement and preferable servers people can select since its either 50% existing out of foreign speaking countries who don't or can't cooperate. and the ridiculous long loadings and queuing.Take those away and you get yourself a 10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-12,0,0,1215,False,Recommended,Amazing Story mode extensive online mode... ing splendid. On online I have spent over 1 100 hours across all platforms (PS4 Xbox360 And PC). The DLC in this game for the most part is great and is free... But the items tend to be worth a lot of in game cash (GTA$) and at times you find that you need to use the microtranscations which in my opinion should not be in the game as it has influenced certain patches on functions of the game (I.E Rooftop Rumble payout decreased and difficulty increased) though through all that nonesense this game is a must have for me. The DLC has also been getting better as of late ever since they dropped last generation console support for DLC.Edit After Rockstar has banned modding singleplayer I can no longer support this game and tell people to buy it this absolutely ridiculous. Modding has been a part of GTA since this series started and to shut down OpenIV after all the years?! I can't support Rockstar or Take Two in the new direction there heading with all the microtransactions and the Anti Modder outlook they have on the commuinity.Edit 2 Since Rockstar has agreed to let OpenIV resume its business I am reccomended this game again but be cautious because Rockstar's higher ups are changing and the new business men have been a lot more greedy lately.,Grand Theft Auto V

You'll see something different every time you play. Online is fun with friends and a nightmare in public lobbies. The entire system needs to be streamlined to reduce the number of loading screens and get you connected with friends faster. Aside from that it's as fun as you would expect. The missions aren't as detailed as they are in the single player story and it can get grindy trying to raise the funds necessary to buy cool stuff.

The rest was just loading screens. Game is fun though when people actually join heist and when you are atleast lvl 50 online. gta 5 the actual story is decently good but GTAIV is a much better game. Seriously though the ing oading screens kill me. I completely walk away from my computer every time it has to load and do something else because they take that long. However when the game isnt loading it is very fun to play even though Rock Star Games have become very jewish and is trying to make it a pay to win type of game with shark cards. Oh well its still playable without them. So i still give it a thumbs up.,Grand Theft Auto V

It is gorgeous and the vehicles handle better than ever before.... the free aim system is still lacking but when a company puts so much into one game it's hard to seriously nit pick. The story kept me playing and while it is well written it isn't anything special but thats ok... It is compelling enough to keep you interesting... Heists are cool even though the build up is kind of boring. Plenty of stuff to do in this game. If you like the series you will like this game. 8/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-26,0,0,342,False,Recommended,Grand theft Auto V Where to start?Campaign The story is great the open world enviroment and 3 choosable characters are exciting as you go through missions and discover their past and present deals friends backgrounds and abilities. They spot light of the campaign is the almost neverending side missions for each character which are exciting to play through after you finished the main missions and got bored (if you ever will D). You have a lot of option of spending your money for example Real estate cars stocks boats clothes guns and so on. The campaign is the best i've played in a while.Multiplayer There are Pros and Cons with multiplayer and mostly there are cons.Pros.The expanded enviroment of races multiplayer missions clothes cars and such. The heist clubs and companies that you can create with your friends is great.Cons.The requirement to play missions with players or friends it's often hard to find players or friends that are willing to do these missions with you. The heist system is not good often times you get paired up with players and maybe it's good for them it's not good for other higher skilled players because almost always they have to be mentored..The money system is okay sadly a lot of cars planes boats clothes real estate and races aren't available in singleplayer. I Definitely recommend the Singleplayer not so much the multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-16,0,0,89,False,Recommended,Great game. However there is an occasional bug in single play mode whereby when you invest in stocks your investment isn displayed in your portfolio. In fact it the money you've invested just disappears completely. This has resulting in some irritating game reloads.Also the game's online mode gets tiresome very quickly. Servers issues in which the connection keeps dropping are bad enough. But juvenile hackers and modders always have the upper hand and tend to pick on new players. They have all the advantages in terms of money and weaponry so you can forget having any advantage over them unless you're willing to waste 20+ on rip off shark cards that give you in game money.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-05-14,0,0,624,False,Recommended,Single player is great fun with the hilarious trademark satire. Nice looking game. Good music. Controls are more console biased but played on KB/mouse just fine (competitve driving requires gamepad IMO). Various funny but flawed characters and 3 very different protaganists with a good interwinding story across the beautiful backdrop of Los Santos. Multiplayer is mostly fun. Cheats/modders are very common &amp annoying. But if you solider on the co op missions &amp heists are what i enjoyed the most from it despite this. With a little free roaming on the servers.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-15,0,0,76,False,Recommended,I think I would probably have been able to say something nice about this game if I could play it. I think A LOT of people would say wonderful things if they could play it. However that isnt the case. As for me I am waiting for some kind of response from Rockstar on my support ticket that was submitted 35 hours ago. There hasn't really been even a recognition of the crashing launcher problem. Pretty new to buying games and first time buying anything from Rockstar and now I haven't even been able to open the game.Not the best launch. I am happy for those who have been able to play this game but wouldn't suggest anyone purchase it until it is fixed.Side note Once this is fixed I feel like I will most likely change my ratingOnce the game was fixed... awesome... lots o fun,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-30,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Update Like mostly everyone else the ban on the modding tool OpenIV is just cancerous. Its like the complete opposite of what gta was about before. The huge modding scene just got killed. There was a multiplayer mod on gta san andreas called MTA sa. MTA was amazing for the time. All servers were created from scratch by the community and all was moddable and you could do whatever you wanted it created the best racing game for me. I created so much with it !Now we have the complete opposite. We go from an amazing creative modding platform (which was the previous gta games before) to an eating money machine. This is one of the best example of modern triple A bull***hit. I must put a red on that one as a modder myself.Edit Change has been made for the good modding tool is back again legally______________________________________________________________________Old review and the meat of it if we forget that absurdity above Did not bother the GTA Online section of it still.However can talk about the Story which is the best GTA Solo to date.The missions are amazingly interesting in term of setup and gameplay change.I mean the missions are really diversified. I really like the pace of starting criminally slow and then Trevor comes.Game is like San andreas HD the city is completely different tho which is cool.The place is alive People doing contextual action animals in woods lot of little activities when you are not on mission.GTA V is beautiful big Technically a gem long Diversified ofc cant argue with that !On the other hand every game has holes in it. There's mostly 2 things that I dont like The way the player is handled he handles like a tank really similar to GTA 4. Example if your on a ledge and you turn back you will fall. The ragdoll can sometimes kick in for small raisons and you lose the control. I must say that the ragdoll is funny tho.The other reaison is even if the firefights are mostly easy the mission fail are sometimes too strict aka failing just because you exit the mission car or the police touch you but you must not attract cops attention. You cant expand the creativeness too far and must follow the mission rules.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-22,0,0,322,False,Not Recommended,"Right I won't mention funky modding policies and other stuff in this review I want to focus on gameplay.GTA V main story mode was quite good I enjoyed it but I would call it a bit short? Also very few mission where you can actually control 3 main characters. Other than that it was really great at the time.GTA V Online as it is right now (2017) is a giant sandbox. Lots of it is locked behind levelling system and high prices.Levelling up system just bad. Because you are new you will have to jump truth so many loops and now when every player has guided missile/armoured vehicles only thing you can do is run. Don't even try to meet other players until you can afford rocket launcher. Prices are steep. My best advice is to take it slow set up objectives and just try and do that by having fun.My biggest complaint the elephant in the room that Co op is terrible. after every mission your group gets disbanded you need to manually re join your friends world ask him to re invite etc... Loading time is also really long especially when you have to re join your friend every so now. I had like 20 ""lifetime"" promotions to specific rank each day. Also if you are working with your friend to support his ""business"" then wow... business owner will get 80% of the cut while you who did the same amount of work maybe more will get something like 10%? GTA V online is so punishing to play with friends that I would suggest to play it as single player and avoid working for other as it is so unrewarding. GTA 5 please make proper ""guild"" style system where players could work together to progress. create a party system where one ""captain"" could initiates activity with his group first and then invite others. How can Online game feel so single playerish?",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-22,0,0,49,False,Not Recommended,This game is full of stuff to do. But it disencourrages people like me who want to be friendly with other players because the community is made up of 12 year old little annoying kids. You can drive all kind of vehicles before destroying them with your weapon arsenal. You can rob very small food stores but you cant rob Banks. The grafics are great. You can race against other players or AI and you can also do very difficult Coop missions and Team Deathmatches. But the gameplay is very hard and punishing. (especialy the races.) And GTA online has the loooongest Loading times ever! 50% waiting and 50% playing thats what you get. If you want to get depressed Buy this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-26,0,0,394,False,Recommended,Hi Fellow gamers So what does your money buy with GTA5. I haven't played another game that would allow me to steal a car make it my own in very sense live the high life and all that it encompasses Hire hookers and strippers get drunk till you pass out and die. Rob Banks Commit unspeak acts against your fellow man. So whats not to like? Here is where it gets really wierd for me. The game is based on letting the player commit any act of unspeakable depravity he or she would like but if you shoot or interfere with other players to much you are PUNISHED LOL. If you kill to many civilians your mental state rises? The game in that way sends the strangest signal. Then we come to my favorite part. I have been a computer gamer since the 80s. I don't remember a game in recent memory including both Dayz and Dayz Standalone that had this many glitches and I mean serious jacked up no messing around glitches. If you make friends with another player as I have your game could crash untold number of times trying to join there game. Hacking and Modding is on an epic scale. Its the strangest thing in the world to sell a game for 60 dollars plus and to have issues on this level. So here I sit with this game it's like the girlfriend that you always liked but annoyed the heck out of you in the end you couldn't decide whether to break up or marry. My message to all would be buyers. GTA5 is like the SEA you love her but don't turn your back on her because she has a kitchen knife.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-30,0,0,1092,False,Not Recommended,"Update 5 Goodbye Grand Theft Auto and this is the last straw. ICYMI a GTA Youtuber (Broughy1332) got banned on all platforms (PC PS4 XBOX) for no reason after speaking out against ol' Cuckstar and Take 2 Much and the new DLC. In case you don't know Broughy specializes in vehicle testing and uses his testing to inform players on what not to waste their hard earned money on. It seems like this multi billion dollar company can't take a little criticism so it decides to abuse its power to silence a critic. Welcome to Grind Theft Auto where the inflation is extreme and the ruling company is fascist.Update 4 New DLC released Doomsday Heists and as usual everything is expensive af. If you have a group of friends who play regularly and you guys can handle the newly added griefing tools and you guys can spend 5+ hours a day grinding away then the DLC isn't too bad (60% of the heists are actually fun). You want an amazing flying Delorean from Back to the Future? Well that'll be 5 million GTA$ or 60 Dollars in sharkcards or about 15 hours of grinding! It's not ok when a hacker explodes everyone on the server but it is ok if you buy a 900K orbital strike canon alongside your 2 million dollar facility and spend 500K per shot exploding random people on the server. Bad things are good as long as Cuckstar can make a buck or 2 from it. The gaming community stood up against EA and its bs with Battlefront II maybe it's time to make some noise again.Update 3 Good news is I've been banned. Bad news is facking Strauss facking Zelnick (CEO of Take 2) said that every game they release now (Take 2 R* 2K) will have ""recurrent consumer spending"" (microtransactions) because that's how they make money now. Looks like RDR2 will be a facking mess like GTA O and looks like this is goodbye T2 goodbye R* and goodbye 2K. I'll still pirate your games not play them (maybe except BDL3) and delete them afterwards though.Update 2 So R* just decided to remove about 23 million of my hard grinded money and you know in some ways I'm glad because I was getting tired of the grind anyways. I've also downloaded a hack so hopefully R* catches me soon so I don't have to open Online ever again. Single player is still fun with mods but I guess R* doesn't care because single player doesn't drive shark card sales and who knows with all that take2 openIV bvllshit that happened a while back who knows if the next GTA will even support modding. Goodbye R* hope RDR2 fails and that you'll never make a good game ever again.Update 1 Everything in this DLC will cost at least 48 million GTA$ or about 700$ in shark cards or about 100 hours of grinding. So yeah for the first time ever I'd rather have paid DLCs than this t.R* may have changed their view on single player modder and allowed OPENIV to continue existing (or they did so for damage control). But they clearly have not changed their minds on monitization. Yes new DLC is ""free"" but if you look at the latest update it adds 19 new vehicles (9 of which are unaccessible and will be drip fed until christmas) new aircraft hangers new planes. All of that is cool but everything is locked behind a pay wall. If you want to buy the new planes (which rnage from 600k to 5 million) you need to buy the new hangers (which is like 2 million) and if you want to upgrade your new planes you'll need to buy a workshop (1 million) on top of the hanger so you'll have spent at least 3 million before you can buy the new planes (3 million is equal to about 6 hours of non stop grinding or about 50$ in shark cards) then you decide to buy the new jet which is 5 million dollars well guess what that's another 10 hours of grinding or 100$ in shark cards with 3 million left to buy some gliders. The prices of the new content is absurdly high and unless you enjoy grinding or want a second job on top of your current occupation (student or whatever it maybe) I'd stay the hell away from this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-08,0,0,517,False,Not Recommended,"RIP GTA. I think soon I will completely drop the game. And for sure I am never ever buying anything targeted at multiplayer from rockstar again no matter how good it is. Probably will download a pirated game when it appears but developers' attitude to players is not worth paying them money.Single may be okay. I don't like GTA singleplayer and I got mine just to play multiplayer.And... multiplayer sucks a55. It takes AGES to load and connect. You will spend up to 10 minutes waiting to enter multiplayer (normally it takes less of course but not less than 5 minutes) Missions (and free mode too but that's not critical) sometimes just throw you away into separate session. Means you are still online it just disconnects you from the heist and it is failed because you ""left"". And your and your team's time is wasted. Awful interface and user interaction. Be ready that in a situation while you need something quickly it will behave oddly. Cheaters are everywhere. Prepare for that. Obviousely they are fighting cheaters as there are fewer of them now but they are still there.Seriousely if you're expecting for multiplayer fun better don't bother it's multiplayer is not worth a penny. The MP game is awesome from many aspects but it just does not let you enjoy it because of often disconnects and long loading time. I think about 10% or more time I spent in this game were spent waiting for it to load restart and connect. And another 10% spent in missions that failed because someone got disconnected for a second or two and thrown away from session (while the internet connection was always stable as we were voicespeaking in discord all the time...)After playing GTAV Online it felt so strange for me that other games multiplayer JUST WORK seamlessly (and even if other games disconnect you that's still SEAMLESS compared to GTAV behavior) and are enjoyable.It feels like the developers just do not care much about multiplayer. Well they DO care adding a lot of stuff you can purchase in game but it feels like that they're encouraging us to buy virtual ingame money. Of which this game is clearly not worth.UPD Well okay half year has passed. Now with new addons some super expensive imbalanced things are at play. Various superweapons that cost tens of millions literally. The only way to get them is by donating. And 50 usd donation does not give you much only 8 millions which is nothing with the prices for MP stuff. Of course there's ways to grind those but that would take weeks of grinding.Prepare to be killed by cheaters ones who donated 300 usd and ones who have no life with new superb weapons you have no access to!Welcome to a 60 bucks free to play game!UPD2 Oh when we thought it could not be worse rockstars immediately prove us wrong! New heist needs us to purchase expensive stuff (there's a paywall) + new update has an orbital strike feature to simply immediately destroy anything you want which makes it a legit griefing tool.If you think you will have fun in multiplayer and are planning to buy it avoid this game it is no longer worth the money by any means.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,89,False,Recommended,Take Two the publisher of this game (and pretty much the owner of the series) has decided to sent a C&amp D letter to the team behind OpenIV the multitool required to unpack modify and repack files used for the multiple and creative mods on this game and its predecesor GTA IV.the fact they are pulling this after DECADES of just looking away on people modding the Grand Theft Auto games. (they not even reacted like this when the Hot Coffee hell broke loose) and the fact this kinda coincides with Bethesda stubborn push to paid mods seems to confirm that they are probably looking at the same end as Bethesda to capitalize what for decades have been a free perk of PC Gaming.DONT SUPPORT THE MONETIZATION OF SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE FREE.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY REVERSED THEIR STUPID DECISION.

I don't usually write reviews for games however I wish to try it out for a few games I have listed the 'Pro's and Con's' of the game. Pros Smooth gameplay providing you have the requirements needed Most bugs being fixed frequently New and immersive features e.g. First Person Large selection of things to do in Grand Theft Auto Online Cons Very long loading screens (Particular to entering GTA Online) A lot of money required to get anywhere in GTA Online A lot of connectivity issues Saved files when regarding Singleplayer get corrupted and remove themselves (This may just be my PC),Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,0,0,148,False,Recommended,As i haven't played the single player much i will focus on reviewing GTA Online.GTA has a massive open world with plenty of interactions. After a large number of free DLC's it now has even more content. Some of which i find sort of pointless but certainly also some stuff i think is quite nice. I wish it had more heists which is a high level mission in several parts. However heists do require a group of 4 friends as playing with random strangers can suck. Online however has an issue with loading screens which are frequent and looooong. I play on a brand new gaming PC on a 250/250 mbit fiber connection but it still takes several minutes for load screens that crop op a lot more than you would tihnk is necessary.Overall a very nice game with plenty of content to keep everyone entertained but with stupid flaws that i have no idea how they havent fixed.

2017-12-21,0,0,618,False,Recommended,The game is great but not without problems.GTA Online is a great game to play with your friends you can also find a lot of people to have fun with but you'll mostly find yourself running away from s in jests and attack helis.With the introducition of the Doomsday heist DLC we also have to deal with orbital cannon which can trace you in a heli jet etc.Another downside of GTA Online is Rockstar's overpricing of the new content which is understandable for things like a stealth tank or attack heli but making a regular car cost over 2mln GTA$ is just not okay when you get about 300k for a heist.On the bright side you have a lot of races missions heists parachute jumps deathmatches etc.In addition with this year's DLCs you have a lot more ways of making money but they require a lot of work if you're alone (Biker's stuff CEO crates exporting cars weapon manufacturing and air freight missions.)If you're not interested if the multiplayer I'm sure you know about the story mode and i don't have to talk about it so I'll just say it's' great even though I haven't played it a lot on PC.Overall if You don't want to waste your money on shark cards and have more fun then just driving around in a stolen car getting killed by s on public session bring some friends it's a lot more fun to play and you can make money easier and faster.,Grand Theft Auto V

I don't think anyone from R* will see this and do anything about it but just saying if you're going to get this game be aware of this blatant t. Also its extremely unprofessional for a company to outright ban someone from social club who has literally only played this game truthfully for over 400 hours yet doesnt ban the extremely large amount of cheaters/hackers this game has.So once again I still do recommend the game as some of my fondest memories from 2013 to Now are this game with friends and it honestly is really fun (In friend lobbies without the 12 year olds trying their best to make you mad by repeatedly killing you). But for R* to treat their long time fans like this is a bit unsettling for me as it doesn't seem like they even do background checks before their anti cheat immediatley kicks you out and in my case banning me permanetly and disabling my social club for FOREVER.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-02,0,0,478,False,Not Recommended,"To start off I really don't want to make this review but im so dissapointed in Rockstar that I feel the need to do so.GTA Online when it first came out was to put it simply fantastic. It was tons of fun to play on my ps3 with my friends. Once I got it on P.C. I enjoyed it so much more. This was in my top 5 games for the longest time. But now it has become one of my least. Rockstar ed this game up. They became to focused on people buying micro dlc (I.e. Shark Cards) rather than helping the player base enjoy the game. Every update that comes out is such a boring repetitive grind. It takes a amount of time to get anything you want. Hell some of the new cars are upwards of a million dollars and for the most part they really aren't worth it. The only ways you can get a majority of items in GTA is to either buy Shark Cards or getting hacker money. I may be wrong but if I remember correctly the most money you can make legitely in an hour is around 400 450k. Since new cars are around 1.5 mil you may have to grind for just short of 4 hours for 1 car. This is why I never understand people who say ""Just play the game work for it"". The fact of the matter is that most people don't have enough free time to spend a few hours everyday to get some of the new Unless you are a Youtuber/Streamer for GTA or you dont go to school/work then you can get these items fairly soon after the update comes out without getting modded money or Shark Cards.All I wish that rockstar would do is make this game reasonable to play again. Either a more effective and fun way of grinding out money or start making everything cheaper. Casual gamers really can't play this game anymore. It makes me sad because this game to me was very casual in nature when it was released but now it has become such a hardcore grind that it doesn't seem worth it at this point.My last note on this game is the ridiculous amount of hackers that are in the game. Rockstar doesnt seem to give a damn about them they care more about getting modded money off acounts than banning those that mod the money in. These hackers/modders what ever you want to call them often ruin the experience for players who simply want to play with their friends.Rcokstar. Fix your This game was fantastic but now it's just not fun to play anymore. Its to much of a boring grind that is such a waste of time. I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore.

Take Two should not have the ability to stop something that even the developers have previously encouraged (Rockstar have even shared mods before on social media).Many people bought the game because of what modding can bring to it. Many only still play to this day because of the longevity that modding brings to games.It is a very clear cash and power grab by Take Two and not speaking up could influence other publishers to do the same thing in order to try and milk their customers for more money.It's a brilliant game whose publishers have killed a large percentage of the playerbase for a quick cash in with hopes of increasing sales of microtransactions.,Grand Theft Auto V

Yes they ruin all the game process. Yes this is annoying. Yes the puiblic community is cancerish. Yes there are jerks and meta gamers. Yes today you gotta grind to get the best of DLCs.However I can't stop enjoying GTAO. It's awesome. First of all you can always join a GTA gang and play with adequate people on gang servers. It's okay there to compete it's okay there to cooperate. So just get to it!Secondly missons and grinding with a friend or two is awesome. I play GTAO with my gf... Well she is not much of a shooter but she was happy to buy luxury appartments clothes for both of us and she also is a good driver so she helped me out many times with resupplies for my bunker.

Phillips Industries for life fool.This game features a beautiful set of graphics in a huge world that takes you far beyond the reaches of your imagination. I found myself getting immensely lost in the game for hours. Playing singleplayer before online was a great plan for me because it helped me really immerse myself in Los Santos and become familiar with the streets so I could navigate myself without the map so I recommend you do that.I also got really attached to the characters. At first I was not a fan of Trevor Phillips. He was rude crude and downright despicable. The more I played his storyline and learned more about him however the more I grew to like him as a character despite his insanity and horrific criminal activities. Upon playing the very beginnings of the game I had decided Franklin was my favorite. He was cool! He did cool stuff! Indeed he proved himself valuable throughout the story and I can't deny he's still pretty awesome. Michael is pretty awesome too and I really like how dedicated to his family he is even though he's a little bit crazy from all the crime...but he made it work in the end. If you made me choose a favorite I think I would go with Trevor but the other two are a close tie for second.There were a few people I got to kill that I was really happy about killing.Oh and I chose the best ending ""choice C"" and I'm glad I did.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-25,0,0,1939,False,Recommended,PROS Fan online and singleplayer missions and experience. You get to play as multiple characters in Story mode rather than needing various games/DLC to get each story. Great detail on the lore environment and vehicles. The vehicles are really cool R* interpretations of real world vehicles.CONS Story mode never received support after the game released. Some bugs may persist. Lack of any DLC for the story mode that R* hinted at coming before the game was actually released and the lack of R*s interest in putting time into this. Online can be hit or miss. Not all servers are set equally. Hackers still exist and run through causing issues. While they have patched many glitches and bugs for Multiplayer they seem to not focus on the bigger issues and focus on fixing things that aren't causing issues. R* also has an extremely poor methodology for dealing with hacker/cheaters. Though that may improve in the future. Microtransactions are tedious and a bit lame. If the whole point of Online is to grind missions to earn money microtransactions are a way to 'cheat' your way up the ladder by paying real money for fake money to buy gear and vehicles. Another big con has been Rockstars parent company TakeTwoInteractive. T2 not that long ago took a very strong action against the modding community with a Cease and Desist legal order against the company behind OpenIV. T2 claimed OIV was the tool used by online modders to cheat and cause other players issues. Whether or not this is true it was not due to the OIV developers intentionally making their tools to do that. Normal use of OIV and mods in Story mode prevent you from going Online with the modified game. It was the dev behind Menyoo that was the actual culprit as a paid Menyoo tool existed that could be used to hack the online session and cheat the system. Because of this singleplayer modding was in an unknown area of legality. This has negatively impacted the modding community that has done nothing to cheat Online merely wanting to improve SP since R* has ignored that side of their game since release day. It was this asinine legal action that caused a spam flood of negative reviews of GTAV. This was done during the time to let R* know that we as consumers will not tolerate being punished for things we have not done. OVERALL This is a decent game with a very much alive Online component that is always being updated. Though story mode has been neglected by R* and if you want to ever just run amok make a copy of an unmodified GTAV folder so that you have a clean one to go online with and a second one for modding the story mode to do whatever you want to against the games AI. Don't expect much support from R* and be sure to keep a close eye on your online account details so that if something happens you can ensure you have proof.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-12,0,0,177,False,Recommended,I am giving this game a 7.5/10... Okay so this game is a MAJOR upgrade from GTA 4. This is mostly played for online i havent played the campaign yet but i will update this when i do. In terms of the online i think this game is okay. One major problem is the modders.. Some are okay and will stop if you ask Some will rank you up give you money crash your game spawn NPC's stuck on you give you all guns spawn cars. And some are cool in a way where they will make a race for you. But i think the modders need to be dealt with. This game also has one major fault... In order to buy say a mobile operations base (semi truck with the trailer base thing) you MUST own a bunker. The cheapest bunker is 1.2 mil.. plus over one mil for the MOB (Mobile Operation Base).. it almost makes this game feel p2w (Pay to Win)..Then when some guy is flying at you in his delorean and your in your Lambogini that costs 5k to get back from the insurance co. it gets annoying... It also takes a while to be put in a session. And then when you finally load in theres an annoying modder and you wait a while to find a new session. If you also meet the right people you can have friends.. I met at least 3 people so far willing to help me make money (legitly) show me the stuff they have such as cars air vehicles and more. Then others dont even care and just throw a sticky bomb on your car and KABOOM you gone..... And don't get me started on the cops..... Also NPC's driving they will cut out infront of you and your nice new shiny million dollar car you just got is wrecked.....I think that Rockstar needs to (no matter how long or hard they have to try) get rid of modders... I know they are trying their best right now.. Also lower prices for ingame stuff... I am saying yes i recommend this game because i have it above 5.. I did get the game on sale. If you don't feel like paying $60 for it then wait for the next sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-28,0,0,1171,False,Recommended,Today I Ran around the city wearing only underpants old style pilot hat goggles and a flasher coat. Robbed a corner store at gunpoint and shot the owner for fun. Twice. Car jacked several people and sold their vehicles at a crooked auto shop. Sniped countless randoms in the head from a great distance for no reason. Bought a variety of firearms without a license or paperwork and killed more random people. Snuck up on someone who was not paying attention and beat them with a hammer. Then again with a pool cue. Went to the strip club paid for dances from 3 different strippers and touched them when management wasn't looking. Enjoyed back alley shenanigans with a hooker I picked up in my stolen ride. Checked up on my lucrative weed methamphetamine and cocaine businesses robbing supplies for each on the way.After doing all of this I went home and played GTA V Online the best game of all time. Practice makes perfect.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,EDIT 7/10/17 OpenIV is back it'll be interesting to see how things will go from here on out. My review will not change as the whole modding debacle is what finally pushed me into writing a review.I've been playing GTA V since release day first on the PS3 and then on the PC. Online started out fun and then just turned into a mess. With the introduction of team based missions where everyone had to cooperate a significant part of the community turned into trolls who would intentionally fail just to ruin everyone elses fun. That mixed with the hackers increasing in numbers and non hacking players getting banned for other hackers' doings I quit playing online entirely and stuck to modding offline just to get my kicks. Today I noticed that OpenIV recieved a cease and decist letter and decided to shut down their mod. After reading this news I have decided that GTA V is going to be my last Rockstar game I will ever purchase. I've been a fan since GTA III but watching this game go from a decently fun game to a Pay To Win game that also has a chance of permanantly banning your online account has just finally pushed me away from Rockstar all together. I will still play GTA V offline and mod the living crap out of it but I'll be spending my money on other games from now on.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-21,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,GTA 5 will probably go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. But there is a hell of a lot wrong with it. Getting the obvious out of the way first the anti cheat is a complete and utter joke constantly banning players who get money given to them without them wanting to and not banning the cheaters (Great move there you mongs)Rockstar promised single player DLC and to nobodies surprise they backed down on it for no reason You get microcharged out of the br&gt But my main complaint is how horrible the story is. All 3 protagonists are the most unlikable tools of all time. Franklin is just a who follows on everyones comment. Michael is just a hypocritical grumpy hate ridden tool and Trevor is just a nod to what GTA's core fanbase is a raven pack of dog freaks. As for the story it's as generic as they get with the only positive points being the Heist missions.Honestly Rockstar after everything you have earnt from GTA 5 you could help out your fanbase some more and stop dicking them over. (Also public lobbies online are all 12 year olds screaming N*gger so that's fun),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-14,0,0,266,False,Recommended,This is the first Grand Theft Auto game of the franchise I have played but I certainly enjoyed it. The game has amazing graphics if you have a decent graphics card. The attention to detail is amazing for example in back alleys and under bridges there is graffiti and shadows. The single player mode storylines are amazing and you can play as four different characters and each of them interact throughout the storyline which is cool. Moreover the online setting allows you to do missions explore mess around or just cause mayhem. The criticisms however are apparent The game as a very long load time even with an SSD hard drive and can lag or cause micro stuttering given the number of textures to load. And as always there are plenty of hackers in the online setting so when they come out to play it can be better to just log off. It comes with a hefty price tag but I believe it is worth it given how many hours you get out of the game both in online and in story mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-09,0,0,340,False,Recommended,"So with all the Negative reviews complaining about mods I thought I'd clear things up for people who DON'T care about modding.Single PlayerThe single player is ineresting and if you haven't watched a play through already the storys decent nothing revolutionary but I like it but single player will get boring after a while It does not feels as repetitive as some games lkek AC 4 BF but it is kind of doing the same things sometimes ( kill this person chase him down or kill all the enemies get a car escape from police etc) but the way GTA V does it makes it feel more entertaining plus everyonce once in a while theres something new and interesting. ( I probably have like 5 10 hours in the storymode so take this with a grain of salt)Multiplayerthe Multiplayer is interesting. With the multiplayer there's multiple things to do such asClassic tdm or as the game puts it LTSRaces this inculdes stunt races with quads that turn into jet ski's (kinda) to cars with rockets on themOther Unique ish ideas for example Rockets vs Insurgents ( I'll explain later )There's also other ""Events"" that happen while your just driving around such as longest wheelie most sniper kills most head shot kills etc. (you get exp and money for participating in these events)Plain old PvP around the map (you can go passive mode or be a ghost to a player if they kill you 3 times in a row)Other things I wanted to mentiontake note that I'm noob The level to unlock all weapons is 220 and Im like level 30 there's plenty of other (good) features that im too low level or never got interested enough to check out. Back to rockets vs insurgents its unique because ive never played any type of game mode like that this is how it works there's two teams one team is on a high platform with rockets and other in armored cas theres ramps that lead to the platform and there people in the cars have to kock off/kill the peopel on the plat. This may seem easy but if you go too fast you fly over them and too slow you dont make the jump this may not sound very unqiue but it was a pleasnt surprise for me.

2018-01-16,0,0,1532,False,Not Recommended,I really enjoy this game and I find the community generally to be a welcoming and helpful. However the never ending crapshow that is modders and hackers in this game just makes me want to uninstall and never pick up a rockstar/taketwo game again. Five different sessions just today and each time some modder ruins the experience. As far as I can tell there has been ZERO change in the frequency of disruptive modders in this game since I started playing. How can you justify charging people so much money for just the game (not to mention shark cards) and then have this crap happening constantly. Extremely disappointing.

2015-06-02,0,0,390,False,Not Recommended,I used to play this game so much. It has an incredible amount of content and development the story has so much fullness that you can compare it to real life and the multiplayer wasen't perfect but it was among anything I'd ever seen in an open world game. Unfortunatly my thoughts on this game have changed since I got falsely permanantly banned. Make no mistake folks that means your account and every thing you've earned goes away to the void for you to never be able to access again. Early in my accounts history yes I tried modding online and got a 10 day ban on my account okay fair enough no more mods. However when another modder unwillingly gives me millions of dollars thats a serious flaw that needs to be addressed. When I initially got the perma ban well I was mad but at who? the modder? Rockstar? Well it turned out to be Rockstar when I found out (after waiting for hours to speak to multiple representitves not even going into their sub humorous technical support) that my account was banned permanatly and there was nothing I could do about it. When I asked what for they declined to share the information with me. When I asked for an appeal they said I couldn't appeal. This is fankly unacceptable from a company that I have bought games from for years bought GTA 5(three times Xbox 360 PC and PS4) put almost 400 hours into(not even counting the hours from xbox and playstation) spend countless actual money on shark cards and in the end my loyalty to Rockstar means the absolute square root of jack s*** to them not even enough to let me appeal something that I was falsely accused of. My advice If you buy this game don't spend actual money and don't go Online If you do go online and find yourself in a modded lobby for gods sake get out.,Grand Theft Auto V

A lot of people blame this game for bringing microtransactions to the gaming industry but I disagree. The microstranactions in this game are different and are present to allow them to release content for free. At least when you buy a shark card you know exactly what you are getting and exactly what you can get for it in game unlike every other game with microtransactions.

2017-06-15,0,0,919,False,Recommended,GTA 5 has been a good game for a while. The singleplayer campaign can only be described as an experience. The online play has been enjoyable but more and more the focus of online updates has been on milking money out of players through microtransactions. As of 14/6/2017 a cease and desist letter was sent by Take Two (Owners of R*) to the developers of OpenIV a kind of base for GTA mods. This means that a huge amount of player content is unsupported. It is likely Take Two sent this cease and desist due to cheaters in multiplayer but OpenIV only works for singleplayer mods. They may have taken down this content in hopes to force more people into GTA online in order to make more money. Because of these things I can no longer recommend GTA 5. Should the cease and desist be retracted by Take Two I will consider recommending GTA 5 again.EDIT As of 23/6/2017 Take Two seems to have retracted their takedown. I will be recommending this game again. The excessive cost of recent updates is still a problem but I think the good outweighs the bad.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-03,0,0,116,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a really good game considering I was expecting it to be dead judging by the recent 60% off sale during the Steam Summer Sale. This game has very exciting missions and a fun storyline which is shorter than San Andreas but still definitely worth playing.The driving and flying physics are amazing for a game that isn't even entirely about that anymore. (The driving is even more enjoyable when you use a controller or gamepad and drift in the Futo).GTA Online is very far from dead with updates coming all the time and a community so strong after the Steam Winter Sale that the servers went into a Limited state for PC for quite a few hours.Building up money in Online is fairly slow but this means you spend longer earning the rewards of being rich. Once you have a high level and money there are still races missions and heists you can do with a team of friends or dedicated veterans from the GTA subreddits.Recommend this game to people who love exploring in free roam and need to relieve stress on civilians or gain stress from being dominated by the online players. 8/10 because the storyline is a bit short and some vehicles and updates added to the game have taken the game's style a bit too far from stealing cars and low level crimes although it's still very very fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-31,0,0,167,False,Recommended,CONCERNING SINGLE PLAYER Get it It's the best GTA yet hands down. Hilarious thrill ride of action feels drugs and impotent rage.CONCERNING ONLINE PLAY Pros I have fun when I have friends to play with.Looks pretty good.Gameplay is enjoyable but fixed wing aircraft controlls need to not suck.Great sense of humor throughout the single and multi player experiences.Heists and jobs are fun to do with friends in general the game is always best with friends no matter what you are doing.Cons General players are clinically disabled and cannot be relied on for anything aside from for to suck which is great if it's any sort of competative play the people who play this are as dense as a daikon radish. Pwn freely.Rockstar is a batch of hilariously ironic criminals with their business practices surrounding this game namely in how getting cash is a grind if you don't have 3 other DEDICATED friends to run entire series of heists (fun but tedious after the first 2 3 times) every day to get whichever amazeballs cool toys what get released with each update and all of it is exhuberantly expensive.Navigating the UI feels like a personal skill it's convoluted trash. Anyone can figure it out sure but it shouldn't be as broken up and... obtuse as it is.Still $60 many years after release.***I'm giving this a thumbs up because it's not terrible and I wouldn't say you shouldn't play the game but note that in my opinion it's really a 50/50 split. For single player YES thunbs up all the way.... but for the whole other half of the game multiplayer it's a definite NO if you don't have at least 3 other friends to play with***,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-02-05,0,0,808,False,Recommended,I have 637 hours on this game. That's 26.5 days!!!!!! I absolutely love this game. I totally recommend it BUT I need to share this warning. This game is very grindy. You will never get anywhere unless you spend hours and hours and HOURS (like 100) doing the same missions over and over again. Time is money in this game. If you aren't doing something that earns you money your wasting your time. I love this game so much i don't mind the slow progress but I'm just letting the new comers know that you have to spend a lot of your time just doing the same missions over and over again. Then again it's your time so why do I care. Consider yourself lucky you saw this reveiw because I'm giving it to you straight up. The game is really fun don't get me wrong but it takes a load of effort to get barely anywhere. There are a lot of things that I don't agree with but that's just my opinion. People who say you can just buy shark cards are wrong. Unless you want to spend $500(us) your not getting anywhere. 100 dollars will probably get you 4 MAYBE 5 good things. Not worth it. That's all I have to say. Thanks for reading and have a great rest of your day dear viewer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,150,False,Recommended,As of today I'm changing my review to a recommend just because the single player portion of this game truly is an amazing experience and worth the cost of the game. In the unlikely event that you have never played the single player then get it on sale and enjoy one of the best stories in video gaming history.My previous comments in my initial review about multiplayer still remain mostly true. It's still full of hackers and not a fun experience. It's still ridiculous that they haven't implemented any anti cheat on their servers. But at least Take Two reversed their decision on OpenIV in response to player protest and that was my reason for not recommending.I still can't fully recommend multiplayer. It's a very transparent cash grab at all turns and when that is the case you want to see that the money you spend is giving you a benefit but since you meet hackers at every turn who will have things that cost you real life money or hundreds of hours of grinding it makes you wonder why you would bother.In summary buy it for the single player and enjoy that. Don't buy it for the multiplayer because it's honestly terrible which is a real shame considering the potential it has.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-11,0,0,764,False,Recommended,Note A to the point review with no spoilers.UPDATE Sep. 2016 With the amount of content that has been added to GTA Online I am able to revise my review and recommend GTA V. The shortcomings I have previously listed are sill relevent but I can say there is enough content now that it is worth $60.UPDATE May. 2016 With added online content and new gamemodes I would revise my value of GTA V to $40The single player story feels abrupt and haphazard as though it were told by a second grader with ADHD. Character development is shallow at best with arcs as defined as Mr. Magoo s sight. Understand that any story judgement is purely subjective but when I compare it to previous GTA titles five falls quite short. The voice acting sound effects and textures are all amazing. These three areas in particular are what I see as the only saving graces of the game and their respective departments should be proud. The multiplayer is a disheveled exploitive mess with net code reminiscent of Battlefield 4 at launch and Rockstar s constant knee capping of any method of progression. One main issues plaguing online is faux longevity caused by constant reduction (Rockstar s Patches ) in amount of RP (experience) you can gain making it take longer to obtain level locked items. The other primary and worst offender in any game is freemium inflation caused by devaluing the in game currency thus leading to high cost items and low currency gains from missions. The devalued currency is solely there to encourage people to buy Rockstar s Shark Cards and is tactic synonymous with poor game quality and no respect for the consumer.Conclusion Overall I would value Grand Theft Auto V at $20 if you pay more than this you will feel swindled. I understand companies are primarily about the bottom line but as it stand this was a deplorable misstep to cash in and leaves me feeling robbed. Unless changes are made in future updates this marks the last Rockstar game I will buy. I no longer have any confidence in the company's ability to deliver a solid game unbridled by greed.,Grand Theft Auto V

But that's where it stopped for me i didn't enjoy the multiplayer part and i believe it's highly overrated. Not only is actually playing multiplayer made way more difficult than it should but it's pretty much just racing.But enough about MP as GTA has always been about the big SP world. And speaking of world it manages to feel smaller than San Andreas.. Yes yes technically it's bigger but it doesn't feel bigger it doesn't have that many different areas. It's basically Rich district poor district and desert. Yes ofc i liked the missions in MP but only with friends with randoms it's just chaotic. I believe youtube has made the MP bigger than it should be. And sure it's a great world to just be hanging out with your friends in...IF you're bored that is why not play an actual coop game together instead of just driving around in cars bored.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-02,0,0,135,False,Recommended,i have played this game quite a bit. I would definently say this game comes onto the catorgory of classic. by the fact that the story mode regards of age is a well devoloped adventure with every thing a good story need (good charactors high stakes good enviroment etc). You really get to do what ever you want. Once you get to th end game you own multimillion dolars companys and have the fate of everyone in your hands.GTA online is a completly differnt story. It may be made on the same engine by the same people and you get with the game but it is notr the same. It is one of the games that when watching youtubers play gta online you get this urge to go buy it and play it. then once youve downloaded the game and finnished the hour long loading screen you gtet dumped into a huge universe with other people flying around in there attack chopper blowing you up as you try to steal a hatchback car so you can get your first job. after this happens for countless hours you start to get drwan to buy shark cards. This is the problem you nned shark cards. I happend to start off with 1.250.000$ becuase of the version i bought. But even that amount was not enough to actually get me started. you need to spen another 404 on shark card once you bought the game just to afford a busness so you can really start making money. so to sum up this GTA online is fun but it is very exspensive fun,Grand Theft Auto V

They are just milking online for money.I have kind of given up hope on online though it can still be fun to play with friends. Though what I would suggest is to get a mod called ""FiveM"" instead of playing online which is a platform where people make their own custom servers with mods and everything or just vanilla.You can still play online if you want though just be aware of the amount of modders which I really hope they will do something about though they've had a long time to fix this issue.All in all I would still recommend the game just for the Singleplayer itself and because of FiveM.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-17,0,0,542,False,Recommended,GTA Online reviewWhen you start off as a low level make sure you push M and scroll all the way down till you see passive mode. Keep this on to avoid getting spawned killed by toxic playes. Join a private lobby if you want to kill a bunch of people without your K/D going down because off a jackass till you get some health and weapons by leveling up to protect yourself. Don't even bother playing heist till you are rank 100 because people will just kick you from the lobby+ the fact that you don't have full health. You get 10% health every 10 ranks till you are rank 100. Just do the missions story based characters give you and/ or go into the mission menu and pick missions to do that you have unlocked via rank. +The game is still updating on the regular with double xp/money and new missions. +Easily 100+hrs MP Load screens are super long in this game. 1 4 minutes when getting back to the lobby. I suggest you get up and walk around. Random disconnects kick you all the way back to singleplayer undieing enemies Slow xp. I generally have no problem grinding for thing like money and clothes but when health is also locked behind rank it becomes a problem. You know you are better than player B but will always lose to player B in a gun fight because he/she has double the health that you do. 90hrs in with 3 heists completed loades of missions and still only have 60% of the health of player B. The complaining about the anti cheat system is overblown. A lot of the people complaining about either got banned for modding overclocking using third party overlays and playing with a person they KNOW is cheating ex. modding free money. Updated 2017. People getting banned for singleplayer mods.........2018 less annoying modders and a lot more to do in game.

2018-01-28,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Nice game,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-28,0,0,482,False,Recommended,"GTA V. Good story mode much more mechanics than IV different driving and rag doll physics.. already too much debate and info you can google on that that's why i only wanna focus in the gameplay and overall experience of the online and collect and analyse the biggest problems with the game in a midly readable review.As for it I still don't know if i like the game more than i dislike it. I'm a big fan ""roleplay"" servers in SAMP and the fact that i have to install a 3rd party client to play that game mode here is sad.Even then I'm not a big fan of playing with 32 or less people (versus the SAMP svs +400 people in a map half the size) doing something similar to the money farm and jobs like in SAMP but mostly with bots and a occassional encounters with players for me that makes get boring pretty quickly.After the small rant let's see what online has to offer Basically the main game mode called freemode is a grind deathmatch with RP elements. Activities are miscellaneous and some created by the community. Races DM matches fights in or against weaponized vehicles and a long etc. You join 32 player (max) sessions or solo sessions. FiveM developers the creators of the 3rd party online client mentioned earlier are working on breaking this limitation and making possible servers with 64 or even 100 player slots. I don't see Rockstar devs working on this.... You can own different types of properties. Some are for vehicle storage only some as bussines buildings and some to do missions/heists which are coop missions with other people. More in that in a minute ) You get to buy different vehicles. Not getting in depth but some are cars helis planes military vehicles with guns anti explosives and bulletproof windows armored vehicles and special vehicles with crazy features like rocket propulsion or bunny jumps.Important points you should consider before buying.1.Friends or solo? It's fun AF with friends.If you play solo its still pretty good but the experience wont be nearly the same as if you played with friends. You can make friends in game pretty quickly. Let alone freemode stuff some work and coop is better to so with people you know.2. Grind for That Auto.By far the BIGGEST flaw of online.Pretty much every nice thing costs about +2 million. EVERYTHING. And for this you have to consider that the most money you can grind in 1 HOUR of NON STOP grind would average 200k. Sometimes 400k.. really depends on what bussinesses you run and tha is considering you ALREADY OWN certain useful vehicles to get you through easier and bussiness buildings to be able to start some jobs which alone would be not cheaper than 2.5 million. Oh my god. Good luck with that of you are a new player.New update cars? pay 1 million or 2 million each.New update properties? Pay 1 million up to 3 million. EACH.Want a car that is faster than the average street car you can hijack? Pay 200k AT CHEAPER Or stick to boring slow sedans and undriveable muscles. And still be prepared to be outruned by almost every user with a more expensive car which make up 90% of players you find in your average lobby.It's not very hard to make money once you have bussiness running but for that exorbitant prices forget about trying ALL of the new or existent content without having to use glitches cheats or buying shark cards.Grind is not necessarily a bad thing when its well done but GTA Online game mode is NOT a RP server with 100 people peacefull folks to make more bearable the jobs you dont have chance to ""be"" and play a character because 1 out of 3 people you will rarely encounter in the sea of bots will try to kill you or destroy your work cargo nor in between all the ways to make money all are fun or profitable.3. Connection problems.It's very common that you have to setup your router settings to make the game work properly. In PC at least after hours of research and trying things only disabling uPnP (which in theory was enabled to SOLVE connection problems in games) i was able to play without connection errors most of times.And this is not MY issue it's a common problem in this game.Yet to get rid of all that i had o activate DMZ for my IP which would make my router naked against malware.... thanks Rockstar.4. Heists.Not much to explain but this has to be the best part of the IMO. Basically multiplayer missions. Everyone gets a role and they have succeed since team work here is a requirement. If someone messes up you have to restart. Consist in a series of setup missions followed final heist which is longer harder and more complex than the setups but it also pays much more. From taking down some targets to stealing a plane getting deployed while your team defends you from a chopper robbing a bank etc. Good and very fun way make money.5. Tryhards.When in game mode this individuals usually have owned a lot of the stuff available to buy and start to find joy only in messing up with other players with less firepower. They kill you over and over destroy your work vehicles your cargo not only killing you but making you lose potentially dozens of thousands. I really feel to point this out because it can get very annoying but you can always switch servers.6. Cheaters/Hackers/ModdersBasically someone with a trainer that can do anything. Some are very chill and nice people tha even give you money (Note Spending modded money can get you a temporary ban and your account wiped) or hang out doing crazy stuff only possible with a trainer like spawning top tier cars and racing but others... oh my. They bug you insta kill you. destroy all your vehicles even kill multiple people using your name so everyone would think you are the hacker and more stuff i would get old naming... unfortunately this players are not uncommon on PC. Again you can switch servers but if it wasn't for Rockstar's lame anti cheat and lazy moderation this won't be such a big deal as it is now.As a quick note load screens are insanely long averaging 1.5 minutes. Understandable but not less annoying.That's about enough to know. Has flaws enough to get you mad and wonder if Rockstar spends money on improving and maintaining their games or they fully run the greedy bussines tactics other big companies do yet all that not being enough to make you want stop playing.As Mr. Ross Scott says i love the games that get you lost in their lore and make you want to play for hours and hours potentially ruining your personal life. Those are the best games.Definitely a love/hate relationship with this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-22,0,0,439,False,Recommended,"A fun story and a soild single player experience the only reason this game is a Yes recommendation. If you like GTA then it won't disappoint and a serious step up from the heavy handed seriousness and dull interpersonal management of IV. Remember the fun of Vice City? It's not quite so wild but more tightly crafted.Multiplayer isn't so hot. All the ""DLC"" that's been produced is amazingly uncreative be prepared to spend large amounts of money on ""businesses"" which require large amounts of upkeep and high risk on each job to ensure the profit from them is as slim as possible. Each new release also comes with vehicles which require even more money than the last. It all adds up to make getting money a daunting task for anyone unwilling to commit thousands of hours to the game all in a thinly veiled attempt to force incredibly poor value microtransactions on the players. It's pretty easy to tell what they care about when it seems like the only hacking they activly persue punishing is the stuff that impacts their microtransaction economy.Rampant greed aside the experience online will also vary greatly session to session. Having a few friends with you will help smooth out the gradual progress to be made just be aware that PvP is inherently encouraged by the game and going ""passive"" will severely hinder what you can do.",Grand Theft Auto V

Los Santos is bigger and livelier as ever before a truly throbbing heart and arteries of life.The main protagonists story is captivating emotional and terribly entertaining. The game carries itself and pulls you along the way and once you finished the main story and the myriad of side missions there is the online mode. Although it not as flushed out in the PC verse as in the console counterpart but it gives you hours and hours of entertainment for your buck.Buy dem shark cards people. No more cheaters.

2015-10-21,0,0,187,False,Recommended,UPDATE With everything running fine and regular content drops for GTA Online the gets a solid thumbs up and I feel a little better throwing some extra cash Rockstar's way with the shark cards. Though the in game economy is wacked if you can't group with 4 since the heists are niegh impossible to do.UPDATE Error 1000.50 has been largely resolved. I still encounter it occasionally thus making the game still a hard sell. I still feel like the game needs work in terms of FPS stability due to the content updates in order to make this an easy recommendation.As many of the other reviews explain the game is wonderful. It is the most expansive and deeply detailed world. The cars are drivable unlike IV and the gunplay makes combat enjoyable. It is the closest thing PC players will get to Red Dead Redemption on PC. Plus wioth rolling free content updates whats not to like. All in all the game is solid 8/10. IN THEORY...The problem comes with the intertextual chicanery that Rockstar forces on players. I am currently going through a bout of problems with an infamous error 1000.50 which makes the game unplayable because you are unable to load into the social club I have submitted a ticket with Rockstar and we'll see how that goes but I'm not too sure. There have been a heap of issues that kept me from even loading the game. Months after launch I can only play when the game decides I can. The fact that I expect the game to fail more times than it works makes the game a very hard sell especially with the microtransactions and the sale price adjustments. I would gladly give back the updates if only the game would run.,Grand Theft Auto V

Not much to say but its damn good. 9/10GRAPHICSMan the graphics are absolutely breath taking as you walk around the city of Los Santos and Blaine County. Whether your at the peak of Mount Chiliad at dusk or cruising around the city at midnight its stunning.10/10SOUNDIf you like music then you won't be dissapointed. The games score is pure synthwave and electric. The radio ehhh. There is a wide variety of music in the games radio system but it isnt as good as what you would listen to in GTA SA. But its much better than GTA IV's radio. The guns feel sound similar to each other and the cars sound ok. GTA V has a great sound design.8/10STORY***MAJOR SPOILERS***You play the role of three characters Franklin Michael and Crazy Trevor. Nine years before the present in GTA V there was a big heist that involved Michael Trevor and Brad. This heist was setup however and the government made a deal with Michael to wipe his criminal record clean if Brad dies. Trevor isn't informed about this till much later And tries to kill Michael for lying to Trevor. I can't tell anymore because there is alot of stuff in the main storyline to list.10/10FINAL VERDICT37/40 ING AWESOME.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-14,0,0,504,False,Not Recommended,TL DR The game is great in singleplayer and in multiplayer with a good group of friends/people but you risk being banned from online play because you left Skype running while playing and will get no communication from Rockstar and be accused of being a lying hacker by the community and it's total ing t because there isn't you can do about it because everyone insists the anti cheat is perfect and it's impossible for it to be wrong and will wish death upon you and your family for trying to insinuate otherwise.I love this game so much and that's why it pains me to give it a negative review.I preordered this game just before it came out on PC in April 2015. I managed to be among the first people into Online during the PC launch and for the first week (I was free all week) I was the highest ranking person in every lobby I joined excluding those that ported characters from the other consoles. In just 8 days I had reached level 72 in Online beaten all the online heists on Hard and owned most of the vehicles and properties I wanted. Realizing how carried away I'd gotten I stepped away for a week before returning with my other friends and continued playing at a normal pace. Two friends of mine one playing for this first time on PC that had been leveling evenly with me and another that ported a character from XBox became the GTA gurus of our group. We were all at least 20 40 levels above the rest of our friends and mainly assisted them in heists missions and other activities. These months of play were hands down the best I'd ever had in GTA until present.We slogged our way through lobbies filled with hackers both good and bad every mission and race we could get from our phone contacts and bought every single weapon in game. We even bought things we could only afford following a visit from friendly hackers. It was in these private mission lobbies and chaotic free roam lobbies that the game truly shined. Our group would team up and cut our way through hordes of enemies using rockets machine guns and armored trucks. It was something amazing and represents some of the best times I've ever had with my online buddies.Then over time people slowly drifted away for various real world reasons and I found myself the only one logging in regularly. The others busy moving with school or careers had very little time to play and chose to spend it on the games we'd all originally met in. I continued to log in frequently buying up cars and weapons as updates were released and generally just roamed empty lobbies alone exploring the map and testing my ever growing collection of high performance cars. I became a collector of vehicles for our group turning myself into the guy that could provide you with any vehicle you might need at a given moment.Then in January of 2016 I too was forced to leave the game. I joined the military and spent a long 2 months in basic training. After that it was off to techinical training for my job. While at tech school my parents drove my computer and truck to my temporary base (I was fairly close to home while in tech school). I started up my computer there and nursed the weak and unreliable wifi to the point that it was able to let me log in and resume my roaming. I couldn't play with my friends yet but it was something. After tech school I went home for a short time and built a new PC from scratch. I went onto my permanent base and GTA Online was my first priority once I got my internet set up.I began playing frequently with a military buddy of mine that had just gotten the game helping him to level up. This lasted for an entire 10 days. I was banned without warning following one of our sessions. No feedback from Rockstar on exactly why. I scoured the internet until I began finding threads saying that an update had temporarily caused the anticheat system to register overlays and programs like Skype Teamspeak and OBS to trigger hacking flags. The posts all said the issue had been patched but here it was. staring me in the face. More research led to more recent posts claiming the same thing but all these posts were denied by users saying the system was perfect and that the victims must have been cheating and were just lying. I waited out my ban like a good little player and tried again. I was again banned for no apparent reason while running only Skype and the Steam FPS counter after just 2 hours of play. That ban has also since passed but I haven't played the game yet since I fear getting a third permanent ban before the issue is fixed. Another part of me fears that the issue will never be fixed and that my time with GTA Online is over. At least until offcial support is discontinued and some guy on the internet makes a mod reviving it on his own servers.So dear reader what should take from this? In short if you want to enjoy a rich and engaging singleplayer game that will take you hours to fully complete and explore everything then buy this game. If you want to enjoy a grindy but ultimately fun and addicting open world multiplayer crime and racing simulator wait until the banning problems are fixed and buy this game. If you want to play an open world multiplayer crime and racing simulator rife with hackers screaming children (and adults) with a ludicrously unbalanced economy that requires days of non stop play just to buy one nice car then maybe buy this game anyway. Otherwise don't even bother before you end up out 500 hours of your time and your some of your real world money with all to show for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

While rockstar seems to have dropped the promised single player DLC in favor of fleshing out online ( a clear money making choice though it's hard to disagree that it's really turned into a fantastic multiplayer game) The core game stands on it's own and the online just keeps giving more and more hours of enjoyment.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-27,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,GTA V was on top of my 'the must play titles' wishlists. The only reason i give negative review for this game is because i feel like i dont bought this game for GTA V but i bought this game for GTA Online which is i dont play it so often.I'm typical and more into single player gamer and dont like multiplayer elemets with microtransactions on it. The single player/story mode is pretty much abandoned by Rockstar since they are more focusing to Online. The gameplay and story are good overall it's a solid game (on a single player perspective) but there are not many activities after you complete to main mission and it gets boring so quickly after i spend 50 hours only on single player.Buy this game if you are willing to spend your time on Online mode especually with your firends it would be so much better if you're more interested in Story mode get this only when sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-02,0,0,1086,False,Recommended,An overall great game with endless amounts of things to do it won t be hard to find yourself sinking hundreds of hours into this game. The PC port of the game is very well implemented I had no real issues with adapting to the keyboard and mouse controls after previously playing the game on Xbox 360 (you can still play it with controllers on PC anyway). The graphics look phenomenal on high settings but people with lower end PC s will still be able to enjoy the game with decent frames/performance. The next gen version of the game also has additional features that the old gen versions lack such as director mode self radio first person and increased lobby player caps (from 16 to 30). A big draw back for the PC version (and almost all PC gaming) is the hacking/modding that completely plagues the online aspects of the game. Sure sometimes it can be innocent fun however more often than not modders choose to ruin peoples play experiences and this occurs far too frequently. Rockstar do try to prevent modders but it surely will never stop happening so if you choose to purchase this game just keep in mind that cheating is very apparent in online.,Grand Theft Auto V

Okay fine... I'll just download it and reinstall it from the Rockstar site not that simple. When I attemp to install the Social Club client from the site it tells me that GTA V is not installed.

Rockstar has too many dollar signs in their eyes from the online portion of the game to further support the singleplayer portion of the game.Online is a whole nother story. Plagued with people out to ruin your experience. Not to say that you can't get into decent game with some decent people but even then the game keeps reminding you how much grinding you need to do to be able to afford the prices on the vehicles and apartments and other items. Then Rockstar comes to the rescue with their Sharkcards that conveniently let you spend your own cash to buy these cards with ingame cash on them. So thoughtful on their part.Do yourself a favor and if you want to play a game where the developer actually cares and appreciates their customers go buy Witcher 3.,Grand Theft Auto V

The people on the server were just like me trying to have fun in online with no modders or hackers. So play it at your own risk cause the second time i joined there were 2 modders spawn killing everyone. So basically if you're lucky you will spawn in a server with no modders and/or hackers.PS Make sure your PC can handle the game. Cause mine is already full and so some buildings in the game wuold vanish and i would drive but then crash in nothing until the graphics came back and i found a wall. So make sure your PC will work the game. So in conclusion Great game loved it,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-29,0,0,174,False,Recommended,Grab That Auto V also known as GTA V is a third person rpg action multiplayer shooter developed by British people who live on the Trump Underground Tower in L.A. In short this game is a TPRPGMS.It's an accurate representation of real life and the feminism political struggles that Americans face everyday.The game focuses on 2 middle aged bussiness men and a black guy. Who have existencialism problems by focusing on the quantity of money they have on their bank accounts and the lack of government involment to help.As a Sci fi Open world game citizens are willingly giving you their cars so you can avoid taxes and prove your point to the White House. The main mechanic of this game has you working as an honest temporaly accountant that works on various banks and jewelry shops across all Vice City you have to make the final cut even if the police and the managers are trying take you in jail for unkown reasons.Just kidding i was lying all along. An honest accountant? Pffftt. You have to steal as much as you can to be the perfect accountant of all Liberty City and invest all your money on the online cellphone market app.Also this has a parent simulator inside of it to activate this mode you have to register your Rockstar account and agree to the terms of service from the game after that you'll enter to GTA Online also known as Greet The Annoying kid Online.In this mode you have to find a way to keep the children out of trouble showing them how hard life is until they enter in a state of anger and frustration that leaves them no choice but to quit the game and hate adult point of views.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-26,0,0,414,False,Recommended,The campaign mode and the overworld itself is worth quite a bit of money already. Though I would not recommend this if you plan on buyiing this for the sake of online mode only. The Grand Theft Auto series was made from the ground up with singleplayer as its priority you'll notice that the world is much more interactive when you're playing as one of the protagonists of the game. That being said online isn't bad especially when you play with your friends and have certain objectives in mind. The online world offers wave after wave of modified game modes available for you to enjoy. Heists jobs and missions not only offer the players some fun challenges but they also yield decent rewards (In most cases they're money. You can use the earned money to buy various customization options and goodies.) Outside of the missions however things could get quite dull. There's a limit to how much entertainment the overworld of GTA Online could provide and the bar is relatively low. Unless you find joy in shooting up some hyper generic NPCs and often paranoid players you're better off looking somewhere else.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-11,0,0,551,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V What can I say about you that hasn't been said a million times? Well this is one that has been on my radar since I first picked it up for my PS3 and it struck a powerful chord with me. From the story to the characters to everything. I'd reccomend it to anyone getting into the GTA Scene.I will be giving my honest thoughts on both the SinglePlayer and Multiplayer Stories Characters Vehical controls Heists and Gun Play Let's get started! SinglePlayer A Story I first picked this up in the year of 2014 the same year I got my PS3 I wasn't expecting much in this game since I previously saw GTA4 Vice City and San Andreas as glitchy bug filled messes with an odd fanbase backing it. When I first plugged in and turned on my PS3 with the copy of GTA V in it as I said I wasn't expecting much then I saw how much Rockstar had put forth an effort in the first mission alone Robbing a bank in North Yankton/ Possibly our Canada. After a botched getaway Two of the three heisters are shot and presumably killed sending the third one into a blood rage slaughtering any cop in the area. After the shootout the third heister runs out of rounds and books it out of there. cut forward nine years and our supposed dead second heister Michael Desanta Formerly known as Michael Townley is now living in Sunny LS. We run into our second Character Franklin Clinton an ex gangster out doing a repo job with his ""Homie"" Lamar Davis/ LD/ Long The repo job goes off without a hitch and the cars are returned to Franklin's and Lamar's boss Simeon a person who sells cars at insanely high prices and takes them back by having either Franklin or Lamar steal it back sometimes both. A few more Repo jobs later and we find ourselves out of a job because Michael Desanta made us smash the SUV into the shop destroying the window and damaging the store significantly. Just from the first hour alone I was hooked My first playthrough I took two to three days to complete everything I could. Story 10/10 Characters From the high class criminal of Michael to the ex Gangster of Franklin to a third familiar coked up psycho none of the main cast feels cardboard or cheap. The same could be said about the side characters from the stoner Tonya to the FIB agent Dave Norton or magee Steve Haines even to face Billionare Devin Weston none of them feel two dimentional they feel like they could actually exist in the real world. Characters 10/10 Vehical Controls Playing on both console and PC for GTA V I can safely say that the PC controls are much more acurate Trying to fly a heli or plane with a controller is next to impossible. The vehicals feel like they actually have weight and force behind them even in multiplayer but i'll get to that later. Vehicals 9/10 Heists The heists in the GTA V storyline are the most fun you can have in any story from robbing a jewlery store in the rich Portion of LS to A bank job in the boonies to the biggest bank in Los Santos. The heists can show you how quickly can hit the fan and make the plans you made obsolete making the characters improvise as best they can. In my personal Opinion the Boonies heist when I first executed it turned me into a blood hungry psychopath in thick body armor carrying a chaingun/minigun. THANK GOD FOR AMERICA! AND THANK GOD FOR GTA! Heists 10/10 Gun Play I have nothing bad to say about it the Gun Play is top notch in the Story mode you lock onto enemies and gun them down with whatever you have in your hands at the moment. Though one gripe I have with the weapon wheel you have to scroll through so much before you get the weapon you want. Gun Play 8/10 Multiplayer Story For the story in GTA Online you start out with character customization from your looks to your perks. Then you fly to Los Santos if you spawn as a girl Lamar is at the airport with a rose which you throw away. He lets you into his POS car and gives you the starting pistol with very few bullets only three spare clips move buddy. After you do the job for Lamar you race him. Either you win or lose he comes back and says that Simeon will call him and speeds off. Thus ends your first day in LS. The story is all out there in GTA Online and I love it. Story 10/10 Characters Sadly Mike &amp Franklin don't make a reappearance in GTA Online but a familiar hacker does make an appreance along with our coked out friend. And That is just talking about the main Characters there are others within the game that I either loath or love one or the other. Characters 10/10 Vehical Controls The Vehical controls in GTA Online feels smooth and fast it controls very well until some ed player shoots out your tires and guns you down FOR GOD'S SAKE! OFF! Vehical Controls 6/10 Heists The heists in GTA online are good but you have to deal with Randos coming in and randomly dropping unless you have friends who play the game as much as you do which I do not. Heists 6/10 Gun Play The Gun Play seems the same as the singleplayer but you have players that gun you down for no reason and KD Warriors that kill themselves because they don't want a player to ruin their KD. Hackers that run amok killing players getting work done. 5/10Full score 74/100 Grade B A good game for singleplayer but multiplayer needs some tweeks and some work.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-28,0,0,784,False,Recommended,One of the best games ever made as far as I'm concerned. Too bad they've ruined the online experience by injecting micro transaction junk and a new DLC that is complettely out of place. Cars and aircraft still have no real purpose for the most part and Rockstar/T2 have failed to deal with the issue of hackers/modders. In fact they seem to support hacking/modding in the sense that they know both are out of control yet they require that DLC content is played in public lobbies full of these people. The single player game is still worth playing and GTA Online is worth a bit of play but I caution players to avoid getting caught in the grind trap and falling out of love with what once was an excellent online game.,Grand Theft Auto V

It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.,Grand Theft Auto V

Lots of side quests and random encounters with very interesting funny dialodges won't be feeling repetative at all. Each playable character with detailed background and development. Players will like them more as the game progress. Good endings based on player's choice.Story Mode Cons Very few heists in the story mode and only available based on story progression. You will only get rich at the end of the game in which in kinda meaningless. Very few attires acessories cars and hairstyles selection in story mode.Story Mode Overall One of the best game of the year. Worth to play and spend time for the story.Online Mode Pro It's free! A lot of heists good story progression. A lot of attires acessories cars and hairstylesOnline Mode Con Time consuming. You have to WAIT LONG just to enter a session quit a session join a heist and the heist fail if 1 player quit then wait to enter another session. IT'S ALL WAITING ONLY. Many idiots Weapons and cars unlocked based on player level unless you willing to spend real cash.Online Mode Overall Would recomend you find friends of 4 and enter a private session.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-12,0,0,228,False,Recommended,"Much as I love this game. It is unfortunately a modders heaven right now. Between Rockstar being unable to keep up with the high volume of injection mods and ever changing scripts. And their unwillingness to drop the ridiculous prices of in game content and shark cards. Your garanteed to have ""AT LEAST""..... Can't emphasise that enough. One game breaking modder In any given lobby. Now that being said there are plenty of things you can do that keep you out of lobbies like that and you can even search out new lobbies that have little to no people in them. I've seen it like night and day some lobbies are chill and have a full roster. And others are not so tame and they only have a few people in them. Just the luck of the draw. Invite only lobbies are also always a thing. Not to mention you can interupt your connection breifly through your resource monitor and have a lobby all to yourself. But there's no telling how long that last could be an hour or more could be 15 min or less. All in all this game is still very worth it's $60 pricetag. You can still have a blast doing whatever your heart desires On the SP campaign and the ever challenging online aspect. So to be fair despite all the nonsense taking place right now. I'd give the game an 8.5/10. There is much that can improve but in terms of what is already possible. It really isnt that much that needs it. I do recommend this game. I have had it since release on my 360 way back when and still continue to play it as if it is still something fresh.",Grand Theft Auto V

With the new updates people have become more aggressive which is the complete opposite of who I amI got on this game to have fun not get repeatedly killed by vehicles which ranged from 2 6 million like wtf some people might enjoy this kind of stuff but now rockstar basically just cater for those players and none of their other playersNow to my main argument I enjoyed playing on PC whilst I had no friends as of that time I made do with what I hadAll of a sudden my game started crashing on launch (yes I can run it I can get 60 100 fps on Max)ive been trying to solve this problem for months going to rockstar support who were completely and utterly useless aswell as consulting with other players who had the same issue.In its current state I am no longer able to play this game on PC and my whole gta play experienced has been tarnished by lazy devs and useless supportWho knows maybe they will fix this one day but from what ive seen I will never be playing another rockstar title on PC ever againThis is disgraceful and I can't believe that rockstar wont listen to their fans problems with and about this game,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-24,0,0,237,False,Recommended,This game succeeds at what it strives to accomplish it has a strong story that most would call the best in the series which is then complemented by solid gunplay and driving. The story was strong enough the catch my interest and keep me going even through tedious and formulaic missions.Aside from main missions it has competent side stories that mostly follow the same formula that the main missions would have this being to kill follow or chase a person through Los Santos it does throw in a few collectibles that directly tie into missions one being where you have to collect several spaceship parts for some guy that lives in the middle of nowhere.This game isn't only a single player experience though most of its players lurk within the online where the developers constantly add content to their almost 5 year old game. Most servers are almost full (at least at the time of writing this) and the community is active.This game is packed full of content both offline and online. It's a decent story and expansive open world complemented by its ever expanding online scene has made it well worth the price of admission.,Grand Theft Auto V

T2's attacks on modding teams which while it has been going on for a while finally culminated to a C&amp D sent to OpenIV just so they can keep on exploiting GTA Online players into buying shark cards.Only buy this game if you're in it just for the story mode and you can look past all this but even then I'm hesitant to say that because it would probably further encourage them to continue with their disgusting business practices.Update Despite T2 rethinking their decision I'm still setting this as ""Not Recommended"" they need to learn their lesson by making this a permanent blemish on their track record.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,628,False,Recommended,Bought the game on day one for Xbox 360. Purchased the PC version at launch. Had a blast playing GTA Online for hundreds upon hundreds of hours. LSPDFR a modification for GTA 5 allowing you to play as a police officer added another few hundred hours of gameplay for me and thousands of other users. 3rd party multiplayer boosted the game in popularity by the thousands becoming a phenomenom on live streaming sites where the game towered with tens of thousands of viewers rivaling top streamed games such as Counter Strike and Overwatch. At one point even DOTA 2 and PUBG.Until Take Two has a radical change of opinion towards modding then I will not recommend GTA 5 or future Take Two games. Neither will I purchase future games published or developed by Take Two.Update Take Two Interactive and Rockstar has since the general community backlash retracted their cease and desist demand against the developers of OpenIV and has had a positive change of opinion towards singleplayer modding.

2015-08-17,0,0,513,False,Recommended,"The state of GTA O has improved but still has some of the issues that have plagued it from day one.It seems like this game is becoming more of a pay to win game rather than a ""pay to have luxuries"" game. You can easily purchase million dollar (that is if you can afford it) vehicles that have weapons in them and set them as your personal vehicle to shred through players. This used to not be the case you had to order the weaponized vehicles SPECIFICALLY by calling a contact on your phone or using the menu. Now you can just store them in your garage and people who can't afford to take it down are screwed.You can pay to research and get OP attachments scopes etc. for your guns. I got a thermal scope which is extremely unfair as it is literally wallhacks but ""legal"" wallhacks. I can see players through walls before they can see me. And it doesn't put me at a disadvantage because it replaces the regular scope or anything I can easily turn it on and off.I can research an EXTREMELY armored suit that can take many hits before I die. Given a minigun or any other heavy weapon I am basically unkillable. Hate cops? Don't worry shell out a few thousand and cops will ignore any crimes your organization commit allowing you to wreak havoc everywhere you go without any risk.Rockstar continues to try and roll out Shark Cards encouraging people to pay for them and whatnot including the new start money for business and enterprise $10m for around $50. Which is absolutely nothing you'll get at most like 5 cars that is if you don't fully mod them. Or 1 yacht. Wanna fully upgrade businesses bunkers etc? Good luck! $10m sounds like a lot but is basically nothing in GTA O right now.tl dr Everything is overpriced money wins every time. Pay2Win in some areas.I'm only giving this game a positive review because it is fun and many issues have been fixed and polished out. In no way do I support the scummy practices the developers have fallen for but I appreciate the hard work and effort putting into making all types of fun unique vehicles It really makes every experience with this game unique and endless.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-28,0,0,211,False,Recommended,First off this game will be fun as hell if you have friends. But the misery kicks in when things cost literally a fortune to buy. Missions payout is low adversary modes get boring after a while. Heists are too hard for new players. In my opinion that's not how you should approach the game.I think dev should change mission reward system. The reward should be constant regardless the time. Some vehicle (super cars planes ...) and offices bunkers hangars facilities need reasonable price tags too. CEO and MC payout sure need to be increased.In the end I know the devs don't even bother to look at customer reviews. But if you do well that's my two cents. Other than that this game is so good despite being a 5 year title,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-27,0,0,344,False,Not Recommended,"What a mess! Let me describe feel of the game for you all it feels like the game was made by seperate groups and then someone just took a duct tape and patched everything together. Your experience is going to be highly unstable where somethings work fine and others don't for no reason. The game looks nice but when you get down to it it feels very cheap and unpolished. There is a new trend on youtube called ""Rstar logic"" it's because there aren't many things that make sense! people who've been playing this game know what I mean otherwise this is just my take.Rstart has turned GTA into a heavily moditised battlefield with flying cars and tanks. The only way to play in peace when in freemode is to create an empty public lobby. GTA V is home to many many modders(hacker) which are continiously ruining everyone's game. prices of in game items have been increased a lot! that is huge problem where money grinding sources are giiving you the same amount as before. Why? sharkcards that's why. The COOP missions are extremly half arsed except for the last heist (dooms day) if you are looking for an exceptional COOP experience with your frinds then I'd say there are better games out there.",Grand Theft Auto V

For me somebody that s nice creative and friendly has not a chance to use the software as it is. I cant do anything as I get killed all the time.You have bane friends for no reason too. Have a little respect. Amazing game. Shame about the limitation on playing with friends. We need rockstar to go away now. There method of game making has taken its toll.

2015-06-19,0,0,187,False,Recommended,Keep in mind this game first of all need to be rated on the Singleplayer front since this always has been a singleplayer game for the most part but the online part is nice as well I just wish there would be fewer hackers as it is and well really only played the online part briefly as it is and the online part is also the only part I would rate this game 1 point down from 10 stars also being able to make money a little faster would be nice.If you are or have bought this game solely for the multiplayer part of the game you will be disappointed as all the fun happen in singleplayer and is well worth your bucks spendt on getting it if you are a GTA fan.GTAV pretty much offers everything from any of the previous GTA's but better what I am missing a bit though is more programs on the TV sets but in general the gameplay and so on and so forth reflect alot of the GTA's for an instance the skill system is partly back as well which is not bad missing the options to have girl friends in the game though but it is a 3 way game and might prove difficult likewise hanging out with friends sort of am a bit flat.Both Martin Franklin and Trevor both have some awesome traits... and well it is somewhat mocking the todays community as well in various ways making it a fun piece of satire as well when going through it.One thing I am missing though is actual difficulty once on certain missions and more it seem like there is none and is somewhat watered down to the general games that come from the console generation making it in general ultra easy in many ways it is not the 3 different modes that the characters that is the problem though it is a cool feature seen in a few other games as well but well you guys probably get it if played the game.Overall though I would say that this game is defineately worth a buy also you get alot of entertainment and fun in between as well as Rockstar always surprices it is one of the few games series that never became to ruined as for sticking to in general what it is about.Storymode Pros Awesome GFX Awesome music Awesome story Awesome gameplay Awesome huge world.Cons The difficulty especially for PC users would need a few more levels of choice so we are not stuck on the console version also a few things did not port to well over from the console port.GTA Online Pros Alot of things to do be able to live like a kingpin a choice in what one want to do.Cons Hackers seem to be a problem very repetetative and it can get very grinding alike and different oddities that it is difficult to account against.all and all coming together I would rate this game 10 out of 10 stars for the storymode and more like 6 7 out of 10 stars for multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

Jaw dropping graphics entertaining &amp well written storyline humorous characters &amp dialogue and tons of replayability. I haven't touched the other titles in my library since I became intent on beating the single player mode and I still haven't bothered playing any other games besides GTA 5 because of its myriad side missions and the pure fun from free roaming the GIANT map.Highly recommended game. BUY IT.Note I am reviewing this game based on the Story Mode (single player) only I have very little experience playing GTA5 Online and frankly couldn't care much less about that part of the game anyway.Addtl note I can run this title on ""Very High"" settings at a steady 60 FPS on a 1440p monitor with an overclocked Intel Core i5 a GTX 1070 (slightly overlocked as well) and 16GB of RAM. The graphics settings are exhaustably customizable though so I'm sure you can get decent results with better/worse hardware.",Grand Theft Auto V

My only dislike is severe desync online and the severe amount of modders online. This problem is growing but they are doing slow paced moderation on the modders. Then other thing is vehicle insurance issue in this game. The issue for example if a player drives up to you trying to kill you and you blow up thier vehicle you have to pay a deductable on that vehicle which is outragous. So you basically get penalized for defending yourself and it can cost you up to 30k on some vehicles. The logic and design of this system is bad and makes no sense.

Multiple players have spent hundreds even thousands of hours playing Online and unlocking items and upgrades for their character only for that character to be permanently terminated once they encounter a player with modding capabilites.Cheat detection is completely and utterly broken yet Rockstar has consistently failed in fixing this aspect of their game. And with the amount of copies that Grand Theft Auto V has sold it almost seems impossible for Rockstar to reach out to the players that have been wrongly affected and restore their deleted characters.The worst part is I've only covered one aspect of Online's seemingly never ending list of problems. If I were to cover every single issue that still exists in the game today this review would take an additional 1 2 hours to read.In conclusion I would only purchase this game for the intent of playing the campaign. Do not waste your time with Online. And if you don't believe me just read the other negative reviews. You'll see why.3/10. /,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar did clear out many of the hackers and I was able to fix most of my preformance issues by uninstalling GeForce Experience entirely. There are however still many issues with the PC port of this game so buy this at your own risk. I ran it buttery smooth at 30fps locked on a GTX 750ti but when I upgraded to a GTX 1060 SSC the gameplay adopted serious stuttering issues. Edit + Rant is over.Unplayable.

GTA is the way to go. This most recent venture into the GTA world is outstanding. The storylines are great. The online portion of the game is immersive and is overall a great time if you can get a few friends together.One complaint. So far Rockstar seems to have neglected finding or creating a solid anti cheat for their multiplayer component. At any given time a modder will rain down millions of dollars on your character or simply spawn a submarine on your head. It can get fairly annoying and is one of the primary reasons that I no longer venture into the online portion of the game.10/10 single player experience7/10 multiplayer experience,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,0,0,348,False,Not Recommended,"Do not buy this game. In game reasons why you should not buy this game. The singleplayer while good has yet to recieve any new content since this game's original release on 360 and PS3. The multiplayer is a grindfest unless you buy shark cards. For some of the stuff it gets as bad as mobile free to play games. The multiplayer features loading screens that can take 5 10 minutes or more. This has been a problem since the title launched. The multiplayer while recieving content updates regularly has the content priced in such a way that feeds back into the grindfest. There is simply no way to make the cash in a reasonable timeframe without shark cards. The multiplayer lobby system is crap. People have reported joining a lobby as a group and then when the game ends after waiting for 15 minutes in a loading screen they get dropped into seperate instances.Out of game reasons why you should not buy this game. Take Two (the parent company of Rockstar) has nuked singleplayer modding on this title and on GTAIV. Take Two's CEO believes that even with all of the money they make from shark cards and from the repeat sales of this title they are ""convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetising on a per user basis"" Speaking of game sales there was also the first time GTAV went on Summer sale and they decided to remove the base version of the game and instead offer ""discounted"" versions of the game that came with shark cards with the lowest tier coming to the full price of the base game.",Grand Theft Auto V

Their shark cards are super overpriced (if you wanted 2 billion you could just pay 3$ for a hacker)bottom line is that they've made the game way too expensive prompting people to buy shark cards and grind missionsThe final thing i dont like is how the Associates get paid once you've completed a CEO task. The CEO can be paid upwards of 800K on a selling run but the associates can only make 35k (if you're in a Motorcycle Club base pay for CEO stuff is 10k) Making it a chore for your friends to do CEO work with you because they get paid their weight in salt.I think GTA V Online had a lot of potential sadly it's too far in it's development to fix everything wrong with it (Rockstar is just greedy) the game itself is so much fun and so glitchy that i have fun no matter what.It's a great game i just think rockstar needs to chill with this whole spending 800 million dollars for one thing I would be fine with buying shark cards if they had REASONABLE cash grabs but it's 100$ US to get 8 MILLION DOLLARS IN GAME.if they increased the money given from shark cards and made everything give more money in general the game would imo be revived. currently it has such a little player base that you'd need to wait 30 minutes to get one Random Person in your lobby only for them to leave.Story is good you already know that.Story 8.5/10Online 7/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-11,0,0,1187,False,Not Recommended,When I first bought this game I loved and played the singleplayer. The singleplayer component of the game is really fun and I want to say would be worth it alone.Unfortunately for this game there's the online and arguably more popular portion of it.Let's start with the most recent case of horridness. From all the reviews I've been seeing on the store page here a lot of people have been getting legitimately earned money taken from them with no explanation and Rockstar ignoring any support tickets sent to them about the issue. While I haven't had any issues with this myself I can completely believe that this is happening given how little Rockstar seems to care about the game outside of the money it generates for them combined with the other bad design decisions they have done for the game.Which brings me to my next point. This game really just seems to be little more to Rockstar than a cashgrab and it really shows. Almost all of the newer DLCs that come out are extremely pricey (It takes about $100 to get the most expensive yacht for instance) and requires several hours of grinding to get even just a few of the items that come out each update. Most of the missions and jobs in GTA Online pay out very little given how much you need for most of the items and playing heists with randoms is about as painful as getting your teeth pulled between how long it can take to get 4 people to start the heist only to have your teammates either die repeatedly or them ending up rage quitting. Also doing CEO/MC sale missions in public sessions full of people? Forget it. They'll easily be able to blow up your cargo in most cases you can't really do much about it if they do manage to blow your cargo up you will get nothing out of it and lose all the money you put into getting the crates.Speaking of other players the game is also littered with modders. So many of them to the point where it's insulting that this is considered a $60 AAA game.I am still unconvinced that they did NOT do this all (losing the legit funds seems like gross incompetence though) in order to promote the sales of sharkcards. Why bother making the game actually fun to play and pay out fairly when you could just pay Rockstar a good sum of money to just bypass all of that? Heck even the Take Two president came out a few months ago and basically said that GTA V is UNDERmonetized.Lastly a more minor complaint of mine and a few others the AI seems ridiculous at times with near aimbot level aim. Sure that police officer just hit me 3 times killing me while both of us are speeding in vehicles fine sure...whatever.All in all a good and fun game that had severe promise and even several decent things about it ruined by awful business practices and awful designs. I would highly recommend against playing the online even if you buy it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-05,0,0,181,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto is a past time of mine I relish and truly enjoy. This is another in the series I thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend this game to anyone. It has most aspects any game can possess leaving you with a ton of replay value and a reason to continue playing well beyond the end of the story and online regardless of your rank. I own both this version and the PS3 copy and I admit that the next generation versions are far superior. I love the new passive mode graphics manipulation first person new cars and all of the other additions. I've had many problems with this game in the past several years of owning it but I always come back in the end.As I stated above I've encountered some issues in the past several years within this game between the two versions of the game I posses. Online servers always have been very weak and easily disrupted leading to MANY disconnections lag issues and other problems. There have also been numerous missed opportunities for Rockstar to cash in on but they seem to have avoided what customers often desire. The censorship has been a confusing problem being that this is a game meant for an older audience and has led to plenty of pointless problems. You would think that in a game filled with violence drugs crime sexual themes and other adult themes there would be less censorship. Of course lastly I must include Rockstar's ability to overlook pressing issues and succeed at fixing small bugs and attacking their own fanbase for silly reasons in an attempt to uphold something I have yet to quite understand.Anyway aside from the problems this is a VERY solid game. Rockstar knows how to make a Grand Theft Auto game even though sometimes they come to disappoint in a multitude of aspects ranging from their quality control to how they please their fans and audiences. Buy this game and I am sure you will be very happy with your decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

I had to put Vsync on 'adaptive half rate' though this really doesn't bother me at all! From then i have spent countless more hours on the game both online and offline with no lag what so ever and even with the graphics on very high including maxe reflections grass water and shadows.

2017-06-17,0,0,619,False,Not Recommended,Edit As promised I have edited my review as Rockstar have joined talks with OpenIV and allow development to continue while they target other sources of cheats and mods for Online only. I do recommend the game but we wary it can get dull fast if you dont have some friends to tag along with Online. The Online section is a hellhole where each update is painstakingly designed to be overpriced and encourage the overpriced sales of their Sharkcards to actually get anything without an excessive amount of grinding to earn enough money to set up a business to earn some money back. The single player is really enjoyable however. Its really well paced and will keep you going for a long time. Unfortunately the single player has been put through a blender to filter out everything fun in the form of BANNING one of the top modding tools OpenIV. Without it there is very little you can really do. No new vehicles or textures. As well as all the youtube machinas that will be unable to make new content. The worst part is that Take Two have banned OpenIV in the name of stopping cheating online which OpenIV has nothing to do with in the slightest.Until the ridiculous measures Take Two have taken are reversed or adjusted ill be keeping this review negative Forget it returning to negative review. yet another Online update for masses of vehicles and planes which require further things such as hangars in order to buy in the first place. I can let it slide if it were cheap but its not. At this point I cant be bothered with even more grinding to get something new without paying for a shark card,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-15,0,0,394,False,Recommended,Update! my review is now out of date they fixed the hackers and modders problem. A bunch of people aren't to happy about this because they cannot use singleplayer mods. Personaly. i'm just glad i don't have to worry about getting banned outa nowhere and i'm glad it's fixed. Rip mods but online is lit. this game is now a 100% worth it even if it is a little pay to win. A lot of the updates leading up to Doomsday have really made the gap between casual players and those who pay money/sell their souls to dat grind is much bigger and more fustrating. Back about a year ago when you joined and online session you way encounter a guy with a tank going on a massive rampage but it was one guy and you could avoid him easily. Now half the player base has a flying missle lauching death moblie and you can easliy get gang banged by 5 guys using tanks flying bikes or flying cars.(Everything in this damn game shots missles and flys). The wrost part is that you can get to a point where you can't call a vehicle and gtfo in time. Gta 5 is a game about Capitialism and you need to change your tactics to have fun and surive. I would HIGHLY recomend getting any armoured car such as the duke o death to help you in your heisting. Missles and jetpacks are the new meta and i don't think that will change.How to Avoid the Ban WaveSo you are considering buying gta 5 on pc? Great! but you will need some steps to play online. if you do story ur fine. people in these reviews talk about hackers and getting banned for no reason it's not joke. people i know have joined lobbies to instantly get 4.5mil and have to contact rockstar to avoid a ban. so here is what you do. 1. Get some friends to play the game with you2. launch singleplayer3. go to online4. play online 5. start friends only lobbythe goal here is to avoid public lobbies at ALL COSTS. if you do join one watch the chat to see if anyone is asking for money items calling hacks or any other indication of a cheater being present. i'd guess that there is a cheater in every 6 lobbies. whatever you do GTFO of that lobby as soon as possible! Leave the second you can or alt f4 on the loading screen. you are not safe anywhere. you run the risk of being placed in an open lobby mainly after quiting a job.This is one of my favorite games but you must be careful.

Unfortunately there seems to be quiet a few problems since PC release with variety of systems... Personally I have massive frame drops where the game becomes unplayable (system is up to recommended specs) so I've put off playing further until more problems are resolved. On that note if you can't wait to play the story mode and have a PS go that route. If you don't have a PS and have lots of cash then keep upgrading your system until you get decent FPS. If you don't have money to blow ... sit back and wait for more patches. Unless you get lucky and things go smooth for you! After a week of replacing hard drives OC cpu OC gpu replacing RAM to higher frequency and better parity better monitor with 1ms response.. I'm left with either upgrading CPU and GPU higher (even though both are above recommended specs).

People also has advantage being coward which they can switch to passive mode after picking a fight with other people. Should give a cooldown time or something after killing another player before switching to passive mode. Recommended game for people who like co op heist game.,Grand Theft Auto V

They are the protagonists of GTA V the new jewel of Rockstar. The series re sets a quality standard not only for the sandbox but for the entire generation and crowns it as the best title for PS3 and Xbox 360. The Saints are ... bigger words.

There is so much to do for completionists. I recommend this game to anyone who loves storyline and a doesn't mind a little RPG aspect.The GTA Online part is when the game starts to get really fun. I'm not sure how enjoyable this game is when you play alone but I have a ridiculous amount of fun when I play online with friends. There are so many different things to do. You can mess around and kill random people or steal cars and planes or helicopters. Or you can play some mini games where you either race or shoot eachother or both. Then there're the heists. This is when you get together with other people to accomplish multiple missions to complete a goal. You designate each person to a role and each person fulfills that role in order for the mission to run smoothly. Sometimes it gets complicated which is fun.This game is super fun especially when you have friends to play with.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-01,0,0,673,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is a awesome game that has happen ruined.This game had alot less grinding before and alot less of the sci fi sh*t. The game has a very good storymode its somewhat long and pretty good characters some cool missions. You can even get mods to make it better. The games atmosphere is very good (graphics background noise &amp music attention to detail views houses/map in general even civilians/ai are good) Online now this i am not sure what to say about however one thing is clear atleast to me online was alot better few years ago. Much less grinding &amp the missions/heists felt more fun back then. Nowdays its way to much grind &amp almost all the new updates have basically same moneymaking methods (however not the doomsday heist update it was fun first few times playing) Also before there was alot less paywalls i will not go into detail in that but paywalls are complete bs. Otherwise online is pretty fun like racing buying new cars doing missions with friends etc.Something id like to mention is the controls some controls like flying vehicles submarines etc have very weird controls. You will get used to them in time though. I also really like racing its quite fun still.My list of ""downsides"" to this game Loading screens To even get into the game you will sit 2 3min in a loading screen and theres alot of loading screens and all of them really long. Also alot of weird cutscenes. GTA V online Paywalls You want to buy 1.5 vehicle? Well f**k you you need to buy this facility for 2 million first. Also most of the vehicles you buy are severly underpowered and you end up wasting 2 million on some garbage thing.Combat system against AI is allright but against player a nightmare D Sync bullets not damaging when hitting directly and the BS amount of damage you can take u can take when you have the skill ""100 health"" (takes like 5 ak shots to kill a player)And of course i havent mentioned hackers you will encounter them. They can take your money trap you inside items teleport you kill you. Basically anything they want. Other i do not at all like some of the things added in doomsday the stuff is way to futuristic. Clones jetpacks flying cars etc. I prefer being semi realisitc than sh*t like this. Theres alot of things i also dislike about this game but the review will be to long if i wrote everything.Ratings in my opinion Storymode 8.5/10Online 6.5/10Physics 7/10Combat 6/10Graphics 8/10Atmosphere 9/10Map 9/10TLDR Campaign/storymode is awesome graphics/ atmosphere is great online fun but to grindy. Your first 100h hours of this game will be great but then it goes downhill. If u want GTA V buy on sale. Not sure if to recommend or not.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,232,False,Not Recommended,"This is a very large game with a lot of features so I'll split into 4 sections. Pros and cons for GTA V and Online respectively.edit now that i am sane i am no longer going to add points for things that are expected of every game.GTA V (Offline)Pros 1. You get excellent graphics (maybe depending on if you can afford it). (+2)2. The story is definitely better than GTA IV so expect a little more fun out of that. (+2)EDIT Emphasis on ""a little""EDIT2 subtracting 3 points for lack of bowling cousins3. You can replay any mission at (almost) any time. Good for those going for 100%. (+5)After all everyone actually enjoys the gta missions and nobody sees them as obstacles to enjoyment.4. Wide selection of vehicles from a blimp to a golf cart. (+4)EDIT Selection of vehicles is actually more like this joke vehicles air vehicles air vehicles2 cars nicer cars less nice cars expensive cars bikes mopeds thats all folksCons 1. Excellent graphics also means you'll need high end equipment to play it. It's also poorly optimized so it almost feels like it was made to sell graphics cards. ( 3) (now 0)EDIT null and void. I gained administrator access on one of my school's computers and it ran this game just fine at minimum settings.2. The story is written better but it actually feels like a recycled GTA IV with slightly improved graphics and a different map and a small assortment of other features. ( 5)EDIT Confirmed. a GTA IV mod exists to convert it to GTA V.3. The mission rating system is a perfectionist's nightmare. ( 4)4. The wide selection of vehicles is nice but obtaining them proves very difficult. There's also many things that are overpriced such as car modifications. ( 6)EDIT not a concern. The new concern is losing your damn car after having it for 45 ing seconds because you got out and then someone ran you over. You cannot keep purchased cars except in garages.5. It's massive. It could easily be better compressed but it's not. So expect to budget as much as 100GB for this game. ( 5)6*. On some GPUs the game refuses to start requiring you to start the game with integrated graphics instead. ( 1)5. Controls are somewhat intuitive and easy to learn but the settings in the game are poorly organized. For example I cannot check what key swims upwards so I have to keep drowning myself trying to figure out which one it is. ( 2)edit moved this to consI used to think it was a solid addition to the gta series now I find it is not just identical to gta4 but actually it is inferior. (+13/ 23)If you're not playing with friends and not doing a youtube series you'll stop enjoying this game after around 40 hours.GTA OnlinePros 1. Play with people around the world 'nuff said. (+6)2. Private servers for just you and your friends (+5)EDIT The reason this scored so highly is because nobody has to host it. Rockstar takes care of that. It IS a pain to set up though.3. Heists and vehicles that you can keep as well as a somewhat efficient heist management system. (+10)EDIT the vehicle system on GTA V online is way better than the singleplayer version. Rockstar's team is just too busy watching the sales to add any decent upgrades to singleplayer.Cons 1. Performance. This is an online game so I expect to lose some frames but dropping from 45fps to 15fps sometimes fluctating up to 20 gets very annoying very quickly. ( 6)2. It will randomly crash your entire game requiring a restart. This is usually during a mission. ( 6)3. Poor security. There is almost no cheat protection on any of the servers so hackers very easily give themselves unlimited health and money in online mode. ( 9)EDIT You are more likely to be banned if you are NOT cheating than if you are.4. Poor community. This could easily be fixed by implenting some sort of kick/ban system so why not add it? ( 2)I would treat the online mode as more of a bonus and not as a reason to buy it.(+21/ 23)EDIT It's a dark day when GTA Online is worse than the main game.All in all I wouldn't reccomend it except on sale. Most of the issues I listed are fixable. This game doesn't feel very finished. While graphically impressive it technically is not. $60 is too much to pay for an unfinished game. If I could do it all again I'd pay no more than $20 for this piece of with a nice tie.*Only mobile GPUs (laptops) experience this and there is a workaround though it is very tedious.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-25,0,0,151,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Grand Theft Auto Five surprisingly blew my expectations out if the water. The game is visually stunning and it has some of the best graphics I have ever seen in any game period. Gameplay for the most part is smooth and flows nicely it can get a little choppy if you are driving really fast but definitely an improvement from past GTA s. The game has a strong main story line a large diverse map to explore and of course there are tons of side missions and other things to keep you entertained for hours on end.I really enjoy the plot In GTA five it is broken into three main characters with their own stories missions and abilities that all tie in nicely together to create the main plot. Which is different from past GTA s where you are restricted to just one character which can make the story line get repetitive or boring after playing for a while. I personally love the idea of having three characters to choose from it makes the plot more complex and much more fun. If you are struggling with a mission or just want to go somewhere else you can just change your character and do something completely different. Not to mention on some missions when you are together you can change between them to help your characters out.I cannot say enough about the visual improvements of GTA V which were much needed from the previous games. The developers did an outstanding job capturing all the small details on everything from the mannerisms of the random people on the streets the vehicles and even nature. They also added a new feature that lets you change the camera to play in first person which I think makes it even more realistic compared to the third person view and helps bring more of the details to life. However driving in the first person view is quite challenging due to the fact that you can t see your surroundings as well.There is also large online multiplayer games that you can participate in which is also fun. I have not spent that much time on the multilayer platform because I enjoy the single player story so much but it is a different and good way to change the game up a little bit.Overall I believe this game is a must have you will not be disappointed. The main story is great and like all past GTA games there is a lot to keep you occupied. You can create your own fun outside of the main plot and go off and explore the huge map as well as cause chaos,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-09-14,0,0,205,False,Recommended,GTA V is a game that runs pretty well. It looks great when run on Very High. On normal it looks OK. Gameplay is fairly standard to the GTA series. The online aspect is....not as immersive as the single player and a few clothing options found in single player are not found in multiplayer for whatever reason. And you kinda have to hope that you dont run into one of the million modders in the game (myself included). If you so much as recieve one dollar from modded characters you will be blacklisted and be forced into modder heavy servers where almost everyone will be either in god mode or aim bots. Good luck,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-14,0,0,442,False,Recommended,I thought by GTA V i would be over Grand Theft Auto but bought it since the reviews were still overall quite good despite the shady pricing shizzle during the sale and the online trouble with hackers. I was very pleased. It has great new additions to the game making it an awesome game if not seemingly an all new original experience. If you dont mind spending the money on a great game then this will be a great addtion to your library. Being able to play and switch between three characters any time save for certain missions really is the best part and does nothing to bog the game down or make it feel like a grind if like me anyone is hesitant on that part. It really actually is the icing on cake.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-06,0,0,40,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is has an awesome and fairly expansive single player experience. The online componenet however is one of the most fun and at the same time frustrating games I have ever played. Loading into a server is painstakingly slow at times and getting into the same server as a friend can take upwards of 20 30 minutes. Then trying to find an active playlist (race deathmatch etc.) that has more than 4 players can take twice as long on an average day. The single worst problem with GTA V Online is the rampant hacking/modding community. In the last week alone I've had my game crash four times due to a hacker/modder and thats the least anoying part about them. Worst case scenario you get stuck being transported along with every other player in the server to some location being stripped (temporarily) of your weapons and being forced to do random acts (meelee mosh pits sitting on the ground while the modder repeatedly runs you over with a tank etc.) or face being continuously blown up or transported several thousand feet into the air without a parachute to fall for endless minutes to you death. I love GTA V Online but the hacking/modding community has infested the game like a cancer rendering it utterly playless at times.,Grand Theft Auto V

Just download the latest drivers (which I forgot) and the game will run perfectly with just a mediocre computer. GTA Online allows up to 30 players and doesn't lag at all (if the players are in the same part of the world still not that laggy). GTA V is a must buy and everyone with a decent PC should get it. The graphics and overall gameplay is massively upgraded from the consoles including animations textures particles depth of field motion blur shadows reflections cars and pedestrian density and animals just to name a few.

2018-08-27,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,As fun as this game could be im giving it a thumbs down for numerous reasons. One being the fact that modders are still a big problem. I get tired of joining an online game just to keep getting killed on spawn/random items being teleported on me. The online community is toxic Starting off at lvl. 1 you get killed over and over by level 200+ just to boost their ego. Money is a big issue for this game. It takes way to long to get money and im not paying real money for fake money. I did buy the criminal minds starter pack to see if I could get a start on getting some money but having to deal with lvl 200 400+ constantly killing me at lvl 5 etc. Its near impossible to get any supplies to make money. On top of that the supplie and product ratio are god awful. Not to mention losing 20 000$ every 20 minutes to pay the associate/property fees is rediculous.

2017-06-15,0,0,393,False,Not Recommended,EDIT ROCKSTAR HAS SEEMINGLY STOPPED MESSING WITH OpenIV SO IGNORE THE PART ABOUT THEIR STANCE ON MODDINGTo start the single player story is pretty damn good. It took me roughly 50 hours to complete playing mostly the main story.The rest of my time spent in this game was either on modding the singleplayer or in GTA Online split about half and half.The online play is a pile of Don't get me wrong the heists can be fun but only if you have 4 friends to play it with because the other online players will not play well enough to complete it or they will end up disconnecting in the middle and that's if you manage to get started in the first place. Most of the nice vehicle houses and almost all of the DLC content costs $1M $2M per item which would be fine if you could get that much money in a reasonable amount of time. Some of the higher income things you can grind will get you just over $100K an hour. This is all an attempt to force you into buying in game currency through micro transactions.Another major issue with the online is hackers and even worse is how rockstar has decided to handle them. Often hackers will just grief the entire lobby killing everyone instantly over and over again. But sometimes they can go as far as taking all your money out of your bank account wasting all the time you just spent grinding to get it. Hackers will often also spawn money for them and maybe even for others in the lobby which would be nice if rockstar didn't ban anyone who recieved hacked money. So a hacker could give you millions of dollars of in game currency against your will and your account will be banned from the online indefinitely.Now modding.The modding community was great. Lots of fantastic mods that added new maps new weapons new clothes new ways to play and reskinned cars.Recently as of writing this review Take Two the publisher behind the GTA series has sent a cease and desist to the developers of one tool that was crucial to the modding scene OpenIV. OpenIV allowed you to access the games files to modify them and add new ones a feature that was core to most mods. In the cease and desist Take Two said that any bypassing of their security and modifications of the game files was agains the terms and was illegal. They just killed the entire modding scene.Overall this game had a ton of potential to be amazing but rockstar and Take Two ruined it. All the game has going for it is a good singleplayer story mode and nothing else that's enjoyable. I wouldnt recommend this game solely because of rockstar's and Take Two's total and complete disregard towards their customers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,0,0,96,False,Recommended,In GTA V you play as 3 characters Michael Franklin and Trevor. All of them have vices in their own way but you grow attached to them nonetheless. Massive open world environment with plenty of things to do even off mission. You can go parachuting you can spend the whole night at a strip club you can play golf tennis go swimming get eaten by sharks discover random objects underwater etc. Replay value is high just to try to obtain the achievements. I have not delved into GTA Online yet but it seems fun. Great online community that provides guides cheat codes mods and walkthroughs if you ever feel stuck. Overall a great game that everyone should play.10/10 would get eaten by a shark again,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-06,0,0,283,False,Not Recommended,Playing this game Online in 2018 is tedious and time wasting. From my experience I often encounter cheaters who blow you up with your vehicle no matter where you are.The loading screens are absurdly long after 5+ minutes of waiting there might be an error and the game kicks you back into the single player which means you have to sit through another 5+ minunte loading screen.The fun vehicles are overpriced and the grind for cash is about the same as grinding in an MMO. They really want you to take the easy way out and buy the shark cards.The clubs CEO offices yachts and other properties like them are very expensive but you can't do anything important or fun with them. The heists are not rewarding enough considering how much effort you have to go through. Like random player disconects and deaths. I was stuck on one setup for 3 hours because some guy on my team would run into the enemies alone full Leeroy Jenkins style and die or someone would disconnect. Also every time someone disconnects you have to get back to you house go into the heist room and sit in a waiting room till the game finds enough players to start the mission.If you value your time and effort don't play this game Online.That said if you want this game for purely single player experience and mods go for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

RockStar support is helpless regarding that all they can do is give virtual currency if you really really complain and the amount they give is just laughable.The new online missions are all designed to persuade you not to do them but buy shark cards (virtual currency for real cash) instead some of them werent even tested and don't work.Weaponized vehicles are getting out of hand and balance is far from the horizon.You are better off playing anything else,Grand Theft Auto V

You can't play one hour straight without running into one of these s. you'd think rockstar would do something about it since these modder add money into the game which cuts away from the sharkcard proffit but no rockstar has no cheat detection system it looks neither takes reports seriously.

2015-07-13,0,0,623,False,Recommended,This game is awesome except where all those San Andreas states go? (San Fierro Las Venturas)FROM NOW ON THIS IS NOT A RECOMMANDATION THIS IS SUGGESTIONIf there is going to be a DLC or a map mod for singleplayer I think It should get that states back.But I still appreciate their work because apparently game is around 60 GBs and If they tried to fit the other states probably we'll had to buy a whole new SSD or HDD for GTA V even a new PC because all that rendering for that huge map couldn't be done in nowadays decent systems. But If Rockstar makes something to the new GTA game that can allow us to travel like GTA 1 ' s playing system (To choose between GTA IV's Liberty City San Andreas' San Andreas Vice City's Vice City) THAT WILL BE AWESOME.Imagine you are approaching to the airport and going to one of the ticket selling places and saying that you want to travel Vice City from San Andreas and they giving you the ticket. There is a small flight scene (taking off and going twords the sea) then boom landing of the plane and getting out from the plane to the inside of the airport. And now you can do whatever you want in the city. But this is impossible because everyday graphics get better Better Graphics Better Game More Storage Space + Powerful PC Better Graphics + This Feature 10.000$ PCIf they add all this features to a game that might fall in next 6 years only high end PC's of that year can handle the game and there will be more work involved so the game get delayed 6 years more.Long story short if that's going to possible I will love to see some feature like that from Rockstar but I don't think that is going to possible. Not because Rockstar can't make it because computers might not be able to handle that.Thanks for reading this long stuff. Enjoy playing GTA V. If you haven't yet don't worry the days aren't making this game old. Whenever I got bored from singleplayer I go online when I got bored from online I'm installing mods when I'm bored from that new mods came up and Rockstar prepares an update. THIS GAME IS NEVER GOING TO GET YOU BOREDBy the way PLEASE DISABLE YOUR MODS BEFORE GOING ONLINE THOSE MODS ARE ONLY FOR SINGLEPLAYERScrew this mods are BACK,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-04-26,0,0,2105,False,Not Recommended,"Story when you compare it to GTA IV or GTA SA it sucks... it's like a level below. This was so far the worst and most stupid ""bank robbery"" story that I've ever heard of. Missions got a bit repetitive. OFC in compare to older GTA games.Gameplay There's really nothing to do... it feels very poor and like it has a lot of cut content... yes they've brought back some cool stuff from older games but also they did cut a lot other content. There are some badass things to do that have been found in folders and old leaks.3 Characters it was cool for like 15min but in the end it wasn't really anything ""cool""... 1 character story is much better for games like GTA.And you won't really enjoy it in missions... you can change characters only when the game wants you to.Physics and attention to detail are awesomeOnline that's a different story... It has much more content and everything. It's really fun.Free DLC...Online that works.The ""hacker"" problem... there are bunch of hackers like 1 or 2 weeks each 4 months and then R* releases an update or a banwave... and if you are smart enough you can always click that ""FIND NEW SESSION"" tab. ""Hackers"" aren't in every lobby and not all of them are morons that just want to disturb you... 75% of cases when I've met a ""hacker"" was a good guy which was fun with and that helped you with things.R* support dont ever expect them to help you... Ubisoft for example are complelty awesome in compare to this one.Online makes like 80% of this game.Now would I recommend GTA V? No... there are tons of other games that are better.Would I recommend GTA Online? Yes... it's pretty unique with free DLC still comming out.",Grand Theft Auto V

I know i have potato PC but there are plenty of peoples who have much better PC than mine and they face similar problems. For a game which is released for 5 years already there is to much of bugs glitches and crashes. R* should be foucusing on fixing that instead of creating another OP vechicle or other cashgrab DLC..

2015-05-31,0,0,61,False,Recommended,What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? The graphics are detailed smooth and full of life and look fantastic with all settings maxed out on a high end rig. The storyline is fun and exciting and the characters along with the voice acting is quite possibly the best ever heard in a video game. The game melds several genres and does each one extremely well. There's something here for everyone and most people will enjoy everything the game has to offer. The missions are fun and well thought out unlike a lot of sandbox games. The world itself might be the most amazing aspect of this game though. It goes on for miles and miles and you actually feel like you're in a real place. Nothing is half and the locations are very believable as are the NPC's that inhabit the world. The length of the game depends on what you decide to put into it. You can blast through the main story line in about 15 hours or so. Or you can take advantage of the multitude of extremely entertaining side missions that all have lengthy well done dialogue that will have you laughing your off. Trevor is the star of the show here and I guarantee you will laugh out loud many times throughout the experience. Quite simply GTAV is a masterpiece and should not be missed if you enjoy video games. I can't wait to see what Rockstar does next(pleade make a Red Dead 2).,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-15,0,0,838,False,Recommended,I really enjoy this game. I was worried that I'd hate the new player system where you change back and forth between three main characters but it turned out to be one of my favorite features! So here are the pros and cons PROS First Person perspective option I personally love FPS! Three well done main characters with their own stories and missions that intersect with each other. Amazing graphics. Smooth gameplay (with a good video card). Golf and Tennis minigames which are pretty fun. Heists!!! Very fun very exhilarating! Most of the missions are very well done fun to play and not overly complicated or too easy. Wide variety of vehicles and special vehicles that can be bought ingame (with game money) from websites. Really BIG game world with beautiful scenery. Wildlife and domesticated animals you even get your own attack dog with Franklin! Funny TV shows and radio as always. Underwater exploration. Buyable businesses. I found the main story to be quite enjoyable with a decent length to it. Most vehicles are customizable at autoshops. You can rob convenience stores. There are many random encounters (unlisted freeform missions). A wide variety of clothing for all three main characters to buy. You can get paid to hunt as Trevor which is pretty fun from time to time. Buyable garages / hanger / marina to house a wide array of collected vehicles.CONS No Pool (the minigame) No Bowling No Casino / Gambling No DLCS No Las Venturas or San Fierro No enterable restaurants. Cannot beat people up like in GTA4 where they would be injured on the ground get up and run / walk away... they just simply die in this game after punching them a few times. Most interiors are not reenterable outside of a mission. Only one enterable bar and one enterable strip club. Yoga (whoever thought that this would be a fun activity was an idiot)I would recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed the GTA franchise as well as anyone who loves open world driving games with a rich story and characters in an immersive setting. Although I felt it could have been better that can be said about almost any game. Some people do not appreciate the satire but I find it to be a boon to the series. A serious storyline in a world that makes fun of the worst aspects of our own! I love this game!,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-05-15,0,0,339,False,Recommended,I really like this game. It's great to play with friends. However I wish they would make it so I could do biker business stuff in a private lobby with friends. Also they need to add new heist missions and make the payouts more so that I can actually play other games.,Grand Theft Auto V

I've seen multiple bad reviews from people who don't like the hackers etc I haven't run into that but I'm not playing from the ingame GTAO server list either.

2018-09-11,0,0,1711,False,Recommended,Still one of the greatest games in single and multiplayer. Of course multiplayer can be rough with all those griefers and gankers out there but thats rather fun to me best way to handle gankers is to gank them out of sessions. But then it comes to the critical point The all around modding &amp cheating in multiplayer is an extremely annoying issue especially as rockstar games doesnt seem to care and many of the griefers &amp gankers are also modders who are not able to lose so if you own them with skill they own you with mods.I cant understand why rockstar doesnt adress this issue. The game is old but its still a cash cow for rockstar and without the modding it could be so much better.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-26,0,0,2199,False,Recommended,This Game is like several games linked by a place instead of one game. A couple of things that I feel get left out of general reviews Bikers Bloody hell is this awesome...assuming you like to drive motorcycles. Start at that because if you don't this DLC will be irritating. Past that the ability to call your *any* bike to you in a second The business opportunities and the missions are pretty slick. Where they aren't bugged. You can make good money and it's not *terribly* expensive to start but all four worthwhile businesses (DO NOT buy docs) with upgrades is expensive AF. Some of the bikes released are amazing (Defiler Sanctus Shotaro) all have a host of visual upgrade options and being able to have 10 bikes in your clubhouse and modify them in your garage is sweet. Cunning stunts Stupid amounts of fun. I'm torn on this one after they revised the speeds on the supers they released. The vehicles they released are some of the fastest in the game but more of them are pointless to be part of a race pack (I'm looking at you Lynx). Some of the tracks are obvious stunt fests others you have to avoid stunts if you want to win. Finance and Felony Money. Maker. If you have a buzzard welcome to your new income stream. *so* many missions. The vehicles from this one are fun especially the Brick. UPGRADE YOUR EQUIPMENT they are there for a reason. Oh and familiarize yourself with ending tasks or unplugging your router losing 3 6 hours of work and upwards of 2.2 mil because of a botched sell mission is rough. Also save up way past the costs for this one you have to buy crates to fill up warehouses and you will go broke without a buffer. Extra VIP missions help with that.,Grand Theft Auto V

The bundle during the summer sale came with more in game money bundled to it than I got for pre ordering and it was the same price as the pre order!*The game might be years old at this point but Rockstar actually put the time and effort into making this a great port it might as well be a brand new game. Games that release only a couple months before the Steam Summer Sale almost never go on sale during the Summer Sale so you should be thankful that Rockstar even let you guys have (more than) the in game cash you would have gotten for pre ordering.*10/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-13,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,"I played the story mode fully on the PS3 on launch day. I played the hell out of online and had a ton of fun with it. So I decided to get the PC version so I can enjoy it at the best graphics settings at 60 fps (GTX 980M here). I can't get past the launcher and have tried everything. 10/10 will get screwed pre ordering on PC again.Edit 1 So apparently the problems I have been having is caused by the fact that I am playing on a laptop. SERIOUSLY? They delayed the release THREE times (I think?) and the game can't be played simply by pressing the ""play"" button?!?! Well I technically can play now but I have to disable my NVIDIA GPU to load the launcher and then re enable it as soon as the launcher closes. THIS IS T! I do love the game though. But at least the game worked properly on launch on the PS3.Edit 2 They recently released a patch that apparently cleared up the launcher issues D Thanks Rockstar! But now the game is ""rubberbanding"" on singleplayer..... Like I will be driving and the car and scenery constantly slows down and speeds up. Almost exactly like if your playing an online game on a terrible connection. Except this happens on singleplayer mode. It gets really annoying really quickly. Unfortunately I still can't recomend this game. The game plays but it plays terribly. They still have a long way to go until they get this game up to par.Edit 3 A new update was released today WHICH MADE THE GAME 100% PLAYABLE! No more having to disable drivers no more rubberbanding! The framerate is acceptable at acceptable settings (given my laptops hardware). I can finally recommend this game! Good going Rockstar! You really ed up at launch but you guys pulled through and fixed the multitude of problems (not saying ALL problems are fixed though) that were preventing me from playing!Edit 4 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDD they ed up the game again.

2018-08-19,0,0,189,False,Recommended,Single Player Campaign While still retaining the outlandish and absurd themes that make a GTA game exciting and spontaneous Rockstar pushes their character writing and dialogue to a new level in this installment. Most characters are interesting and funny and the stories that tie them together are for the most part as well. Gameplay is fairly smooth graphics are still as impressive to me as they were when I first saw them and the voice acting/performances are top notch. The only real complaint about the single player aspect I have is character arc inconsistency. But that could just be Rockstar telling me not to take the game as seriously as I am. GTA Online While In theory an online aspect to GTA V could be great and seemingly was for a while there are a few glaring issues that cut my playtime short. Firstly the obvious greedy/cash grab mentality of the team in charge of maintaining this game mode. I can't tell you how much I've tried to keep up with content updates and trying to participate in them only to be indirectly pay walled by in game prices that would require absurd amounts of grinding to achieve without buying shark cards. Secondly at least around the time I was still playing there was a massive hacking issue that seemingly went unchecked. I would only need to join a few different servers before experiencing some sort of hacker friendly or not. Regardless I still had a lot of fun in GTA Online and don't regret the time I've spent playing it at all. There were enough things to keep me busy and entertained most of the time though I'll probably never be able to afford the yacht I wanted.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-21,0,0,316,False,Recommended,"I will review here only ONLINE mode of the game which is bad. I recommend the game itself for story mode. GTA ONLINE REVIEW MADNESS 50% of all online VEHICLES are militarised so people kill you all the time randomly with their fancy vehicles. Rockstar makes them purposely expensive and OP against other poor players to milk sharcards. Online is just big synonym for a efficent cow that is being milked constantly (refrence to SHARK CARDS). People sure want fancy vehicles that they can't afford to have so they grind buy sharkcards or buy modded money wich is not allowed but way cheaper than shark cards. I see alot of MODDERS ingame (some of them are nice) that troll or abuse people. LOADING SCREEN is my favorite part out of gta5 I guess that's why I have 100h in there (it was a joke). But in total seriousness loading screen is way too long it's like 20 mins normally. I don't know if developers could even reduce it but in my opinion it's way too long even for 80gb game. DRIP FEED is a real hell they have ""leaks"" that tease all cool and awesome AND expensive vehicles just to release them in 3+ month long period to get to another DLC. Big portion of PLAYERS are pretty toxic and not likeable their hobbies include griefing killing randomly modding insulting bulling noobs.

In the real world it seems that Rockstar wanna do a RIPOFF than on making a game that is really FUN to play. Paying up to 5000 each time you die is NOT my idea of fun. In GTA V making money is a cumbersome and a slooow drag. While dying or loosing health is all too easy. Sorry Rockstar but I fail to se the ""game balancing"" here but perhaps you're talking about balancing your checkbooks ?If you choose to play GTA V the old fashioned way and NOT be investing in any of Rockstars Shark Cards then make sure that you plan at least some 30 years ahead.

2015-05-24,0,0,410,False,Recommended,The long wait has been worth it. If you re a PC gamer who s spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest greatest GTA then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version. Sure the Xbox One and PS4 versions were amazing delivering GTA 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures smoother surfaces better lighting and cool depth of field effects but the PC version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the PC s strengths. In doing so it adds a few more metres to one of gaming s towering achievements.Having covered the game twice already we won t go too far into the detail of what makes GTA 5 so good. Partly it s a question of experience. With four previous 3D GTAs under its belt plus Red Dead Redemption Bully and assorted DLC packs Rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems and GTA 5 has the best driving the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series.It s also a question of structure. Dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from Michael s ageing career criminal saga to Franklin s ambitious hoodlum story to Trevor s crazed amoral brand of mayhem where the dumb cathartic slapstick violence we all deep down love GTA for finds its natural home. With repeated play it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with Rockstar s savage satirical take on the Californian dream.,Grand Theft Auto V

Getting into a server that has enough players to fill up a lobby for a heist or a mini game is sometimes rare If only the game would have had a server list with category's everything would have been solved In my opinion.

2016-12-04,0,0,458,False,Not Recommended,I thoroughly enjoyed this game for the time I had it. Then I got banned for some unknown reason and after several calls to their customer support was told they couldn't say why I was banned that it looked very odd but that they could do nothing about it. I accepted my random ban as it was only a month and when I tried to play online again for the first time a day after my ban was up I was informed that my account had been permanently banned the minute the first ban was expired. I called again and was informed that I was banned for modding which I lack the competence to install. I asked him how my account was flagged if I hadn't touched it since the date of the original ban and was promptly read off a transcript of the same god awful automated emails you get when you send in a ticket before being told they would not help me and not to call them again in very rude terms.This game doesn't reward players for investing their time or money in it. This is $60 and nearly 500 hours I will never get back and their customer service is if existent at all. I strongly encourage you not to get this if you have any plans or notions of getting actual help with issues you come across.

The game is constantly being updated with items more and more expensive. To the point where if you don't spend hundreds (real dollars) on shark cards that the only way to buy the in game dlcs is to cheat or exploit. Then there's that no good piece of anti cheat I am a personal victim of the ban hammer despite not having cheated in any way. Fortunately mine was merely temporary at least it wasn't permanent and I was able to keep my stats. But now that I mention this it'll probably ban me darn.

2017-06-15,0,0,654,False,Recommended,TL DR Its a fun game if you can show some patience.Im going to level with you here This game is FUN. AS. HELL.I wouldnt say the story is spectacular but considering some games this day and age are now outright removing single player in favour of following trends I can say that the story is above average. Movement in the game is pretty straightforeward as well. Driving and flying is relatively good its not floaty enough that it feels like you're on an Ice Rink (*cough*WATCH_DOGS*cough*) but its just enough that most of the time a mistake is generally your fault not the game's fault.Online has a whole hell of a lot of different things to do Heists the Doomsday Missions Regular Missions Races Gunrunning Product Distribution etc. There is really just one thing holding the game back however.THE GRIND.Now in all fairness I think the grind is a good thing. It gives you something to strive for something to do a tangible goal that sets a bar and gives you the freedom to reach it in your own way. If you had everything in the game right off the bat you'd probably be bored within the first week or so (I know I would). I would've said this was a problem back when the game was relatively new. However thanks to the introduction of heists CEO missions and Product Selling there are more options to make bank than ever before.If you have time on your hands and the patience to finish heists and the like I'd say go for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

I bought the PC version specifically to mod it but by taking down OpenIV Take Two seems to have made GTA modding something of the past. Probably to push players back into GTA Online where they'll almost have to spend extra money on Sharkcards since everything in GTA Online is way overpriced. But that is not the only problem GTA Online has the community is toxic as f**k. Most of the time you can't do anything without being run over by a tank driven by a screaming 9 year old. It's simply terrible. The only fun I've had online was doing races although those often end up with people ramming you on purpose. Modding for me is essential to a GTA PC game to have fun that lasts till the next GTA game comes out. It keeps the game alive. I fondly remember spending more time playing as a cop chasing criminals with LCPDFR then playing as Nico Bellic in GTA IV. As said I specifically bought GTA V for the PC to mod it. It has a great modding community with a wide variety of possibilities. Take Two now has decided to destroy that community because they somehow feel they haven't made enough money yet (despite GTA V being the 4th best selling game of all time).That's what I call greedy.Take Two F**k you!I won't play GTA online ever again on PS3 PS4 nor PC.

2017-06-15,0,0,129,False,Not Recommended,The Singleplayer on this game is pretty average as far as story goes the missions are pretty fun and are different to the ones from the older GTA games. I don't really like the three protag system though I would have prefered a more in depth single protag and the car physics are really off. Overall though I can say I enjoyed SP it was just fun and there was lots to do to keep a player entertained.HOWEVER the online portion of the game is why I'm leaving a negative review. At first it wasn't too bad a bit grindy but was still fairly fun. It got worse as time went on though things got more expensive money became harder to get and more griefing tools were added in each new update. Rockstar's anticheat is also absolutely broken many people have been banned for absolutely no reason. Online has single vehicles which I you not in real money cost over $100 due to microtransacations If you aren't willing to pay that then have fun with grinding for ages to get one vehicle that will be replaced with something better in the next update. Hackers are also all over online this could have been alleviated had Rockstar not made a system which essentially promotes people hacking in money so they don't have to sell a kidney or live on the game in order to afford the new content in their updates.My complaints with online wouldn't be that bad of an issue if Rockstar also hadn't neglected Singleplayer GTA 4 had 2 SP expansions meanwhile GTA 5 has none. They also stopped people from trying their new content (vehicles weapons etc) on SP.I wish I could give the game a positive review due to the fact I thought the Singleplayer was okay but the Multiplayer is so god awful and a horrible example of how to treat consumers and run a multiplayer system. Don't buy this game if you do you're supporting Rockstar's terrible business practices. If you wanna play it for the online worthwhile aspect (SP) you can buy it from VERY LEGITIMATE OFFICIAL WEBSITES rather than supporting Rockstar's t.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,260,False,Not Recommended,So Rockstar or T2 have killed the OpenIV.It was a year 2003 and I was in love with Vice City and GTAIII. Had no internet back then but we had those pirate warez CDs and among these were the GTA mod CDs. You want your boat to have naked Candy Suxx sunbathing on top? No problem. Flying DeLorean? Here you go. Oh man have you heard about this new sh*t for Vice City the zombie overhaul? And so on. We've exchanged with friends we stalked pirate game stores we were obsessed with finding more sh*t to throw onto our GTAs. Then San Andreas came and with it I first got my hands on the Internet. Free dial up over night you know what I'm up to right after the porn pics. The GTA mods. Download as much as I can throw everything on CD share with friends. Then was the GTA IV and ADSL internets for even more modding stuff. Laggy and bug infested the game got it's mods as always. Now the devs are trying to kill what I was growing up with.Now I'm 25 I don't have that much time to patiently smear mods over my favourite game but still GTAO cars and weapons along with couple of graphical and gameplay tweaks were a must have mods after another GTAO patch. I don't even play this sh**ty grindfest I just want to visit virtual LA and maybe ride some real cars with realistic handling at eternal night time with a bearable FOV and so on. Unfortunately marketologists rule the game dev now so sh*t like this was expected to happen. Though I'm sure we'll see a rise of a modding scene again. When GTAO will die and it will after the last patch we'll see the people enthusiastic enough to pry the game open and mod the hell out of it.For now I'll pirate the latest moddable version and fu*k these online flying bikes updates.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-01,0,0,292,False,Recommended,"After playing the game for almost 150 hours now I feel I have put enough time in to review it fairly so here goes.I'll start with the good It's the GTA that I know and love. It feels more like San Andreas than like GTA 4 to me which is a good thing since I adored SA for its open space and variety and felt like 4 (despite being a solid game) just doesn't live up to the legacy. GTA 5 has a well written and interesting single player experience the playable characters are diverse and interact well with each other the mission are entertaining and numerous. Probably the thing that interested me most about this iteration of GTA was the native support for multi player (finally!) with its Online Mode. In it players can join friends crew (think ""clan"") or strangers in session of (I believe) up to 30 players. The online version of the game is rich in Rockstar created activities and the mission creator allows for a great deal of additional variety. You can race fight arm wrestle play tennis contend for resources and do a whole host of other activities with fellow criminals.Recently I spend most of my gaming time in GTA Online and I feel that it really is a great addition to the game. Despite this it has its ups &amp downs. There are several key issues I should address here Hackers Mission requirements and player dependency Loading timesSo hackers. What do I mean? One moment you're cruising around with a friend taking on the world and feeling its the best game ever. The next you're violently exploded by a hacker from half the map away. All your weapons are suddenly gone. You open the menu to hit to hit ""change session"" but you can't even do that since THE GAME CLOSES THE MENU EVERY TIME YOU DIE. Sure you can report them by email. Sure hacks are transient and eventually the game should grow ""safer"" and less exploitable as Rockstar addresses issues and releases patches... but right now some days are just bad like that.What's that about mission requirements? Well to me the best kind of missions in GTA Online are the heists. These require a 4 person team to play. So sometimes you're in the swing of things running with a solid crew and clearing out mission after mission... and sometimes you're just stuck in eternal lobby limbo waiting for that elusive ""last member"" to join your team and every time you get one they quit mid mission (throwing you all out since that's how the game is designed). This might not be a problem if you're not going after heists with such enthusiasm but eventually you have to remember one thing Multi player games are just that meant for multiple people to play together and your fellow players will make or break your experience with the game almost every time. Keep that in mind and if you have a big group of friends who are already into the game good for you!And finally loading times. I got a fairly high end PC and I can run the game on very high settings without performance issues and still I spend a good 2 3 minutes loading into the game at start up and a minute or two after every mission. This is time consuming it breaks the immersion and mainly just sucks because sometimes the game initiates loading in cases where it really shouldn't have. I'll give you an example that happens to me daily You're invited to a mission while playing online. You hit 'accept' and instantly get a message saying 'session full returning to GTA online'... so far so good too bad you were in session literally 3 seconds ago and now you're going to load up another one for 2 minutes. Done loading? What's that another invite? ""Heh let's try"" you say... Nope. Full again. Loading again. Enjoy your wait. This issue might not be that bad if you're running the game off an SSD but then again it's a 60 GB game. Kinda heavy IMO.TL DR? I got you covered.Good Great looking game. Very solid single player. Online mode is a beast especially when you have friends online.Bad Some bugs ruin missions though rarely. Hackers online. Game aka ""Loading Simulator 2015.""Final verdict Very Recommended!Thanks for taking the time to read my review. Obviously all the above is just my opinion and I appreciate anyone who cares enough to read it. So far I enjoyed the game very much and I'd say buy it and have a blast )",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-06,0,0,1050,False,Recommended,As for your personal score and perception of this game.. it really depends on what part you are trying to play. Are you just doing SP or are you doing the GTA Online portion as well?Because GTA Online (PC) still has a ton of issues since launch especially those of modders and hackers killing the entire 30 player lobby at once and then blaming it on another innocent player. And even though there are not that many 12 year old squeakers as in the console version you are now having to deal with smart teens and young adults. Another problem is matchmaking. Trying to play a heist with a lagging Chinese player teleporting around the map is no fun. There are no region locks so you might end up in a lobby where everyone speaks Russian. And then everyone disconnects and you are the only player.But if you simply want to avoid all of this together at least complete the single player mode or if you played the console version before you should try beating the game again. To be able to make out the unshaved stubble on Michael's chin to see the beautiful water reflections on the waves as the sun is setting brings a tear to my eye. I am running on a low spec computer and I can still perceive all of this with everything but texture resolutions toned down.

2017-06-15,0,0,152,False,Not Recommended,A while back I submitted a negative review because of the whole OpenIV fiasco. When this was resolved I changed it to positive. However I am now changing it back for different reasons...Over the years GTA V has changed a LOT. Unfortunately these changes only added new content to the Online aspect of the game and were increasingly more pricey. After being away from this game for a while I am now beginning to see just how much of disgusting pile of GTA V has become. When you don't own every single addition made to the game you will get bombarded by phonecalls emails and info popups to remind you that you still need to sink those millions into that pointless property that you will barely use. And if you dó use said property a lot there will be upgrades that cost you MILLIONS to obtain! Meanwhile the real life money to gta dollar ratio has not changed at all making this even more ridiculous.Seriously this game has become a disgusting pile of and I refuse to support it. In fact I'd rather recommend people to buy cheat menus at this point.,Grand Theft Auto V

Like many of them I've tried multiple times to get Rockstar support to even get this looked at and all I get is bots telling me all bans are final. When I ask WHY I was banned Rockstar support just tells me ""Read terms of use"". It feels like their responce is simply ""You know what you did"" or ""We don't know you figure it out"". I could go on a rant about this and tell how Rockstar is greedy and how little they care about their players even going so far as to censor people who raise too big a stink about stuff like this. But there are enough people telling you that here already. Instead I will give you this warning.Do not grow to fond of your character or invest to much time/real money in them as I did.

Welcome back!It has A WORLD of content it still gets regularly updated with new things it's active and there's a lot to do. You are very likely to encounter hackers sooner or later but you can just switch lobbies or play with your friends (it's fantastic when you get a crew to roll with) or even alone. You create a character customize it dress it up as you like you level up by doing stuff shooting stealing racing killing heisting the good stuff you name it. As you level up you unlock loads of stuff to do and play with properties to buy like safehouses and garages businesses to generate more cash more missions vehicles clothes tatoos hairstyles etc.You have stats for shooting driving flying underwater breathing but all that is improved through playing and never really degrades so unless you're really obsessive about it you needn't pay much attention to it.Regarding the single player aspect it's fantastic lots of stuff to do three protagonists to play as the missions are varied and wacky in true GTA style. PC gets first person too which is a damn fine addition to an already very polished game.The only literal bad thing are the loading times but if you can stand that (through SSD or sheer patience) you're golden.

2015-06-15,0,0,35,False,Not Recommended,For single play it is great!For online play it sucks... at the moment.GTA V was great until the latest patch and then it went to crap. No matter how hard you try anytime you play online now there will be atleast one hacker in your game. That person will be ruining the game for you the whole time. The input setting are optimized for a controller and the mouse and keyboard are useless due to input lag and mouse click issues. I would steer clear for some time if you have not already purchased this. If you have just wait a few months while RS sits on thier stacks of cash laughing at us until they feel sorry enough to fix the issues.I recommend for single player but not for multiplayer and for that reason I cant recommend a broken game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-10,0,0,448,False,Recommended,*I edited this recently*(KEEP IN MIND THAT I HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE STORY AND HAVE MOSTLY PLAYED ONLINE)GTA V is a hell of a lot better than I was expecting. The gameplay itself is fun and the co op is good. I enjoy the co op because it actually requires coordination and not everyone can go in balls to the wall without saying a single word to the team without failing. (I mean this as in Lamar missions and Heists) I find playing with friends to be the best way to play through this game but I will say this.Anti Cheat isn't good. I have played online with randoms for a very small amount of time and I found a modder 2 out of 3 times. Community also isn't great *cough cough* Sernandoe *cough cough**Edit*I guess that I've jumped the gun a little bit here. The game itself isn't that bad but you're going to have some pain in terms of grinding. Rockstar places ridiculously high prices on stuff and that normally wouldn't be an issue but you're going to be grinding for hours sometimes days. I'm fairly certain this is to sell the shark card (which are not worth it I might add),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-18,0,0,524,False,Recommended,Have been an avid GTA player since day one including all the side ones like GTA London. Had GTA V on xbox transferred to PC when bought it here also.Cant fault the game all the extras they've added to the online game theres loads to do even in the single player. Theres even side games of golf tennis mountain biking and skydiving to name a few.The only issue you are going to have apart from their shocking server issues and hackers/modders is trying to get your account unbanned after they wrongly ban you for whatever reason they picked as they never even tell you this either.You can be in a game suddenly have cars planes moneys trees etc you get the idea drop on your head then suddenly you have a months ban. Nice guilt by location I was there so I must be guilty.Sooner or later it will happen to you when it does good luck. Whilst I agree you need a system to ban the hackers/modders blanket bans across the server room you're in doesnt quite cut it for me. I made 300k in 5 hours before I was banned for a month. The only other issue was I had two cars mysteriously drop from the sky onto my head before I managed to change to another server. If you read from their forums anything to do with bans they ignore whether it be twitter a ticket or the forums. Theres no appeals process once they decide you're banned permantely I assume you're gone for good. I assume this transfers to earlier and later games also as I cant be arsed to check.Whilst I have enjoyed the game series for so many years theres always something that spoils it. Be it modder/hackers or customer service/game infraction rules. I cant recommend this for online gameplay with the state of play at the moment knowing full well that sooner or later with their severe system in place you could loose access to anything you have earned bought or worked towards. Unless of course this is a marketing ploy to make you buy Shark Cards(ingame credit boosts) to retrieve what they removed.The single player game whilst good wont keep you very long and once you've done the sotryline theres only so much more to do. I wont be buying the next in the franchise for this to happen again unless I read something stating they've changed the system they're using for hackers to something more fair and appealable for when they get it wrong.They're still going to mess up but not allowing it to be appealed is ridiculous. Then again I suppose they already have my money so they obv need to cull the player numbers on the server somehow.Buy it on sale only at least 50% off otherwise walk away. You dont need this kind of BS in your life.Edit 1st August 2018For some reason I got a huge cash lump sum from R*. Dunno why not complaining.Been playing this again since just before the After Hours Update. Havent seen many spawners/money droppers in the sessions. Hopefully R* has managed to sort out most of the issues.I must say I'm loving the Back to the 80s vibe with the Gay Tony return. I always did love playing this game and the extra stuff in the After Hours update is almost like reliving GTA IV. Now if they could only do San Andreas in the V engine or even GTA London then I'd be in my element.From what I've read they've changed their policy on people whom had money dropped on them. Seems promising. With this in mind and the recent update I'm changing my review to positive. Like I said before the game was always great it was the way they handled cheaters and innocent victims of these cheaters that made me place the negative review. Time alone will tell.,Grand Theft Auto V

That was not the case. I was refused/denied a steam refund for playing for 5 hours. You'd think multibillion dollar companies like rockstar and valve would have a fairly streamlined game here with few bugs but apparently that's not the case. This the first game I've not been able to get working on my setup (6700k 1080ti 32gb) ever and also the first and only refund request I ever made. Not a good look for either and I suppose I can now fully latch onto the idea this platform and its ethos has calcified into a soulless ""screw you gimme money"" platform like all turn into. Oh well.TLDR Don't play over 2 hours or you can't refund if the game is nigh unpplayable. Claiming you tried to fix it a bit after the 2 hours means nothing. The 'case by case' byline of steam's refund policy is bunk for me at least. Highly unrecommended.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-27,0,0,443,False,Not Recommended,I had to change my review from positive to negative because of how awful this game has become.GTA Online has the potential to be really awesome and I've had my fair share of fun with it but it's become obvious that Rockstar sees it not as a game with players but as a scam with marks. GTA Online has hands down the worst anti cheating/hacking measures I've ever seen. You have to get on 5+ year old Call of Duty games to see hacking this bad. More than half the servers I log into have some blowing everyone up spawning tons of vehicles on top of people or countless other annoying things. And they get even more aggressive if you're running in a CEO crew and trying to make money.Of course Rockstar has anti cheating measures but they only seem to kick in when a hacker is doing something that helps players get around buying Shark Cards (GTA's 'pay real money for in game money' system). I've never seen a hacker shut down for doing annoying t or for destroying players who are trying to make money honestly (even when they're reported). I've seen countless hackers shut down for giving free money to players with the players also having their money taken away. Taking this along with how absurdly grindy it is to make money in this game and I'm forced to the conclusion that Rockstar only cares about their players insofar as they can get them to buy more Shark Cards. I can't recommend this otherwise excellent game so long as they're continuing slimey business practices like this.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game in between Load screens is pretty fun too but luckily the matchmaking and the mission/heist joining system is so buggy that you're never separated long from your favorite spinning Loading icon! Then there's the bonus the game crashes and gray screens! These are really fun too and not hard to find either as you can find them with any graphics settings on almost any resolution.I rate this Loading Screen Simulator 9/10..........unless if you like the game in between Load screens in which case you'd better just wait until Rockstar decides to optimize the game (I'm sure chasing hacking and modding is their first priority so they'll take their time getting to it).,Grand Theft Auto V

But the reason why I am doing this in English is because there is something I want to do with the Rockstar Games. I came across GTA 5 when my server wasn't running properly and then I was very disappointed and I didn't know what was going on so I made a malicious assessment and I felt sorry about that. And now I am having a lot of fun playing games so I have a new assessment. I have a favor to ask the rockstars operators. There's no update ahead but you don't need to monitor and manage your server so that this great game doesn't break down. I'd really appreciate it if you could do it before the problem gets bigger. And I would appreciate it if you could offer cars or buildings on sale to keep people entertained. I ask this as a user. I don't know if the rockstars operators will see me but I don't know if I'm going to encourage a small group of people to make requests. Thank you for reading the long article.

In online people can be s (Extremely annoying s) I mean s as in kill you over and over for no reason. That takes some getting used to. Most importantly this is a grinding game. It has races and adversary modes and other tid bits but it is primarily grinding whatever you can for money. If you don't like grinding games don't play GTA online. But if you do welcome to paradise. I have spent somewhere's around 600 hours grinding in this game for my ""criminal enterprise"" and I am still not getting bored.

2018-10-12,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,It shouldn't cost as much as it does considering how old the damn game is sure it's fun but what gta game isn't tbh. Online is broken most of the time due to modders/hackers/what have you as somebody who has owned this game on several consoles by now I am very disappointed with this purchase.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-29,0,0,273,False,Not Recommended,First off I first bought this game and made an account back on my X Box 360 like 5 years ago. So don't let the few hours that I have on my Steam account fool you. Secondly if there was a netural button I'd be hitting that instead of recommend/not recommend to be completely honest. However I do have to say the PC version is a lot better cause you have a lot more content and stability.Now on to more of the up front and brutally honest opinions/facts of the PC version of GTA V Positive 1 There is a lot more content like I stated before. As well as newer content being released first on PC(Although I could be wrong about that part) 2 This version of the game runs much more smooth as stated prior. 3 You have the option to multi task using more then one screen with out having to switch between screen settings(If your console and PC are hooked up to the same TV unless you have a laptop) 4 More key binding options then console versions. 5 Computers will more likely have more memory then a console so no need to uninstall any games to run this one with all the new updates always coming out. Negitive 1 There are a lot more hackers and it seems to me like you have to report them A LOT to RockStar in order for them to even start giving a damn! Plus other player's love to exploit them for money and other items instead of reporting them! 2 The cost of certain things you need to do to expand you MC/Org Bunker and the newer features plus a lot of the cars is stupid compaired to how much you make per mission or other jobs you can do. Plus the fact that some Heists take so long to prepair and are so hard it's like you need a team of PRO gamers plus the payouts suck! I mean come on RockStar that's why you have people hacking in the first place! Maybe if you lowered the cost of certain things and gave us missions that gave us better payments but not as much as Heists things might just be better! 3 RockStar support is always hard to deal with so it matter not which version of the game you have you will usually always feel somewhat empty when trying to get help from them. And when I say usually I mean like %92 %98 of the time you'll feel like it was nothing but a waste of time even if you got the issue resolved and the only way to resolve was through RockStar. 4 Even though this game is not free the game can attract some toxic crowds from time to time. So while in free mode you might not want to deal wth it. Alright let's kick them! Vote to kick someone you got like 3 votes..... person is still not kicked. Now you got like 7 votes out of say 24 people......... Guess what! you need like %90 of the people in the server to vote to kick that one player in order for them to be kicked! So if it's a hacker ruining your day Just find another server everyone will suck up to them and do whatever they want to get some free cash! Don't even bother trying to finish your cargo run or that car delivery it's not worth the frustration if the hacker is targeting you. Do not give them the satisfaction of killing you and making you waste all that time and effort. Quit while you're ahead and on top. 5 RockStar keeps coming with more content but no new real ways of earning real cash in game unless you already have lost of cash so you can buy the new content. They are trying to steal your money(Real life hard earned money. Don't put any real money into this game it's NOT WORTH IT!) If they put some more missions that you could actually do with the base content that paid out rather well then we'd be getting somewhere! Greedy jerks!,Grand Theft Auto V

For the first 200 hours there is so much to do I still find the game fun sometimes but here's why I don't recommend this game. While playing the game you'll run in to some of ""those"" guys. You'll be minding your own buisness then blown up by a jet or stickybombed. Then they'll almost always run away and avoid you until you least expect it then do the same thing or they might just go in passive if they know that you will destroy them. I call these people K/D Warriors all they care about is killing people and their kill death ratio. One of the major reasons people hate this game is because of the cheaters. If you have played this game at all then you know what I'm talking about. I guarantee you will run in to at least one cheater while playing. They will either explode everybody or they will just mind their own buisness. But really in the end you're just gonna run in to people that just want to kill you.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-23,0,0,127,False,Recommended,This game is absolutely fantastic. There's very few bad things to even mention about it. The story is composed to make fun of the American ideals and it succeeds in it. To add to that the story is really long which offers a lot of game time (30 something hours of story) + a bunch of side missions to do in addition. And the multiplayer which supercedes GTA IV by miles. In terms of performance this game is so well optimized. I don't have the strongest PC out there (AMD R9 290 AMD FX 6300 6core 8gb ram) and I could still run it on high settings. If you want to squeeze the most out of this you're going to need a titan and lots of ram. Try crossfiring too to get the most out of the amazing graphics.The only few bad things I do have to say would be that with all of their immersion with the environment they really should've added indicators. Adds more realism for us role players. In addition to that there was also the fact that no matter whether your gun was silenced or not police got right on you no matter where you shot. And when it comes to multiplayer then occasionally me and my buddies had difficulty getting in each others games but that's about the only bad thing. I hope they add big bank robberies into multiplayer soon.All in all it is a very very good game that I can happily recommend to anyone who wants to be armed with 20 guns to go on a killing spree on bikers gang members and the police. People who enjoy a good story will not be disappointed either with superb voice acting and sound quality. The performance as I mentioned earlier is also a very good reason why anyone should try it out. It might just run smooth as butter on your baby.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,120,False,Not Recommended,"With Some hours under my belt I have to change my mind on GTA V being a good game. To be honest It's not. It's a pretty boring rehash of what used to be a fun game but which has been milked dry by now. The story mode is alright the story is basically san Andreas 2.0 . The dialog is funny. And so on. The missions become repetitive pretty quickly and after a while you just get bored. Sure the city is well made but the amount of entrable buildings is very very lowThe online mode... Well that's repitiion coming out of every pixel. You have a bunch of heists which are the only interesting missions but that's all. Some standard races with occasionally a funny twice when you race golfcarts. Some fedex misisons collecting item A then taking it to point X. Some ratkilling in there somewhere. Done. Then random people on a random server. Don't kill them too often and don't destroy their precious cars that respawns though. You'll get Bad player points because you have to be a nice criminal. Meanwhile if you drive around aimlessly doing F*** all you are rewarded. So yeah that was the part where I said to myself ""Really?"" In the end GTAV is a game you can buy in one of Gabe's discounts. It's fun with friends but outside of that there's too much repitition to be a game you'll spend hours playing. Unless you're some hardcore fanboy. 20 30 would be a good price for it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-13,0,0,1132,False,Recommended,Great game and the king of sandbox play. Their opening of the sandbox to online play is incredibly exciting and some of the most meaningful online play you can experience in an ideal scenario. However there is a lot of rot in the form of hackers and this is incredibly unfortunate as it completely destroys an otherwise amazing experience. Past this the game gives a whole plethora of activities for you and your friends to do and an armada of vehicles to collect in various bunkers and facilities scattered about Los Santos. Currently it is in the twilight of it's Golden Era look for something newer and shinier in the future but not too soon as Rockstar is now cenetered on consoles with their release of Red Dead Redeption 2. Red Dead Redeption was never released on PC dispite a few petitions and obvious potental to make millions and it was Rockstar's first entry into online sandbox multiplayer which had very few problems on consoles. After what the PC community did with GTA V in regards to hacking and headaches I doubt we'll be seeing Rockstar bringing RDR 2 to PC. So if you want to experience the best there is in sandbox play here is this mess with no announcements for the future or even if there ever will be one on PC.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-30,0,0,248,False,Not Recommended,The story was fine I can't really compare this to the last few games because the last GTA game I played was is San Andreas on the PSP and that I never actually finished it. The story was fine and easy to understand technically there are 3 stories but that doesn't matter much. All you need to know is that the game is fun. The controls are very tight the combat is delicious and the driving is good of course the driving is good in a GTA game.Once you finish the story you will want to play some online right? The answer is NO this game is filled with hackers it is actually impossible to be in an online session without any hackers. What you need to do is host a private online session with your friends and it really just defeats the purpose if you're looking for a war spree with some randoms.What is the worst thing in this game is the loading time the load time is ing terrible not for the story but for the online. The game loads forever and when it finishes you are in a server with flying tanks and hackers dropping money on people (which can get you banned even if you're not hacking)4/6,Grand Theft Auto V

More things to do more places to see and San Andreas was always my favorite GTA city anyway.The game is well optimized for PC it seems. I don't have a particularly amazing rig and it runs on (almost) all the highest settings with a good framerate.

But GTA Online is still so much fun you can always have a laugh with your mates and even make new friends. And its amazing how rockstar are still updating the online mode even though the games been out for nearly 5 years.All in all GTA 5 is an fantastic game i highly recommend it,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-01,0,0,172,False,Not Recommended,If you buy GTA V for the singleplayer you will have a great time and I really did enjoy it but the multiplayer was my main focus and why this review is negative.The multiplayer now takes me over 20 minutes to load into which is just insane. I get it is a large game but it used to take 8 minutes.While I have personally not met many hackers and modders I know there is a large amount of them that can easily ruin a session and potentially get you banned. Rockstar support with ban's never really works and is frustraiting to work with.Lastly It now just takes too much of a grind to get any large amount of money because Rockstar wants you to buy shark cards. Every new car is overpriced and takes too long to getIf you want a great singleplayer experience then this is a great game but if you are looking for a good multiplayer game I would advise checking out other games first.,Grand Theft Auto V

I do have one complaint though I like to use my controller with it. However every once in a while the wire accidentally gets tugged a bit and it disconnects for about half a second not long enough to have a major effect and it isn't that common luckily at least in every other controller supported game. With this game however whenever it happens the controller switches to player two. This doesn't make any sense to me at all considering it doesn't have a split screen multi player option for two players to even work. None of my other games do this it just connects right back as player one even games that DO have split screen multiplayer options.Edit I should also mention that it will switch back to player one if I completely close out of the game reconnect the controller (wired) and log back into the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-03,0,0,133,False,Recommended,To be honest I don't really have anything new to say about this game that haven't been said already. Grand Theft Auto 5 is a well crafted game. The singleplayer aspect of the game is fun and worth playing through but the online aspect of the game is where you'll have the most fun and what you probably pay the game for. Wait you have a hard time getting money in GTA 5 Online? Well you got some options.The first one is obvious. GRIND. Making big money takes a long time but if you are dedicated and have a lot of hours to kill this is the solution. But wait if you also have some money to spare waste them on MICRO TRANSACTIONS silly! That will definitely speed up the process. The last one isn't all that common but you could encounter a hacker in the lobby that you join. If you are lucky enough they might give you a couple billions and be on with their day or make your session a cluster .Sounds good to you? Buy the game.Godspeed.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm a noob and it's tough for me to earn GTA$ without getting killed because someone is always following or waiting for me until I do something to get money.

2017-06-13,0,0,257,False,Not Recommended,The online component of this game is unplayable. Every public session is full of hackers.They like to teleport everyone on the map to their location and blow them up or walk around invincible shooting everyone or any number of other annoying things. But by far the most annoying thing was them adding money to my account. There is no way to stop them or to seperate out your funds from what they added.Now when I bought the game a couple weeks ago I also bought 3 shark cards with the bonus running at the time that was about 20 million in game currency. I figured it wasn't really any different than buying expansion packs for other games and that that would get me up to date on all the old content and ready for gunrunning. But I had that problem with hackers adding money to my account. When I logged in today to get started with gunrunning most of my money was gone. Rockstar adjusted my account down to about $2000 in game currency. you R*. I will never buy another one of your games again. Now it's entirely possible that I had actually spent the money there isn't actually any way for me to tell. But I really don't care. As I said public sessions are unplayable because of all the hacking. One of them actually thought they were doing something nice for me and that's what R* cracks down on? Not all the ing trolls teleporting me to their location with a proximity mine waiting? you Rockstar.Never again will I buy one of your games. I want my money back for the game and for the 3 shark cards I bought.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,154,False,Recommended,So if you are like me that has bought GTA 5 on almost every platform then you should feel to have the right to be able to mod your game once you've played the game for months. If you add up how much money you have spent of the amount of times you bought GTA 5 then threw it away that is like this. Not being able to mod the game just because rockstar wants more people to use online so they can get more money is wrong. If rockstar had a actual problem with it they would've stopped it 10 years ago. Don't get me wrong I love the game but I don't know if I'll be able to play it in a few months. Next thing you know they remove story mode or something. Do not buy this game on any console/pc until it is more stable.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-26,0,0,394,False,Recommended,This game is FUN. If you haven't played it before I suggest that you at least give it a try. Singleplayer is pretty amazing so is Online Mode though cheaters may troll you sometimes... All you have to do if that happens is either join another session or go to singleplayer then back to Online.The game is filled with a lot of content that is still added almost every month or every 2 weeks in some cases. Also Online is very good if you have some friends to play it with.You will find things such as racing adversary modes a very good storyline for singleplayer along with a very good story tons of places to explore dozens of easter eggs heists amazing graphics and all that nice stuff. Oh and.. A LOT of cars.. I mean... A LOOOOTTT.Anyway if you find it hard to make money in Online mode I recommend you find a money guide for Online and not use cheats because there are pretty high chances you will get banned and your character will be reset second ban and you are going to not be able to play Online mode forever.

I've spend +300 hours into this game I feel like I should be in better position than now the net income of all the contact missions and heists that I've done aren't even enough to get me close to end game content after 300+ hours of grinding. The sad part is I wouldn t have minded buying the Shark Cards if there weren t hackers dropping money left and right.... it s ridiculous that Rockstar can t stop this. I know you want to make a profit but why not stop putting all this effort into the online part and maybe release a DLC while you fix and address some of the issues affecting GTA online?7/21/18 Game is still filled with modders turning on god mode dropping money blowing things at random etc... fail rockstar is fail.Just FYI this was a positive review when game first came out on PC.,Grand Theft Auto V

Not going to mention the positive things due to the company's hate for it's consumers despite making more money than it ever has in the past year 4 years.Good things aside this is microtransaction garbage Take Two went hard after modders and back pedaled after everyone got angry. Not a fan of the Publisher or the Studio at this point anymore.Update 4/23 Trying to enter the online and play is just a relization the last few patches have been massive grinds to get players to purchase SHARK card currency which is just anti consumer grinding garbage. Last year was the biggest growth year of TAKE TWO Interactive's finacial sector in the past 4 years despite the game being out for 4 years. The game is garbage the networking security is terrible.

2016-11-23,0,0,340,False,Recommended,After playing this game for several months I've done nearly everything there is to do but I'm still having fun! Finishing the Story Mode was quick and rather easy however that's only a fraction of what this game has to offer. Playing GTA V Online is a whole new game with new missions new obstacles and the chance to interact with plays who most of the time make the game more difficult just by being bad. That's just part of the entertainment.There isn't much I could bash this game for. It's a large map with an enormous variety of NPCs weapons locations and vehicles so you do sometimes run into a really annoying glitch but except for the occasional game drop there's nothing severe. The biggest problem I have with GTA V (Online) is how many modders there are. No game that I've played has every found a definitive solution for hackers but in most games you can't change the actual world using hacks like you can in this game. Modders spawn UFOs make ground vehicles fly and can glitch your character so hard it immobilizes you or even makes your game drop. I love that Rockstar constantly updates the game and adds new content so often but these modders are a problem that should be prioritized. I cannot recommend this game highly enough especially if you have friends to play with online!,Grand Theft Auto V

Modders who get passed rockstar's defense can spawn money at will and just with any lobby it's pretty damn sad especially when you see them spawning millions in seconds compared to normal players who spend time grinding for cash. Rockstar keeps adding unnecessary weaponized/Sci Fi flying vehicles that I personally believe don't belong in GTA but rather other games like Saints Row. Also like I stated earlier modders can easily get into GTA online which is really toxic so that'd be good if rockstar could fix that. Like a 4/10,Grand Theft Auto V

If you try to start jobs using matchmaking you can waste hours cause of trolls and connection isssues.Conclusion This game can't get a negative review because it is really nice without online mode but Rockstar Games doesn't deserve nor good reviews nor money. GTA V is the last Leslie Benzies Masterpiece. The future of GTA without his father/ main developer is unknown.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-08,0,0,685,False,Recommended,"Ok i have seen that people are getting banned from gta for stupid reasons but lets be honest they probably got a hacker or were hacking and got themselves banned because in this game there is no shortage of hackers in the absloute slightest like 1 2 per server but thats not really a problem when you work your way around them. I recomend this game because of its online multiplayer aspect and its ability to keep me hooked for long extensive periods of time without any doubts of playing anything else whatsoever. However there is the argument that ""hey some vehicles are so expensive you have to give your family away to a terrorist group to pay for it."" However i have found that the vehicles at that price have their reason to it being they are very powerful and useful however thats also no a problem either because when you get a hanger and you have some friends money is not a problem to speak of just time and effort and you will have what you wanted. So even though people are complaining they're getting banned and such thats just the fact a hacker may have done something to them and i would agree thats a problem Rockstar needs to adress with GTA 6 because of the utter easiness to hack in the game. But i would still recomend this game because it is 2 games packed into 1. Singleplayer which i havent even gotten into but ive heard its good and then multiplayer which brings the best multiplayer experience I have ever seen in the entierty of my existence. Buy the game you wont regret it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-04,0,0,517,False,Not Recommended,Really good game fun in a lot of moments good to play with friends i have over 479 hours in record. Why not recommended ? Simply because of hackers and rockstar not giving a damn about their customers. This is one of the worst games in that regard. Many times you WILL encouter a cheater in a freemode lobby and it's just gonna cause 2 things 1) Ruin your freemode activities like sabotage and make you mad and make you want a refund2) Cause all the kids in the server to beg the hacker for money drops spamming the chat and annoy you.I love and enjoy the story mode in gta V but the online needs to be polished even though I play online most of the time with my friends. I give story mode a 10/10 but the online a 5/10. There is still room for improvement but rockstar only cares about money and selling shark cards.

2018-06-28,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,This game is kind of absolutley terrible Servers are absolute horse br&gt Due to this fact Combat is unbalancedPeople will have terrible phantom hit boxes and their modle will frequently not match their hit box Enemies tend to take 60+ rounds of an assult rifle and still get up to kill youCombat is also unbalanced in the same way as peer to peer combat works You can't have fun fue to constant disconnectsAlmost every time I play with friends I have atleast 5 random disconnects that ruin everything for us.On top of this Rockstar refuses to fix hacking and modding problemI frequently see hackers getting people banned because they (being the hacker) keep spawning money on their character (that being the innocent) until the servers think that they are hacking and ban them. This is an absolutely broken system and pains me to even think why Rockstar has not fixed this with a simple anti cheat engine yet. Rockstar refuses to fix server problemsI will frequently experience copious ammounts of lag for no reason at all. No lag spikes are shown in my ping but I will still rubber band around the map. On top of this the peer to peer connection is absolutley broken as well. I will be playing with my friends during a heist and at random they will disconnect and force restart the heist 100% reverting all of our work. online is the only allure that the game has leftIf all the game has left to do is do heists over and over again as well as jobs then this game is beyond on its last legs. I cannot explain the tedious build ups to the ends of the heists where you actually make any kind of money. Further elaborationRaces races races races and more racesYou can't play any elaborate mission that doesn't require a large sum of money to start up. All the rockstar jobs and online posted jobs are absoulute trash and barley fun to play the first time around. I cannot see why people are still having fun with this horse Heists are boring and repetitive. Go in kill someone get a vehicle or information then rob the place. They are all boring and the ammount of times you will be restarting the missions due to 1 person getting killed will make the end result so underwhelming that you will want to quit the game then and there.When your game's only remaining selling point is online wouldn't you care even a small bit to make it playable and good? This game is over hyped beyond all others for no good reason and should be forgotten like all the other garbage GTA games that came before this one. I can't recomend this game at all to anyone due to its absolute fest of online content.2/10 rockstar is a terrible company that will never change. I do not expect this game getting any better from here. DO NOT BUY,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-13,0,0,276,False,Recommended,"For how much money Rockstar has made off of this game I'm shocked that their servers are in the state that they're in. You'll find hackers or ""modders"" as they're so benignly dubbed on every other server. I constantly see pooros asking for them to drop money for them and they wonder why they're getting banned left and right for violating terms of service. It's not uncommon to just wind up dead because some eleventeen year old used a hack to make everyone suicide at the same time. I usually jump ship and find a smaller lobby which is where you'll want to be if you run VIP or MC jobs that guarantee money. There's a healthy toxicity in some lobbies but not all. There is also a mix of foreign lobbies and sometimes you get paired with 3 Russians or Brazilians in a heist who can't communicate with you. The game has some fatal online flaws and the grindy nature of it all can be a turn off. Once you get over that 2 or 3 million dollar hump things get a bit easier. That being said the game is still a riot of fun. I find myself giggling or bursting out loud with laughter at some of the absurdities I encounter online. Finding a group of friends can make this game 10 times better but there's a kind of pleasant solitude if you can find your own public lobby. I usually can turn on or off my VPN while joining a lobby in order to get my own all to myself. It makes VIP missions incredibly easy because nobody is trying to kill you and you can fill your MC businesses with supplies with all the time in the world. I recommend the game at the price point I picked it up at $38. It's gone on sale now for $30 in the last sale or two so if you're on the fence about picking it up only commit at anything less than $60. It's kind of insulting that it's still $60 this long after PC release and 3+ years after initial release.",Grand Theft Auto V

The game provides many ways to make money but you're going to need to spend a lot of your money to do things like have a corporation motorcycle club etc. Despite all the ways to make money becoming a millionare is a slow process and will take some grinding but with friends the pain is alleviated.

That's not the games fault though. I haven't had too many interactions with modders/hackers although I don't play a ton.

2017-02-10,0,0,287,False,Recommended,This is honestly one of my favorite games. I have played the story mode multiple times over and i still come back to mess around. I don't play GTA Online so i mostley just mess around in single player with mods and trainers. I first played this game on Xbox 360 when it first came out and i finished it at least twice on that alone. I then bought it on the Xbox One and probably finished it another 2 or 3 times. Since i've had it on Steam i've probably played the story 2 times agian. This game has one of the best singleplayer stories of any game. One of the best things about it are the 3 main characters. Franklin Michael and Trevor. They each have their own appeal and they feel like real people and even though they are the bad guys you can still connect with them. To think this game came out in 2013 and it's been on 5 different systems says something. This game is still going strong and will continue to for a while. The only thing i can say bad about this game is that they were planning singleplayer DLC but it was canceld in favor of GTA Online development. Besides that this game is really good. Defenitley worth the price.,Grand Theft Auto V

They ban EVERYONE for recieving modded money intentional or not. You were so caught up in a event that you didn't notice the money? BANNED! You were confused and didn't know what was going on? BANNED! Yes you can escape a ban. If you can go to rockstars support page and write up a post asking them to take the money away within 5 minutes if not... BANNED!The worst part is. You can't appeal. If you were banned because some ******* hacker made you his target you can do absolutely nothing about it. Remember that money you spent on shark cards?

While I get that it's the most recent one and that they still release content regularly for GTA Online it still stands that not only did they successfully release this game twice but it took ages to get it on PC. Who knows though could still be worth 60 bucks to some people.,Grand Theft Auto V

There seems to be quite a few modders and toxic folks around especially the PC verision. Nevertheless GTA 5 is staggeringly beautiful with amazing graphics and mechanics. Rockstar still cares to a certain extent pumping out amazing DLCs... Grand Theft Auto is a great game for casual playing adventuring and chillin' with friends.

2015-12-05,0,0,625,False,Recommended,After being positively surpised by GTA GTA2 Vice City and San Andreas I was disappointed with GTA IV** and almost skipped GTA V as well. But luckily I didn't as this game is brings the title back to its old glory. Fun beautiful addictive. That's all I have to say.GTA Online in the other had has some serious issues. The public servers are very quiet and mostly populated by hackers who blow every player up every 5 minutes. Trying to do some missions or racing may involve 5 10 minutes of waiting for other players. However if played in a private session with friends GTA Online is incredibly fun. Heists offer lots of challenge (especially trying to do elite challenges) and the forced grinding doesn't feel that bad (you'll need to level up your character to use certain weapons etc.). Too bad there are only few heists and they'll get repetitive after you've done them few times in every role but yet they are fun to play.**) I don't know why. I really liked only the Lost and damned expansion.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-28,0,0,438,False,Not Recommended,"They totally ruined GTA Online. I played it because I liked the real life simulation and the fun that there was. I stopped playing for a year and now I'm back and I'm greeted with flying motorbikes with missiles and a pay to win freemode. New DLC cars (which at this point are all the exact same thing with a reskin so you can give up as much money as possible thinking you're getting ""content"") cost 3 4 times as much as the already not very affordable ones did in the first DLCs anyone who puts real money into the game can buy one of several kinds of invincible death machines (or you can grind for literal weeks...) all the RPG realism is totally dead...It's not a real life but cooler simulator anymore. It's just a game for people who put real money into the game to bully and flex on normal people just wanting to have fun. Everything has to be bigger better faster MORE explosions MORE sports cars... All this superficial trash that is unattainable for anyone who doesn't invest either huge chunks of their free time or of course real money.Having something cool to destroy people with like a fighter jet used to be difficult enough rewarding fun and balanced. But with stuff like the Hydra and MKII Oppressor people who spent 30 on each vehicle and just literally float up to you and wipe you out with no resistance. You just get defenslessly annihilated. Not to mention the literal missile truck and that weird future tank thing.GTA Online isn't fun or rewarding anymore.

How is that my fault and i aslo use open IV but i thought they aloowed that agian but i could be wrong. I don't cheat on the game simply becasue it would be unfair to the community but it doesn't seem like that matters becasue know one in the PC community really cares(The Cheaters i mean not everyone) and when a legitimate player gets closed to being banned for what becasue a cheater that dropped me money without me giving him permission to it is stupid! i put a ban appeal in but nevver got a respose becasue it's a ban appeal and they don't want to hear there player base get mad at them becasue they are banning whoever they want to. All i wanted to do was get on for the one times that i do to play with a couple buds and what does it say Your a account has been temorparly suspended and for what i say because it could be one of these reasons which im not going to say becasue you could look it up yourself if you really wanted to know not to be irrational.this is why it gets a bad review!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-12,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,This game is trash.No let's say it in another way.GTA is good.GTA V is also good.GTA Online is pure trash.It is fun when and if you play with a friend you know and I write this having 300 hours of it between PS3 and PS4 but at the end of day the activities you do are always the same. Grab some weapons/crates/cars and bring them to your expansive base hoping no one will come to bother you. Is this fun? No. Then why you do it? Why for money of course because Rockstar always find a way to block cheaters but I don't mean those cheaters who destroy you while well... cheating. I mean people who gain free money with a mod menu because if you want to make money in the hard way you will get bored of it before you get more than one supercar and a single office or bunker or whatever you want. And that's why those greedy a**es gave us an option to buy money with money. Cool right?! Yeah throw away 75 Euros to have 8 milions in game (and they still won't be enough). Now I'm tired I spent every single hour looking for an hacked session but I found nothing I'll just play something else.By the way if you want to play the regular GTA V then you should buy this not the best game but still fun but stay away from GTA Online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-12,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,I honestly do not know what to give this game because the singleplayer is great but the multiplayer is NOT so great even though all I play now is GTA V Online. The singleplayer is really rich in story and it is also an open world game so there are of course side missions you can complete and basically a lot of things you can do however I wished the game was more open world being able to enter any buildings etc. But overall it has a really great singleplayer mode and many things to do/take part in. However the multiplayer is just a disaster. The character customisation at the beginning is really limited and horrible followed by the incredibly long loading time it can take up to 10 minutes just to load you into the world etc. Most heists/missions are usually the same and you fail too quickly if someone in your team screws up (I did a mission with this guy before and we had to replay &gt 20 times because he kept alerting the enemies. Boring minigames annoying phone calls from people that asks you to buy a property and poorly paid tasks. I wish there was more to rob other than minimarts (like a bank etc.). I still play this game (Online) don't get me wrong and I really enjoy it because it is something unique you get to fight with other players and own several businesses making yourself a true Kingpin but it just has a bad execution and felt like the Online mode was made in a rush compared to the singleplayer mode which was well polished so I wasn't able to give a good review for this game.Overall 5.5/10 (Mostly goes to singleplayer)P.S. AIRCRAFT CONTROLS ON PC IS TERRIBLE (or maybe its just me lol),Grand Theft Auto V

I have played every GTA game since GTA3 on the PS2. Red Dead Revolver is one of my favorite games and it's older than most of the people reading this.

From racing Tron Bikes and absolutely crushing the competition to saving my son from thugs in story mode and even picking up ladies of the night in my very expensive car only to murder her after the deed is done I can say that I enjoy this game very much. This game gives you the chance to live life the way you want to without suffering the consequences. Thank you Rockstar.On top of this all DLC is free.

2018-01-02,0,0,252,False,Recommended,Before (i have been randomly suspended + all character wiped) you read this I would recommend a few specs to have before buying this game for decent settings and a stable frame rate. Trust me I have a 1050ti i3 2100 and I play 720p with the lowest settings possible and I barely get 60fps.Have anything about or higher below for good settings and 60+fps1050tiI5 74008gb ram100gb of space on hdd needed.Random bans I was recently suspended for no reason and also they wiped all my characters details. I dont mod i get money drops *not wanted* i was level 300 and something (why would i mod after all that?) but since you made me do all that and get wiped. give me a refund. i dont like this game anymore i cant even appeal for the suspension *bans are final*. this is pathetic because i know other players have been banned for no reason.Single player Play between 3 characters known as Micheal Franklin and TrevorThe story is quite big as I spent about 30 hours for the story mode for the PS4Multiplayer (GTAO) Make a character and be prepared to grind for hours to make a simple 100k. Most of the vehicles are at rediculus prices like 5 million for a rocket car when you can get a armed flying car for the same price? 11 Million for a useless yacht? Microtransactions DO NOT BUY ANY OF THEM AT ALL. It is not worth it anymore since GTAV is ending soon. And it pointless.Hiests Some of them are good. There needs to be more bank hiests in GTAO. Graphics I'm not sure about the higher graphics since I use a i3 2100 but I see videos with the redux mods and it looks really good.Mods Never used mods much on GTA so I'm not sure what to put here. Kinda just gave up after none never worked. *Dont use mods in GTAO or expect a ban*Fivem You need GTA to use this.The best thing you can use for GTARP and for servers.

2018-03-28,0,0,1758,False,Recommended,"Warning Somewhat contradictory content ahead&gt Right. So this comment was initially posted in response to an unjust ban and I will keep the entirety of that original comment below and will not change it. I do believe it contains important information to consider if you are thinking of purchasing this (or any other) Rockstar game. I stand by a lot of what I said in it and personally will most likely not purchase any further games from Rockstar or Take Two in the future unless they clean up their act in some key areas.That all said I need to acknowledge their relatively quick repair of the situation in my and at least some other peoples' cases that I am aware of. As of shortly before this edit my GTA Online account along with my character and stats has been fully restored having been banned and reset over the weekend as part of an apparent ""ban wave"". I'm very happy about that and more than a little relieved given how much time I've sunk into it.In light of the fact that they *did* take action to restore my unfairly banned account I am changing this to a ""recomended"" review BUT I strongly advise reading my original comment below. Poop most definitely occureth where Rockstar's online stuff is concerned and if you are interested in this game for its online portion (as I am) then you should go in with an awareness of some of the more glaring issues with it.I do apologise for the lengthy read but it's not exactly a cheap game. Better to know what you're getting in for.My original comment follows _____________________________________________________________________________I've been playing GTA V almost since it was released on PC. I bought it *primarily* for the online aspect and personally loved it. It's EXACTLY my cup of tea. The single player portion is also very good. Not really all that interesting to me personally but it ""is"" very good. If that's all you're interested in then go for it it was a great story. I'm only really interested in the multiplayer portion though so my review is following my experience of that. I have 1392 hrs in GTA in total as of this writing and the vast majority of that time was spent in online mode grinding missions and faffing about. I have spent all of that time using the same character and DO NOT CHEAT. I *have* however been harassed on many occassions by hackers griefers and general jerks. The griefers and jerks I try to avoid. The hackers I try to report and am just thankful that none of them have ever been the type to drop tons of hacked cash on me.But the other day out of the blue I was issued a temporary ban until next month along with the notice that my character would be reset and all my progress and properties in online mode would be forfeit. The reason given? "" You have violated the terms of service"". Ummm..... Okay? I'm pretty certain nothing I was doing or have ever done with my copy of GTA violates the terms of service. I don't cheat I don't (knowingly) exploit game mechanics and I generally stay as far away from other players as I possibly can so I don't see how I could have been interfering with other peoples' gameplay experience. Four separate tickets opened with Rockstar Support resulted in four *word for word identical* replies amounting to ""all bans are final. We don't care if you are actually guilty or not. We already have your money. Please get stuffed. Love Rockstar Support"".Strange how most courts of law in the civilised world no longer assume guilt until evidence to the contrary is provided (by the accused) but big businesses can do this with impunity and get away with it. I'll be taking this to the relevant authorities in my country. Will it help? No idea. Maybe if enough people stop bending over and taking it. I DISPISE hackers and cheaters in online games but brain dead algorithms most certainly can and *do* make mistakes. I ""know"" I'm one such case and while I'm damn certain pleanty of the people caught in this recent ban wave are guilty as charged I'm also sure there are plenty who are not.If you can be ""banned"" by a robot that same robot should be able to provide you with a damn good reason beyond a simple ""you have done something wrong"" message. Real law enforcement don't just arrest you with the statement ""you have broken the law"" so why is it okay for a company that you have paid for a service or product to take away that service or product based on a vague statement that you somehow deserve it but be under no legal obligation to tell you exactly ""how"" you deserve it? That's basically daylight robbery since you don't actually ""need"" to do something to deserve it because they have no legal obligation to tell you why.Long story short If you plan on getting invested in this game in the online portion and are a legitimate player don't count on ""playing legitimately"" to keep the ban hammer away. The algorithms have botched up before. They are STILL botching up. And Rockstar will not even ACKNOWLEDGE you if it happens to you. I LOVE this game's online portion. But I strongly advise against purchasing this game until Rockstar starts treating its ""current"" player base (paying customers) with a bit more respect.___________________________________________________________________________End of original comment.If you read this far then great stuff. I hope it wasn't too much of a rant and that it has been helpful to you. My over all opinion of GTA Online is that it's a lot of fun. It has its problems gameplay wise and it has its problems in terms of BS like the stuff discussed in my original comment but in general I consider it a good game. Sometimes R* and T2 stuff up badly but it's my hope that they can learn from it and do better in future. They make great games. They just need to bring their policies in line with the quality of those games.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-31,0,0,141,False,Not Recommended,I had to delete the old review to make this new one. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU PLAN TO PLAY ONLINE!!!!Cheaters have been rampant for half a year now and Rockstar can t handle them. They've a terrible god mode mod they can do anything they want like killing all the players at the same time or subtle stuff like fighting with infinite health. The mod is everywhere very easy to get and that's why TONS of kids have them... Usually the kids that can't play good and get mad when they lose. In every session with more than 10 players there's a cheater using the mod. It's common to see three to five cheaters at the same time ruining the game.Rockstar is not banning them they just suspend the cheaters... Probably because they've real money to spend buying things in Online. Also the report button is very well hidden in game and it's completely useless if the player logs out or if you close the game. The last time i played a cheater crashed my game because i publicly denounced him... I obviously couldn't report him after that.DONT BUY GTA V,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-13,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,I am completely frustrated with Grand Theft Auto Online my opinions will not be based on the story mode because that is great but rather on the online part that rockstar still updates. If you are gonna buy this game for online don't. Hackers control every lobby and if you don't mod you will eventually be picked on by a hacker. Hackers have spawned cops on me removed all my weapons froze me in place set me on fire from across the map and so much more. The game forces you to play with hackers if you want to make money using nightclubs businesses etc. The online portion has also lost all realism everyone now has a flying bike or car with homing rockets and machines guns. Until Rockstar fixes the hacker problem don't play online.PS Rockstar censored the word rockstar in chat lol,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-22,0,0,1143,False,Recommended,(My English isn't so great so I apologize in advance)By now everything about this game that can be said has already been said but I still want to bring in my own personal perspective and by doing so I'll devide it to single player and online. Starting with the single player. It's amazing. It's extremely rare seeing this amount of detail in world design in so many different aspects despite very few games which come by once every few years like this one. The world is insanely detailed and diverse with tiny details in every corner of the world that I can't even begin to explain. But it doesn't end in the graphical or even audio design which takes me to my next point. The game captures every corner of the american society in the most brilliantly hilarious and sarcastic way from the in game marketing to the radio channles and commercials and to the way the npc's themselves look and talk which in my opinion is one of the major strong points in the game. Even over 1000 hours of gameplay the majority of which is in the single player I still CONSTANTLY hear new lines of dialog from npc's which are consistently clever and well written. The story it self is pretty amazimg aswell which in the most brilliant way manages to bring togathr 3 different characters from 3 drastically different edges of society togather in a fantastically written plot line with funny and whimsical characters along side fun as hell and divers missions and plenty of great scripted side missions. Although at times the game embraces realism in mission design a little too much to the point of boredom. The gameplay is out of this world aswell with fantastic driving mechanics which till this day so many games don't get it quite right like they did here descent shooting mechanics and really good animations which result in really good walking animations which even though it doesn't sound like such a big deal it is very nice to see so much work put into such minor things which in my opinion is what this game is all about. Also one more point of view is the in game graphics which along side the crazy amount of detail are extremly gorgeous on max settings with long and sharp draw distance and sharp shadows phenomenal reflection and shading. The city of los santos has never seemed so vibrent and alive with a great aspect on people of an urban city and blain county has never looked so smooth and crisp with an amazing depiction of rural america. so to summarise the single player is realistic fun and detailed as hell and I couldn't recommend it more so If the single player is what interests you go and get it right away when it's frequently on sale. Now to the online. I personally believe that in it's core its still good and not rotten although the ways of progressing are extremly flawed. I love the way the online mode gives you the amazing world from the single player and allows you to do what ever the hell you want along side with friends but in order to truly enjoy you'll need money and that's where the problems begin. The game allows you to get money by doing certain jobs which are an insane grind and unless you don't have more fortunate friends who are constantly playing and can do with you heists which are big jobs who aplly you with alot of money or own a buisness than you're pretty much on your own. Everything is annoyingly expensive and the progression system is designed to push you into paying real money for microtransactions and buy in game currency. The terrible grind and the high pricing brings in more and more cheaters into the game mode who spoil the fun even more. In conclusion if you're prepared to grind or can just enjoy some dicking around with friends and willing to try and ignore the cheating the online mode can be lots of fun but I'd reccomend to stear clear of that and stick to the single player.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-23,0,0,207,False,Recommended,This game has to be split into two singleplayer and GTA online. You get both obviously but they differ quite a notch. I will keep myself short If you are loking for a singleplayer gameThis one is fantastic. I played it vanilla and loved every second. Part V is my favorite of all including Vice City and San Andreas. It is very cinematic and has a lot of nice little easter eggs. The story is basically about Max Payne living a second life under a new name from police protection programme who's befriending a joung boy struggling with criminal influences from the hood. After some time a third party joins all the fun. But I won't spoiler their relationship with each other.That beeing said I give singleplayer a 11/10. Looking for a multiplayer gameAfter playing the singleplayer I switched to multiplayer. Having read some previews before I expected nothing good. I was surprised however. GTA online has a lot to offer in regards of different gametypes and charactercustomization. There's more content than in singleplayer. There are some heist there are races you can mod your car for that purpose similar to Need for Speed like games. All in all the whole GTA O experienc remins me strongly of GTA 2 which I really like. Unfortunately two thirds of the other playrs I have interacted with only want to bully you spoling the experience to a point where it's no more fun to play. You can keep in your hideout using the ingame interweb to find a suitable gamemode but that's only a weak substitute or a classc severlist/gamemod browser.I want to give GTA O a solid 5/7 but the communitiy does spoil it rendering my rating to a 4/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-26,0,0,69,False,Recommended,This game is something I would recommend if you were going to play the single player as the multiplayer is filled with hackers cheaters and the single player has compatibility with openIV which allows you to mod the game as it is now allowed however if you want to make the most of the game you need a mod menu however it is not necessary to enjoy the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

On the good hand there are plenty of ways to make money in the game and all of them are fun. I am amazed on all the detail this game includes.

That being said this entry tries several new things and several of them succeed. It is not a perfect game but it's flaws are part of the charm.

I have never played Grand Theft Auto before so I don't have anything to compare with but this one give you various characters to play with when they become unlocked. The story line is emmersive and the cut scenes make it all the more enjoyable. There is so much to do that there is never a chance to get bored. My controller of choice is the wired afterglow xbox 360 version. I have tried keyboard and mouse and the Steam controller but my afterglow gives me full control even for rampages.

2018-09-04,0,0,86,False,Recommended,In many ways I believe GTA5 is the best in the series. I only have two issues with the game though. First I thought it was too easy. The fact you have checkpoints in every mission doesn't even make it a big deal if you die and I didn't find the missions to be particularly challenging. Fun yes. Challenging no. And second the physics were better in GTA4. I don't see why they would downgrade the physics instead of improve them... But in overall it's a great game and it gave me many hours of fun. Definitely recommend.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's always enjoyable to roam around in a sandbox kicking and taking down names. The online aspect is definitely where all the joy is to be had especially with friends. The story on the other hand is moderatly enjoyable though I mostly found myself just wanting to finish rather than enjoying it.Pros Many Hours of killing and car jacking Graphics are definitly great if you've got the gear Online has been and still is one of my favorite things to do with friendsCons Story is mediocre The money grinding online is absolutely ridiculous for some of the itemsOveral rating 9/10 It's most definitely worth having in any gamers library!

2017-12-25,0,0,1028,False,Recommended,"After nearly 1 000 hours into this game I can say I love it very much. I've loved GTA since the very 1st one which was a top down style and really fun.There's so much to do in this game that it's hard to get bored (unless all you do is solo). Lots of money to be made if you know how things work. Even just cruising around the map doing random things or just exploring the map is fun (at least for me).The part of the game that really... REALLY makes me mad is modders and the fact that R* seems to have adopted a ""no fuks givin"" attitude towards them. Yes they actively respond to complaints but it seems that modding programs are hard to detect. What's absulte BS is that modders today do everything they possibly can to destroy your fun. Whether you're doing CEO / Biker things to make money or just delivering a car to Simon for a few thousand $$ they will stop at nothing to destroy your shipments cars or set you on fire permanently so you die over and over again.Modders are the cancer of GTA 5 and it's been getting worse over time. They used to be nice and help people or gave free money to the entire lobby but R* hates modded money (which I can understand as I like to make my own money). Several months back R* removed all modded money and I was actually happy because it allowed me to FINALLY make my own. I DID however enjoy the $37 million I had aquired over time due to modders because it allowed me to try CEO / Biker businesses so I knew what I wanted whenever they did a wipe.So now I have legit businesses and it's fun. However since modders are easily banned for giving money they turned salty and are now destroying people's hard work. A lot of lobbies are with players doing their own businesses and everyone else leaves them alone that is until a modder shows up and the next thing you see is 15 Death Messages on the left of your screen because the modder killed EVERYONE. Once we re spawn we get teleported to each other and die again... and again... and yet again. At this time I've already retired from my CEO went passive and loaded up a job to do solo or joined another lobby.It's absolutely ridiculous that these little bastards just join lobbies and kill everyone or just destroy shipments / resupplies for people working on their CEO/Biker stuff and then leave. Modders can basically do anything and are completely hidden so they never get discovered.I hope one day that R* is able to crack down on modders and ban them all. That would be great.Do I recommend this game? Yes. Even with all the modder BS... it's still a really fun game.As for you modders reading this t( . t) I hope we meet IRL so I can deal with it personally.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-21,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,"Whatever millions were spent on this game wasn't worth the experience but I read their investors are happy! The GTA series has been rough for a while and this one's actually a good kick in the right direction. The world is vibrant animations and car mechanics are fluid and the 3 character dynamic was a nice breath of air. The story is meh I'm still crawling through it and I only like one of the 3 characters but the stories aren't why I play GTA. The cloud save feature is nice! I love that I don't have to manage my savefiles offline! I wish the cops' AI was more similar to IV but I like the new AI too they just seem less intelligent. The the new cop ditching system is fun ducking in cars or hiding in bushes is cool. Ignoring story I like this GTA a lot as a sandbox for havoc.The multiplayer is wretched. I don't think I've had a single good experience online and I'm afraid that's where most of Rockstar's focus is. I don't want to lobby with other players and missions are multi player only. So why play online? There is game content I'd like to access (flying motorbike extra missions for example) that is locked away in a dysfunctional network.Network aside I'm constantly being hounded to buy $multi million ventures over the phone every few minutes ventures I can't afford... every few minutes. Missions reward you with about $10 15k on success take 5 10 minutes to complete and are surrounded by at least 5 minutes of loading on each end of the event excluding any several minute cutscenes a player hasn't seen yet. So in total I'm making about $1k per minute *at best*. I'm sure there are more lucrative ways to make cash but at this rate I'm just staring at a mountain of work I don't want to deal with because the whole experience is a slow paced aggravation. With the ""success"" of GTA Online I'm willing to bet people just buy cash cards instead of earning the money in other words you can just buy game items with real world money to skip.. ""the game"". What is this world?Here's an example of my frustration I had to re play the same mission (the *first* multi player mission with Lamar) I don't know how many times with the relobbying and all the loading between.. guh if you really want to include all of that It probably took 3 hours to complete this one simple mission. It was just a few drive bys but with four players one would die and leave the lobby forcing a reset. What a terrible experience.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-27,0,0,1901,False,Not Recommended,To me this game is only fun because of multiplayer. I would never have put the hours I did into it if it were single player only and I may have played 10 hours of SP. So if you are looking for a SP review look elsewhere.I will summarize my review as to the update simply.If your average income per day includes a full heist and some missions which is a lot of playing you might break an average per day of 200k+. The combined assets of everything you can purchase with the new DLC probably reaches into the 500 600m mark and that's not including repairs insurance upgrades and consumables. 8m of in game cash costs $100 USD and even a decent car can cost you around 4 6m for instance.Add onto this that you can be banned permanently for doing nothing wrong and there are reports of this in the reviews and you can see how this is one of the grindiest games you can play.There needs to be a GTA Online that's expanded and made fair that isn't done by Rockstar (who censors their own name in game chat btw) because this is a lot of fun up until someone decides you shouldn't have it anymore.Original review (with thumbs up) This is one of the best games I've ever played which sucks because it's also one of the ing stupidest micro transaction systems ever. If Rockstar/Take Two make GTA6 and can somehow avoid the entire dumpster fire of Shark cards and make a fun game I'll be all over it but at the rate they're going based off of previous ban waves they're likely to blame the consumer and change nothing.Only saying yes because the game itself is very fun but everything else about it when it comes to buying things is terrible.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-01,0,0,87,False,Not Recommended,At first the game was great fun. The enjoyment is wearing off very fast though. I'll try and keep this very short with pros cons. With the exception of a few big cons I found with the game. (My opinion).Pros. Game looks great it was optimized very well In my opinion. Campaign is fun Online is great with friends if you have 4 including yourself Vast amount of things to do online missions game moads and heists of courseCons. FPS aiming down sights doesn't really work that well (The game wasn't designed for it so what did you expect) using the dot for aiming in first person is great though. Flying mechanics (Not the controls) are the worst I have ever come accross in any game. Vehicles tend to float through the air when doing jumps almost like zero gravity. Looks very silly and you are able to move your vehicle in mid air? really annoying. You have to WIN races in order to unlock upgrades for certain vehicle components (Should have made it compete in rather than having to win) No plastic surgeon or option to allow you the ability for changing appearance online Enemy AI online are able to blind fire with any weapon and hit you from hundreds of yards away while you snipe. This is incredibly frustrating. The AI on hard difficulty seem to have far to much accuracy when blind firing at long range I find myself constantly applying body armour or blind firing back from cover in order not to be hit making fire fights last longer than they should. Online difficulty ballance. This one is the major problem that almost ruins the game for me. The higher the difficulty the more damage you take that's fine but.. Rockstar also chose the path of giving enemies enormous amounts of health. This is where the problem lies you can stand over an enemy and fire 7 shotgun rounds into him before he dies. Go for headshots? yep certain enemies will stilll take huge amounts of damage even enemies without bullet proof helmets take several shots to the head. Online At first the game felt great but as you level up the game becomes incredibly frustrating and I find myself playin for shorter lengths of time when I get on. Campaign Is great fun. Online with friends is where the fun really is though for a while anyway.As an Australian I cannot recommend this game for it's high price. The value really isn't there.I definitely would have preferred Red Dead Redemption.,Grand Theft Auto V

You either die the hero or live long enough to see your favorite game become another micro transaction generator. In short taketwo has made mods illegal. The only reason I bought the pc version was to mod. That was the THIRD time I paid for the game. If 180$ isn't enough for you guys I can live without your game. If I could refund I would. But I'm fine with just never playing gta v ever again. I won't buy or play the next gta to come out either because I can already tell what it's going to be. Just another cash cow. It's disgusting nowadays how game developers try to get their money.UPDATE Take two have gone back on their decision to try to kill mods. So with that I'll give em a thumbs up. But we shouldn't forget what happened here. Take two showed their true colors and we as a community said we weren't going to stand for that crap.

2017-06-13,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,"I already had been debating stopping based on the honestly ridiculous levels of misogyny and transphobia covered by a thin layer of ""JUST JOKING XDDD"" but then apparently my 2 minutes of online play were considered to have been hacking and I lost all the money I'd earned along with the 2 million from the cash card that was bundled with the game.Bottom line controls work as wonkily as in IV game has a serious issue with failing at satire (even the arguments I agreed with felt half and just created to rub in the opposing side's face also why the hell does this game hate celebrities so so so much? It's obviously not their money given that it's GTA... I guess the creators are jealous?) story is rather nice and fascinating but ultimately not enough to justify a full price tag and Online will just result in your character's money being taken by the developers.BUY IF AND ONLY IF you want a single player GTA more polished than IV you don't mind bad frame dropping issues you can stomach really bizarre and offensive treatments of people who don't deserve it (and a lot at people who do but honestly I don't think that's really an issue) you have a controller mic and rig capable of running this monster you don't intend to do anything but drive (list of things that suck to control swimming flying boating running biking gunning from any vehicle melee combat close range ranged combat and probably some other things I haven't experienced) you don't mind loading screens that last forever and the game's on sale at more than 50% off.DON'T BUY otherwise and ESPECIALLY not with bundled online cash which WILL be flagged and taken.SP 7/10 playable and sometimes enjoyable but shallow and with some glaring issues (plus seriously offensive content towards women trans people latinx people and occasionally gay people and this isn't a case of ""offending everyone "" this game absolutely loves its male early 20s to late 30s demographic) and requires ridiculous specs.MP 3/10.

Destroying a games reviews as quickly as a company tarnishes their reputation can certainly spark change it seems.Thankfully Take Two has allowed the OpenIV team to continue work on modding.The game is fun to mess around in. Glitchy but not terribly glitchy. And overall it's worth the moeny.However GTA Online still has a massive problem with it costing so much in game currency to get any of the new thing you have to sell half of your old things. Original Review Dear Rockstar What's next? Having a month subscription just to access your garages online? Having to serve in game jail time for your crimes you commit in game? You've pulled a Bethesda. Not only is GTA Online basically pay to enjoy at this point but you also shut down a huge portion of the GTA 5 Singleplayer mod scene. As a result of your terrible decisions your game has plumeted to an Overwhelmingly Negative score. However you can fix this. All you need is to man up admit you made a huge mistake and let the Open IV team continue their work. I'm sure if you do this you'll have a better review than Day One Garry's Incident.I really do enjoy your game however your incompetence as a company makes me sick. The cease and desist was completely out of the blue and has virtually no reason to have happened seeing as Open IV has NOTHING to do with GTA Online. You can fix this. PLEASE.

It has a tons of races or adversary modes that you can play with friends. You can fly different types of aircraft or drive boats and such. A huge map for players to explore. We had a lot of fun time in this game.Here's the downsides The Optimizations It is important to have a good optimization for players which can affects players gameplay experience. I would say it is DECENT. You do need a decent PC to run this game smoothly.All the vehicles are VERY VERY expensive. Which forces you to use the microtransactions ( Shark Cards ).Tryhards They are extremely annoying. You can't have fun if they are in the same lobby.The Anti Cheat System I don't see any updates about the anti cheat system from Rockstar. This cause Modders appear in this game. They usually interrupt your gameplay experience.This game is fun overall but the downsides actually annoys you. Sorry for not being able to use proper grammar.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,504,False,Recommended,I HIGHLY recommend this game. Its some of the most fun ive had in a long time. The story mode is FANTASTIC and the multiplayer is really fun too. Though i cant seem to connect to public servers very well. I suggest that if you want to play online do some closed sessions with friends. I noticed that rockstar is trying to do these shark cards? Basically buying in game money with real life money. Some people are complaining about that but honestly its not hard to get the money if you have people to heist with or to do some missions with. I can't say that im happy about the mods situation though. Alot of people are getting banned for using single player mods and im very sad to see this. I hate that people are giving the game a bad review solely for this reason. If you have read this far you are awesome! If you dont own this game on another console then go ahead and buy it! But if you do own it on another console and want to get it on PC i suggest that you wait to see if Rockstar changes their modding policies. Thank you for taking my opinion into consideration and have a nice day. D,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-11,0,0,397,False,Recommended,EDITED 12/15/15 OLD NOT RECOMMENDED REVIEW I love this game. Really. I do. I'm level 95 I love creating jobs I love playing with cool people who actually follow the rules for the custom job.... But that happens like every hour. once. every. hour. Why? Because Rockstar doesn't know how to moderate their god damn game and instead lets hackers and griefers run COMPLETELY UNCHECKED. This makes the game nearly unplayable and dare i say it it makes me regret getting rid of my xbox 360. YEAH THIS PROBLEM IS THAT BAD.EDIT The hacker problem seems to have been cornered off... not solved... but cornered off. So I can actually play the game this time around. It's not perfect but it'll do for now.GTA 5 is one of my favorite games of all time and the freemode events update made it so much better because there is no longer an inscentive for trolls to kill people because they get nothing from it. Freemode events are something that brings lobbies together in fair competition.My review for GTA 5 from this moment on will be positive.FURTHER EDIT THIS NEW UPDATE IS FREAKING AWESOME.

Grand Theft Auto V's world is both immersive and entertaining with numerous activies and a litter of fast cars planes and boats along with npcs to populate it. The story is hilarious and extremely fun to play through multiple times. The characters are well written along with the plot and you have feelings for digital characters populating your screen. Then there is online. Grand Theft Auto Online is one of the key selling points of this game. The ability to create your own GTA character is amazing with great customization options and the feeling of being able to live as a criminal however you want is worth another $69.99 alone.The graphics in this game are amazing and it is so well optimised that even my GTX 850m can run it on ultra with all anti aliasing and every other option on at a solid 60fps without drop.

2018-04-06,0,0,544,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto Five Online Review.Grand Theft Auto five online is mostly positive rewarding experience however there are gripes and common pit falls with the abundance of online hackers/glitchers in most online lobbies.But as far as content release Rockstar seem to be doing a pretty good job streaming consistent regular content although this game does echo fair grinding in terms of money to spend on anything remotely fun and enjoyable content in game be it cars weapons or property ( including various businesses) as the investment reaps rewards.Definitely playing with friends is a lot more enjoyable and you will spend your mission reward money on various personal customisations be it on hair styles clothes tattoos or masks.Obviously from the previous GTA 4 title car modification shots make a comeback in its strongest form yet in terms of customising a lot of vehicles (mostly any vehicle going as long as you own high end rides) all with varying degrees of customisable options.There is a pimp my ride style shop for ultimate customisation and showing off but this will set you back quite a lot money but definitely looks the coolest in my opinion.If missions are not your thing there are a lot of races coming in varying amount of different type s straight races time trials point to point and vehicle weaponized death match races. All in the format of cars boats motorbikes quad bikes and bicycles. There is also a transformers race which takes all these into consideration and changes you into the various vehicle classes when you hit a point in the race. It s different and enjoyable and also frustrating if you make an error it is unforgiving.There is other content including parachuting survival mode wave based attacks of enemies increasing in difficulty various sports sport games to name a few golf and tennis.There is a lot more content that I personally have got round to trying.I only did the things I enjoy which are fine for me and my friends. We do sometimes want to branch out and try something new to see how it goes.As a quick summary would say personally for me GTA 5 online is best enjoyed with friends as a much better enjoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this game and if you can to start out with someone who knows the game (friend or social gamer) will help get you on your feet a lot quicker.Thank you for reading my first review it may be a bit quirky but I hope this helps you in reaching a decision about the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-06,0,0,848,False,Not Recommended,PAY 2 ENJOY ____And Here's Why_____ This game started off fun and good.But with each update the developers showed more and more of their greed.Vehicles Weapons Mission Progression Business Enterprises Buildings have become so expensive throughout this game's lifetime that it is merely impossible to casually achieve anything in this game.You are instead required to grind or use real money to buy shark cards which you can then use to make these purchases.Simple contact missions which used to be a core element in the game no longer pay you a fair amount. To put that into perspective. On average a contact missions awarded the players 10 20k and the most expensive vehicle at the time of launch was 1 million. (50 Contact Missions The oppurtunity to buy the most expensive car at launch)Now however the prices for everything in the game have went up but the payout has not be increased respectively.If you're planning to buy a new vehicle building or an enterprise to cotinue progressing in the game you will need atleast 3 million + excess to cover mechanic charges and bills for your apartments (which you can't sell). All that money gets blown the moment you make a purchase and you're back at squaure one having to grind your way to 3+ million to make another purchase.If you're aiming to get the best locations fully upgraded you're simply looking at 6+ million.If you only use contact missions to grind which have max payout (20k) which on average takes 20 minutes you're expected to do the mission 300 times which would take 4 days straight to complete. All that just for a garage for the car heist dlc. (And that is ignoring the charges for the mechanic in game waiting time lobby's to fill up etc...)Put simply the game is Pay 2 Play and Enjoy. If you buy the game you'll be satisfied for a while but then when you want to try all the missions and own a part of every dlc you're going to find yourself miserably poor.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-16,0,0,243,False,Recommended,Well i guess it's a good game? Gta 5 is literally one of the funnest games i've played if we're talking about missions jobs or playing with friends SO FUN! Besides that lets talk about the elephant in the room the game is balanced on the pay to win factor super grind factor and the modding factor. If you start fresh in the game it's nearly impossible to beat anyone at anything or even make money to beat anyone in a race your pretty much required to have a 2.2 million dollar supercar. btw thats a huge investment making between 2 30k a 10 minute race. Usually you'll find yourself being abused by a flying car that shoots heat seeking rockets or a tryhard asshat in a jet ruining everyone's experience in the game. Can't lose if there's no one that hasn't uninstalled the game from rage? To this day i cant find one season in a whole year that won't have a toxic player modder and ect. those kind of people are wasting their life shooting innocent noobs just trying to make money (and) if we're talking about the millions of modders putting everyone in cages or taking their hard earned weapons and destroying their vehicles... Or straight kicking them from the game X(. It also pisses me off how much time you have to invest into the game to actually be able to afford something. I could spend my time in a day doing jobs and make in between 1 3 million if i don't mess up and only do that all day. or i could spend my real money to get the same amount in a couple of seconds. I guess that's aspect of (( PAY TO WIN))). Eventually the loading screens will kill you or not spending 100 (REAL LIFE DOLLERS. to get 8 million in game) will. BTW that's 2/3 of a jet in the game. But to sum it up in very simpler terms fun irritating very pay to win and very unbalanced.,Grand Theft Auto V

As of the 14th of June 2017 I can no longer recommend this game to anybody.They've taken away the appeal of the single player by giving the OpenIV team a cease and desist notice (OpenIV is like the backbone of mods). The story is still the best single player story in a GTA game but mods make the game so much better.As for GTA Online that can go itself. It's a microtransaction ladden hell hole you don't get to about and have fun unless you have money in the game And it's so grindy that it relies on you buying shark cards or finding a modder in the online (which is never gonna happen anymore). To me i have zero reason to play GTA V again. I've finished it 4 times the online is only fun when friends wanna play and even then you're worried about losing money every waking moment. The only fun there is is driving around the single player by myself and you can only do that so much before the game gets boring. TL DR unless Take Two stop this I would never recommend this game to anybody.,Grand Theft Auto V

Its intense and hard at the same timeI also like the GTA online mode were you can play with all sorts of people and have funIt feels like its pay to win and it kinda is. Real money is as easy to spend all of it just as it is in the game.Like really a t shirt is like 1000 dollars. Ammo and guns is the most expensive thing you will getI say that because you want to buy a lot of it because people in this game are like trolls and will try to mess you up.For this review my rating for the story mode is 9/10 the gta v online gets a rating of 6/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-17,0,0,98,False,Recommended,Actually gonna give this game a thumb up. The game is not perfect but you can really have fun through the game and of course if you have friends to play with. Graphics are really good and the optimization is perfect. Just all I can say is perfect. Game by itself is boring to play alone but you can still have fun even alone but you will get the best experience when you will play it with your friends. Game is full of modders cheaters however you want to call them but you know if they are not harassing you if they are cheating for themselves then just ignore them and try to have fun but if they are trying to harass you and keep throwing things on you or something like that just report them and go to another session. Believe me. Don't cheat don't mod your money I know it's really easy to find a undetected cheat because the game's anticheat is t but don't do it it's not funny. Things that the game needs to fix is the loading screen and of course ban cheaters and get a better anticheat. There are a little things they need to fix and they need to update but these 2 are the most biggest and most important ones. After all I will just say that if you have friends to play this game with definetly buy it. If you are alone you can still buy it but I can not promise you to really have a lot of fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-08,0,0,481,False,Recommended,I started out solo with GTA Online and it was a rough start trying to get money saved up. But once you get a business running it gets better. It eventually got to the point though where I was starting to lose interest. That is until I met a great group of friends who recommended Discord chat. We now have our own small crew of people we can trust and get along with and I must say it has made this game 1 000x better then it was before. When you have a group of people who are also willing to help grind for money and are able to have fun doing it...it reminds me why I loved this game to begin with. Really brings back the nostalgia of it allSo if I had at least 1 recommendation make sure you're able to use voice chat (Discord is the popular program choice) Online gameplay isn't the same without it,Grand Theft Auto V

Don't believe me? Literally look anywhere on Steam and on Forums... I can say a GOOD chunk of bans are innocent people that haven't hacked a day in their life. Will this ever get fixed?

2017-06-17,0,0,568,False,Recommended,At 500 hours of gametime on PC alone I can say that grand theft auto 5 is an open world sandbox whome is a great experience. It has an interesting online multiplayer component which is not the shine of this game and I cannot personally reccomend it however when you throw mods into the mix you get an experience whose limits are defined by your computers capabilities. There are modded multiplayer servers where it's similar to online however you roleplay as anything you want anytime you like! Albeit most of these servers has rules. Some remove pedestrians and have it an empty experience while some expand on every aspect making it hard for inexperienced players to join in.CampaignThere is a great long campaign which is about 70% of the main game. The campaign has many bugs and occasional issues like in the mission where you chase the lady for the certain analog recording at the airport the vehicles go through a closed gate a military aicraft takes off from the helipad while sometimes 2 jets will take off and land on the runway at once during the mission.There is alot of scripted sequences that is a shame that you cannot alter in anyway.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-16,0,0,167,False,Not Recommended,This is probably one of the best single player experiences i've ever enjoyed. It's a very vivid and alive world and the story is phenomenal and engaging. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is smooth.But if you're playing it for the multiplayer... I unfortunately have to contend that it is one of the worst experiences you can have at the moment. Let me paint you a picture You and your friends are cruising around taking part in the various things to do in the packed world of GTA Online. Maybe you're looking at properties or showing off new vehicles and gear. It's all well and good until somebody who dished either actual money into the game or an insane amount of time takes it upon himself to hunt you down repeatedly and kill you over and over. Then should you choose to go into passive mode will probably be taunted or griefed in such a way that even passive mode doesn't save you. Of course you could go into a different server but your very likely to run into the same situation. Better yet you might just be trapped in a cage or repeatedly explode thanks to the efforts of a modder. In short get this game on sale if you've never experienced the story but stay far far away from the online unless you're just desperate to play with your friends.TL DR The single player is good but the online is a toxic wasteland.,Grand Theft Auto V

I clearly didn't jump on the band wagon when the whole hype about this game got released way back in 2013. However after 5 years of waiting I finally got to play GTA V.So far I've played a good 17 hours of pure fun and mayhem and without a shadow of a doubt I can categorically say it's the best game I've played in a long while. The open world game is just mesmerising as you drive a long the streets of Los Santos. It's action packed crazy and mindless fun. The story is so compelling and interesting. I love the characters. Most of them are just stupidly hilarious. The graphics just blow me away. It's 2018 and I still feel if this game were to be released today it would still be on par with the current games. I'm playing on max settings on my PC (Specs below). I get a solid 70 75 fps but in grassy areas it drops down to mid to low 40s but that's ok. I play with vsync on and 90% of the time I get smooth 60fps. So I abslolutely recommend this game. It is a must have and GTA V is on sale now for an absolute bargain for $20.

2018-07-06,0,0,60,False,Recommended,"GTA 5 (Singleplayer) is a great game everythin you'd want from a GTA game and more. I enjoyed it on Xbox and I enjoy the improved PC version just as much. But the reason for my review is offcourse GTA Online.Absolute utter garbage. There is zero incentive by R* to create a decent community it's basically everything bad that happened to gaming in one. There is gacha elements constant ""advertising"" by NPCs to make you buy that car / facility / factory facebook esque gaming vibe.You are constantly remininded of the fact that OTHER PLAYERS are there supposedly to you up. As such nobody trusts anybody. You could just be minding your own business and all of a sudden you're dead because that other guy thought you we're going to kill him. So you start having to kill every player in sight to get anything done. Or just run and get nothing done. There is no dedicated servers meaning your loading times can last for up to 20 minutes if you're unlucky.The game is riddled with people who do nothing more than hunt down new players in their Attack Helicopters or kill you AFTER you group with them only to steal the money you just earned TOGETHER.Crews are meaningless they're just 4 lettres next to your name. Other than a handful of extra cash / reputation you gain absolutely nothing from being in a crew. Motorcycle Clubs or Corporations are just as bad. You can't sit in both at the same time forcing you to go through the creation process EVERY TIME you relog get a new session... If you are running said Club / Corp you'll have to leave it if you want to help your friends with their Club / Corp. Having to juggle something as simple as what is in essence a ""clan"" is horrible.Now I could deal with most of these things but what I find absolutely appaling is the artificial difficulty they put upon GTA Online (compared to GTA SP) everything is outrageously expensive compared to the amount of money you can make. I received one free shark card with my purchase of GTA O worth 1.25M in game and without it I am certain I would've had to grind 20 30 hours in order to buy an appartment / some weaponry / a personal vehicle. (All of them cheap!) Because of the card I got somewhat of a headstart but it just made it so much more apparent I would have to again grind hours and hours in order to be albe to do a Heist with my friend. Or to expand my Motorclub to be actually usefull. Another big no no is the amount of content / DLC added to GTA O that was PURPOSEFULLY omitted from the single player version. There is 100s of vehicles and dozens of weapons / locations that are not accessible in single player. Why? THey need you to play GTA O start hating it and eventually cave in to shark cards.That is the gamingloop GTA O banks on grind your buy the thing discover you need to use the thing to grind even more . Repeat ad infinitum. No wonder the game is rampant with hackers and cheaters. I met someone who got 200M from a hacker that guy is now enjoying the game as he can buy (maybe 25% of) all things and just play y'know. But to get anywhere near his level I'm looking at atleast 150h investment. This would be no problem if the game was atleast fun but it's not.GTA Singleplayer outshines GTA O in every single way possible. The only reason I'd ever recommend this game is if you'd play it with a closed group. Get atleast 3 more people and do nothing with randoms only play with your 3 other friends. Maybe just maybe the game would be enjoyable. But trying to do things with just 1 real partner is impossible.All in all I'd say I regret my descision of buying this game and it saddens me that GTA O absolutely shrekt Rockstars reputation for me. I've been a loyal fan / buyer since their very first game but the fact that they'd allow this piece of to bear their name and clearly have no issue with it is the final red flag. I will NOT be buying GTA 6 or RDR2 for that matter.",Grand Theft Auto V

I believe that if you play the online portion if you never play any content released after the heists dlc you will enjoy it. After heists it became a grind for everything the game became a boring wait game. Bikers waiting. Gunrunning waiting. The whole game is a wait fest now. Its like a clicker game except its 60 dollars. So if you wanna play gta online find a friend or 2 and play the online up to the heists dlc then never play the dlcs added after. And never go into a public lobby rockstar unfairly bans because their cheat detection is Rockstar is a cash hungry company the whole point of the modern gta online is to push shark cards. Don't support that don't buy shark cards,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-20,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,Played this game legitimately for probably 200 hours on xbox. Switched to pc and literally had to mod it to be able to afford to do anything.this isnt to shame gta5 this is simply to shed light on a current truth.Currently the online portion of this game is unplayable. It doesnt matter how much free bull winding content Rockstar releases It's all so insanely expensive you have to pour a part time jobs worth of time into it weekly to see small returns.Players simply can not work together to complete heists there is no team work to the game at all which makes it incredibly boring after about 25 minutes.The shark cards are a wash. Seriously Rockstar if you read these reviews wake the fluck up. Nobody in the right mind will pay those prices for that little return when they can just buy the game every time it goes on sale for the same price and mod it or just quit the game as I and many others have.This is just a pc review Imagine how much more terrible the reviews would be for console where these problems are completely enveloping the online experience.What youve done here is made it impossble to move. Even before hacking and modding as a well off player I still couldnt reach your ridiculous numbers.With each dlc you release this problem this overwhelming sinkhole increases. You just released this Import/export dlc. You have $20 000 cars that run you a $25 000 bill to repair $20 000 to mod and out of the $100 000 after all the damage you're lucky to take home 50 000.By the way the dlc car prices are absolutely stupid. Fire who set that thats just a joke.You keep banning the people who actually make the game playable or who are actually interested in your sinkhole and soon youll find yourself with a very limited playerbase.sincerely your game is garbage.,Grand Theft Auto V

This is a punishment they dole out for cheaters but I never participated in or would know how to hack or mod or cheat. Just a freak error on their part but guess what?

2015-05-29,0,0,401,False,Not Recommended,Hackers Arsehats and children seems to be 90% of the population in this game.Game itself is good just needs better matchmaking and an anti cheat system of some sort. (VAC would be nice) I can find myself only being able to play story mode or invite only sessions with friends. Do I recommend it? No. Not unless you have a group of friends about 6+ that also have the game and are willing to play with you because that's the only way that the multiplayer will be fun. Otherwise it's just people hacking people in tanks or kids screaming at eachother about stupid crap. Breakdown Pros Good graphics Nice story Decent sized array of guns Amaizing cars and driving fairly realistic (as far as they can get without being an actual racing game) Good character customizations First Person is really well done. Cons Needs a anti cheat system BADLY. (Have gone server hoping for 8 servers before finding one without a hacker) Those who aren't hacking are either idiotic or kids screaming You need a decent group of friends to enjoy the game fully Most of the music is quite garbage but every now and then a nice track will come on. (This is an opinion.) About the last one a way to add in your own music or do something like in Saints Row where you can create your own station to listen to where you pick what tracks play on it. Takes about 10 minutes to load EDIT Was banned for a month and had my account reset for no reason. Now that Rockstar has actually started to ban people they're a bit TOO ban happy. Throwing account resets and bans around for no reason at all other than because they feel like it with no option for an appeal. Rockstar does not give a single damn about their playerbase. All they want is to make money and if they have a slight suspicious that someone may have cheated in some way even if they didn't they do not give a warning they do not give an option for an appeal. They just ban you outright and throw away all your hard work. Rockstar is one of the worst game developers out there right now because of this issue.248 hours and $60 down the drain for a game that banned me for no reason. Good job Rockstar.,Grand Theft Auto V

People blame everything on modders and i do myself i think they should off modders should respect that i want to play legit. People calls me to me for saying that it ruins my experience and i want to play how it's meant to be played. Go back to singleplayer where you belong instead of spawning thousands of planes infront of me. I don't really mind the grind but i mind the people that is grinding. People think that it's some kind of race to get the best equipment/car or whatever before everyone else. And that's ok but not doing anything other than sniping hiest and repeating the same ing mission is ridiculous. You can never get anything fun done because people rarely care about that. I nearly beg people on my knees licking their boots and they wouldn't give 2 s to join my lobby. And that gets me to the worst part of it all is the matchmaking system the ing matchmaking system i love it so much. All the countless hours i have stared at a lobby screen is probably 50% of the hours. Two times today when i made myself a lobby it always end in me nearly commiting suicide on how bad it is. It invites the same ing people over and over again. Wow gj rockstar and invite friends of friends of friends. Amazing system!!! That was litterally 2 hours of my day and don't get me started on the ing p2p system you should think that a company as big as rockstar could afford dedicated server that should be a common thing among AAA Titles. And people actually defend both sites what a bunch of s. One side defends modders. Because they don't want to grind but that always ruin the experience for others and they litterally cage you up until you say sorry for saying off what a bunch off es. And the otherside is people defending the system and is litterally grinding day/night. Join a crew get more friends. That don't help all if people don't give a anyway.If you want online gta fun. Buy san andreas and download sa mp. 1000000* better than this Because let's get real you have already bought this game on one of the other consoles. You will keep supporting rockstar market strategy holding off pc version until people want it so bad that they will buy the game again. And i'm guilty as .

2017-01-06,0,0,53,False,Not Recommended,What really killed GTA online for me is when I got back on after a few months break and was almost immediately killed by a flying motorcycle shooting rockets. It wasn't even the fact that it was a preposterous concept it was the fact that there was nothing I could do to stop him. He could evade homing rockets with ease and guns did nothing while my jets couldn't even get the chance to launch not to mention evade his missiles. If I wanted to get the same vehicle to counter him I would have had to grind for months (for something I DIDN'T actually want) or spend several days pay on a few shark cards. At that point it truly was a pay to win game and it killed me inside. GTA V particularly online was one of my favorite games. I played for well over 800 hours on xbox and then PC attaining a level near 300. I LOVED that game. Realizing my time with it was over and not by my choice really hit me hard. Now I cant have that kind of dedication in any game due to work and responsibilities. The pay to win aspect of the game ended it for me. No matter how much I work ill never be able to afford a super yacht and no matter how much I play Ill never be able to afford a virtual one either. And so Ill never buy another rockstar game again. Not out of anger or spite but simply because I cant afford it be it money or time.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-12,0,0,641,False,Recommended,This game is fun until you get to a higher level (online) like 40 50+.At first you do missions with your homies get weapons get cars get a house and it's all cool until the game starts feeling more like a competition of who kills the most people either with their hydras kurumas or insurgents. I swear to god this is the most annoying part of all when you just wait inside your car (for a friend or idk) and some random a**hole shoots you through the windshield just because he was passing by or when you just finished customizing your new car and a hydra comes flying towards you and destroys it.But overall it's a good game you can escape the cancer by staying on Passive Mode or by joining a private session with your friends/crewmates .There are many awesome things to do it's very unlikely to get bored.

2017-12-12,0,0,410,False,Not Recommended,Really good single player campaign but GTA Online is an exercise in frustration. It takes a very long time to load into a session and you are never automatically placed in a session with friends when starting the game.GTA Online is rife with hacking which usually means you die a lot to people that spawn the best weaponry or you get kicked from the game because you're being gifted cash or somehow killing everybody in the session instantly.If you can get a team of friends together the Heist missions in GTA Online are instanced so there's no way to be griefed there and you have an objective.Update Changing review to negative because the load times for GTA Online coupled with the cheating and Rockstar's attitude to both (ignoring it) is unacceptable.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,220,False,Not Recommended,Don't buy this game for any reason other than modding the singleplayer and even then don't count on them not taking the chance to get rid of it once more.The multiplayer is filled with boring grinding modders that serve only to destroy your hard earned vehicles and to toy with you like their own playthings. Even ignoring this the matchmaking is awful. The game tries to get a semi MMO thing going but instead just puts you in sessions with players who have put a significantly larger amount of time and effort into the game than you have. This essentially means people chasing you on rocket bikes across the map just because killing you might give them some more in game money. Which is another problem. Most things can be bought with the money. Unfortunately grinding for it takes ages and if you splurge it's gone in seconds. Of course if you've managed to steal mommy's credit card you can feed R*'s gaping maw with cash you will never see again in exchange for pitiable amounts of in game currency. Please don't ever do this. Don't buy this game. Just torrent it.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game itself is easy to hack and I've seen youtubers posting hacks for free online. This game a so requires a quite good PC to run at high.

2016-12-14,0,0,123,False,Recommended,GTA V has become a highly respected game over the years and there are countless reasons for this from the truly beautiful and packed open world to the genuinely interesting characters of the story. Rockstar has managed to create a world which feels alive and real. I have played well over 200 hours (Xbox + Steam) and there is still so much to experience. The majority of these hours were spent in GTA V Online which in my opinion is Rockstar's greatest achievement with this game. The ability to race shoot and explore in Los Santos with friends creates an incredible gameplay experience. Playing with other players who all have the same level of freedom as you creates an infinite ray of opportuities. I understand that games with too much freedom of what you can do can be lacking in gameplay however Rockstar has overcome this in GTA V Online by releasing free additional content regularly. With these expansions come new cars weapons missions and gameplay mechanics. Due to this the game never loses its ability to keep the player hooked and before you know it you've punched another 10 hours into the game. The visuals audio and atmosphere are all here the game doesn't lack in anything. Gta V is a masterpiece which has and will stand tall for years to come. 10//10,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-18,0,0,340,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open world games aspire and it s incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do explore and play with both in single player and multiplayer plus great creative tools it s truly amazing on multiple levels.,Grand Theft Auto V

However I never really enjoyed GTA online and now TakeTwo have taken actions that make mods impossible for single player using multiplayer cheats as an excuse despite the fact that the mod tool actively prohibits this. It is undoubtably really because of the microtransactions (""Shark Cards"") that allow you to purchase online mode currency and the fact that you could get previously multiplayer only vehicles in single player through mods. However they took a heavy handed approach and effectively prohibited all modding outright. I will never play this game without mods and if that means I never play it again so be it.

2017-04-29,0,0,434,False,Recommended,Single player is flawless. A true masterpiece. Online gameplay is fun at most considering the obvious lack of gameplay reviewing and correcting by Rockstar. Innumerous glitches exploits third party cheating enabling in general excessively long loading times and bizarre respawning system that sometimes makes you go passive mode or leave seassion to stop being owned by positioned players instead of having a chance to regroup and plan your comeback. All of that has to be due to their focus on singleplayer game creation and this is the reason I can't blame the company for almost all of this. Their ability to make masterpieces since their first GTA game is impeccable. Singleplayer gameplay and storyline 10/10 online gameplay 6.5/10. Graphics are awesome too!,Grand Theft Auto V

They didn't even bother to remove the hourly reminder in the game without which I never would have known I'm playing an imcomplete game. It took Rockstar a full 24 hours before they even released they had forgotton about it and released a statement saying ""Oh yeah that's not updated yet we'll get around to that someday""So on one hand I'm glad they delayed the game the extra months because clearly even with the extra time they still weren't able to test or complete the full game experience. And on the other hand I can't stomach playing the game with a hourly reminder that i'm not playing the 'Full Game'Here is a link to the only official response I have heard from Rockstar on this matter.

2018-09-03,0,0,72,False,Recommended,I played GTA V when it first launched on Xbox 360 and now I'm replaying it for PC. After 5 years this game is still a masterpiece one of the best GTA games and possibly one of the best games of all time. There's a reason it still sells so well after all this time.GTA V has something for everyone inlcuding the classic GTA tropes we all love. Want to go for a scenic mountain drive above Vinewood Hills? Done. Want to pick up a prostitute? Go for it. Want to pick up a prostitute and take her for a scenic mountain drive above Vinewood Hills? Of course you do. The sheer volume of distractions afforded to you in GTA V is astounding as is the world you're dropped into. Los Santos is enrapturing. Driving around isn't boring or a grind it's literally the best way to take in the world.The driving mechanics and gunplay are the best they've ever been. The graphical upgrades are significant textures lighting reflections and water all look amazing. The three protaganists are great and their individual stories as well as the overarching narrative are engaging. I found the controls to be equally suited to keyboard/mouse or a controller. There's really not much to complain about with the offline story mode except for Rockstar's unwillingess to develop any DLC for it unlike with GTA IV. Instead they've elected to focus on GTA Online which is a mixed bag by most accounts.Admittedly GTA V has gotten some rebuke for the way Rockstar handles GTA Online and all that goes with that the cheating the way Rockstar handles mods players being wrongfully banned a toxic community etc. However I don't think GTA Online should be lumped in with the brilliant single player story mode they should be looked at and weighed separately.GTA V was an instant classic and 5 years later it's still one of the best games you can play. It's something of a phenomena how every GTA game manages to be better than the last. Perhaps that's why it has been 5 years with no word of a sequel? GTA V will be hard to top.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-11,0,0,248,False,Recommended,"The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre ordering games but I made one exception this year for GTA and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch because the game is ridiculously big. I'm running it at 60 90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on ""high"" except for the advanced options which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680 which is a few years old now so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.You can play GTA in first or third person mode and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting swimming walking can also be done in first person so you can just pick what you like the best.If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world but also in certain quests. Michael Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character Niko.GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single player experience but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run but to play free roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12 so that might refresh things even more.I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it at least for the driving. You can enable auto aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit ""Z"" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard mouse and controller so thats really good but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed so I will just see GTA online as a plus.Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends whether your the single or multiplayer guy you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,2424,False,Recommended,This review has been updated after spending more time in gameSingleplayer story mode is good just like in previous installments. Hasn't received any content update since launch.Online mode is really bad. Getting any amount of money is a horrible grind. New expansions only add more properties and stuff to buy while not giving you the ability to make money any faster. Hackers are everywhere. You risk being banned because a hacker dropped money on you.Getting money isn't that hard you just have to know what to do and invest in properties and useful vehicles (like the Buzzard) instead of spending on toys. Hackers are not that common anymore and Rockstar doesn't ban for what a modder has done to you.Netcode is atrocious can be funky no official servers all P2P based if you play with friends and do some jobs/races together then exit to freemode you get dumped into a public session. Sometimes you'll get stuck on loading screen for a few minutes for no reason.Mind you I've had some fun in it but only because I had a group of friends to play with. Otherwise I'd avoid it completely.It's more fun than that. There is a good variety of things to do even alone.

GTA 5 lets you do anything you want in an amazing open world full of details seriously rockstar put soo much detail into this game its truly fascinating. The single player mode offers many hours of fun and when it gets boring you have countless of mods to spice up the gameplay which is an amazing aspect that only PC can offer. Although the ban waves on GTA Online keeps me and many other players away from GTA Online the game really shines in single player. If you want to play GTA Online honestly the best way to do so is on console in order to avoid random bans. All in all GTA 5 is an amazing game that really shines in single player thanks to the endless possibilities the game offers and the fact that gameplay can easily be altered thanks to mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-01,0,0,45,False,Not Recommended,The story mode is amazing but the problem with this game is going to be the online mode. Online is really fun especially with friends but its focused on getting money which is a really slow process if you don't pay. This essentially is the same thing EA is being critised for lately. If you want to get it for the story do it's amazing and full of detail but if you are looking for a good online sandbox game I'd recommend looking elsewhere.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-13,0,0,589,False,Recommended,This game is great fun and can give you countless hours of joy. That is however if you have 3 grand on standby per DLC or a moder who will obey your every command. Heck I still get phone calls from ron telling me about aircraft i can buy at a trade price. Also unless you have 7 friends constantly on standby then everytime you go in to freeemode there will be a squad of epople waiting to blast you with there jets. When you start out everything will seem simple but it just gets more complicated. If you want anything you'll be grinding for hours. However the grinding is fun and can and will vary alot and you have an aray of methods to grind with once you get to a good enough level. You also should be carefull whenever you see the discount page don't just impulse buy something at %25 off because you may ise it.

2015-04-15,0,0,113,False,Recommended,Despite the plenty negative reviews on GTA V I honestly think that those who did post a negative review were just dissappointed that they weren't able to play as soon as it was released. Sure there were some problems that many people encountered but with a game this big problems are bound to come and go. I haven't encountered too many problems and so far the game is beautiful. I've played on the PS3 and the PC version is so much more detailed and thoughtful. There are things that boggle me still to this day. Best game to play with friends and overall you don't need to think twice on buying this game the problems will ultimately be fixed as Rockstar do not want their reputation and expectations to drop.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,411,False,Recommended,At first I was very sceptical especially because i have seen the flaws of this game on the XBOX 360. The issue with that game on that console was that you could glitch your money in many different ways by using 2 online players and the pay &amp spray shop. You could also gate glitch and get underneath the red parking lot building and if you had a fast enough car you could even make a jump towards the metro underneath Los Santos. Most of these glitches I have tested if they still work and from what I have gathered and tried it's 9/10 made impossible. Along with the graphical update the first person view and for how you can transfer your GTA console character to the PC makes everything just perfect as it should. I espect many hours that I will spend inside this game all under the form of total freedom that we all care so much about.The only thing I really dislike about GTA is that they have taken so much time untill the PC port was finally there.. For future games this should really be quicker prostponing will make gamers angry and nothing positive comes out from that.I give this game a 9/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

This also gones to rockstar because one if you added any rules I am going to tell you that I am not aware of them. Two this is why you lose fans because of your werid rules that you add.So don't buy this game if you want to kicked out and waste thousands of hour on this game.Because of the new changes made Rockstar is going hardcore on hackers and cheaters but what they don't see is that they are banning people that did nothing.don't make the mistake that I have made buying this game save your cash and buy another game.,Grand Theft Auto V

Like Minecraft Arma or WOW it is a timeless masterpiece that will never need another sequel. If you haven't played this game because you're afraid it won't be worth the money I promise you it will be.If you haven't played because your computer isn't powerful enough this game is worth the upgrade.Even if you end up not liking GTA too much this will undoubtedly be an experience tha (by the way I'm talking specifically about the online) that will have a profound impact on your gaming career. You MUST join the game. See what the hype is about. Run some complex and challenging heists and gang operations with real people. Work like crazy to start some criminal organizations from the ground up. Learn the truth of what it means to actually have to put in serious time and effort to make in game money and reap the rewards.GTA is for noobs and pros alike because there's a place litereally for anyone and everyone. The crazies and the serious ones. The rich and the broke ones. The pilots and the drivers. Stealth players and guns blazing types.

Golf parachuting base jumping deep sea diving the list goes on.I felt the graphics for this game were about par as far as GTA games go they slowly keep pace with the times the graphics weren't mind blowing but they were very decent. As far as support goes Rockstar is currently reviewing a Ticket I submitted regarding a few bugs and things seem to be moving in a positive direction. DO NOT rate games on their glitches and bugs rate the GAME. And i give this game a very good rating.

About those public sessions? They make it like that because all the new veichles are speicifed for messing with people want that to stop? Better buy one so better get some shark cards36. Unless you only play GTA or pay someone to play it for you you will never have enough money only way to get money is Sharkcards or modders37. Since the update every session has a modder in it this wouldn't be a problem in Private sessions38. This game still has problems from back in 2013 that have never been resolved39. Nightclub update is the 5th version of the same DLC except with less to do40. Ballistic equipment is stupid expensive and last's for like 2 miniutes then is removed41. the JB 700 still does not have working guns42. They finally added Hawian Shirts and they are trash one of them is literally the Max Payne shirt Micheal wears but if it was only blue or red.43. In order to get the DeLorean in GTA you need to buy a Doomsaday bunker then you need to buy the car then you need to customize the car all this for $100 real life dollars44. No Nightclub varriation45. Added in some new music and DJ $100 000 for the new DJ and $10 000 to switch between them afterwards at first gives you lots of popularity then it gives you nothing because you I guess46. Doomsday heist is and pays trash47. it's not Bully 2There even more reasons why this game is doody garbageRockstar is about as Greedy if not more so than EA at this point 528/10I will revoke this review and praise rockstar all day everyday if they announce Undead Nightmare 2 open world GTA online and it works in private sessions until then this game is bad.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-05,0,0,292,False,Recommended,I bought the game for the multiplayer and some of my complaints are that there is a hacker/modder on about a third of the servers I join it takes about 10 minutes to round up enough people for a heist and you have to grind for about 10 20 hours just to get into the juicy part of the game.

2017-04-17,0,0,370,False,Not Recommended,overall Grand Theft Auto V has several issues one being hackers/modders online make the game unplayable to a degree where even innocent players get banned and rockstar don't care how you got banned.the second issue is that the optimisation for pc is bad like for example the the render distance doesn't change even with the settings turned all the way up and also the anti alisaing is really poor on 8xmsaa you can still see the jagged lines you can see with no AA.The third issue is that the story mode hasn't changed over the 3 years the game has been out making it boring for players who have a poor internet connection.I suppose one upside is the fact that the new online DLC's contain new exciting vehicles at which you cant use in single player.This is from a person who has played grand theft auto v since it came out in 2013 on xbox 360 one and pc,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-04,0,0,36,False,Recommended,There are times when I look at Los Santos and think 'why would you even think to build that?' This is appropriately a thought that I often have about Los Angeles. In GTA 5's case the tone is different baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled y'know despair. Rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit. I look at it and I wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so. I marvel at the care evident in San Andreas' gorgeous sunsets in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world in the artfully chosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience. Everything about Los Santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years. The abiding irony of Grand Theft Auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in Los Santos hates it there.This is the most beautiful expansive and generous GTA game and also by some distance the nastiest and most nihilistic. Rockstar went through a phase in Bully Grand Theft Auto IV and the sadly console bound Red Dead Redemption of framing their protagonists as anti heroes. GTA 4's Niko Bellic did some terrible things but he had a downtrodden charm that helped you like him as you piloted him through the underworld. He was surrounded by people who were larger than life but ultimately beneath the surface people. Among those people were some of Rockstar's better female characters Kate McReary Mallorie Bardas The Lost and Damned's Ash Butler.GTA V ArgumentGrand Theft Auto 5 does away with all of that deliberately but to its detriment. Its trio of protagonists occupy a city full of vapid two dimensional caricatures and they flirt with that boundary themselves. Michael is a middle aged former bankrobber unhappily married and on the edge of a breakdown. Franklin is a young hood purportedly principled but willing to do almost anything for money. Trevor is a desert dwelling meth dealing psychopath with a homebrew morality that sits uneasily alongside his capacity for violent cruelty and sexual aggression. The campaign explores their relationship through a series of heists and misadventures as they clash with every L.A. stereotype you might imagine the bored Beverly Hills housewife the corrupt fed the bottom rung fraudster the smug technology exec and so on.Against this backdrop it's only Michael Franklin and Trevor that appear to have any kind of internal life. I get the impression that this is deliberate part of the game's relentless skewering of southern California and indicative of Rockstar's waning interest in romantic anti heroes. Trevor's introduction in particular amounts to a particularly explicit ' you' to the characters and themes of Grand Theft Auto IV. GTA 5 is heartless in that way and as a result I found the narrative difficult to care about. It is ambitious well performed and the production values are extraordinary but it is also derivative and brutishly adolescent set in a world where the line between criminality and the rule of law is blurry but where it is always hilarious that somebody might be gay.GTA V ChinatownIt's an R rated episode of The A Team where the 'A' stands for ' '. The campaign's best moments come when your cigar chomping master strategist insane former military pilot and talented driver come together and when you're given the power to choose how to use each of them. These heists are set piece missions where you pick an approach and perform set up tasks in the open world before setting out on the job itself. In the best of them which occur later in the campaign it really does evoke the satisfaction of having a plan come together. Perhaps you position Trevor on the high ground with a rocket launcher Michael on foot with a stealth approach and Franklin in an armoured ram raider. With a button press you can flick between the three dynamically orchestrating a crime caper on your own terms.It is also in these moments that Rockstar's most ambitious storytelling takes place. Your choice of character crew and even certain in game actions have subtle effects on the dialogue. In an early heist a crewmember dropped part of the score but as Franklin I was able to retrieve it a side objective that I'd set for myself but that was subsequently reflected in a later conversation between him and Michael. This is another example of Rockstar's extraordinary attention to detail and if the rest of the campaign respected your agency in this way it might overcome its weaker moments.GTA V Plane ChaseAs it is this is a very long game with a lot of filler. There's much driving from A to B a lot of conversations in cars a lot of gunfights with hordes of goons who show up just to run into your gunsights over and over. It's far richer in set piece moments than its predecessor drug trips aerial heists dramatic chases and many of these look incredible even if they're light on actual interaction. In the best examples you soak in the atmosphere and happily ignore the fact that you're only really being asked to follow the on screen instructions. In the worst examples insta fail stealth sequences sniper missions and so on it's harder to ignore the shackles that are placed on the player in order to preserve the game's cinematic look and feel.I spent a lot of my time with the campaign frustrated along these lines bored of the same mission templates that I've been playing through since GTA III and making the most of the scant opportunities to play my own way like Franklin's refreshingly open assassination missions. Then inevitably I'd be doing one of those rote activities a heavily scripted freeway chase perhaps when the magic of that extraordinary world would creep up on me again. It'd hit me I'm doing 150 km/h along the Pacific Coast Highway at sunset. The rock station is playing 30 Days In The Hole by Humble Pie. It feels incredible a collision of pop culture atmosphere music and play that is unique to GTA.,Grand Theft Auto V

Don't believe me? Grab a chopper or a plane and gain some altitude then look down on the city. It feels so alive every car driving with a purpose every pedestrian doing his own thing.

2018-02-18,0,0,232,False,Recommended,"Having not played this game since about a year after release I was pleased to see after many years there is an insane amount of new online content in this game. I love the heist options and the ease of joining them. If you read any other reviews you know the main issue with GTA Online play MODDERS. It's almost a gaurantee that any lobby you enter has at least one modder the issue being if that modder is a or not. Overall I would recommend this game. Please read on for my more detailed review.ProsIf you have a high end PC the graphics on this game are absolutely beautiful. Simply amazing if you're up in a chopper and you can see the entire city.Single Player At this point you know when this game came out it was one of the best campaigns ever created that still reigns true. Not much to say about this as i'll be focusing on the changing GTA Online play.Online Aspects Run by a system of RP (basically EXP) and money.Heist play IMO the most fun. You can earn some good money doing the setups and even more money on the heist finale. Doing the quick play option from a high end apartments heist board will allow you to finish several of these every hour.Home/Bunker/Facility/Bank These buildings that you purchase control how you do most things online. Your home is used to start heist missions and somewhere for you to spawn. The Bunker allows you to run a business as long as you are a CEO/Club MC/VIP. This business will earn you money over time that you collect by delivering weapon cache's. Moreover the men at work in your bunker will research weapon/vehicle upgrades and modifications as long as they have the supplies to do so. These supplies are replenished by doing missions for the bunker that don't earn $ just supplies. If the supplies deplete research will cease. This adds a fun element to GTA Online that seems like you actually control your life and have things to worry about. A type of micromanaging that I enjoy.The Facility is the newest addition to GTA Online. It allows you to play the newest Heist The Doomsday Heist. A three act heist that is the most fun of all six IMO. The Bank is the cheapest option for you to become a CEO. Being a CEO allows you access to the laptop in your bunker so you can resupply and sell your weapons cache. At first I didn't enjoy spending $1 000 000 GTA dollars on the bank then another $1 500 000 on the Bunker just to get my business up and running but that's the price you pay. Being a CEO also allows you to hire associates (friends) to help you do resupply missions delivering of weapons cache and several CEO exclusive missions to earn RP &amp money.Earning RP will allow your level to rise and give you access to new weapons vehicles and much better vehicle customizations. Overall this game has a ton to offer for online play. Playing with friends increases the fun 10 fold.ConsIf you are playing alone it can be difficult to navigate through heist setups and other objectives where team work is key. Even having one friend with you makes everything much easier. It seems that half the setups I get in to people don't speak english which can be especially difficult for heist finales. Mic/coms are RARELY used in PUGs.Even worse than that and above all else is the failure for R* to address the modding community. With the download of an app it is easy for most to enter GTA Online with inifite money and access to everything you could imagine. It is very hard to express the rage that is induced by you almost finishing a gun run worth $500 000 that took you a week of supplies to save up only to have a modder teleport to you and destroy you with 15 rockets in 4 seconds. As I mentioned earlier this doesn't effect me too much as I mostly do heist setups/finales. Most modders tend to stay away from those and just ruin the fun of people in public lobbies.As everyone knows in 2018 a ton of companies are doing microtransactions and R* takes advantage. This is never something I partake in especially when a game that came out 6 years ago STILL costs $60 except twice a year when it's half off. For $20 US you get $1 250 000 GTA dollars. If you do several setups and a heist finale or two you can earn that money. Is 2 4 hours of GTA online gameplay worth $20? I guess that's up to you.Loading Another issue with GTA Online. I do believe my high end PC and fiber optic internet connection help me have less issues than most but still several times a week you will have to force close GTA because you're stuck staring at the city from above for 5 minutes. I have found if it's taking longer you can hit Alt+F4 then push ESC to go back to the game sometimes this forces you to load back in to a CLOSED (non public) server. Another tip When turning on GTA always load single player mode first then load the online from the menu. I always select CLOSED FRIEND SESSION to get on faster. Also the rare auto kick while entering a setup/mission. It will say ""The host has left the game"" when really it just booted them for no reason.Another annoyance that most agree with As soon as you enter Online mode or even return to a lobby from doing a mission/setup you are bombarded with phone calls and tool tips about purchasing all types of buildings. I don't even want to own a heli/plane since you can only use them in the lobby (not setups) and only on select missions but I still get the same ing call from Ron ""HEEEEYYYYYY IT'S RONNNNNNNN"" telling me to buy a hanger to store a plane. This will happen with a facilites AND bunkers. So when you're just starting off be ready for 3 calls+tool tips until you purchase these buildings.OverallIf you can get past the annoyances and the modders you can have a ton of fun with GTA. It still contains all the things you love like jumping cars off cliffs jet ski's parachuting blowing up and following the flow of traffic in your supercar for no reason. I still RECOMMEND this game but add it to your wishlist and grab it on sale.8/10",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-05,0,0,87,False,Recommended,I bought this game twice. Once for the 360 and once more for my pc. And at the time they seemed very much worth it but now it seems that the game has in fact changed than when I first played it. The online component is very much geared into getting people into spending money on Rockstars microtransactions I can't in good faith say that isn't a scumbag tactic. The singleplayer is very much the same with no changes. I would say don't buy this game if you dislike microtransactions in games especially if your prone to gambling. And if you think that you can resist the microtansactions. Then by all means purchase this game on a sale. BUT BE WARNED Rockstar will bundle their game with microtransactions on sales forcing people to pay more for the game and for their fake currency so just do a littel more browsing and you should find the base game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-18,0,0,414,False,Not Recommended,I do indeed enjoyed this game but I cannot recommend it to anybody new. This game takes WAY to long to get up and running. I once had a dream of owning every car in the game and I did that in the base game. But now it's impossible. The DLC they release basically ensures that you buy $40 worth of shark cards. To get the full enjoyment of this game you either need 500 or $300 in shark cards. (No really this is actually what it would cost to have a taste at MOST of the side features in this game) The campaign is really solid but this game is now out of hand. They do a poor job midigating hackers because people need hackers to enjoy this game. A SINGLE CAR can cost you $60 REAL MONEY to get if you don't want to grind the 40 hours to get it. It's a grind fest. And a not fun one because you usually have to drag your friends along to replay side missions that are just boring. This game can be a lot of fun with the right people but you NEED to have owned this game since release. It is not worth it to anybody new!!!

Just LEAVE the server. That's it. Problem solved. If there is a modder on another server just leave again or stay away from them. Now for the people complaining about Rockstar. I agree completely that Rockstar shouldn't just hang up customer service for millions of false bans and they should make a system to catch cheaters/modders without falsely banning people. My only advice is to leave servers with modders leave servers where people are money glitching or play some jobs to get away from them.As for the game itself I would very strongly recommend buying it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-01,0,0,193,False,Recommended,The online community is full of only cancerous jerks who drop out of missions so you can experince the fun of more than 50% of your playtime being loading screens.would be an alright game but people are just the worst.DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE A BADASS RIG TO PLAY WITH or else its all loading times for you my friend and very little of actually finishing a mission.that being said the early game mission are just infuriating! the they expect you to do fresh of the plane is stupid! unless you drop MORE money on the game to make for an enjoyable gaming experince free of jerks and having to interact with them. but then WHY AM I PLAYING A MULTIPLAYER GAME???? LATER EDIT After playing the game more I have started to understand the online progression. don't do Lamar's mission jump in lobbies untill you can afford a house witha heist room (500k+ish) and then start doing heists.BE WARNED the hiest missions are UNFORGIVING to drop ins.also the whole story campaign thing is heaps better to play at the moment because it is snowing for chrismas and it wreck all yo' tractioning.also get friends. good ones.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-24,0,0,1575,False,Not Recommended,Well There goes 700+ Hours of my Life Thanks Rockstar I have just received notice that my account has been Permanently Banned So many people are exploiting the game modding and basically griefing an enitre lobby of people trying to do missions yet they seem to focus on the Clean Players who try to grind their way up with the help of the occasional Shark Card. Thanks to their way of thinking I have no way of knowing what I did to earn a Perma ban. This is the second time I've been banned for no damn reason Last time it was 30 days But somehow I've killed their LORD or something to get banned Permanently from a Game where Modder's Rule. This has officially put me off all Rockstar Games Doesn't make it fair that we can't fight the ban either. I would have to get a new Steam Account and buy the game again and Restart From Scratch All I'm going to say is screw that The first ban took everything from me and now this second time has just ran me head first into a brick wall and killed me before I could get back what I lost from the first ban.I'm done! Through! Damn Rockstar and their Faulty Ban System is basically running off alot of players due to the constant bans gong around and not to the right people either And now the game is worthless to me Single Player is fun for awhile but it get's tiring doing everything over and over. With Half the game missing what am I supposed to do with it? Now I got a Useless Icon in my Game Library that is basically sitting there as a big F.U from Rockstar. Word of Advice Do NOT buy this game or You'll probably end up in here doing what I'm doing and letting people know to not waste their time in a game where you can simply sneeze in your own home and get banned for somehow breaking the Terms.,Grand Theft Auto V

The banning system in this game is complete Don't abuse the game get banned. Seems legit. If I do infact get unbanned I might change this review. Otherwise this game is a complete waste of time and will only disappoint you.Good work rockstar go from allowing your parent company to sue small SINGLE PLAYER modders to banning innocent players since they play in the same sessions as modders and have their stats messed with.

2015-04-14,0,0,837,False,Recommended,the game is awesome....if you are playing with your own friends in your own session. Because the gameplay in public contradicts it self. To me it feels like the game was done by two groups. One that likes coop and the other that likes the oldschool GTA4 multiplayer where everyone kills everyone. That's why when you play public you feels as if the gameplay contradicts it self. You want to kill people but you get nothing from it. On the contrary you get punished. You have to pay for his vehicle if he was in one and also you have to pay for the bullets you've wasted. But that's not all you also have to pay for every single time you die. So in other words the game was design for you to spend money on sharks. Also when you play CEO everyone wants to break your crates even tho they get nothing from it. But it is part of the game and they should be allowed to do what ever they want. The problem is that there are tons of CEO without balls that like everything handed to them easy and they try to vote kick you. So basically the game is broken. It like I said contradicts it's self. CEO should belong to a coop world instead not public.,Grand Theft Auto V

It doesn't matter how to it compares to the other titles in the series on its own it is a technological achievement and deserves the praise that it receives.The online has a hacker problem and has become difficult to play due to incredibly over powered players. IMO Rockstar Games should consider bracketing these open world multiplayer games in the future or maybe having privately owned servers. I personally could do without the flying cars rocket motorcycles and armored vehicles.If you are looking for a fun single player experience you will have one. The online...it might be too late by now but you could still have a lot of fun. I do believe GTA V on PC is still a good purchase in 2018 and is by far the superior version.,Grand Theft Auto V

And they haven't even bothered to reply.The 28 hours of time played has been roughly 6 hours of actual gameplay the rest have been waiting for it's lengthy load times while restarting it over and over hoping for it to have it's rare boot where the sound works.And then when the sound does work the online servers are so atrocious that a good portion of the players get disconnected and thrown into a private server where nothing works within 15 minutes of logging in.I just tried re installing the game hoping that might make a difference at least one time so I could have some fun this weekend and now Rockstar can't even find my account for their horrendous webstore nonse that I have to be logged into to play a game that already has online only functionality and cannot be played without Steam open.I've had more than my fill of the arrogance greediness and complete disregard for it's players by the developer and no longer wish to support this game.

I only bought this game for the multiplayer aspect as I have already beaten this game on 360 The single player campaign is nice but I wish it was somewhat longer. The multiplayer is horrible sometimes it's controlled by people who mod but can also interrupt your gameplay and gaming experience. Despite the interuptions and people who play unfairly I think it's worth it to buy. The first person aspect is pretty epic and I am glad it's included in this game.

2018-06-07,0,0,62,False,Recommended,You played GTA 1 2 3 Vice City 4 and now you're ready for the king of them all.. GTA V. Well are you though?If you were expecting an open world do anything shoot steal and be a maniac type of game... I guess this technically fits the bill. But what if you found out it was designed for consoles in 2013 and it still felt like a console game on PC? Sure the graphics and framerate are umpteen times better now but if it wasn't for some of the unique gameplay it would just be another 5 year old console title.I preordered this on PS3 &amp PS4 played it every night for years and still 100% never did everything there is to do. It's amazingly endless replayability just crusing around and of the cops is a blast. But somehow I still feel like I got cheated out of my money on PC. The online multiplayer is where it's at right now buying properties customizing cars chatting with ethugs new game modes and free DLCs every other season. And yet it just feels so dated. I transfered my character from PS4 and played it only a short while. The driving mechanics are still on rails the lack of NPC interaction is unsatisfying at some point I finally realized it was just missing that revamp that would have made it 10/10. The best I can tell the fact it's a console port explains it all. It just doesn't bode well for what we expect on PC. Rockstar thank you for this great game but I hope you learned your lesson.,Grand Theft Auto V

There will be a lot of hackers taking advatange to grind the money or troll other people. Please be cooperative when there is hacker/modder on your own team or other team and report them for your own sake and others.Rockstar impletantion against hacker is half baked. We only can confirm people are hacking by spectating the match but when you are spectating but we can't report until the next round. Also when the round ends when you find out he/she is hacking it is too late the game does not let you report.Great single player loading time horrible load time in online.You spent more time in loading screen than playing the game.Compare this online loading time 4 5 min single player loading time less than 20 Sec.Mind you i have moderate Nat Type.There is also alot of bug in the game at the moment makes want to pull your hair out.Unlimited Loading Screen Crew members cant drive during heist Police still onto you even you are out the vision error joining session everytime you have done heist or mission as a host and some AI can shoot through wall in certain location.What make it worse is that r* do not want to acknowledge this bugs exist.I only recommend this game on sale and single player only.

2018-02-01,0,0,337,False,Recommended,The singleplayer is awsome The online is pretty good but has plenty of negatives. For example it has many things to do you make many plans on how to use your money or invest them on something BUT the heists or any activities you do do not give you enough money so you have to grind alot and it gets boring. In the Online again alot of people are too toxic and kill players in free roaming. I prefer to go for a ride with them or something but i cant find anyone else who wants to as well. Now the real problem is the servers. They are quite badly maintained and sometimes you crash. You might as well see modders in some lobbies. Anyways i recommend buying this game mostly for the singleplayer and IF you have any other friend playing the same game you should try going on private lobbies (online) and having fun with them (and of course doing heists with them or any other activities),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-04,0,0,202,False,Recommended,This game is insanely fun in practically every way possible. Singleplayer storyline combat and all the features make it absolutely amazing. GTA Online is also fun yet some things can improve. A better system to prevent cheaters would be amazing because there are a lot of them running around multiplayer. Micro transactions are also highly unnecessary and deter many people. For a game that is normally priced at $60 that is a steep price and is definitely worth it although micro transactions are only for greed rather than to improve the experience of players. In a way they cause players to become pay to win because those who spend lots of money can buy overpriced items to enhance their game and even cause other players to become mad at them and the game. As a gamer who loves GTA removing micro transactions would improve the online gameplay and would most likely draw a larger audience to play the game(s). Overall an awesome game yet as with anything things can improve. Game is worth the price.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-19,0,0,562,False,Not Recommended,After 140 hours logged on the pc version and something like 50 accumulated days of playtime logged across the ps3 and ps4 version of this game I can only say I heavily regret getting the pc version Why you might ask? After playing the game at a higher frame rate and ease of aiming with a mouse I can't see myself being able to go back to the console version This is a problem because the PC version of this game is completely ruined by the community I have never encountered more hacking in a video game in my 15+ years of gaming and Rockstar either doesn't care or is unable to control the issue It wouldn't be a problem if it was simply players giving themselves money or something using programs I really couldn't care less but the problem comes in when almost every session contains multiple hackers trolling players either by using god mode to get kills or through other wackier means such as sticking a campfire on a player causing them to burn alive as they spawn. If you haven't played the PC version yet DON'T keep playing the console version and stay there as you're ability to play on PC will be heavily affected by the community's acceptance of hacking and rampant use of external programs. I know this probably sounds like I got owned by hacks and I'm just venting but honestly it pains me to make my first bad review on steam one of my all time favorite games and if anything happens to midigate the issue I will change this review in a heartbeat since outside of the hacking I have had a blast playing but it really is such a signifcant problem I would have to say newcomers stay away the console versions are much cleaner when it comes to hackers not that they don't exist on the platforms but here it's just insane how bad the issue is.,Grand Theft Auto V

You're the best psycho ever.Micheal if I ever met your kids I'd slap the stupid out of them.Franklin instead of hustlin with the guys you coulda took the money from the second heist and really got out of the country. Nope you waste it and stick with the guys.What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said?Not much. Its just so good.I had it on the 360 when it came out and played it to death back then. Didn't really do the GTAOnline thing much as I knew the 360 version's character gen wasn't as good as the pc's but I wasn't gonna blow out for the game twice.Then my kid and friends got into it big time about a year later and so I hung out with them online doing races and generally arsing around in LS. I must have 100 or more hours in it before deciding to get in on some pc Mc.Lovin and get the big boy version.Oh am I glad I did. LS looks and sounds glorious its just so much more LS than LS if that makes sense... The weather wow. The first time a thunderstorm turned up I actually jumped because my sub rattled so much. Ah good times.First person view is a godsend driving is now actually doable with characters other than Franklin. Flying is easier too. I actually am spending a good amount of time in the aircraft in game and can fly without crashing everywhere. Of course a gamepad is pretty much mandatory for this game and something I found that makes it so much better are thumbstick risers. Little rubber nubs about an inch long that fit over the thumbsticks and let you have so much more travel of the sticks.Mucho mondo accuracy. Which is a really good thing as the aim helper from the 360 isn't there so its all hands on deck as far as shootin.I like that I've been able to transfer my online 360 character over to the pc so I've got all my cars houses and money I played for on the 360. That was a nice touch and R* should be congratulated for it.I'm enjoying Online on the pc I guess I've been lucky in that I've not come across hackers yet (touch wood) and griefers are easy to deal with just go into passive mode till the go away. They do tend to get bored easily.The stunt racing Before I bought the pc version I thought what a stupid idea. We have all the tools and things we need already to race and do stunts already. Oh boy was I ever wrong. What fun it is to tear through loop the loops at high speeds. Doing jumps at stupid heights and praying you make the landing. Yeah that's my favourite mode.But then they go and bring out the Bikers expansion... Oh whut? Bike gangs.. Go on then. Ouch clubhouses are expensive but what fun the outfits bikes and everything they've brought out for it is. Its candyland for bikers...Whats this $3m for a boat? O Guess I'm gonna have to go rob more liquor stores ),Grand Theft Auto V
2016-10-14,0,0,1567,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humor and gift for mayhem.

2016-09-18,0,0,104,False,Recommended,This game is insanely good. Despite playing this for over 500 hours on the 360. It still has the drawing power to make me want to come back and play new things. Story mode is simply increcible I've replayed the main story 4 times now and in my opinion it is the best part of the game. With so much to do and so many ways you can play it differently each time I've never had a boring moment. Story mode for me is what makes this game well worth it's price. Moving onto online for me I find it more tedious to play by yourself. Gaining money without grinding heists is very tedious and often leaves me finding a new game to play for the evening. However if you do play this game with a friend or a group of friends you are in for a great time. I can't remember how many times I've had my face hurting from laughing so much after a session with some mates. So to conclude GTA V is well worth the buy even for the story alone. But once you throw online in there I would be happy spending $150 on this game. If you can't afford it or aren't convinced because you thing there are too many hackers (I've never actually seen a hacker but that may be because of me being on Australian servers) then at least wait till it's on sale and give it a go. This was the first Grand Theft Auto I played and was so good it made me go back and buy the previous titles.TLDR Well worth the price tag pick it up now or on sale. Story is the best feature and online can be incredible with a group of mates.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-07-05,0,0,317,False,Recommended,Currently my favorite game. I wish they would come out with more DLC's like the gambling/casino one they have been talking about forever. They have done a better job at getting rid of all the hackers. I rarely see a hacker these days. It is fun and enjoyable especially when you have friends to play with. My major problem is some lag amd random connection loss. Besides the fact that I need a better updated PC to handle it better. Other then that I love it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Single player works fine but the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer. It crashed at every chance it gets loading screen *crash* fifty restarts later the game still won't ing work. I googled it to see whats wrong and my one conclusion (that is probably not the real reason) is that the DRM is completely and utterly ing my game. you R* and your DRM also every other company that uses DRM I'm looking at you Ubisoft.It's been a year since I bought this game and I only just got it to work. When I bought this game and couldn't get it to work I contacted R* support they were beyond useless. They had me try so many different ""fixes"" which fixed nothing and after all this they just said stuff it and wouldn't respond to any of my requests for help. Either way a year later months after giving up one of my friends fixed it for me. What he did was set me a static ip and that solved it. Why didn't I think of this? because I didn't know it would effect the game. So this review is more about R* support at this point. I spent ages talking to them and they didn't even think of telling me to set a static ip. So a year down the road this game is still worth it but if you have issues with it don't contact R* support they're beyond useless.",Grand Theft Auto V

I also would dare challenge the newest supercars are worth the same as a fighter jet but that's just my humble opinion on that... At least the game itself runs fine as long as the servers don't crap themselves.The main gripe I still have with the game has to do with the lobbying system I can't fathom why it's never changed that the game first leaves a world to then check wether the new world is full of players having to load back to another (often different even if you were in a world filled with friends) world if you can't join the new one.I'd love to see actual logic applied there in that the game checks the new lobby first if it's full poses the question wether to queue/join and only after that leave the world if the new session can be actually joined this would really save me and other players a ton of time when trying to join invited sessions which end up to be full (even if the game stated otherwise just seconds before...) Also quite a lot of worlds are so often ruined by one guy having to misuse the Opressor/Deluxo out of 12 ish players in total indirectly forcing you to drop to an empty session if you want to have any hope of achieving anything... It'd be great if the game could detect people with a tendency to get in their boom mobile and throw them together in one big of a game might teach them a lesson why it's bashful.Other then that especially when played with friends it can be a fun experience playing missions with Randoms is very hit and miss mainly since a lot of players seem to lack even more communicative skills then I personally do Be ready to carry if you wish to play any mission above normal level.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,1529,False,Recommended,Alright I've spent over 1k hours in GTA V and GTA Online and I think it's time for an review. The core of the game is masterfully done and there was a lot of thought and process that went into the game and it's online addition. This is mostly noticable in the detail of the world and how it works with the player to make you feel immersed. The big problem with GTA isn't GTA V itself but the problems that exist in Online. Especially modders crashing other players games and the horrible loading times. Rockstar have made multiple attemps at fixing the hacker plauge that has spread over Online with Gunrunning being the most noticable one. There are unfortunately still hackers everywhere trying to destroy for other players and killing them when they are doing missions in a freeroam lobby. I understand why it is such a big problem for Rockstar to remove the hackers when there are so many diffrerent mod menus out there both free and paid. I also want to talk about the ridicoulous prices of some of the vehicles in GTA Online most noticeably the Lazer. The Lazer is an fighter jet that can be found in the Military Base and stolen as long as you're skilled enough to get away from the enemies both on the ground and in the air. In late 2017 Rockstar made this jet purchasable for 6 5 million dollars which is around 800$ in real life money. The only thing that you get for buying it is that you can make it another color than grey. There was a huge outrage about this because of the fact that the jet is still stealable from the Military Base and because it had such an ridiculous price. Other vehicles with ridiculous prices include The Luxor Deluxe which is an golden jet that costs 10 million dollars in game. There is also the Jachts that go from 6 10 million. I'm not here to complain about them though because all of these vehicles are completely useless and you are never forced to buy them. Overall I love this game. I'm an big fan of the whole GTA Series and for me this was an huge addition. The game is coming close to five years since it's original release on PS3 and Xbox 360 and Rockstar are working on Red Dead Redemption 2. GTA V doesn't have many years left but it will absolutley go down in history as an great example of what an ambitious and motivated developer and publisher can do.I conclusion I recommend this game to anyone that likes open world games action and getting blown up by an Tryhard with an explosive sniper.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-05,0,0,1160,False,Not Recommended,I've given this some long and hard thought. I'll start with the good things.It's beautiful large chunks of it have wonderful attention to detail. The enormous open world that can sometime look photorealistic in the right light and distance is great. The ability to run a wanton criminal empire is great the driving is alot of fun and loving detail has gone into the sheer number of different cars bikes planes and boats available. There is an in game purchase system that isn't lootbox based. A bunch of the missions and races and whatnot are good fun in coop and there's lots to do. I'm hooked and may be coming back to it a long time if the annoyances below don't kill it for me eventually. Unfortunately there's so much wrong with it that I can't possibly give it a positive review.1. Ridiculously expensive.The in game purchase system is preposterously expensive and dramatically unbalanced. Eight million in game dollars buys you very little indeed and rockstar has the gall to charge you 75 euro's for that. It's ridiculous. I've found myself paying it though but it gives one a feeling of disgust and dirtiness. Rockstar does not get my sympathy and I will think three times before ever buying another of its games.2. New players.If you haven't spent say 200 euro's on in game dollars you're ed. There is nothing to help new players into the online version of the game and the complete lack of any sort of balancing means that you will be constantly slaughtered in ambushes or one sided exchanges in freemode untill you reach end game levels of cash which you need to bring something like 500 euro's to do or thousands of hours of gameplay and even then you will still be subject to the general freemode balance problems.3. Balance.Heavy military hardware is far to cheap relatively. Freemode is dominated by s flying gunships hiding and griefing anyone who is trying to make some in game money which they don't really need anymore since they've already got all the cool gizmo's. Freemode pvp gameplay is a sequence of one sided exchanges and ambushes and respawning is so close together that after the first death it's just a matter who spots who with a sniper rifle first. It's inane. Rockstar needs to look at open world pvp games and learn from them. APB has a system which is far from ideal but dramatically better than what's going in in GTA online freemode.4. Hackers.They're incessant and constant. Rockstar doesn't seem to want to do anything about it. You can't tell me that it's impossible to put a sanity check on the means by which someone was killed or what happened in the minute or so before someone switched sessions. Or they should talk to the OpenIV developer and include anti cheat code in that software. if you can't detect tanks being dropped on a helicopter in mid air you're incompetent rockstar.5. Story mode.No female character? Seriously you can't write a story which has three switchable characters ffs and you can't make one of them a woman? You have got to be kidding. Of all its numerous shortcomings this is almost the most glaring. The previous four can be attributed to rockstar's inexperience with online pvp environments but not including a female character in the main storyline requires actual long term vision. If story mode had a decent female character I probably wouldn't visit online at all its so full of jerks and hackers.Not catering to female gamers in the main story line and the intolerably bad protection of new players is really bad business by rockstar and I'd be having a serious words with them if I was one of their financers.The sad thing is most of this isn't all that hard to fix which could make it magnificent. As it stands it's just barely tolerable and since I've run out of other games that are holding my attention I'll stick with it untill something better comes along. It can hardly take long.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-10,0,0,1736,False,Not Recommended,The character limit of this review does not allow for me to list all the faults present in this game.Here are some of the highlights Toxic community most public sessions are filled with absolute s. Cheating and game hacking is so common place it's more surprising to enter a public session without a hacker than a public session with a hacker. At one point GTA's servers lost my character and all my progress for GTAO and it took 2 weeks and dozens of support tickets to get it back and I mostly received automated canned messages and had my tickets all closed. Combat is horribly unbalanced and gameplay is totally illogical. For example You can be walking down a street and any random player can come at you in an armoured bulletproof car and shoot you repeatedly from inside of it while you can't touch them. But if you blow up their car the game will fine you a small amount of money and call you a bad sport. Seriously. Rockstar has made it extremely difficult to acquire money without playing in public sessions while at the same time hasn't done anything to address unbalanced combat or widespread cheating/hacking in the game. The fastest ways of acquiring money mostly involve doing a substantial amount of grinding building up 'product' then 'selling' the product in a mission. Other players will receive a notification that you are selling product and will be told to go destroy it. They receive no reward for this. If your product is destroyed you just wasted several hours of gaming for no reward and actually probably lost money overall. There can be 20+ players in a session. Imagine it. GTA's servers falsely accused me of acquiring hacked money and removed $4.5m GTA dollars from my account. I will say it until I turn blue in the face I've never hacked cash in the game. Again GTA's support system has given me nothing but canned responses and closed my tickets without resolving the issue. To put it into context $4.5m is about a week worth of nightly grinding for a high level player and about a month for a new player.There is a great game here buried under all of the horrible business decisions made by Rockstar and Take Two but this game continues to be fun really in spite of Rockstar and not because of them. I would not recommend you buy this product.Update Orbital cannon? You ing kidding me? I'm done DONE.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,96,False,Recommended,EDIT The mod situation has been resolved! Most companies don't backpedel so I have to give them credit for listening to the customers.I can't and won't speek on behalf of the OpenIV team. The is on my behalf only as a consumer and a person that loves mods. I do not agree whith what t2 did with the OpenIV creators. and for that I have to say that I don't recomend this game. What that means to me the base game is pretty good 8/10. The online is crap and I do not wish to participate in it at all. I don't like all the people that KOS when you are min. level with no guns. The constant cheating and hacking is annoying. The only online I enjoy is in a private server with friends and that's not possible.If you enjoy the story and that's all you care about only get the game super cheap. The single player alone is not really worth even $30. The single player mods made this game replayable and so much fun after the story is finished. I will be uninstalling this game and WILL NOT bother with online. I was disapointed that the 'private server' mods were shut down but there was still single player with mods. Now that's gone and as soon as the next update comes out for this game I'm sure the last version of OpenIV will be unusable. I will come back to it when something is changed or figured out with the mods. Until then I don't want it wasting HDD space.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,150,False,Not Recommended,"Funny how telling it is that Rockstar/TakeTwo are using screen shots from the multiplayer to sell this. I do not like multiplayer. It stresses me out and I deal with enough stupid people in my day job that I dont want to deal with some on the other end of the world being a I dont like it that's my personal take. However with TakeTwo they seem to only want money and have been throwing EVERYTHING at the online portion. Meanwhile the single player while fun at times is completely forgetable. Trevor Micheal and Franklin are all s in their own right and none of them are what one would call likeable. The heists are fun but limited in scope. However and here's the kicker most of the game is completely forgotten after a short time. Why? Well there's one campaign. That's all you get. TakeTwo hasnt added in any substancial content for the single player guys to enjoy. No DLC for single player no nothing. I mean Im greatful that there's no microtransactions but when they pretty much dropped the ball entirely on it I think that was a mistake. So what do you get for your 60 ING Dollars for a now 4 year old game with ooodles of hackers a now crippled modding scene and a 60 GB download that seems more like it's meant for only the multiplayer? You get a 20 hour campaign a fair number of side activities and some goodies. However if you want to experience anything in the screen shots according to some buddies (as I dont play multiplayer and am now going to uninstall this game from my computer due to the modding scene damage) you get to grind or pay. I dont think that's fun and when I heard about the grind and microtransactions I lost all intrest in it instantly. Good job Taketwo/Rockstar. You took a promising game and killed it. If you do want to pick it up get it on sale. $60 is not worth it after 4 years. Actually you know what? Dont bother throwing money at this mess. If you want a drive aroundy shooty bang story with a lot of fun and none of this bull go get San Andres. UPDATE 6/24/17 Good job community on kicking up a huge stink. You're the reason we have the news we do. TakeTwo has back peddled from their orignal statement seemingly. Firstly with the ""talks with the openIV dev"" and suddenly a new small update for openIV. However do not let your guard down. At any time they can take down that statement and go back aftrer modding. It's still dumb because of how little TakeTwo thinks of the modding community and if it werent for the reviews getting abosolutely tanked and will remain that way for a while and everything else that happened modding would be effectively ended on the PC Side. My review will still remain negitive though.Why? Multiplayer sucks and you can get banned for seemingly no reason out of the ing blue It has microtransactions in the multiplayer. That alone is enough for me not to recommend playing. No content updates for the Single Player planned full stop. Thats all for now. Will update in the future with more things if TakeTwo decides to continue to backpeddle or if they go fullll retard and go back after modding.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-25,0,0,413,False,Recommended,"Recently there's been a lot of negative reviews for this game so I just want to give my two cents on the topic and hopefully it'll change someone's mind for the better. *Disclaimer I have not played storymode as of now (so you can tell I'm an expert on the topic lol). Currently I have logged 191 hours when this review was written off of only online mode so imagine how many hours you could get with playing story mode.*To begin yes there is a somewhat long wait to get into online mode. However if you have an even satisfactory computer relative to what is necessary to run this game then the wait is bearable. I would be lying if I said there is a minimal wait time but 5 10 minutes is fine considering I spend three hours playing. Normally I turn it on get it running and then watch a quick YouTube video or make a sandwich. When I come back the game is ready to play. Simple as that.Once again while the claims that there a plenty of hackers on this game are true it doesn't make the game bad. I'd say every 1/5 servers I go on has a hacker and of those hackers only 1/2 of them are there to make your day worse. So about every 10 severs I go on there is a 'bad hacker'. However there's a simple solution the join a new server option. Then you don't have to exit the game but you do get to join a new server. Easy fix. )Lastly there are some reviews about this game saying that online is too difficult because all the weapons/cars etc. are overpriced. Keep in mind I've only played online and never story mode but speaking from experience that's kinda BS. Yes it takes awhile to accumulate wealth (I still haven't gotten top dog stuff after nearly 200 hours) but that's the fun to it. I don't care about how it'll take me awhile longer to get all the most expensive items because getting there is so exciting. And to be honest there are easy ways to get money and all the really really expensive items are kind of just showy stuff you don't have to have it to have a great time but it does surely enhance the gameplay.After all this time I still hop on whenever I can because the game and sometimes even the people can be extremely enjoyable. Don't like the ""abundance of hackers"" or just interacting with people in general? There's a single player online (though seemingly counter intuative I'm sure someone has found good use out of it). But personally I've made plenty of good friends on this game and I bet that you will as well. If I have convinced even one person to get this amazing game then writing this review was worth it. Enjoy. )",Grand Theft Auto V

If you go more than a week without internet while traveling or after moving you can say goodbye to playing this game at a moment's notice when internet is not available.Who would want to invest their time and energy into a single player storyline when they're not in complete control over when they can play it?PC single player (the main reason I bought it) is broken. My opinion is that conforming to Rockstar's single player authenticator would make me a sheeple so no thank you. PC online is a different topic.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar gives us FREE f***in' DLC! That's UNHEARD OF in 2018! If anything laugh at the people who use Shark Cards dont hate Rockstar for making them an option! For example I spent $30 on GTA 5 and never had to pay another cent for my 600 hours of playtime that have only been stunted by my interest in other games. Meanwhile I spent $36 on Battlefield 1 a while back and EA DICE whoever makes that game came out with countless DLC packs for the game zoning me out from being able to play the game because either literally nobody plays Battlefield anymore or they're all playing on the DLC which I don't have.Regardless the point is stop lashing out at Rockstar.

2017-07-03,0,0,526,False,Recommended,One of the best games out there Almost.There are so many funny things about GTA V Online. They keep their game updated with free DLC things much other company should consider. But ofc GTA V Online has some bad sides like not dealing enough with the hackers/modders. Many people saying bad things about GTA V Online like it's too hard to make money which it's not right. Money was much harder to get back in 2013 with those stupid missions that gave you 10k$ now you can make 550k$ in 2 hours with the heists. If you just work hard enough to get the money it's pretty easy. Just queue up with 1 friend it's easy and fun to play. Remember that they give DLC for free so don't be angry about it's hard to get money. If the money was too easy to get you would get everything in no time which will make you have no goals in the game. So 9 75/10 so get rid of the hackers/modders.,Grand Theft Auto V

Gta V has a multiplayer mode to.First i'm that guy that likes to grind his of and i like it that way but damn if you start from zero experience and no knowledge from this game you will have to grind longgg for you get something.the prices are ridiculous wtf were they thinking 5mil for this 3 for that rockstar pls its hard to get a good mil for starters.Butt this revieuw got some tips try to find somebody that has an office and play a lot whit him till you get a mil nothing else just go straight for that office and you will see that money will come fast.MC busniss is great if you are that guy that want to get not the office first i personnaly bought the MC first and i got some decent money out of it bought coke methaphine and docs my personal tip go straight for coke the others are nice but not so fast money gainers.OFFICE is lovely you get fackup fast money from it warehouse and vechicles money is not going to be an issue anymore Bunker its nice if you want to resupply it every goddamn time if you are lucky you will have some good project after eachother and they are goddamn nice and the MOC is nice if your duo playing HANGAR missions are nice but the delivery missions are t some times but worth it if you only get 1 kind of stock FACILITY trade prices are the only thing that i can say and for duo heisting is it nice other wise...

2018-01-31,0,0,45,False,Recommended,At first I feel like voting as not recommended because of how fast you go through the storyline but then I realized this game left me wanting more. Specially more heists and more story&lt &gt world interaction. I remember playing the older GTA's and GTA's jewel of the crown has always been it's interaction and relation between the world and the storyline. In this case the story feels like it's in a completely different universe than the side quests and characters. I mean for example why bother adding the possibility to hang out with characters if it doesn't make any difference. And that's the thing. Although the story is rich with a lame ending choice side characters and the universe around it seems pretty badly explored in my opinion leaving you with just a couple of side missions and the online mode to explore after you finish the game...I'd like to say I loved the game. But this one seemed a bit detached from GTA's all time premisse of a storyline perfectly blended in a highly chaotic world you cannot escape from.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-10,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,A Polite Review on the Online Gameplay This is completely ignoring the campaign because overall story mode is ok. However I would like to dedicate this review to the hard working polite staff of rockstar. They have created a system that really looks out for their players. Well done.Now on to the point. I believe I hit level 20 before I was flooded with modders. Most of which were kind of passive and just minded their own business. I'm against hacking and personally avoid taking any sort of short cut that would overall shorten my game time by just spawning myself cash. But those passive hackers just go around their own business and bother no one. And from what I can tell they don't even put on godmode when doing public supply missions. Unfortunately I am not writing this review in regards to the passive players. This is towards the pleasant players who destroy the fun factor of others and that the system in place that is meant to prevent such actions is completely useless. When I finally hit level 30 I am constantly killed by god mode vehicle spawning explosive ammunition wielding modders. Now the correct process would be to report them and switch server to deal with some other player who tends to have similar if not the same hacks in place. Fun. However a week later and the exact same usernames pop up to spawn camp me. Or even force money on top of me when asking them to stop. Are they banned? No.This is when the almighty banning system comes in with it's completely ridiculous algorithms that just ignores the true threats to the game. I eventually hit level 50 and grinded like crazy to max out a bunker during a massive discount weekend. Now for some reason. Banned. Fantastic. This is only a month suspension and I would have just brushed it aside as a break from a game isn't the worse thing in the world. But as to the brilliant staff behind it all after the suspension is finally lifted EVERYTHING will be reset and I will have to restart all over again. For what? playing the game by the rules?My online experience has been dreadful. And trying to discuss it to the staff directly results in hanging up copy and pasted replies that CLEARLY indicate that my issue has not even been read and/or be left to deal with an automated reply by some bot because of a subject I selected as to try and stick to guidlines. A really alround great staff.So if you have poor internet or just aren't interested in online gameplay then go ahead and get the game for the singleplayer campaign. I dare say you might enjoy it! HOWEVER If you are thinking of getting this game for online. Remove from any wishlists shopping carts and start looking for a different game with at least 90% less hackers. I understand games have hackers in them but 9 in 10 servers is an absolute joke. If i wanted to play a pc game to deal with unfair gameplay with hackers I would have brought any CoD.tl dr DO NOT BUY FOR MULTIPLAYER,Grand Theft Auto V

I should get a refund and not have to rebuy the stupid upgrade I already paid $250 000 for. Your in game items are over priced as and the missions dont pay well enough to afford anything. Between the game being $60 and then shark cards this game is ruined. You better not up red dead redemption like this or I'm not gonna buy another game from you guys because it's just toxic to own a game from your company.

From the enjoyable story plot to the activites Grand Theft Auto V demonstrates a strong effort into creating a cohesive well planned game. Grand Theft Auto Online also holds its own with new content being released frequently and modes that prevent one from getting bored. This game is also easy to mod and add extra expansions that can keep this game relevant. Overall great game!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-26,0,0,833,False,Not Recommended,"New Update Nope just nope. Rockstar says modding is illegal. All they cared about was making money on this game from day one. There will be NO MORE MODS. So if you're buying this on pc for mods save some money and don't bother because there won't be any.Well after continuous updates the game no longer runs on my computer. Even after a fresh install. Used to work just fine. Now though it'll crash after about 1/2 of gameplay.Update again after new graphics driver as well as insuring everything is up to date. The game is broken for me. Again they only care about not so micro transactions so their updates are for content only. Not making sure the game works. I can no longer recommend this game at all.6/21/2017I will never take this review down or review it. An attack against gaming itself shouldn't ever be forgotten. Take Two made games shaped my childhood starting on the Playstation 1. They used to make games to be fun. Not be be a money sucking leach. Oh well plenty of other publishers and game developers that really deserve my support. I will never EVER buy a Take Two and certainly not a Rockstar game again as long as i live.7/1/2017Rockstar/TakeTwo changed their mind. I haven't. They push content for multiplayer and it never comes to singleplayer without mods. Oh and there's a DLC they promised for singleplayer that still hasn't happened. OH and guess what hackers get banned. The malicious ones that make the game unplayable? Nope. Just ones that give out money. It's not worth buying unless it's $15.11/22/2017Update time. Should you get this game? NO. 1 their takedown of mods caused a severe distruption to singleplayer modding. The required scripthook is almost never available to due GTA getting an update for multiplayer that breaks the hook shortly after release. 2. If you're not a ""whale"" aka rich enough to buy shark cards have fun spending countless dozens of hours grinding to earn enough money to buy ANY of the most recent cars. 1.5 million GTA dollars or higher. Which to buy with real money is obscene.

2018-02-10,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,I've been big fan of the Grand Theft Auto series since GTA 3. I think this game is amazing in every way possible. When Online launched me and my friends spent countless hours doing the most random things in game together having fun making money and memories. When I seen the next gen trailer I was blown away and pre ordered the game for second time. And when it launched again I played for countless hours. When the PC version launched I couldn't play it due to me not having a PC that could run it. When I finally got my new PC GTA 5 was one of my first purchases and I was looking forward to grinding. But I was upset deep down about how Rockstar decided to make this games grind to literally be endless. Overpriced items and vehicles 30k for a mask? Really? Making money in this game is almost in possible and is way too grindy. People run around in this game with God mode No clip freezing other players Deranking other players Taking away money and generally running a muck and ruining the fun. And they don't get banned. But. If you decide to download a menu to have some fun in Single player and Invite only sessions with a couple friends instant ban. When it comes to ruining others fun it's all dandy and just fine. But having fun with a harmless menu. Unacceptable. I'm done with this game. I had my fun and this game will be dead soon.,Grand Theft Auto V

You are able to switch between a Xbox control if you wish for driving flying etc. Then go back to the keyboard and mouse for running on foot for shootouts. Full of Graphic settings to mess with to find the sweet spot of fps and eyecandy that you perfer. (Long shadows and mountains can eat fps with long shadows.)On a sidenote I had issues with crashes dealing with ERR_GFX_D3D_INT. (GTX 980 SC) In event viewer it will say Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has succesfully recovered. I have tired reinstalling the drivers along with the game. Each of course at different times. Even lowering the factory overclock to stock did not help. After countless hours of missing out playing with friends I redid the GTA 5 ready drivers but this time only installing the driver Physx system driver. (Do not install the HD Audio that appeared to be my issue.)Dealing with the crashing it was random sometimes loading right into online or in about a hour or two. That happening in heists causes a failure for your friends and teamates. For me it left a bad taste in my mouth to let them down. Anyways enough of the QQ.

The largest most ambitious world Rockstar has created with an insane amount of detail and variey from ghettos in Los Santos to hippie camps this game has it all. A campaign that lasts 30 hours with some of the most fun missions I have ever seen in any GTA and a story that really is in relation to the time the game was released (2013). Combine that with a large multitude of mechanics each perfected to the game's desires. Driving shooting flying running all work together as one. Finally there is an online mode and despite the microtransactions and hackers can be amazing when only with friends due to some of the best co op gameplay ever seen in an open world game.This game is a masterpiece.

2017-06-14,0,0,823,False,Recommended,This is probably the best game of all time for me because of mods and the Rockstar editor.The online is fun... when it works. Most of the time you'll be sitting at a loading screen... just waiting and waiting.. It's horrible. There are times I've waited 10 minutes and other times where I've waited almost half an hour. It's just a huge waste of time but great when it works. There is a lot of things to do online.Story is great but not as good as GTA 4's story but still entertaining nonetheless. The open world could of used more interiors and places to go to. It's just very empty but mods exist to fix this problem. Graphics are still incredible especially maxed out but the NPC models don't look as good as the story models. They are just not as detailed. No interactivity with NPCs and environment like in GTA 4. In GTA 4 you could buy hotdogs from vendors pick up items off the ground and throw them climb and scale a lot of things etc... GTA 5 has some things to do but not as much.With all that being said I still give this game a 10/10. It's perfect for a creator like me.

The pricing in Online is not as horrible as people make it out to be it's just like any other game that requires you to farm to get what you want. People want things too easy these days (aka every c*nt ever that complains about how things require time and dedication). News flash bud YOU EITHER HAVE THE TIME TO PLAY OR YOU DON'T oh boi the flak I'll get for defending Rockstar's pricing.I'd say the primary issue I have with this game is that it's hard to consistently earn money if half of the time what you're doing is staring at a loading screen. Doesn't matter if you have the game installed on an SSD or HDD it just relies on connectivity but it's still f*cking awful 1 2 minute(s) just to disconnect from a mission session.First Person View gets a huge plus from me it's like playing a new game.Game is worth every penny you paid for it even just for the singleplayer alone.,Grand Theft Auto V

Everything is just beautiful with this game. I recommend the game to anyone that likes the GTA series or for the psychopaths that just want to go in and kill everyone. Also an excellent game because I can take my real life frustrations out by killing people and hooking up with hookers.10/10 IGN GameStop and whatever other gaming review industries that are out there.EDIT ROCKSTAR GOT RID OF MODS SO I NOW DO NOT CARE FOR THIS GAME.

2017-06-15,0,0,942,False,Recommended,Rockstar might be one of my favorite gaming franchises. It never ceases to impress me with their content and their singleplayer campaigns are always fun with a little bit of dark humor mixed in. The online for me is a totally different story however. The community can be pretty toxic occasionally thats not the worst of it the money system in the online is horrible. Assuming you aren't hacking or cheating the only way to get money in game is to either spend the equivalent time youd spend in a part time job or spend a part time jobs worth of cash just to afford the shark cards in order to even scratch the surface of what GTA online has to offer. If you are just buying this game for the singleplayer then you will not be dissapointed although you may be incredibly annoyed by the wealth gap in its online mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-14,0,0,688,False,Recommended,I am playing GtaV since it was announced on xbox 360. I was shocked by the graphics because it actually was a pretty well designed game. I didn't payed attetion to the story that much because younger me though that GTA games were only cheat codes 5 stars police chases ect. I reaplay it on pc and I understand it was a lot more to it. The story is flawless the characters are very well designed. The game cauterize America on its own way. The graphics on pc are amazing! A lot of people are complaining about the price tag (60 euros in my country) even though it has been about 2 years since it was released. We pay the full price BUT we get every DLC for free! I haven't play online that much but I can safely say that you are going to have a lot of fun. The best way to play online is by having friends along but that doesn't mean that you are not going to enjoy it alone. My opinion? 10 out of 10. I have some complaints about the bushes and the trees but that cannot change my opinion for this game. I 100% suggest it!,Grand Theft Auto V

The game play is great and is really fun if you get friends playing with you.The only thing we would like more is if they would make everything on the public room in invite only room because I could fill a room with friends and we all could do our on thing and not get in a room with players that call bad or players that can kill everyone on the map at the same time.Now if you are a new player it's going hard until you get some money up in the bank so I would recommend looking at some YouTube videos to guide you On the best and fastest way to make money or get some friends together and play hard on some jobs for VIP'S or CEO'S.Good luck to all and may you make a lot on bank.

GTA used to be a fun game where you didn't need to buy shark cards or grind for days just to get the latest gear even if you do grind successfully you'll most likely be killed numerous times by a kid in a flying car which was bought with mummy or daddy's credit card or by a modder as they seem to be invading every server. If you do buy the game get it on sale with a shark card bundle as that's your best bet as it will take weeks to get what you want or even worse end up splashing cash on shark cards.

The heists Inport Export missions contact missions VIP missons they are all fun but the MC and Bunker bussinesses are crap. They were big updates but the money method is really boring it's like they don't care about that. The steal missions are boring and long. Everytime I want to play some races adversary modes or heists I can't you maybe ask why? the reason is THE SERVERS SUCK. My internet connection is good 35mbps download and about 10mbps upload but whenever I join the lobby or try to play with my friends it just lags and says that everybody left the lobby.

2017-06-27,0,0,225,False,Recommended,GTA V is one of my favorite games of all time. The map was beautifully designed the characters the story and the voice acting is all amazing. The driving mechanics and car customization is better than most racing genre games I've played. I just wish they would have come out with some single player DLC because I can't get enough of this game. The multiplayer is fun too but it waters down the features that bring the open world to life.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-17,0,0,134,False,Recommended,"It's still a game I want to play but the ingame credits are hard to come by and the out of game credits that would open up the new content is way overpriced.There are really cool roleplay severs but due to the player limit they're constantly busy.There's also the old holdover of being banned mid session for whatever reason Rockstar deems fit as they don't have to tell you why.As I said I want to spend money to open up the new content but it's over priced and requires ""friends"" very weird game world trying to be realistic and fun but failing at the most fundamental level that of having a low barrier of entry to the new content.The races are fun if you can find a group of people to race with. If you like open sandbox games buy it. If you like a strong (although OTT but this is Grand Theft Auto) story inside that sandbox buy this game.IF you enjoy online play get this game if you find it easy to make friends. If you don't find it easy to make friends make the effort and buy this game.But lets take it in stages shall we.Game mechanics sound and graphics.Robustly involving Easy to learn difficult to master comes down to practice. This can be especially important when on missions that require the control of the three characters.As in previous GTA games the mini games are an interesting diversion but that's all it really is. The tennis can be interesting but the golf is a bit annoying a lot like the real thing actually. I haven't tried the others though.Earning cash can be done but sadly only by reading tips and tricks on forums and websites. The main missions however progress enough for you to make enough cash for the important stuff. Making money can come down to exploring and taking advantage of what you see so when driving around do take a moment to keep an eye out.The scenery is absolutely amazing too.The soundtrack is as usual top notch while not all players may appreciate all the music genres that exist there is something for everyone.Pros Lots of things to do through the eyes of three protagonists each with different backgrounds you may end up actually not liking any of them though. Online play can make this a title you return to for many months or indeed years to come. It's the freedom and fun found in the original Grand Theft Auto updated for the 21st Century.Cons When you start playing a four hour session will in fact be eight or more. This is unfortunate as well as a testimony to it's greatness. The best online modes are locked until a fairly high level is reached. Online play can of course be random at best terrible at worst or if you're lucky enough to have a good group of friends a brilliant exhilarating experience.So if you're in doubt buy it or wait till the price has lowered the servers will still be active and there'll me more tips and advice to enjoy.Hopefully there will be less of an elitism but I believe it's more of a time/money/effort balance that could be addressed by Rockstar by having lower level Heists to act as an introduction to the current ones.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-07,0,0,1306,False,Not Recommended,i have played this game for over 1000 hours so i thought it was about high time that i wrote a review for it story mode the story mode of gta 5 is honestly pretty good because of the fact that you can explore the entire map from the beginning of the game also i think that the missions that you do show the emotional connection between the main characters (especially michael and trevor).online to be honest online sucks d*ck because of countless hackers that attack you when you are having a good time pvp'ing against other people in the last month i haven't had ONE single session that was filled with players without a hacker in it that was messing things up for others. other than the hackers i also advise against buying it if you dont have friends that play regularly because of the ENORMOUS amount of choices that you have to make and account for if you start playing GTA ONLINE. if you do have friends that play regularly and are also pretty good at the game then go ahead and buy it in sale for 30 bucks.in all honesty R* should have stopped releasing DLC after the IMPORT/EXPORT DLC because now there are sooooo many OP vehicles in the game like the Hunter helicopter Khanjali tank rocket APC Rocket bike and some other planes that got implemented in the smugglers run update not to mention the HORRIBLE explosive ammo that every noob/tryhard abuses. DON'T PLAY GTA ONLINE IF YOU WANT TO GRIND MONEY OR TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE GRIND MONEY BECAUSE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A HACKER OR A TRYHARD IN A STARLING/HYDRA TO BLOW YOU TO BITS!so just trust my words (after all i played the game for 1000+ hours) when i say that the game isnt worth it anymore because of toxic community and constant new updates that put unbelievably expensive items in the game.just don't a concerned player.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,333,False,Recommended,Fun when its good an extremely frustrating tedious ing grind when its not.I've only played Online mode so i wont review singleplayer. PROS Heaps of content for your money loads of activities missions races etc. Combat Driving Pedestrians all the things that make a GTA game awesome.Character customization including weapons clothing and accessories (they cost a lot of money though).The Heists are fun and interesting the first few times the cutscenes can get annoying though.Cool and unique game modes.Free DLCCan grown weed and cook methCONS Take two tried to remove singleplayer mod support not cool they should be able to work how to stop cheaters without trying to do DCMA takedowns (or whatever its called).Loading so much loading its crazy.Some missions and heists send you driving across the entire ing map its alot of driving to do.Everything is really expensive and making money takes alot of time (mainly because of all the loading). Even clothes and jackets etc cost thousands of $$.A lack of control over the mission and setup lobbies you cant just do a bunch of setup missions and then do the heist. After EVERY setup you load back into freemode (if the lobby has got a lot of players this takes a ton of time).Missions work a little differently you can choose from a selected bunch of missions on the lobby voting screen however they took away the ability to 'replay' the last mission so you cant just grind the same mission over to make money.Some instances of cheating personally I've only seen it a handful of times i just find a new session straight away.TIPS Play with friends more friends more money making potential join a crew as well. Get the Armoured Kuruma Passive Mode use when you dont want to be killed over and over The micro SMG Go off radar Get an Apartment/Penthouse that enables you to do the Heists. you should really do your research before purchasing an apartment. Think about what you want to get out of the location and what other jobs/activites that you regularly do are nearby? Where is the nearest Helipad? Is is near the CEO/Biker office/clubhouse? What garages are nearby? Is it easy to get home if someone is chasing you? Get a place out of town When you can afford it buy a cheap garage or house out in the country the city is very chaotic lots of players have their homes there and it can be a pain to always start in the mayhem. Buy a fast aircraft When you have the money buy a fast air transport the Buzzard is a good choice any personal vehicle can almost always be called for missions and freemode. Check the websites for vehicle discounts I got the Savage attack helicopter (the Russian HIND gunship) for 1.4 million on special. Watch the minimap you should always have one eye on the minimap in freemode. Only buy a few guns And clothes etc. If you buy an item of clothing you cannot get rid of it and things can end up clogging your clothes/weapon menu. Macros If you can do it setup macros for putting on armor and changes clothes etc they are usually several menus deep. Eat Snacks Press M and go down to where it says 'action' change it to eat snack then you can press Capslock to eat and regain your health. You can spam it while in cover (press Q) or in your vehicle. Go into passive mode Before Heisting with randoms go into passive mode at the end of a setup mission or heist you all load into free mode right next to eachother! Anyone can and WILL shoot you in the back. Save your money Save save save everything costs even a gray jacket in the clothes store costs like $20 000. Sometimes its best to hold off any purchases.When its all running smoothly its a ton of fun some of the missions make you drive a long way but other than that the game is awesome. With this game you really need to be making an effort to always be making money doing missions setups/heists biker CEO jobs etc. Sure you can roam in freemode stuffing about its great fun but focus on making money and things become much better.,Grand Theft Auto V

Thats all good what i can say about this product.GTA Online form other site is just money machine where (just like on YouTube) some algorithm making rules. No contact with Rockstar support if you are simply player who dont pay for they sharks cards or you are not modder who using anti ban protection you gonna be banned Your money and RP points gonna disappear at time to time (usually after DLC release). i came back to this game after year brake when Rockstar took from my game accout over 6 from 11 mln (wich i was keeping for new DLC) i try to get aswer why but responds for e mails looks like some automatic ones. Today afet maybe 3 weeks of game i've been banned for a month and both my charakters (one on very high level) been reset. And why? Probobly cos i was victim of modder. So what you doing with victims? Of course ban them! What you doing with modders? Nothing cos you cant do nothig!Beside i notice after many DLC all old bugs are still on even few new ones so R have interest in adding game plays and cars (on wich hopefully you gonna spend real money) but they have no interest to make game playable for regular players. GTA 1 was one of my first games later all wich use to be release on PC till now. GTA V is my last game from Rockstar. You dont gonna get a penny from my wallet and i dont gonna recomend your work to enyone. I know maybe i wrote more about this how i feel about way how R treat players then a game but i cant tell this to them in e mail or any other way so i think is best pleaceMaybe if You have similar feelings after play in GTA Online You gonna take my side and boycot Rockstar.So now i only click Unistall button and never see You again dear R team...,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-23,0,0,572,False,Not Recommended,I don't recommend this game. GTA5 story mode was quite good a fair bit of content for solo players. However the reason I don't recommend this game overall is for several reasons that can be summed up with GTA online sucks balls!First off there is the player base most people are alright but the few s in this game are enough to ruin online play. You have pay to win idiots that throw some money at R* and buy the most overpowered weaponized vehicle and spend all day flying around blowing other players up for no reason other than they have a micro peen. Then there are the modders that do the same except they just use cheats. Finally the pay to win s that ruin the racing again by just buying the best car available putting the best mods on it then spend all day hosting races with rules that only benefit them and then kick players that have the nerve to beat them fair and square.Second the content. As I mentioned there is a lot of single player content easily 100 hours. However 90% of this game's content is online. If they add new vehicles guns properties missions or whatever it is online only! Online and takes many many many ing hours of grinding to buy all while the players are trolling away with their OP toys. There is no balance grinding money is no fun after a while. This game is just a huge cash cow for R* and it's only fun if you are willing to empty your bank account into R*'s pockets.Anyway... Rockstar!*Edit*Also R* seem to ban players just for associating with cheats. My friend and I were doing some heists with some randoms and suddenly my friend and the guy on his team for the mission both went offline and my friend got a message saying he had been banned for 30 days and his characters reset. My friend admittedly can be a bit of a sometimes but he is not a cheat he's being punished just for having a cheat ride in his car. Could have happened to anyone. Sort your ing out Rockstar!

2018-03-07,0,0,351,False,Recommended,Let me just preface this with saying that this is my first GTA game I've ever played so yeah here's my review. I've put in quite a bit of time into this game and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in every way. Rockstar has put in a lot of effort into their latest AAA title and it shows. This game hosts multiple types of gameplay from racing to shooting to tennis minigames. The story is rich in action although I did find it a little boring at times overall it was amazing. This experience is further enhanced by GTA Online which brings forth a slew of multiplayer missions heists and gamemodes that significantly increase the playing time of this game. With the Rockstar team adding new things on a near weekly basis playing GTA Online never gets boring for me. I'd recommend this game for everyone.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-29,0,0,77,False,Recommended,For this review I am going to treat the single player and online as seperate games.The single player is one of the greatest open world videogames of all time. Los Santos is ginormas and sprawling with each distinct area perfectly flowing into the next creating the most lived in worlds of any videogame.GTA Online however is a completely different game which is utterly flawed by the in game economy. To do literally anything in the game you have to have money and lots of it. Thats fine by itself however when you factor in that you have to do hours of grinding to earn enough to afford any of the cool stuff. To make the matter even worse you can buy in game money with real world money making the game pay to win. And finally to top all that off there is the toxic community.So in conclusion buy for the single player and not for the multiplayer and you won't be disappointed.,Grand Theft Auto V

There is no clear pattern Some play heists some are racers some mainly derp about in freemode..You see Rockstar reserves the right to ban anyone for anything (including nothing)... and support is beyond insulting(!) They are hitting the legit communities and 30 players in my extended circle got banned recently. Most did nothing wrong in particular (if at all).They even disabled phone support ... Now is just talking to a chat bot (named Cliffy??) till maybe able to escalate to an actual person (who is pointless to talk to) and might be kind enough to escalate it to *his* supervisor. Maybe if talking to the supervisor's supervisor something can be achieved...

2015-05-12,0,0,164,False,Recommended,Gta 5 is a good singleplayer game. Great story good action and lots of stuff to play around with. The story had me involved and I really enjoyed all the characters. Some of the scenes in the game were very well done to bring an emotion out of you and this game says alot of truth about our society but hides behind satire which is ok. It's also pretty long too if you can d other things while doing teh campaign I don't think it was a long as GTA SA but the missions have alot more life to them. You can run people over which is my favorite thing to do or you can mingle around like a normal citizen and punch people in teh face. This is a good game if you getting it for the single player. The multiplayer is what turns me off. You got two sides of the coin here first off they did an alright job of putting it together in free mode and the instance zones but it takes a big dump is its heist mode with friends. Why you ask PEER TO PEER gaming folks. Its 2015 and R* is that cheap even though they made their investment back and then some but they haven't spent any time fixing the horrible lag issues. My friends and I all live in the same area roughly and have good internets but we can't do a heist ever. It lags out and is one reason why I stopped playing the game. If you do get lucky with your buddies and have smooth gameplay and a good time well good for you but for alot of people the lag makes it unbearable. The whole online experience I have had has left a bad taste in my mouth if your just gonna screw around in free mode go ahead but you better find people who have super internets and live close by if you want to have a smooth heist experience.

2018-01-09,0,0,406,False,Not Recommended,Okay. So I played this game when I had an xbox 360 about two or three years ago. I upgraded my PC and recently decided to return to it but it is NOT the same game. Microtransactions were always a part of the game but back then 20$ shark card took you a long way. Now the top end vehicles in the game sell from the dealers for like 50 100$ in REAL LIFE. The value of about 1.4 million is 20$ 3.5M is about 50$ and there's another for 99$. Thing is the most awesome cars businesses flying motorcycles all of that ranges between 2.4 million 5 million dollars in game. Specifically the flying motorcycle costs about 50$ in shark cards. Do not waste money on this game unless you just wanna rob stores with friends. At best legitimate money making will take at least 4 5 hours a day to get anywhere. Forget it if you're a solo player like me as well. CEO and MC jobs REQUIRE that you have a team of other players or you are blocked from doing anything with them.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-09,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,Well I tried. I dealt with random connection issues griefers hackers and silly design choices from rockstar. This game has some fun elements. Overall though it's not worth the money or time investment. The mediocre amount of fun I was having in GTA O during heists required a significant amount of grind to attain and the rest was pointless timewasting. The single player game was heralded to me as some fantastic mix of amazing characters but really just left me thinking that no one knows what good characters are like.Overall it's a mediocre game that you'll dump a lot of time into trying to find the fun parts before finally getting bored blowing up some personal vehicles and getting dumped into the bad sport lobby. Then you'll quit playing. If that's worth $60 to you feel free.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,690,False,Recommended,Review Edited due to Rockstar removing the Cease and Desist. Grand Theft Auto V is following the proud tradition of changing up the gameplay featuring three different playstyles along with an online which while it takes a lot of grinding can be rewarding if you have friends to play with. Franklin represents the older 3D games a character who starts from the botom and claws his way to the top lacking a litle in the character front with Lamar Davis being the most annoying side character I have had to deal with.Trevor represents the old top down GTAs which were more murder friendly rewarding you for running over groups of elvises. Micheal represents the new style of GTA someone who is near the top but is stagnating and needs that push to do the crazy Then we have online online if you have friends to play with is fun if not you have good nights where you can earn money go to car meets iwth randos and chill. Then you have bad nights where people who either just bought shark cards or hacked money are just killing the people trying to work for their content. Shark Cards haven't been adjusted since GTA O came out the max shark card is 8m which is nothing in GTA Cash so it makes them a huuge waste of money R* would need to adjust them and refund anybody who has ever bought one the difference to make them relevant again.In Summary If you have friends and the game goes on a hell of a sale get it if not I would avoid this game as its still very expensive considering its age.,Grand Theft Auto V

OK yeah you have to buy those but at least you can go around and use everything that came with the game without having to grind for hours on end or just purchase money also those expansions added extra single player story and that for me is a reason I play the game. Another problem is people are losing their money who have legitimately earned that money and people who actually deserve to be punished are fine. I will admit I have been banned for the use of mods (which was entirely my fault my single player mods were still on when I went onto online) which was fine I understood that. The hiest missions are pointless unless you have 3 other people who are good or else you probably have a better chance at the casino. Each mission could also be done with just 2 people as well I don't understand why it had to be 4. Why does everything need 4 people like the MC/IE/etc,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-01,0,0,268,False,Not Recommended,DISCLAIMER From all of the friends I know who play this game it seems that only a few are getting crashes and similar but not as frequently. you might not experience problems and if you can avoid them the game is AMAZING you will undoubtadly (if that is how you spell it) get an endless amount of hours in this game.At first i thought that Rockstar Games was one of the best companies and I still in a way think that because of my lack of experience so take this review with a grain of salt. I always thought that 60 dollar games arent worth it however i made an exception with this game. When i heard of the amazing reviews this game had i thought why not give it a go? In the begginning I hade amazing thoughts about the game (even though the tutorial for online alone is longer than 2 hours so once you do that you wont get a refund). I was addicted to this game even though the amount of bugs i have experienced. I have been finding the usual bug here or there and that was ok but getting TEXTURE GLITCHES AND GAME CRASHES so frequently. I have done everything to fix this I have searched through forums and forums and still no fix. The cherry ontop of the cake is that after 80 hours in the game GTA Online is glitched and cant seem to fix it either and everytime i start up the game its like starting it up from scratch. Thankfully I didnt lose the game files as other people have. I have read about that and the answer that everyone got is to save their game files on their pc EVEN THOUGH there is an option to save your game files to the cloud. Theese arent all of the problems i have experienced but just a few and for a 60 dollar game it is disgraceful. However if you can avoid the problems somehow this game is a steal.,Grand Theft Auto V

You might get banned you might not. It kills the immersion however. This is a 2+ year old game and i paid $60. I feel cheated this is a ripoff if you're just buying it for the online.

2018-02-12,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Didn't play the multiplayer yet so this is for Singelplayer only.Fantastic game. Really quite a masterpiece actually. One I won't soon forget. The story is immersive and well written and the main characters are very likable. Something that put me off the older GTA games was that we always had to have this mafia / gangster cliché going on. For once GTA isn't just about crime all the time. GTA V lets us do other stuff (which is actually relevant) in the game world. You're focused on a more realistic interpretation of a person with each of these characters getting involved in their lives and ultimately caring about their choices. I really hope we see more of Trevor Micheal and Franklin.Now for the revolutionary stuff. This game blends 3rd person with 1st person like nobodies business. You can gracefully transition between views during pretty much any time giving you unprecidented access and control over what you're doing. First person in this game is just so good and feels natural to use. You'll get to see the world in all its detail through the eyes of the characters. The game world is beautiful and feels boundless. Runs smooth as butter on the PC and didn't cook my card.A memorable moment for me from this game would be taking a breather after speeding down a highway whilst avoiding cars panning my camera up to see Michael's son dangling from yatch on a trailer also going 100 miles an hour and watching him sheepishly drop into the back of my convertible. How I pulled that one off in first person I do not know. But it was possible and it felt great.Come for the story. Stay for the sandbox.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-07,0,0,298,False,Recommended,"GTA V was the game to break the internet back in 2013 with record breaking sales. The game earned it's records too. Great Story gameplay the usual GTA humor among other things that earned it's praise. If you are thinking of buying the game for the singleplayer experience you will not be disappointed.GTA Online is a rather mixed bag for me and I'm sure majority of the community. GTA Online is the first attempt by Rockstar to create a multiplayer experience in the MMO style. Saldy that did come with MMO's cancerous microtransactions. In my opinion if you are thinking of buying GTA V for GTA Online to enjoy the game with friends (and I mean friends as in no less than 3 other mates) then you will enjoy the game. If you are flying lone wolf then... Payouts are so bad that by the time you earned enough money to enjoy one of the more expensive objects in the game you may be old enough to qualigfy for pension. A game about a sandbox world where you can murder destroy and generally make the world feel your wrath... can lose some of its fun when you are joined by up to 29 other players who have the same potential for chaos. Sandbox games and chaos have a way of mixing weirdly depending on who causes the chaos. Finally whether it was the developer or the publisher who decided a game that went for ""full price"" this generation and last gen have a free to play's business model has some interesting thoughts... You may feel milked for your money playing GTA Online.In short. GTA V? 10/10 Singleplayer. GTA Online... kinda like a relationship... happiest kind of torture to endure/enjoy",Grand Theft Auto V

It's just Storymode only.. the Online play is is wracked with lagging servers broken game scripts that has and will make it impossible to finish missions. Rockstar's customer support will continuously blame your computer is at fault for the server side issues and degregading scripts.But more than that Rockstar Games has fired the heart of Grand Theft Auto Leslie Benzies the creator of the GTA series and the game has deteriorated to a simple racing game. So unless you want to take part in a corporation riding a dying cash cow that they killed themselves..The game is only good in storymode only..,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-15,0,0,199,False,Not Recommended,Now that this game has been out for a while I wanted to redo my review. Originally I enjoyed the game and I still do. It runs well plays well and most bugs have been worked out. However if you want to get this for the multiplayer look elsewhere. R* didn't have a problem banning people for FOV fixes but even now months after release there are still true hackers ruining the game for others. You can't kill them. Not to mention that even during peak times you get grouped into lobbies with 5 10 people. RediculousAnd now with what is probably the worst sales tactic I've ever seen. They bring the game to sale for 30$ for 2 hours. Those lucky to spam refresh on the store page got a great deal. Everybody else is getting royally shafted. The base game as well as a 5+ year old game that's normally on sale for less than 10$ and a 20$ in game cash card are now bundled together for the Low LOW price of.... 59.99 The same it was BEFORE it went on sale.So if you want to pay a premium for an old game the base game which is almost 2 years old mind you and i'm guessing less than 500k Multiplayer money then go buy this game. you Rockstar,Grand Theft Auto V

Tried everthing i can using third party softwares tweaking the game settings cleaning and re installing drivers optimizing through geforce experiance cleaning registeries defragmenting HDD and God knows how much sh!t i have done for this game to run smoothly. Not recommended unless Rock$tar patches this sh!t.EDIT Seems to work fine with another 4 gigs of ram. Perhaps the game won't run any good on 4gb ram so you definetly need to upgrade to atleast 8gb of ram. As for the game its awesome.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-29,0,0,0,False,Recommended,I bought the game outside of steam and only paid around 46$I dont think buying GTA V within steam is the best of ideas because of the 70$ (CAD) that we need to spend.So if youre really interested in getting the game you could just use special bundle sites such as HumbleBundle or GreenManGaming. Both sites give great offers and with the 23% discount going on right now you could get the game for even cheaper. Overall the game is fun and probably gives more than 1000 hours of gameplay (UNTIL THE GAME GETS BORING). If you want a different GTA experience this is what youre looking for. But switching around settings is very limited so if you dont know if your computer can handle it DO NOT PURCHASE.SUMARY I recommend this game OUTSIDE of steam and only if you know your PC can handle it.Very small mod support but it comes with a built in cheatcode operation system.Only get the game on steam if you really care about fully suppoerting the game....

2017-02-24,0,0,481,False,Recommended,Category Details Rating Graphics GTA V's graphics still hold up to be some of the best graphics of today even for a 5 year old game. Mods enhance this even further 9/10 Preformance Preformance is great! Game is very optimized. However the servers do seem to be an issue as people are frequently kicked into solo sessions and various other issues. 8/10 Gameplay Gameplay is great especially content wise there is so much to do. But after a while things to get repetitive in online. Movement is a bit weird and clunky but I can look past that. 9/10 Community/Developers The only problem with the community is the people that treat GTA Online like it's one big Team Deathmatch. The developers and Rockstar in general are doing terrible with this game. The in game economy is f*cked and there are hackers and modders everywhere. Rockstar never seems to add what the community asks for but rather pushes out DLC with overly expensive vehicles and clothing every so often. 6/10 Story/Singleplayer The story mode is one of the best stories I have ever played I think I've done it over 10 different times at this point across two different platforms. It is also fun to just have fun d*cking around in singleplayer and do whatever you want. And you can have mods to enhance the experience. 9.5/10 Overall Grade 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-23,0,0,120,False,Not Recommended,What should start with Full of tryharder hydra or oppressor that ruin every one fun in the game. Lack of optimization and full of crushes in my case. It has good heist and story in them but I can t join them with random because they DC at end just for troll or bad internet. Infinit grinding that take a lot of time even with import/export veicules is difficult and also areoverprice stuff like car properties etc more likely to make you buy shark card that is extremely overprices too. Moders that ruin your work teleporting or explode you. DDOS attack must be ban and to stopt it because is criminal even is some hours whit out it hacking your internet and you can t use it anymore only if you change you re IP as a method so you can get regain internet but is very rare this type of attack but can happend if someone from online get upset with you.As an overall the game it have bad competitive mecanics because when I start an freeroom mission most of the players will try to destroy your payload but the point is to steal it not to destroy it and hydra tryharder or how I name them s are the wrost thing in GTA online beacuse they attack for no reason most of times and for they're KDR.The single player is extremely good experience and some aspect from GTA online like game modes heist (if you can play it) and some mission can be a good experience. This was a review focus more on online because it is the game future because in single player you don t need to buy shark card because that in online is more profitable for them to make money and with update more content added people will want to have money so they will have the new future content.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-07,0,0,166,False,Recommended,This game is incredible its action packed and if you are a citizen you can help and follow the laws there s also cheats if you are on story mode gta v is a game related to real life if for example you can accidentally hit someone with your car and rob a store have a drink so I would give this game a 5 star rating the best game related to the possibilities in life also there are phones and websites and you have money it s like a virtual reality real life game and all is the same,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-24,0,0,76,False,Not Recommended,Don't normally post reviews on games but I have to help in the protest of the OpenIV mod takedown.GTA V is an incredible game and Rockstar did some amazing work making it but with no DLC or updates to the single player mode and campain mods have been a vital part in driving up the sales on a already 5 6 year old game. And if your someone like me who does not have amazing enough internet to enjoy the online mode we have to settle with the vanilla single player and flavor it up with mods. So until ROCKSTAR which is the same company as Take2 resolves this and brings modding back in I will not be playing GTA V.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-28,0,0,517,False,Not Recommended,EDIT Changing this review because I wouldn't recommend this game anymore. If you a casual player and want to buy the last releases in online mode forget it. You will probably have to grind for weeks in order to buy the most expensive car in the game or... buy a shark card and that's exactly what Rockstar wants you to do. If you are like me someone that study full time or work you will feel as frustrated as I do when they release new content in online.It's an amazing game no doubts about it. It's huge the story mode is very funny with very distinct characters. The online mode is very funny to play with friends get some money buy new stuff and plant the chaos around Los Santos. One con is the amount of hackers every day I always find one or two and they teleport are invincible drop money (what sucks the game's economy) and disrupt your gameplay. Despite this I recommend buying this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

The gameplay is just amazing makes up for whatever thing you disliked in the game in genral . It's simply fun .Grand Theft Auto Online is a whole other story it used to be so good but it had to be ruined .As you all may know the servers of this game are horrible . Take a look for yourself this is an actual 100% legit image of the GTA Online servers (since links are removed google search ""potato with wires""...) . It will take you around 2 6 minutes to join a session and there is a fairly high chance you will disconnect which is so annoying at times .The next extremely annoying ""feature"" is the super expensive cars . It's not annoying that it's expensive what's annoying is that if you try to play heists or missions 1 of 2 things will happen 1 You will disconnect because of the server . 2 You will get the worst teammates ever . Believe it from someone who knows how hard this is I grinded for 3 days trying to get 10 Million Dollars so I can get my yacht . It could've ended in a day if it wasn't for these stupid servers and stupid level 4 players who don't know how to open a parachute .If Rockstart could just fix their servers this game would be great . Believe me it would be the best game ever they got everything right but they had to ruin it . Preformance wise this game is great gameplay wise it's the best . Online wise ....",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-24,0,0,683,False,Recommended,this game is like Lennie from of mice and men. you think he's ok at first but once you start to get to know the guy he knows jack about anything (pricing) and holds on to when they get scared (again pricing). you love Lennie but you know that this dream you both want will never happen. Eventually you're going to have to shoot Lennie and let go of his this game is good but when you've been playing for 6 hours straight and have only gotten 1 mill (not even enough to buy a decent house) you get kind of mad. So all in all if you're going to get this game be prepared to either play your life away just to get to 10 mill or suck rockstar's and pay $100 us. just to recieve 8 mill which you can then only buy two cool cars with and maybe. just maybe. you can buy a house or office building.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-23,0,0,592,False,Recommended,"Breathing In The Life of San Andreas Some games are picked up played by a gamer and then they are laid down left to dust. Other games are picked up admired by the audience from the trailers and like a good episode of Game of Thrones the audience will automatically know that this will be ""the one"". Or in GTA V's case the ""Big One"". As you play the game you can't help but notice the small minute details that Rockstar puts in the cariacture to present San Andreas as it is an actual real breathing place. This is the first game which really showcased that. Sure there was Sim City but that was a city simulation game. This is an open world game and while you may argue that Skyrim or Fallout New Vegas were good games which I admit they are this game is the first one that started to blur a scripted game to reality.You can see it in the AI. Take for example the cars that people drive down the roads of Blaine County &amp Los Santos. Each one is wearing some different each one drives a different car depending on the area where they live in each one has a seperate gender &amp race which doesn't make it feel like it's an illusion of generated cars &amp vehicles that are set to spawn in certain locations as you drive by which applies to most vehicles that naturally spawn. Then there's the fact that they always seem to be there never popping in like God himself placed the car with the people in there.One of the other areas you can see it in the game is the interactions between the characters. Take the characteristics of Michael for example. He has a surely defined storyline within the game's main storyline itself. All the characters in this game seem to work together 'in harmony"" minus that French yogi &amp that accursed tennis coach! The small viligant villans will try to ruin your character while the rich will as well. The good thing is you will always have a ""little help from my friends"" which is a real good thing! One of the other things that you won't ever forget is how much depth that goes within the storyline and the famous quotes that come from the game. Overall it's a splendid singleplayer experience.Then there's the multiplayer which is always evolving and changing. There's a variety of different tasks for you to take on whether it's managing your Motorcycle Club or partying on the Yatch having fun with the ladies. Whatever your most inner heart desires are just remember one thing from this review DO and I repeat DO NOT let the money rain on you! Report it as fast as you can and you will be saved from spending another $60 dollars plus the Shark Cards you buy.One last thing Fire rockets at Michael's house. He will really appreciate it. Personally he should upgrade to the crib that Franklin owns OR BETTER YET buy a trailer out in the Grand Senora Desert! Trevor will really appreciate being neighbors with you.

The heists are a great addition to the game which makes the planning fun along with medals for each mission and side quest to challenge you for 100%. Online is hit and miss it is best to play with friends as there are people who are a higher level who attack every player or hacks which ruin the online experience. The only safe passage around this is passive mode which means you cannot do much and restricts you to so much. The online game is a grind to earn money through missions like heists races and different modes which makes the game enjoyable.

(Bad Sport.)Modders that can circumvent passive mode by attaching a live campfire on your nuts and roast them like christmas.Modders that can lock your character set you to near perma rag doll mode and knock you around like some malevolent child god throwing a temper tantrum.Modders Now I JUST learned... can send vanilla players straight to Bad Sport lobbies because they seem to have finally found all the values between mental health status that can turn you psycho at will (you give players more RP when you're killed) and actual bad sport points which means for the average player you're going to be in bad sport lobbies regardless of your actual playstyle. which makes both useless.Let me explain why this is so ing &amp quot licking is so hype"" rediculous and plain lies.IN normal lobbies people can report bad players. In Bad sport lobbies? Yeah it's ing nothing. There is no limit to the stupid. So lemme get this straight... Everyone is now a bad sport and can't report actual modders and jackasses.Which potentially makes everything R* does now Moot and breaking their own stupid ing ToS. and as such should not be enforceable ever again. The next GTA better be free.Oh and R* also blocked modding in general because it was causing this problem. Modding which was mostly new rendering new textures and sound effects Glowies shinies and a new coat of paint for extention of life. Not mechanics not how the game worked and for the most part was already incompatible with online because of the consistant patches.The biggest t is how they want you to spend your money $99 for 8 mill.It's a nice chunk of change.Here is the problem any amount of modded menus in the game makes anything rockstar offers as good as whale crap as long as modders can still spawn in whatever. The Nike' of the Modding menu world will not engage if it will be potentially detected will send you a update prompt ... do the download itself AND literally shows you it's new features.The amount of money needed for this game is huge a mod menu will cost anywhere from $20 $50 tops.I'm not saying get them.I'm saying... don't smell right.As far as R* is concerned. Every player is a criminal playing GTAV Online.I'll leave you to you and yours but for me Rockstar (Which is ironically a actual profanity in the lobby chat.) Became EA. So no more purchases from me.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-04-04,0,0,1149,False,Not Recommended,"This game was really ahead of its time when it came out first bought it for xbox 360 then xbox one then PC. I have almost 1000 hours logged into just having it on PC alone. The driving physics are very good the cars and trucks are customizable and have wide variety the combat like gunfights and melee are great weapons customizable map is desently big first person mode is great in driving and combat with good variety of terrain AI are great physics are pretty good though unrealistic but mostly in a good way graphics are awsome variety of gameplay.. All the makings of a good game.I beat the story mode at least 4 times and had a good time doing it the single player mode has countless hours of fun in it. But in order to gain access to about 75% of the other features in the game and play with friends one has to venture to online/multiplayer. Multiplayer was great you could go into lobbies with deathmatches races or complete hesits or jobs with your friends. You can buy houses and store custom cars buy planes at airports you can even start businesses and hire your friend's help with them.Over the years however this game has gone very sour and makes me sick as far as the online world goes i'll try to explain why.This is where my review gets negative. So currently you get into online freemode/freeroam and you can expect this a 30 person lobby consisting one or more of Higher level players obliterating you every chance they get with not only weapons but also players in tanks blowing you up constantly or some guy repeatedly running you over in an armored truck with no chance of you getting up or people in fighter jets spawnkilling you on the ground or in the air. Then theres already or eventually 2 or more hackers blowing up you (and everyone else in the lobby) and killing you every 5 seconds.Somehow with all of this going on you need to make money in the game and lots of it every feature in the game is now mad expensive. Even if have the best means to make money (like the best businesses) and even you are a high level player and even if you have a few friends helping you it takes about 3 hours to gain $1million and thats chump change in this game! There are cars that cost $3mil just for reference. AND theres still some guy in a jet that can decimate you and whatever youve worked for the past 4 hours in about 5 seconds with a cannon blast. I no joke had $3mil worth of stuff (back when money was harder to make I spent a month accumulating that stuff). I was shipping it in a plane to a drop off to make the money and some guy in a jet blew up the plane and i lost every cent of that $3mil in about 5 seconds! No refund!The twisted part is they give players money for destroying other players trying to make money in the game so yea GUESS WHAT EVERONE IN THE GAME IS TRYING TO DO WHEN YOURE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY. OH THEN THERES HACKERS WHO FREEZE YOU THEN BLOW YOU UP AND THEYRE INVICIBLE GOOD LUCK MAKING MONEY!Rockstar seems to only make a concious effort to ban the hackers when theyre doing harmless things like giving other players money. But if somenone in a levetating tank thats invincible kills you everytime you spawn thats perfectly fine. Rockstar only cares when you find a way past buying their in game currency other than that they dont care. OH SO THEN YOU HOP LOBBIES? THE NEXT LOBBY IS EXACTLY THE SAME! If they just spererated violent and nonviolent players based on kills and removed hackers the game would be enjoyable but they dont.Now I will describe the other lobbies other than freeroam/mode. So theres other game modes like race or deathmatch or cool team objective based missions or you can even do small missions that arent in free mode and they give you money BUT NOT NEARLY ENOUGH! Even if you do the highest paying job its like $20k payout and takes more than 10mins to do and thats if your really good. $40k an hour with all the loading screens. $1mil is chump change $40k is less that nothing when youre trying to buy a $3mil business in freemode.You can also play any of the other hundereds of game modes they have but guess what NO ONE IS PLAYING THEM. Part of the problem with this is 1. They dont pay enough for people to actually want to do them2. The game uses a player hosted lobby system so what ends up happening is there are 1000 hosts and only like 10 players willing to join someone else's game. I waited no joke 30 minutes to get 4 players to start a deathmatch map with me. Abysmal. AND THERES STILL PLENTY OF HACKERS WHO ARE INVINCIBLE IN THESE GAMES. If they just made a public server for every game mode that everyone can pile into you might actually get a good amount of players per lobby and again ban the hackers they might be cool but they dont do that.Now you can play races which people actually play and you might join a decent 10 person race if youre lucky but lemme tell ya the races in this game are pretty rage enducing. For one everyone is banging into each and spinning each other out the whole time but thats not what bothers me. What bother me is these devious features that are on by default 1. Catchup which makes your car slower if your in first to give everyone else who is bad a chance to catch up to you and either mess with you or pass you usually both2. Slipstream if anyone is directly behind you they get an ungodly speed boost and just ram you in the rear. They do this repeatedly until they pass you or make you spin out. BOTH OF THESE ARE ON BY DEFAULT AND MAKE RACING SOOOOO MUCH FUN!!! AAAAAH!!!Now you can host a race and configure the options to have both of these off but we all know how long it takes to find enough players to do anything. Plan on about 10mins.My other gripes with racing is how you can only race vehicles of the same ""class"" and how some vehicles of a class are rediculously underpowered compared to others. For instance there are cool offorad races but if you dont choose a dirtbike no matter how fast and upgraded your offroad dunebuggy is you will lose to the stock dirtbike 100% of the time. If they just made racing normal more customizable as far as what vehicle you could or couldn't use and took the stupid rage enducing features out of the races they might actually be fun but they dont.The only truly non broken good feature of the game is heists which is probably what 50% of the people in the game are doing. But either get some good freinds or a few competent players otherwise theyll take forever. Theres one heist that can give you about $1mil per 1.5 hours (if you fly through it and the cuts are split evenly). Sadly theres only like 5 heists so they get old pretty quick.WELL THATS IT THATS ALL THE FEATURES OF THE GAME IN ONLINE YOU NEED A BILLION DOLLARS TO BUY ANYTHING AND THERES NO GOOD WAY OF MAKING MONEY EVEN IF YOURE A HIGH LEVEL PLAYER JUST CAVE IN AND BUY $500 WORTH OF IN GAME CURRENCY LIKE ROCKSTAR WANTS YOU TO DO MMMMKAY? I say either you become a hermit playing single player or just embrace the chaos of multiplayer with no aspirations of progressing in the game. This game could be better though and im very very very salty. Its gotten to the point where i want to hack the game just to combat all the hackers to make money in the game IT SHOULDNT BE LIKE THAT. Oh and I havent played recently but apparetly Rockstar messed up and their game is banning players who are following the rules. So there ya go they ban regular players but not actual hackers.

Controls are all good. I highly recommend this game. I got 61 hours play time out of it and I think I only did the online multiplayer for maybe 4 hours tops.

2015-04-13,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,"Some strapped on PC code to tote along a mixed style mess.First off you have to create a Social Account which means giving up your email address a potentially good password and some other information in order to play a the game in single player. After you create the account you have to go to rockstar's website and turn off a ton of email spam waiting to happen. Like I care whether some webstie tracks my single player stats. Save this garbage for IF I play the game long enough to go online.Just using the menu system is sluggish. The mouse moves really slow the menus draw like something out of DOS. ESC plops you on a social menu of some sort with a bunch of obscure keys that one does lead to a system menu. Since the game started in windowed mode for some random reason that was the first thing to change. I noted all the settings didn't indicate whether they were max or not at a glance. What game doesn't do this out of the box? You can do global ""max"" settings and then adjust as needed.Next you go through some pretty boring tutorial mission go here do this use your phone etc. For once I'll say STEAL SR3's control sceme fast efficient and doesn't involve wacking keys that in every other game actually do what one wants to do crouch isn't where crouch normally is prone isn't where prone normally is. If you don't do what the AI tells you it nags at you. Initally after a few nags the AI took over and did the task. So I did what anyone would do went over and surfed the web watched some video and hoped the tutorial would move itself along.After about 10 15 minutes I switched back over and the AI was still yelling at me to do something. So the first time was a freak incident. As there was no other options available I drugded along another lame tutorial. Which led me to the first beef I have super twitch wasd controls in vehicles. W and D are either not being pressed or turning the car 100% left or right. So one either wears out the keyboard trying to drive efficiently (think old school Galga) or smacking into everything. SR3 didn't have this issue.So you do the robery tutorial and think that is it for tutorials but noooo you get plopped into a car theft activity get in a car follow some AI through the streets that instantly loses you if you go through a shortcut and then get chased by the police in a confusing how do I escape the police activity.So the blue/red flashing dots are police but if I don't see any on the map how can they still be chasing me? How about since your wasting my time on something I could care less about while listening to some really crappy rap music there was no tutorial on how to change the game give a tutorial on what this whole cop chase thing is? So after some driving around smacking into cop cars that magically appear in front of me (Scotty stop beaming in cop cars 50' away from me ok?) I avoided them dropped off the car watch some bad acting and then have to get into a car and drive.At this point all I can think of is after 4 games why Rockstar hasn't figured out how to implement a custom main character just like SR3 has been doing since SR1? Why are you wasting my time in a character I can not invest in but dragging me through the chains of stagnation to do it? C'mon it's 2015 where is my custom character at?And I quit playing after realizing things wouldn't get much more interesting... waste o money.

2017-06-15,0,0,104,False,Not Recommended,*EDIT 30/07/18Glad to see Rockstar over turn the decision made by Take Two to ban single player modding. Its a step in a positive direction.However it is but a single act of good. GTAV is still left completely ignored in the wake of the cash cow that is GTAO. A cash cow that is becoming increasingly sour with unjustifiable ingame item costs to tempt players into purchasing microtransactions.GTAV is a good game. Its truly tragic that is has to be lumped together with GTAO a festering wart on the face of an otherwise decent experience. Had the games been seperated GTAV would be remembered as a true classic. Instead it will be remembered as fathering (among others) the 'games as service' model.If you've gone this long without buying it you can live without it. But if you must do not go online.OLD REVIEW Avoid at all costs. Same goes for all other Take Two Interactive products.They've made modding singleplayer illegal just to force people into the GTA Online mode which is complete garbage.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-10,0,0,28,False,Recommended,Pretty amazing really. The shear attention to detail is incredible. Call me weird but the only reason I purchased this game was because of the mods that the community have created especially LSPDFR. Unfortunately the game updates break most of the mods for a time until the mod authors can catch up. I understand the game developers can't base all of their decisions on whether or not it breaks a mod however it is a little frustrating to finally get everything working with mods only to have an update break everything. For me personally I've never really been into the thug life but have enjoyed the GTA games for many years and they just keep getting better and better. I can imagine how cool GTA 6 will be but I know it's gonna be something amazing.UPDATE I will not support a game that does not allow modding like LSPDFR. The recent decision to shut down OPEN IV is heavy handed and un necessary.UPDATE 2 Take Two has bowed to public pressure and recinded their ban. I once again can recommend.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have almost every little ""extra"" graphical feature enabled and it takes up about 3 and a half GBs of VRAM. (I have 4GB by the way.) I run the game on high to very high settings and I get an average of 55 60 fps.Storyline Hands down BEST storyline EVER! I may only have 23.2 hrs on record but I've beat the game 4 times on my PS3 and know the entire storyline by heart. My only problem is... (this is a spoiler by the way so be prepped.) When Wade finds Michael it's so fast. There should be a real mission toward it rather than Wade just out of the blue saying he found Michael De Santa. Even further when Trevor pops into Michael's house for the first time Michael doesn't even question it. Like... what the actual Rockstar? Is that how lazy you were when making this game?! Aside from that the storyline is really good. It would be cool if we could go visit Brad ocassionally but... y'know... things aren't always the way you want 'em to be.Audio Ehhhhh. Pretty okay. I guess it sounds nice and they have nice sound effects but I have Dolby 7.1 surround sound in my Corsair headset and Jesus Christ... it sounds like you're trapped in a box. This may just be a problem with Dolby branded surround sound but it's so bad that I had to disable surround sound just to make it sound okay. Even then I didn't get that nice feeling of being in the middle of LS. So I've been using my speakers instead.Online One word GARBAGE. The community is SO toxic. You can't even drive around to check out the view without someone blowing your damn car up! Oh yeah. There goes 100k right down the drain! Haha! Another bad thing You get banned for NO reason. It hasn't happened to me but I've heard MANY stories and I've seen it happen first hand. My friend Joseph was driving through Vinewood Hills and jumped out of his car right? Get this... he glitched a little bit into the map and BAM! There he goes! Banned!Overall Not worth $60. However if you enjoy incredible graphics consistent framerates and amazing storylines then I'd say wait until it's on sale. I bought it during the Steam Summer Sale for only $20. Now THAT is worth it. The most I'd pay is $40 for this game. Do NOT pay full price because it's often on sale.",Grand Theft Auto V

Game Development Frequent updates a lot of content released FOR FREE the downside is that new content is for multiplayer only unless using mod in SP to unlock it. Single Player Score 9/10 Perfect game too bad R* forgot about singleplayer otherwise would be a 10. Multiplayer Score 8.5/10 Multiplayer lacks some optimization demanding more resources from computer causing some low fps sometimes has a BIG variety of jobs to do.

Most of the time you are just stuck in loading screens and often after playing a minigame inside the multiplayer you end up in a different lobby than your friends in the regular multiplayer even though you joined the minigame together from the same lobby. To join your friend you must sit through another loading screen only to fail many of the times.GTA V should have been what San Andreas couldn't because of the technical limitations of it's time yet GTA V is a step back. Surprisingly the possibilities are limited in GTA V compared to San Andreas even though it should have been the other way round.With the singler player you get the familiar GTA gameplay and story type but in reality most of the reason that there are many hours of gameplay in single player is because you spent a lot of time driving rambling NPCs around.Rockstar really hyped the multiplayer gameplay but its a massive letdown. Only very limited gameplay options and a very limited selection of vehicles. The biggest problem is that you are painfully aware of the potential possibilities for fun but Rockstar has chosen to implement so many abitrary limitations.Also why the hell does Rockstar hate mods so much?,Grand Theft Auto V

The campaign was fun but I'd be lying if I said there was more than 40 hours of single player activities. Unless you like those busywork collect em all mindless frustrating tasks they seem to fill games with to get an inflated playtime stat. I honestly prefer Watch_Dogs and this game is better in every way. I hated the helicopter missions the yoga mission the mission after the yoga mission and the far too sparse checkpoints. You or one of the other two characters died or you ""spooked"" somebody? Have fun starting over probably from the beginning. Then the crashes. First any menu I went in was choppy as then the game started crashing constantly for seemingly no reason. This game has crashed on me more times than there are missions in the main story. However this might not happen to you.Tl dr not worth $60 especially if you are going to play by yourself. Prepare for dissapointment.Edit after a second playthrough I can re attest to all of the points above except for the crashes. And I prefer the 'parkour' and cover systems in watch dogs way better but the driving is second to none.Edit 2 Apparently you can nullify the menu stuttering by locking the game to 60fps using an external program (Nvidia Inspector in my case) this shouldn't be necessary in a AAA title over 4 years old",Grand Theft Auto V

There is so much to this game I'll only cover a few pointsIt has first person mode you can play it the whole game. There is GTA ONLINE which is basically an MMO GTA style.The open world map is huge!You play as three different characters throughout the whole game there are only a few times when you have to play as a certain character but most of the time you can choose which one you want to play. Each character has different missions which progress the game so you can play one mission while the other missions get passed up giving this game great replay value when you play again as a different character and have different missions and perspective of the story.There is 3 different endings which you choose at the end. Once again giving it great replay value.The main story is only about 60% of the total game. Everything else is side missions and such.The gameplay mechanics and graphics are superb.This game introduces a new kind of mission to the GTA series called heists you and a crew you choose do heists to gain large amounts of cash. This is a 3 or 4 part mission. Ultimatley you choose how to do the heist which changes the mission once again adding more replay value to the game. The citizens of Los Santos are randomly generated and walk around or drive like a normal city would. You will witness car chases accidents and people committing crimes. The police are more realistic they will attempt to stop you if you are caught speeding they will respond to citizens calling them when they witness you doing something illegal. They are also more challenging to shake off compared to other GTA games. Other drivers in the game will respond if you are an . If you stop behind someone and harrass them by honking if you crash into them or flip them off there is a chance they will become hostile.

So for GTA V story mode 10/10.GTA Online however is pathetic yes there's fun things to do but everything is seriously over priced and im someone who actually enjoys the grind you can see my total hours of gameplay but its ridiculous when a plain black shirt costs 50k and when every DLC comes out you need to buy more properties like warehouses and bunkers just to purchase the new vehicles and weapons. You're spending 6 million jusy in setup costs let alone the 100 hours it takes to grind for it and then to grind for the new stuff. But ok the DLCs are free so its not ny biggest issue. MODDERS! modders everywhere every session modders going round killing poeple in Godmode taking all your weapons your money its absolutely out of control and has been since day 1 but of course R* does nothing about it if you wanna play online be prepared it is 30% cheaters who are on purely to troll and ruin it for others.,Grand Theft Auto V

However the online is complete cancer and is impossible to buy anything over 3 million without blowing your brains out from reptetive missions from ALL the different characters (love the way the put single player characters in it though). In order to become rich in online you are pretty muched forced to dump your hard earned cash into buying shark cards. The signle player alone is a solid 9/10 wouldve been a 10 if it was longer like GTA 4's. However the online is 4/10.

2016-07-26,0,0,252,False,Not Recommended,"Initially i recommended this game but now i don't. The only fun to be had in this game now lies in its singleplayer as it is effectively the only safe place where you can expierience everything the game has to offer without the new trash and community. please dont buy this game for multiplayer it is not a fun expierience.Singleplayer Works fluidly within its world. The missions are interesting. Its a sandbox so you can do quite alot even once the game is finished. Includes some memorable moments and has great replay value thanks to its design. Small easter eggs and other interesting things are scattered around the place and reward you with cool things. The mod community keeps getting better and make this game look like it was released this year with these mods you wont be able to access online but imo thats a great tradeoff no paywalls no griefers just whatever you want to add to your game.Shame we never got that single player expansion hey R*. They have stopped adding the GTA O vehicles to singleplayer with the newest updates so all the cool cars and so on are not available here just keep that in mind. The trailers are deceptive like that. Mods might be able to help remove this change however.Multiplayer This is 5's worst aspect. The game revolves around the same premise as single player. A large open map in which missions and activities take place. Sounds great but on paper it doesnt work. Atleast not anymore. The free roam update after update is becoming a battle royale where everybody loses. Grinding previously was done in heists and missions so you could afford that sweet $1m car (Keep this price in mind). With the newest additions to freemode Rockstar have been merging the missions you grind and the freeroam in one. For players actually trying to play the game and work towards that juicy $5 10mil (Yes it can cost over 10 million for a single vehicle) flying motorcycle or $10m plane good luck. The community here will not help. These missions are encouraged to be griefed by the developers. What do i mean? If you start a mission and need to kill 3 NCPs rockstar will tell ALL 20+ other players to protect these NCP's to earn $ AND RP. The method by which they do so is up to them however whichever way they choose will almost always result in your death. Pick your poison. This means freeroam lobbies turn into witchhunts for whoever tries to deliver a parcel to X to a destination. The sandbox element doesnt help ironically. With each update they add more ways to kill you and less ways for you to defend yourself once you start trying to sell business's product you will understand what side the sandbox truly favours (and guess what it doesnt favour you earning $$$). With every update comes something more rediculous they can kill you with. Initially it was an armoured (fully bulletproof) car that caused a stir then it was a jet that had explosive cannons and now after a few updates there is Flying Cars with Homing missles and machine guns Flying motorcycles and now standard cars with missles and VTO capabilities that will make the jets jealous. To keepup with the ingame $inflation you will need to use businesses if not then prepare to invest 500 days grinding contact missions. This choice of forcing you to use businesses was done intentionally to force players into freeroam lobbies (the only difference here is it isnt just ai's trying to destroy your hard work). The nice people are what make this game tolerable but like i said with 20+ people in a single lobby it still wont matter. Inflation in both prices and toxicity are on the rise and depending on the next update it is likely to increase further. So what does this boil down to? If you are a newer player or even a solo player this game IS NOT for you. All the ""fun"" activites will need multiple people heists using the sandbox to its fullest and actually trying to earn your way to what you want will require people. The game will not let you do it alone even the things that you can do alone the game will actively seek to get you killed by every single player in that lobby. If your new prepare to get destroyed by everyone and everything. If you are a veteran well you already know the deal. Its either kill or be killed and survival of the fittest (which almost directly depends on who is richer. level and hours mean nothing here. Its whoever owns the newest vehicles.) This game does nothing to reward players that invest time into aiming perfecting your jet skills or even just helping a friend. You will recieve recieve virtually no benefit. As R* themselves put it Cash is king in this town. Solve your money problem and help get what you want across Los Santos and Blaine County with the occasional purchase of cash packs for Grand Theft Auto Online. Either you will be blownup by a bombing run cheesed by an invisible (off the radar) motorbike or someone will sell their soul to R* for 500 750mil just to have you killed by something you cannot avoid the beloved orbital cannon. Final Note I have been playing this game for a very long time before all this crazy stuff started getting added. Unless you wish to play in Public Lobby's by yourself. i highly recommend you to not buy the game. The price may be cheap they may offer a specific bundle which seems like a good deal but it isnt. The business's are grind fests and guarantee you nothing but hardwork (countless hours depending on your circumstances) and it can be destroyed in seconds. Rockstar are not generous they are not giving you a good deal. You can lookup why... theres too much to add. All in all the community that has been SHAPED by the devs is whats slowly killing this game thats the saddest part and its only just getting started.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-16,0,0,158,False,Recommended,This game might be fun sure. I'd recommend purchasing it. The story is probably worth the 30 dollars. But be aware as soon as you want to download mods this game goes from fun to ing hectic and annoying. There is no actual easy way to download mods you have to download .zip files and copy paste into the game folder. You can choose between playing online and having no mods or playing singleplayer and having mods. That's it. What I'd give to get back the hours I've slaved away trying to get GTA V running smoothly again most of them waiting for the damn game to re install. And I don't even have that many mods I have three. If you make one wrong move the mods up and break the game until you delete them or delete and re install GTA V. Rockstar sucks at making GTA V compatible with mods. And that's the long and short of it.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have been waiting for over 10 minutes for the story line to start (still waiting) just to see if those horrible graphics glitches (clipping) have been solved. Admittedly I do not have a state of the art system anymore but still one that is well within the boundaries of the demanded specs. I know the game can run fluently on my system with pretty high settings I experienced it in one session. The rest is just one awful experience. I am going to wait two more weeks for patches to fix these problems. If not I will demand my money back.,Grand Theft Auto V

Customize your vehicle and personal appearance. This game is longer than Fallout 3 and filled with adrenaline pumping missions that will leave you craving for more by the end of the game. Even after the story mode ends you can still finish all side quests and other missions. The story mode does end but the single player campaign will last you for as long as you want after the story mode completes. It's not particularly one of the best games I've ever played but it definitely gives you the value of your purchase in hours played from the $60 debut price tag. Worth $60? Yes. It's only 1 of two games that I think have ever actually been worth that price. The other being Fallout 3 w/all DLC's.,Grand Theft Auto V

I want it to be a good game so bad but there are so many problems 1. I HAVE TO run the game under my Administrator account as Administrator. It won't work on my domain profile which is REALLY irritating. 2. The game takes FOREVER to load. I actually wrote this entire review (the whole thing) while waiting for story mode to load (update at end of review it's still loading). It doesn't matter if it's multiplayer online or story but I get MINUTES of waittime to do anything load a local story mission load in game switch online sessions etc. I have a RAID 10 of SSDs and am ALWAYS the first to load in maps in CS GO so the slow load is something very unfamiliar to me.3. I'm stuck in story mode. To not give away anything there's a mission where you have to dive off a pier and swim. Well it doesn't tell you how to swim. Or swim up. So I drown. Over. And over. And over. I still don't know how to swim up. It doesn't say in the controls and google only comes up with console answers. 4. The menus are confusing. There's like a billion. And you HAVE TO use R*'s social serice you can't use Steam friends. 5. It likes to randomly dump you from online to story after a mission involving 10+ minutes of loading. There is so much more but just writing this is making me angry. I'm going to go pour a scotch and keep on waiting for my session to load......,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-18,0,0,128,False,Not Recommended,"GRAND THEFT AUTO V ONLINE is an excellent game when it works unfortunately it has several serious flaws (hence no recommendation from me).I bought this for its ONLINE content exclusively I did not care for the single player campaign and spent only the time necessary to unlock the online content playing sp (the tutorial) so this review is strictly a review for GTA ONLINE not the single player version and not the game in whole.First off GTA ONLINE's co op is fun probably the most I've ever had in any multiplayer co op game. The game world is huge and immersive and the possiblities simply amazing.Unfortunately there are some serious flaws that seriously screw up the gameplay experience 1. Connectivity issues (and no it's not my internet ALL other internet games work perfectly). Network connection is frequently lost and you are tossed into single player mode and have to load Online mode again (takes several minutes). This often happens when loading co op missions and you basically let the other players down. Also nice when you finished a job and it happens right before payout time. Thanks for nothing.2. Modders. GTAonline has a big modder community and the regulation of cheaters is practically non existent. Other players that are over powered and can play in ""God Mode"" can easily target new and weak players. Rockstar games also made it easy on themselves reporting cheaters comes with a dire warning report at your own risk wrongly report players might result in termination of your account. Well how about you guys DO YOUR JOB ROCKSTAR GAMES????3. Kicking out players from sessions. So I got target by a group of 3 bullies. I retaliated which made them angry so bully 1 decides to use the ""kick player"" option on me. Bully 2 + 3 do the same and you're gone. ""The other players kicked you from this session"". But good luck trying to kick a modder from a session. Very unbalanced here.There are also micro transactions in GTAo but I will not criticize these because they are optional and not required to progress. The only problem is that progress is slow. WARNING! Money is hard to come by on your own CO OP IS MANDATORY IF YOU WISH TO PLAY GTA ONLINE PROPERLY. DO NOT BUY GTA V ONLINE SIMPLY FOR SINGLE PLAYER ONLINE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO KEEP POURING MONEY INTO MICRO TRANSACTIONS!With this said I personally LOVE GTA ONLINE but point 1 3 can be truly frustrating.",Grand Theft Auto V

It's full of action and there are a lot of stuff to explore.I played GTA V first on last gen so it has been quite a while ago. Back then when it came out on PC in 2015 I bought the RSGC version first and played like 600 800 hrs on that. I'm not sure when I bought it on steam but it has been at least 1.5 or two years ago. This is the only game I didn't regret buying multiple times.However that doesn't mean it's flawless. My biggest problem with it is that Story Mode has been abandoned by Rockstar. They stopped adding DLCs to story mode after Ill Gotten Gains Part 2 which came out 3 years ago. That's my only complaint about story mode.If somebody wants this game for the Story Mode then I recommend it because this is one of my favorite games of all time. I will always like it regardless it's flaws.So to sum it up Exciting story and lots of action Lot's of stuff to explore Multiple protagonists Very much optimizedOnline Nowadays I only play Online. I have at least 1.2k hours in Online. I'm level 289 and I have to say the more I play Online the more I get annoyed and disappointed by it.Firstly Free Mode is a warzone...You come out of your office or your apartment with a sportscar or a supercar I can almost guarantee there will be somebody who is bored and blow you up just for fun. There are a lot of people who are just going around in free mode with Oppressor Deluxo Stromberg Khanjali Hydra etc. In my experience 7 out of 10 sessions are like that. So in order to survive or have a chance you need weaponized vehicles (which some of them are pretty pricey). Which leads me to my next point...Prices and Payouts Many people say that a lot of things are overpriced and the business and mission payouts aren't enough. I can somewhat agree on this. But what I can't stand is that there are vehicles which are expensive for no reason. Their prices just don't match their performance and ability. And you might buy a useless vehicle because you were unable to test it and to top that of there's no money back.Going over to businesses Biker Businesses are complete garbage except coke. The amount of time you spend resupplying (or the amount of money you spend on supplies) the amount of money you spend on upgrading them and the fees... It's just not worth it. I have almost all biker businesses (except document forgery) and I shut most of them down because it was a waste of money and time. Not to mention you can get raided even if you have purchased the security upgrade. Worst of all is that there are multiple delivery vehicles even on small stock so you need other people to sell. But even then it's annoying because most of the delivery vehicles are slow and vulnerable to other players. It's just a waste of time and it's so annyoing.Good businesses are Import/Export Bunker Nightclub.If you solo then Import/Export is the best one the only problem is that there's a 20 minute cooldown between selling cars.Bunker is pretty good too if upgrades are purchased. The payout is decent and it doesn't require a whole lot of work.The nightclub is pretty pricey considering all the upgrades and delivery vehicles are expensive. It takes a bit of time to break even but after that it's a really good business. I just mentioned nightclubs and another good point came to my mind...Paywalls There are a lot of paywalls in this game. The absolute worst one I've seen is the Oppressor MKII. In order to get one at the trade price all 6 client jobs have to be completed at least once from the Terrorbyte computer. The Terrorbyte is also needed for upgrading the Oppressor MKII. But in order to buy a Terrorbyte you need a Nightclub. So really it's unavoidable if you want an MKII like I did. This can add up too some serious money.Another example of paywalls is when I bought the Akula. Which was quite a while ago. I didn't have a hangar at that time and wanted that helicopter so badly. I had to buy a Facility and complete Doomsday Heist Act I to unlock the trade price for it otherwise I would've wasted around 1 Million on nothing. But it turns out I also had to buy a Hangar in order to store it. It cannot be stored in the facility. But this is not everything... I had to buy the Aircraft Workshop for the Hangar in order to upgrade the Akula. I spent a lot of money at that time to get that helicopter. But I could go on and on with these for hours.Shark Cards When I was just starting out I bought a few shark cards and bought properties and an office to speed things up. Back then it was worth it more than now. It wasn't a good deal even back then but Shark Cards are just aren't worth the money now. They are overpriced and almost useless. A 8 Million dollar Shark Card can't even buy a fully upgraded nightclub. You buy 2 supercars and maybe one weaponized vehicle for that money. And it's over. The 8 Million dollar Shark Card should be 80 Million dollars for the same price.Don't even get me started on the Criminal Enterprise starterpack. That thing is useless. It gives the worst things in the game. It's even worse than buying a Shark Card.Cheaters Hackers Modders This one is probably the most annoying one. I couldn't even count how many times I was blown up by cheaters or caged by them. Sometimes they kick people from the session or freeze them. They spawn money on you whether you like it or not. They orbital cannon people. They teleport to people to kill them with god mode etc.Not every one of them are like that though. There are some cheaters who are friendly and don't interfere with other players expereince. But this is very rare.Loading Times Lag Bugs Glitches Loading into the game is at least 5 minutes for me. Sometimes loading into interiors takes 5 10 minutes. Many times when I'm switching sessions I get stuck in the clouds. Sometimes I just restart the game because even that's quicker than waiting for nothing.There are many times when I or my friends get disconnected from the session. Sometimes I can't even join them and get a Timed Out Loading Session error message.Online runs considerably worse than Story Mode. Much more. Sometimes it even lags. It's just plain annoying. You drive around smooth 60 fps and then it starts dropping for a few seconds and then it smooth again. It's unplayable like that. Sometimes this happen frequently sometimes it doesn't.There are a ton of bugs and glitches in online. One time all my cars disappeared from the garage and I had to restart the game. Many times I was delivering vehicle cargo and when I was done with it and wanted to sell the car it didn't show up on the warehouse computer so I had to get another one. A lot of times the camera stucks on the entering animation when I enter the office. It happened multiple times.So for me going Online is many times a frustrating experience rather than an enjoyable one. It's just unplayable sometimes.I'm in a Love/Hate relationship with Online. I love it for what it was when it came out and I love it because it's GTA but I hate it for what it became and how frustrating it is sometimes.When I don't experience the negative things I just mentioned above then it's a very pleasant and fun experince but when all these issues come up I just rather close the game rather than get frustrated over it. The very reason I wrote this review is because today the game made me really mad. I guess I just had an unlucky day. xD If anybody can get over the things I just mentioned then I do recommend Online too but otherwise I do not!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-06,0,0,997,False,Not Recommended,I've put like 800 hours into this thing. It's a fun game. I can kind of forgive the setup of the online mode it's skewed towards trying to get you to pay real money to get in game cash but once you get far enough in the grind isn't too bad. What I can't forgive however is Take Two being so paranoid that single player mods are going to make them lose 0.50% of their profits from microtransactions. I'll keep playing and enjoying this game but I'm not giving this company any more money. Sorry Rockstar but your choice in business parters is pretty lousy.(OLD REVIEW)Experience all the fun of being hunted down by overly agressive L.A. cops from the safety of your own home!

2017-06-15,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,I supported this game by buying it 3 times. GTA has been a staple in my life as a game for years and years. GTA Online unfortunately is not what I hoped for and the experience has gotten worse and worse. Modded content allows players to build an environment that they want and showcase their skills. A community developed where members shared and showcased hard work for everyone to enjoy. This doesn't impact anyone elses player experience and that is why I am let down with Take Two and as a result Rockstar. Whether I want to enjoy some singleplayer content or hop onto a FiveM private server there is no impact on anyone elses experience who purchased the game. I don't like playing online anymore but I still love playing GTA V with the custom vehicles and textures and missions like LSPDFR etc. Recently Take two decided that we shouldn't have these experiences. We must play online because a % of players will purchase their shark cards. They block everything out to make themselves the only option and thus open the door for taking MORE money from the community. It feels greedy after so many people have supported this game for so long and even purchased it multiple times. The game has been out for a while and to still try and milk money from us paints a really bad picture. I am let down and won't be purchasing future Rockstar or Take Two content until there is a resolution. Take some notes from Arma 3 and other games that embrace community creation and modded content!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-21,0,0,292,False,Recommended,"Pros Online This online portion of this game is more addictive than Meth. The game is large so you'll need a good pc to run it. If it's good enough to crank everything to the max setting the graphics make you forget what reality is. So much time and effort has been put into this game. Single player campaign Great storyline. This game lets you play from multiple peoples' perspectives. Each leades in with one another creating an intricate story for those who love a good plot. Cons Hackers/modders Yes...there are too many modders. I feel that Rockstar needs to implement some form of anti chest like ""Easy anti cheat"" or ""Battle Eye."" They don't seem to take any action and its too easy to get access to exploits. FOLLOWING UP ON THAT The modders don't really ruin any of the gameplay. Most of them just give you money. However to be honest there aren't really a lot of active modders anymore. They've mostly moved on. Resource Demanding Gta is a very resource Demanding game meaning you'll need a good pc to run it. The minimum I'd recommend is an i5 and gtx 1050ti. Final thoughts Unlike most super awesome games...gta is now only $30. This is 100% totally worth your money and you'll get hooked on it.

2018-09-24,0,0,244,False,Not Recommended,Modders (often called hackers) have always bugged me and usually I just find a new session the moment I realise I'm sharing one with them but oh no... not today.Today upon discovering someone was invulnerable to damage for the billionth time they decided to lock up my movement disable my UI and then boot me back to singleplayer.The modders have more control over my gameplay than RockstarSome of them can be nice (or at least not bad) though. One time this guy just broke the monotony in the weather and then flew around in a giant ocean liner which didn't really bother anyone and actually got a few cheers... until some people started begging for them to drop money (and often threatening to report if they DIDN'T drop money)The modders hold more respect and authority among the other people in my session than RockstarNot all modders just mod from in game. Some of them make lovely community projects like the framework to host your own dedicated servers in which you can set your own custom rules and structures completely independent of the main cluster so you can't transfer anything either way. A great escape from the tedium that players in the early to mid progression face while constantly harrassed by people who can just keep pulling Oppressor MKIIs out trapping us in an endless grind.But then Rockstar decided to make those modders cease and desist because adding the option to not trudge through cancer every time you open this game would be circumventing the coding or promoting piracy or some other that most people don't agree with.The modders care more about the community's experience than Rockstar.I'm going to keep playing this simply because of the effort I've already put in to growing a business and the prospect that maybe I can find a heist lobby without a player who quits halfway through. But I could never wholeheartedly recommend anyone wastes their money on it after me.What I would recommend is that you find out how to suspend GTA for 10 seconds using resource monitor because that's the only feasible away to stop disrespectful s on flying motorbikes from killing multiple days' work with 1 tap. Nice way to promote player interaction you goddamn geniuses at Rockstar! I hope you're happy with what I paid for GTAV because you'll never take another penny from me.TL DR The community is largely a cesspool of griefing and modding and the developers/publishers could not give less of a about it as long as they make money.,Grand Theft Auto V

T2's cease and desist is cruel unfair and an abuse of power even if they have taken back their decision they should have done more research on the issue before making such a drastic decision. Shame on you Take Two.Edit In light of the lawsuit against the developers of GTA Online cheats it is now my opinion that Rockstar and T2 are taking advantage of the legal system. This lawsuit is not only a step in the wrong direction it is encouraging other developers to do the same. If their main goal was to stop cheating in the game they would work on improving their anti cheat system instead of prosecuting one of hundreds of cheat developers. Now talented reverse engineers and developers will be put behind bars because Rockstar wants to exploit their players with microtransactions more than they want to make something worth selling.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-01,0,0,124,False,Recommended,"I had heard rumors. Rumors of the most difficult game ever for anyone who started playing after shark cards were introduced into the game. A game that quickly declined as soon as a contributing company started adding DLCs into the game. A game that will make you feel like you are clocking into a 9 5 job every time you boot it up. This game is GTA V Online. Gone are the days were one can RELAX and play this game. As someone new to the game in 2018 GTA Online feels like a slap in the face to the the original GTA all the way up to GTA 4. And I know why GTA Online is so unbelievably soul crushingly anxiety inducing. It's because Rockstar/Take Two are Micheal Franklin and Trevor. When Trevor killed Johnny (From GTA TLATD) it was Rockstar/Take Two slapping us in the face and saying ""We've got you by your unmentionables and you ARE going to buy our products."" And we the players of GTA Online are peasants. We have to dedicate as much time as a World Of Warcraft player has to and we gain way less reward. (And I have a lvl 100 Human Paladin. For The Alliance!) This game is a slap in the face to die hard GTA fans... But there are some things very good about this game. The scenery is beautiful graphics as well. The universe of GTA is better able to be explored in this game. The customization is amazing and very pleasing. And if you can ignore the tryhards kids who stole their parent's credit cards to get everything they want/ or the spoiled brats and the butt hole modders that kill you for no reason then I tip my hat to you.

2018-11-13,0,0,239,False,Not Recommended,This game is generally fun and well done to a point. The singleplayer and online have a heist mission set which honestly kind of makes this game for me. In it's own way it gives it an identity that sets it apart from it's predecessors. Unfortunately there are many issues with the game that will unfortunately not allow me to recommend it. The fact that the Xbox version had a way for you to buy Shark Cards regardless of the payment restrictions you had in place set the tone for what I am about to say. They are money hungry a lot of the game's content is locked behind in game currency that reaches exhorbant amounts. This will usually have most people do one of two things A) buy their shark cards or B) mod the game. If they choose option B then they potentially might get banned and have to buy their game again. Because the latter is actually a small risk compared to the reward a lot of people hack extensively so. In fact every crew has that one modder friend that can boot you from the game because of how little attention Rockstar pays attention to their cash cow. The only things they add are things for you to buy and to be honest while you can do certain lucrative missions it is not fun to do 3 million times so you can get that one airplane you wanted. Since I have lowered my expectations of the game and focused only on hesiting with friends it is pretty enjoyable past that... I have no real interest in the online game.Graphics Pretty Excellent especially in comparison to its predecessor.Story Easy to follow funny and a generally a pleasure to go through.Replayability low the online gets repetative fastSound effects Great everything gives you a sense of immersion up to the small details of the radio.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-27,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,Did I just grow up or is it really worse then all the GTAs we had before?From the technological point of view it's amazing. When I first launched it I could just walk around the city with first point of view looking at surroundings very detailed world high resolution textures and so on.Then I started playing the story mode. The multi character missions are really an interesting addition to the gameplay. But the characters are terribly boring and with three of them I couldn't feel attached to the story of any of them so In the end I didn't really care at all. GTA VC GTA SA and GTA IV stories seemed much more interesting to me.The radio stations didn't impress me as well. Like they underpayed the designers or something like that.You can easily see that the company made a huge accent on the online part of the game. They show off the extra nonsense vehicles everywhere and suggest that you buy virtual money packs all the time. The online part also has a lot of nice missions but it seems to me that some of them could be in the singleplayer part instead. The session making in the online mode is just terrible you can't chose the session you will join and end up with endless loading screens all the time. Sometimes it likes to crash as well. Not to say that before I even could play online I had to create a ticket at R* because the game froze during the character creation broke character data and couldn't just erase the character without help from R*.So very mixed feelings. It's a great game on it's own but I expected more from it.,Grand Theft Auto V

I mean the AI spawns so hard i had instances of people dcing cause their potato of a computer can't handle the torm that was unsuing. Personally for me the difficulty is alright but im pretty sure the average player can't complete the heist without one of their friends being having a minigun. How r the casual player suppose to enjoy the heist. The money to effort ratio is not worth it.(heist prep setup all take atleast 2hrs to complete)(the most time consumming is the setup whr u drive the anti air truck like half thru blaine county). Grinding the 1hr 650k money trick or the endless bodgan prob glitch is way easier to earn money than going thru this down sydrome of a heist.so basically wud u shuld take away frm this is don't do DDay Heist Act III if u r either 2 low level or tryna grind money. Go on utube and search for some good money make tricks or bugs or just mod the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-27,0,0,256,False,Not Recommended,I'm doing another take on my old review here goes GTA V is really an amazing open world game with a stunning online mode and truely great DLCs BUT Take Two interractive (Rockstar's owner) does not care about the consumers anymore only about the money. Everything the devs put their heart into is hugely expensive and is virtualy impossible to obtain without spending large amounts of real money (shark cards).As a result people mod give themselves millions of GTA Dollars and go around killing people who are just trying to enjoy the game and that's not even the worst part they don't get banned you do In my case I got banned for... well I litteraly don't know they didn't even give me a reason I didn't mod recieve money from modders or grief ever on my 1000 hours on PS4 and 200 hours on PC. They gave me a 1 month ban and a character reset completely deleting my previously mentioned 143 lvl progress houses cars bunkers garages EVERYTHING! When my 1 month ban had finnished I got back in and played for 5 minutes only to recieve a permanent ban...You can't even use a friends account that was generously given to you because your Scoial Club (GTA online) account is permanently linked to your steam accout.In conclusion Story Mode is like a dog nice and funny does what you tell it to do and just keeps on suprising you with new features and mods. Online is more like a very wild yet cute cat you're very excited to play with it at first but then it starts feeling like a job you don't even get paid to do. The grinding beacomes bananas. And then it just comes in for the kill when you least expect it and now you can't play anymore because you got banned BOI. I do recommend GTA V since it's a truely great game but ONLY BUY IT FOR THE STORY MODE AND THE SINGLEPLAYER MODS they are great.Hope I could help you out! Have a great day.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-08,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Simply put definitely a fun game but has a number of flaws.This game can be extremely addicting and enjoyable with a group of friends. With that you can queue up and have a blast doing heists and earn a ton of money along with it. That said for those of you who play this game solo will have a rough time. Solo heists are not even worth it due to the long queue time. Even once you get a heist going you and your team will most likely die at some point resetting you to a checkpoint every few minutes. This makes this experience frustrating and not rewarding at all. Other options of earning money is tedious and not entertaining. Overall play with friends for a good time otherwise expect a tedious grind. 6/10 game I'd say,Grand Theft Auto V

Just a little bit of problem with the modders but everything else is not so bad. The heists were fun to do with other players. The random events on Free Mode was also fun. Becoming a CEO and inviting other players to become associates was a great way to earn in game money and Exp. The online missions did not feel like a chore at all. Each were very interesting to do and have their own way to complete.Some stuff that I want to see Online. I doubt that Rockstar would add any of these but'll be interesting if they would Fight Club Mano y mano with other players under a specific special 24/7 convenience store.RC Races Race throughout the city with little RC cars.Hitman Missions Improved stealth mechanics for assassination missions for players who love co op with stealth.Pool/Billiards Tennis?

Pay to win/money grinding.2. The amount of hackers jesus.. ""JUST PLAY WITH FRIENDS OR SOLO"" and defeat the purpose of the game being played with other people I don't know maybe make a friend? lol3. The weapons and weaponized vehicles added during the Gunrunning update and later ruined the game. ""MAYBE YOU'RE JUST BAD!"" What a classy come back.4. When I started playing back in 2015 it was easy to fill a lobby with players to race against. These days you can only expect a full lobby from double money events or a fan base following. This could be a combination of player base being smaller and/or the number of game modes added is too high to get a decent size lobby going.5. Explosive rounds and super accurate missiles.

From the complete aww of the game when I first got it to the frustration that came from being banned for no apparent reason to the grinding for hours on end to get back to where I was but let's put all of that behind and see the game for what it truly is. I mean come on what other 5 year old full price game has nearly the same active player base as GTA 5?For me the massive open world of GTA really is astonishing in fact I'm still finding hidden areas around the map over a year after I first bought it. The world is really loaded with a crap ton of detail which most people wouldn't even notice like the amazing texture work the bumpy potholes the non copy and pasted roads. Rockstar truly are the masters of the open world genre at this point and I would expect nothing less from RDR2. In terms of visuals this 5 year old title holds up surprisingly well. The graphics still look sharp as ever and with draw distance that is still very impressive to this day. In terms of audio the game sounds nice in general. The cars sound as you would expect the music is pretty good and the ambient noises (ex. traffic in the background) is all pretty well done.Content is often times a weak point of many modern games only lasting so long until you have done everything you can and want to do. With GTA 5 on the other hand there are plenty of things to do ranging from sports to going on rampages. That's not even touching on the Online mode. GTA Online is in my opinion one of the best games in existence. There are endless contact missions adversary modes heists free mode sports and other stuff to do. In GTA Online it nearly never bored me never really having a dull moment. Plus it can be whatever you want it to be. If you want to play tennis with friends its got that. Golf? Got that too. Racing? Shooting? Heisting? Running a drug business? You name the criminal activity chances are GTA Online has got it.Of course with every good thing there's always the negatives with it. First and foremost the Online mode of GTA 5 is quite a big never ending grind to gain all the money you need to buy the stuff you want. The items are very much overpriced with an average car setting you back 1 million bucks. Also the Online mode is plagued with modders as well as a the trigger happy ban bot. There is also a ""problem"" where there is so much content in the game that not many people are playing it (which is not something you get to say often). But really with over 100 million copies of this game sold there's only so much Rockstar can do.The verdict is that this is a spectacular game that I recommend everyone try out plus the steam price is now only 30 bucks.

2018-02-24,0,0,491,False,Not Recommended,Single PlayerSo in GTA 5 you're going to experience a well written well acted and quite funny story filled with mayhem and colourful characters. This is a great thing too many games focus on their multiplayer first then stick a lackluster storyline in to make it worth the price tag which it often is not.Pros Lively world feels both lived in and realisticGood main cast of actorsFun Story MissionsColourful side characters and villainsGood humour...mostly...Driving is greatRadiant eventsCan 'hang out' with friends/family which is nice for some dialogue and character buildingOne or two returning characters from previous titlesCons Gunplay and general combat is not amazing but its fineI prefer the GTA 4 pedestriansStupid 'flip the car upright' mechanic that breaks realismNo real reason to keep playing single player when you're done almost like it forces you into GTA Online which may not be a good thing to some...Overall rating 8/10Closing Verdict GTA 5 is a fun experience but it does hold your hand a little more than previous titles though you'll most likely not care when you get into the story which is well told by a terrific voice cast. Steven Ogg is now one of my favourite actors (he plays Trevor) and he's making a name for himself too what with him being in The Walking Dead as a prominent and charismatic villain.GTA Online (Multiplayer)Lets be clear I've sunk a lot of hours into this and my final opinion is that it's quite...toxic...so much trolling hacking/modding (calling them hackers implies intellegence they are not Intellegent) griefing and general bad people that I wonder why I keep coming back too this money grind that is becoming less worth it by the day. Playing this with friends and just goofing around is all well and good but I WANT to make money to expand my businesses and such but other players make it hard or very trying and when a modder gets involved it can become impossible.Here's an example of just how bad this community can be. During a team PvP match a friend and I were greeted with 'We have a hacker in our team D'. Any decent player would report the modder but nah these guys seemed to be on an easy winning streak and were all to happy to let this aim botter get them easy rep and cash.Now not all bad things are the result of modders. Some players just have nothing left to do and lots of cash to spend be it from the grind or just using a Shark Card. During a friends mission to sell some cargo for a hefty sum we were on the last checkpoint in a Bunker mission to hold off a wave of Merryweather troops when all of a sudden some high level hits us with an orbital cannon. Why? Using it cost more than what he would have got from ruining the shipment. It was dome because he could plain and simple which is just another example of this bad community.And then there's the constant stream of phone calls. Call me paranoid but it feels like Rockstar are trying to annoy me into buying Shark Cards so I can buy what the callers are hyping just so I can shut them up. There is absolutely no need for these calls I do not need reminding for the 100th time that there's Facility's Bunkers or other such crap in the game. One phone call would suffice but no Rockstar have abused this idea.I strongly feel that Rockstar should never have implemented Shark Cards however as it's made the experience very imbalanced and the high prices of goods gives you two legal options to make money and one that will get you in trouble.Option A Buy a Shark CardOption B Grind for days for a single 3mil bikeOption C Begging a modder to drop money which will GET YOU BANNED but the idea that people are actively doing this should tell rockstar that the grind is broken.Occasionally Rockstar will do something grand to combat modding but they're still everywhere and it makes playing on public serers a pain. When I have to use a sneaky (and legal) trick to get my own public server it just started to make me wonder why I was playing the online portion. If we could just do our business grind in a closed/friends server I would be happy but I also WANT to play with others.I have had good moments to share. Some players will offer to help run selling missions resupplies and such and they get rewarded for it ofc. I've also seen some random silliness from people that brings a smile to my face.I also welcome the addition of Nightclubs seriously these are great! Every business in this game is so high maintenence with resupply run after ressuply run crate/vehicles collections and so on so forth but the nightclub has you only doing maybe a handful of promotion runs a day.Even if the Nightclub is dead you'll still get resources gathered from your active businesses like the Weed Farm or Meth Lab and the best thing is you don't even need to resupply them for these goods to generate in the Nightclub basement. So long as the Weed farm is running you'll have some weed added to the basement even if the supplies have run dry and the staff are doing absolutely nothing. It's a valid but slow way to make money while you just do whatever it is you wanna do.Pros Have literally cried laughing sometimesRandom events can distract the trollsI enjoy the NightclubsCons The worst community of griefers modders and trolls I have ever seenToo GrindyFeels Pay to WinPersistant and Annoying phonecallsToo many moddersToo many trollsToo many griefersCannot do selling or resupply runs in a friends/private serverOverall 4/10Closing Verdict GTA Online is fun when it's fair but Rockstar seem uninterested in addressing the big problems. I would suggest just removing Shark Cards slightly lowering prices and putting everyone on an even playing field. It wont solve all the problems (modders and griefers) but it will improve the quality of the game IN MY OPINION.The modders and the heavy pay to win is a serious downside to this potentially fun experience. With hours upon hours of stuff to do anyone with patience can enjoy GTA Online but you'll need thick skin to get through a day.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-24,0,0,79,False,Recommended,"I will go ahead and adress the elephant in the room GTA Online is a steaming pile of hot garbage. It would be a sad and broken excuse for a game if it was some low end internet multiplayer scheme but the fact that this mess was created by a good name like Rockstar is an absolute disgrace. It's such wasted potential and squandered wealth that it's like the digital equivilant of the baby boomer generation and quite frankly the whole thing ought to be overhauled from the ground up. But ignoring that and focusing on the single player experience I am blown away. It's honestly the most enjoyable GTA game that's out there IMO. An actually enjoyable story in a beautiful immersive world. This one has a lot to offer that previous titles don't. My issue with a lot of the previous games is that they'd get very repetitive and stale after all the fun missions are said and done. It's an honest problem with any sandbox game and this one while not perfect fights it pretty damn well. I really like the degree that the world feels ""alive""...the random encounters are pretty cool especially. And I like how the NPCs (and even animals) are a lot more vibrant in going about their routines it's a big departure from the cookie cutter people walking back and forth in straight lines of the older days. Missions are super fun especially the big heists. The gameplay stays pretty fresh and interesting throughout the story even on the majority of the side quests. I guess if anything could be done better it would be a little more immersive stuff to do in the world. This is nitpicky because although its leaps and bounds above any other title you can't help but feel that there could have been more. For instance the convenience store and (especially) random armored car robberies are a super cool touch and I would have loved to have more of that in the game as opposed to some of the ""official"" minigames. They can be a cute one time diversion but lets be real people play GTA to shoot rob and steal. Violent Crime. More of that please. If I want to get serious about Yoga or tennis I'll turn my computer off and go outside. All in all though the game is fantastic and now that the price has dropped more to reflect that it's essentially a single player only experience totally worth every cent.",Grand Theft Auto V

But the multiplayer oh don't get me started about the fricking multiplayer. First years (despite of damn cheaters everywhere) was fun and playable then they added heists which gave new life to the gameplay. Later came new missions and jobs freeroam activities which were cool to. But the content gets ing ridiculous. Grotesque vehicles uberweapons and tons and tons of useless crap. If I wanted that stuff I'd go for Saints Row not GTA. Call me a purist but I loved simplier GTA not the one full of panzekampfwagens on the streets without flying cars and bikes and all that t.

2016-06-29,0,0,2723,False,Recommended,This is a game I can not recommend highly enough but also one I apprehensively recommend to other PC gamers and only after I've known them for a while. The GTA brand is one that is known for controversy and most people have a preconceived notion about the franchise. I know I did.I played a few of the games in the GTA series (read HOT COFFEE) ) and never got it . That was until GTA V and the Heist update. It is the most fun I've had in a 4 player game (the most you can heist with) ever! Initially it was just fun to take off my white hat and stop playing the role of the good guy. But after carefully planning bank robberies with friends knocking over armored cars and breaking criminals out of prison I was fully embracing my dark side and the hedonistic joy that is GTA V. I have since amassed a small criminal empire... In the game of course. )It does have one significant drawback. HACKERS. Rockstar (RS) does try to keep them from ruining the game but they are seemingly one step ahead. With each patch RS plugs some of holes the hackers exploit but some remain and most pop back up after the hackers learn their way around the new patch.Online hackers are the only thing keeping this from being a perfect game.One thing to be aware of is the lack of controller options. It works great with most gamepads but you will need a second party program to get steering wheels and some other controlers working in the game. I have a Thrustmaster steering wheel and have to use X360ce to get GTA V to see my steering wheel. In between play sessions I often think about my crews next adventure in Los Santos. There are so many areas to explore I don't think one person can see it all. The map is approximately 100 square miles (13x7) with Los Santos being about 21 square miles The game is a technological marvel with top notch graphics and game play. I have over 1 000 hours in Los Santos and gladly no end in sight. It's a great return on a game investment.It's an absolute no brainer. If it's on sale get it! ),Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-09,0,0,455,False,Recommended,I started playing this game when it was released on the PC... It was very fun and I spent almost my whole time on this game from my second account and my Xbox One... After 2 years...It feels that your time is almost over...there are so much new expensive things that you force yourself you must get them. Because without the money and without the new things (cars businesses etc.) It's not worth that. This whole time while playing it without the new content is a little bit boring so you will probably leave the game very quickly after couple days of missions... I'm turning to all who are still didn't get this game and want to get it soon... Remember my words You will work very hard and you will do a huge ammount of missions and heists to get yourself a good stuff. But if you decide to do it on the easy way so you will probably find yourself losing experience from this game. So think and choose wisely... It was fun at the beginning but know it's just a matter of time. Take care of yourself!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-28,0,0,1014,False,Recommended,"Definitely the BEST new generation GTA game ever. Lots of things to do. It's like you have bought a hundred games in one purchase.Sure it is not perfect but it's really hella fun to play especially with friends online.I'd give it an 8/10 ratingI would give it a 9 if only they had better servers and do something about rampant chinese modders/hackers.To be specifics about the negatives here are the things that ROCKSTAR NEEDS TO FIX 1. Annoying forced lock on animations like sitting down changing gesture animation cycle and etc2. SLOOOOW LOADING TIME. They should really fix this. Players waste 30mins to hours of time just because of the loading time.3. CHINESE HACKERS4. BETTER MISSIONS with LESS DRIVING. They should really take out the driving/cruise part of a certain mission. We've already had enough of driving DURING the actual mission.5. Bring back the ""PICK UP ITEM"" feature and ""HANG/GRIP"" on vehicles feature6. When buying/taking SNACKS or any item give players the ability to place the amount of items they want like the SNACKS from the secretary. It's so stupid that we have to click on it one by one every time.7. MORE REALISTIC WORLD. Let players go inside a building or house by opening the door and not on a blip. Let paramedics do their job properly by not just declaring a casualty dead on the spot. They should take out a stretcher and try to revive a patient appropriately.8. Keys 1 2 3 to 0 should be quick switches to the assigned weapon and should no longer bring out the weapon wheel9. CROUCH. I don't know why there's no longer a crouch button but it should be there.10. ANIMALS. BRING THE ANIMALS ONLINE11. QUICK DIALOGUES MENU and GESTURE instead of just one preset gesture animation12. DESTRUCTIBLE BUILDINGS (Maybe in the future GTA6)13. RAGDOLL PHYSICS FIX. The characters look really stupid when they fall to the ground. Bring realistic animations.14. SEAT EJECTION when not wearing a seatbelt. Bring em back15. STOP THE GRIND MISSIONS. BRING MORE PRODUCTIVE WORHTHY ENJOYABLE and NON TEDIOUS MISSIONS. The HEISTS DLC was nice but you should UPGRADE it and not make future DLC suck. Make shorter and faster and more epic gameplay.16. REMOVE THE RADAR for PLAYERS. It just takes away the fun if you know where the players are. Or at least have a lobby that doesn't have a radar on it.17. Give MINI MISSIONS that can contribute to the community in the PUBLIC LOBBY.Like you can sell hotdogs on the street so players and NPCs can buy.18. FASTER LOADING TIME19. FASTER LOADING TIME20. FASTER LOADING TIME21. I could have said more but I forgot the restPOSITIVE THINGS ABOUT GTA A LOT CAN BE MENTIONED! GREAT GAME!BEST GTA EVER but even the best isn't perfect.",Grand Theft Auto V

Flying cars and bikes lazer tanks and other stuff arrived. Hell as far as I know we didn't ask for a Saints Row game from Rockstar didn't we guys? Community Go play San Andreas it's not ""Saints Rowish"" like this one and it actually surprise surprise has more both Singleplayer and Multiplayer content. Unless you're a 4K graphic addict then I feel sorry for you that you can't play this masterpiece from the 2003. Rockstar Remaster San Andreas but DON'T change anything apart from the engine and graphics. And you may add some content and pay the SAMP developers to develop an actually good multiplayer.

I'm sure you probably read reviews about how Online is overflowing with hackers and modders but it's not true. Most people are just content to genuinely gain ranks and let you go along doing the same (that being said there are some s that will go out of their way to annoy you but that's the same for any game that allows PVP.

2018-11-21,0,0,708,False,Recommended,I love Grand Theft Auto V. Even though the game has been out for almost 4 years on PC now but its still fun to play whether you're playing online with friends or modding your game in singleplayer. I would recommend GTA V to anyone looking for an open world game to play with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-10-12,0,0,359,False,Recommended,Story Mode is okay. Multiplayer with friends is where it's at key words being 'with friends' because playing GTA Online alone might actually be a legitimate form of self torture. If you don't have friends to help you out and back you up finding competent players who aren't jerks to do heists and missions and generally anything to do with trying to make money among other things become nigh impossible tasks.Once you have three other trustworthy players to do stuff with so long as you have the patience to deal with raising money manually and not through shark cards (unless you're into microtransactions) so long as you can deal with the occasional bugs and glitches and so long as you can avoid cheaters and hackers (just hop into a different session the second you notice anything weird going on) it's usually a very fun time.My friends and I have had a lot of fun together in GTA Online even in spite of all it's problems and that usually makes dealing with all of those things worth it in the end. Just be sure to take breaks from Online every now and again because the occasional annoyances start to pile up over time and might lessen the overall experience.TL DR Despite all of it's flaws I'd still (tentatively) recommend GTA 5 in 2018... but mostly to people with the patience of a saint.,Grand Theft Auto V

The missions are sometimes unbalanced which can lead to people getting mad. The game is not at all perfect. After the price dropped to 20 dollars there have been more and more hackers and modders. They can break the immersion and sometimes even the game. The community is filled with people who are either as toxic as a squad of 10 year old fortnite gamers or they can be as chill as the cooling agent for a nuclear reactor. The game does become more and more intese as you sink hours into. I enjoy that sense of progression it feels rewarding to make lots of money for the hard work and the effor put into setting everything up. This is where the game truly shines in my opinion. I would recommend this game if you had more than one person who is either higher level or has the shark card pack because the initial grind is very difficalt and can make you lose hope for the late game due to the ammount of time needed to start things up.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-20,0,0,581,False,Recommended,GTA V offers a very fun yet hardworking environment. You are able to play with your friends complete missions and so on in GTA Online however a lot of the items are overly priced so you have to grind your way to get the items! Once you get a hang of earning cash in GTA Online it will not be a big issue to earn large sums of money! Rockstar as a company tends to keep up with GTA V / GTA Online content updates however they also have a tendency to punish players without question and the absence of a chance of a appeal. If you are more towards the GTA V Single Player side there are a lot of mods for you to use if you are going for the Single Player missions i must say they are not as interesting. GTA SA was better than GTA V in terms of the story mode and missions however that may just be me.In conclusion GTA V is worth it but i would recommend you to get it when it's on sale or from CD Key websites that sell GTA V.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-27,0,0,105,False,Not Recommended,Now if I had to go back before I bought this game and make the choice to buy it again I wouldn't. In fact I'd rather ing buy WinRAR. This game started off as a gem on PC. When it came out the 2 year wait was all worth it. Flash forward 3 years and the game's online population is 90% hacker. The other 10% can't escape the never ending grind for weapons cars and apartments. Essentially everything new they add into this game is worth millions of in game dollars and HEISTS give you ANYWHERE FROM 30 000 750 000. That's way too little for all the effort. It's so much of a grind that GTA V created a third party buisness which people sell modded accounts. So essentially you can buy a modded account for $10 which has 500 000 000 in game dollars on it. Or you can buy a shark card for $10 WHICH GIVES YOU 200 000. What in the ing are you gonna buy with that? New tires for your 3 000 000 dollar car? This game is filled with micro transactions which led to so many people hacking on PC. I've put around 1 000 hours into this game including console and PC and I can say without a doubt don't buy this dog game. If you must buy a modded account or pirate it. Don't give Rockstar any more money for ruining their game. Which mind you is still 60 dollars 5 years after initial release.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,0,0,563,False,Recommended,Forget everything you think you know about remastered video game rereleases because new gen Grand Theft Auto 5 punches the rule book steals its car and then reverses back over the battered leathery remains just to be sure. The obvious question is should I buy GTA 5 all over again? to which the answer is a resounding Yes. Right this second. The improvements are numerous and obvious right from the get go. Better facial animation gives added weight to the already excellent vocal performances. A longer draw distance pulls you deeper into an open world that was already obnoxious in its level of detail but now feels even more exciting and alive. In fact it s so beautiful that simply existing in the sun bleached sprawl of Los Santos and surrounding countryside is as enjoyable as tearing through it on a lunatic murder spree. One of my favourite moments came when I flicked the radio off and drove slowly over a patch of lakeside dirt listening to the crunch of gravel under my tyres while watching the afternoon sun peel across the water. Bliss.Most impressive of all is the new first person mode. Rockstar could have simply crammed an extra camera in slapped a bullet point on the back of the box and had done with it. Instead what they ve done is essentially built an entirely new game. It s a switch in perspective both literal and psychological. Playing GTA 5 while looking through the eyes of your character connects you to the action in a way the traditional third person viewpoint never could. You re doing rather than observing. Punch an innocent bystander in the chops for a laugh? Suddenly it s not as funny as your first whips out in front of you and cracks them in the cheek sending them reeling. Stamping on enemies while they re down feels intimately gruesome (I still did it). It s a genius way of reframing a series notorious for its slapstick attitude towards violence. I found myself being well nicer. I drove more sensibly called taxis rather than hijacked cars and resisted the urge to whip out the sticky bombs every five seconds to make mincemeat out of the cops.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,199,False,Not Recommended,I enjoyed the single player portion of this game. Played through it probably 2 times now since it's been out. But like most gamers you are interested in the online portion because you may believe it'll give you a more immersive experience. For the most part that is true. In the case of GTA Online? It's false.You'll wait around 2 5 minutes for the online portion of the game to load. In which you'll begin to experience the clunky smooth loading of menus transition to game lobby screens and then into the game itself. If that's not enough to ruin your experience of the game then the community will. Unless you are an absolute scumbag of a human being you will not enjoy the community this game has to offer.In the last two weeks I played 22 hours total and of those 22 hours I estimated 2 2.5 of them were waiting for loading screens. I estimated that approximately 6 of those hours were of heists that only half finished due to someone repeatedly failing or someone leaving the game. 6 more hours could be counted towards waiting to find games and waiting for them to start and the rest of the hours were of actual enjoyable gameplay.If you are one of the lucky few who finds a friend or someone online who is helpful and fun to play with you might enjoy the game. However if you are like me and likes playing a game that has an established community this is not for you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-05,0,0,46,False,Not Recommended,I have to go not recommended never thought I would not recommend a GTA game but this is why.After playing the game for like 45hrs I have completed it and now no replay value and no point playing any more I could have completed the game in about 10hrs but it s fun just to drive around getting cops to chase you It s no GTA 4 let me tell you the missions are crap and boring nothing like 4 I only managed to buy 1 garage and 1 business to make some money ..yeah right you don t earn enough money throughout the game to purchase hardly anything the heists don t pay enough for the time and effort put into it .until the last heist 9million and the game finishes well all that it s too late most of the sub missions are crap and buggy like the collecting the submarine parts for a pay out of 10 dollars .really who wrote this garbage! And then I got stuck in a ship wreck after amazingly passing through the hull like a ghost!!!!Multiplayer ..ha forget it it s a joke just full of idiots that just kill you with rocket launchers from nowhere all the time.The game it s self is very good graphically but not very open world for a game in 2018 GTA 4 is way bigger and in my opinion much better.In short GTA 4 is better and more fun better missions longer game play building an empire etc but not as good graphics wise.GTA 5 Has better cars and more custom items and my fav the musical air horns .lovely jubbly.GTA 5 has gone pay for multiplayer route .not good it will kill it off GTA 5 missions are crap and boring and way too short for a game for 2018! Paying too much for a nice looking game.Use of the N word way too much.Buy Mafia 3 better missions better game play full stop.,Grand Theft Auto V

I like how there's a level system and money in the online mode but it takes too long which makes you either end up getting bored or having to spend money. All DLC is free but you need to buy it with in game money which comes to having to spend money or grinding for a while. Lot's of variety in the game which is perfect and a good amount of customization. You can easily find yourself spending a lot of time in this game but eventually you will most likely get bored. For the price it's at now it's a good pick up and you'll get your money worth.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-13,0,0,559,False,Recommended,I've been playing GTA 5 since 2016 and I have just decided to write a review now. GTA 5 is a really great game beautiful graphics well polished and has a really fun single player campaign even though the campign is a little short. The storyline is great absolutely love the story mode. Really great idea how they allow you to choose how you want to end the game. The online aspect however isn't looking too good right now. It's full of griefers and modders who just mess up the entire server when everybody is just minding their own business. The online aspect also consists of way too much grinding to get anywhere. All of the new content is really overpriced and to actually get and upgrade a lot of the new vehicles you have to separately buy overpriced things to upgrade the new vehicles. It just forces you to grind way too much but trust me once you have completed the grinding and reach the top it is so so satisfying and it makes the grinding and dealing with all these modders and griefers completely worth it. Overall GTA 5 is a really great game and it is definitely worth every cent of your money. Good job Rockstar Games for making this great game!,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-01,0,0,839,False,Recommended,It's been a long time since I've wanted to write a review for this game. Having accumulated that much playtime here are some good bad and mixed points. Pros Solid singleplayer The story is memorable (so are three main characters) albeit for some people it may be too short. There are many things to do even after finishing storyline (i.e. collecting cars going on rampage around huge city scuba diving and many others) Support of modifications Even if one becomes bored after doing everything in the game it is quite easy to revive it by installing third party mods which range from clothing to adding additional vehicles weapons or missions Long lasting multiplayer To be frank this thing has kept me entertained for more than 700 hours. It has been maintained since 2013 and is still going strong. It massively expands options which were available in the initial game and adds a lot more. One is free to create a character (which is quite customizable by the way) and build a criminal empire from scratch. Make friends participate in air races assasinate other players you name it! Cons (multiplayer related) Phone calls This one is truly annoying both for newcomers and long time players. The developers offer everyone to buy particular businesses on a regular basis. In case one doesn't want to do it the game constantly bombs you with calls and text messages. There is no way to fix it unless you purchase them. The other aspect is NPC calls. Even not that frequent they may distract player from flying texting or shooting which is irritating at times Anti cheating system The truth is if one encounters a cheater and reports him it's highly likely that nothing will be done about it. I've spoken to some modders and they stated that despite numerous complaints from others they always come out clean In game pricing In short this is ridiculous. In order to get any decent vehicles or businesses one should spend a lot of time before buying any (in case one gets assistance from others it's less of a problem). Of course everyone is free to buy virtual currency with real one but for some it costs way too much. Mixed (again multiplayer) Controversial community The gaming base is quite broad which may or may not be good. Sure there are people who are willing to help fellow player. On the other hand the number of not so nice gamers is huge. By them I mean those who find pleasure in killing others over and over again or just ruining someone's hard work Neverending grind In the end it all comes to this. First in case a player doesn't have any rich friends he goes through some missions as heists multiple times. Later on it's about using vehicles to get from point A to point B (everyone on the server gets notified about player's actions and is free to disrupt them) with a little variety. Even with some glitches making money may easily become tedious.And that's going to be it. Hope it helped you make up your mind.P. S. There are unofficial multiplayer projects (such as FiveM) based on Grand Theft Auto Online so YMMV.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-27,0,0,1016,False,Recommended,Grand theft auto has always been a favourite of mine. From learning to drive and somewhat getting over my fear of heights by playing it the game has not only been fun but also very educational.GTA V for me is particularly amazing. For the small amount they ask for the game you get a nice open world game with loads of updates that don't require extra money for DLCs. I am really enjoying the car heists that they brought into the game. Brings back the original GTA feel.Having said that there are a lot of things that they could do to improve gameplay. Especially between CEOs and Associates. But all in all it truly is a great game. Best money ever spentUPDATE Amazing work by R* keeping the updates and missions coming. A truly remarkable experienceUPDATE2 Even more amazing stuff released this year. The after Hours DLC especially,Grand Theft Auto V

The sharkcards are overpriced AF. That new rocket bike is like 4 million wich stands for 0 5 Megaladon sharkcard. That is 37.5 euro for just one vehicle!!!

2018-11-14,0,0,964,False,Recommended,Offline mode is fantastic. Great story and great gameplay. Worth getting just for the offline mode.Online would be fun except full of cheaters and little can be done except to switch sessions. Online is a bit of a grind as well but overall the experience is decent enough so the grind isn't horrible albeit very prevalent. The buy and sell missions are varied enough that you don't feel like you are just repeating the same thing over and over...even though you are. Also in online everything is extremely expensive to justify the use of shark cards. Shark cards essentially create a F2P mechanic in the game. R* has to put things in the online game that are grindy and not very fun to justify people buying shark cards to skip all that. So they are putting bad grindy content in the game on purpose so that people will want to skip it by buying shark cards. This overinflates the online economy and also means that R* wants you to pay them so you don't have to play parts of their game. F2P is not F2P rather it is pay not to play. You pay not to play the grindy bad portions of the game. This is a horrible idea dreamed up for online mobile games and has no place on the PC. I would argue from a gaming standpoint that this cancerous idea has no place in gaming in general but that is another discussion entirely.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,394,False,Recommended,I Got GTA to have fun i completed the story mode numerous times and its one of the best campaigns that i have ever played and then started playing online but quickly become bored and frustrated with the high prices of everything fair enough the DLCs are free but they expect you to buy shark cards or have no life and play the game everyday of your life do you have enough money to buy anything so I rarely played online due to this and when new content did come out he would want to play it but you would have to pay millions in game money two do anthing. In the end Rockstar and TakeTwo is just all about money not about the players they don't listen to the community and they don't care about any one but themselves. When thay tryed to take down OpenIV was the last straw modding is so fun and has such a big community.I Loved playing as a Cop with LSPDFR and as i am British and using openIV changing the vehicles to UK ones. GTA/ Rockstar and TakeTwo should embrace modding in SP as it gets more people playing there game and now to take off a FIVEM more and more people are switching to this online platform do you have fun and mess around online together not having to worry about messing up each other's car because it might cost them $5 000 to fix it. It just opens up a massive opportunities for Communities to form. e.g. DOJ RPI can only recommend this game because of the campaign and modding and what that adds to the game.NOT GTA ONLINE! I don't recommend GTA Online its a wast of time and money.We did it we got back OpenIV #BringOpenIVBackhttps //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openivMORE things I don't like about the game or could be improved 1. Loading screens take forever.2. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all.3. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list but whatever.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-14,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is an open world rpg by the likes of Skyrim with the old classic feel of the first Legend of Zelda. I decided to go through the evil campaign on my first run of the game. I started as a man who was robbing a very rich person in the ild little village. I later became a different person and robbed two carriages with the help of a friend. I thought it was a little wierd becoming another townfolk but the tutorial was excellent. I don't want to ruin the game for you so I will stop with the story there. I loved the campaign and would definitely play again to try to get all of the endings.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-25,0,0,159,False,Not Recommended,**DISCLAMER**This is my personal opinion on the game. Dont get butthurt please.Good game but you need friends in order to have fun. I mean you can almost do anything from selling coke to stealing cargo in order to sell it on the stock market. But solo is boring AF. At least 3 people required to have a good time. ********* EDIT **********Story The story is ok. Not better than GTA IV and not even close to GTA SA but its ok and its fun even though R* still own us a f*cking Story Mode DLC but whatever.*Online After a month (After the new update) I can say that the Online experiance is out of f*cking controll. Before Doomsday Heist the game was OK. It was fun with friends and all but after the new update the game has gone to sh*t. A game that you suppose to start as a Hustler and slowly progress in order to become a Kingpin has gone to Nuclear Warfare and WW3. Hell this aint GTA no more. Its ing WW3 simulator. FFS R* the online has gone to absolute SH*T. *Conclusion If you are looking to buy the game grab it while its on sale cause this game aint worth more than 25 bucks anymore. If you pay full price you just wasted your savings. You will enjoy the Story but you will find the Online kinda weird. Old school players like me that we used to play on Old Gen (PS3 Xbox360) will remember the good old days of hustling and grinding. Peace. Im out.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,88,False,Recommended,Pros Best GTA Story and Game So Far. Great Fun. Great Side Missions pretty much everything about the campaign in this game is stellar and worth admission. Being able to switch between 3 Characters keep things fresh and witty! Heists are great fun..Cons Multiplayer I think misses the mark as GTA was never about multiplayer and its a shame thats all they focused on after release dropping content update after content update that never made its way to single player.. This plus the punisment to single player modders in recent history is inexcusable. Banks heists can only be done in main campaign missions in single player. Some elements from previous games are missed. Its a great GTA game however (Single Player) and one that shouldnt be missed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-09,0,0,99,False,Recommended,GTA V has a great story because you aren't just black. In GTA V you are told to do heists because the Corrupt FBI is forcing you to do so. I like that its an original concept for you to do heists where is in San Andres you are a black man. GTA online is pretty good and probably isn't going to continue having updates but that's okay. I have met a handful of hackers finding one out of every 10 lobbies or so. The main hackers I have found are pretty cool though all they do is force GTA snow when there isn't supposed to be. Those are the hackers I like. I am not saying that there are no hackers that just kill you with aimbot from across the map those still exist. Overall I say maybe don't get this exclusivly for the online... The online is still good and all but there are a good amount of hackers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-24,0,0,1536,False,Not Recommended,"NOTE This review is based entirely on the GTA Online mode not the single player game because the only portion of single player I've played is the few minutes of tutorial that are inexplicably required before you're allowed into Online.GTA Online is to put it plainly a giant mess. The problems began with the early design decision to use a peer to peer networking scheme likely as a way to save money on server resources. Peer to peer lends itself to hacks and cheats and both the game's original two platforms (PS3 and X360) and PC are infested with players using mods usually to ruin other players' days.But the worst problems have developed as the game has been expanded over the years. Once the developer (Rockstar) and/or their parent company and publisher (Take Two) realized the revenue potential of selling in game currency for real world money the game's design has been primarily driven by the desire to ""encourage"" players to buy Shark Cards. As items purchasable with in game money (vehicles properties clothing etc.) have been added to the game their prices have undergone tremendous inflation requiring players to acquire more and more in game money to enjoy the new content and keep up with other players.At the same time while additional money making activities have been added to the game they've been locked to public sessions where the game not only encourages all other players in the session to interfere and stop the player trying to make money but gives those other players tremendous advantages (including telling them that someone's doing something lucrative in the first place giving them a real time updated map of where the money making player is and allowing them to use all of the miliary style weaponized vehicles that have been added to the game in the last few years while the player attempting to make money is usually limited to a slow unarmored vehicle such as a civilian car delivery van prop plane etc.It's possible to use various techniques to interfere with the game's network communications in order to get into a ""solo"" public session to avoid other players while engaging in money making activities but this generally makes it difficult to play with friends as well as strangers and could easily be considered a violation of the game's license agreement. I haven't heard of anyone being punished for this but it's a chance you take.There are other issues that can be raised as well such as the developers primarily relying upon other players to provide challenge rather than NPCs their unrealistic and inept use of NPCs when they do use them (for example NPCs who can headshot a player in the cockpit of a moving helicopter at extreme range with an SMG or just check YouTube for videos of NPC traffic deliberating swerving and doing other crazy stuff to hit players particularly during missions that hinge upon delivering a vehicle with minimal damage) and many of the game's updates over the years being composed primarily of content basically cut and pasted from previous updates just with a new skin.All in all GTA Online is the poster child for what can happen when game design and development are driven primarily by corporate executives' need for constantly growing monetization both immediate and ongoing rather than more traditional goals such as player fun or adherence to an artistic vision.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-22,0,0,1597,False,Recommended,To keep things short get this game for the singleplayer because it is enjoyable and fun with the characters and story. It is lacking in the singleplayer DLC minus some drip feed cars that you probably won't til the end.As for the online be ready for a grind and a half but it can be made easy by playing with friends and meeting more with the Rockstar Social Club. As for the issues well....... Server Kicks and Disconnects thus making you lose progress. SHARK CARDS (It is just not worth the asking price even with the 'microtransactions in a priced game argument' is ignored) Other Players being jerks Destroying Cargo Using Orbital Cannon alot Griefing other players K/D ratio warriors etc With all the money this game has made somehow hackers are still running rampant in this game glitching money or just using God Mode and Teleportation. (And if hacker drop for you money don't pick it up!) Payouts for various missions races Modes being too low thus making it hard to get more players to play them. Insane prices of some vehicles and PropertyAll in all if you can have 2 6 friends to play this online mode with then it gets less grindy. So I reccomend this one but wait for a sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-12,0,0,217,False,Recommended,I recommend this game it's pretty funny especially if you play with friends. But there're some problems with GTA Online players. They're crazy. (I know about the passive mode).The biker club business isn't effective at all because of GTA Online players. Every time you sell for example documents or deliver materials you get a very high risk of being destroyed by a freaky guy on Opressor Mk. II or another wunderwaffe. Okay I would understand this if I could deliver documents by my helicopter with weapons or another vehicle but I can only use vans/planes/bikes that the game gives me. This pity thing destroys my desire to play GTA Online. (And I forgot to write that you can't use the passive mode when you're the president of the Biker Club/SecuroServ Organization).BUT if I understood it correctly I can sell all my production with the help of the Night Club so thanks for that. But you also need to earn about $1.000.000 or more.I hope that Rockstar will do something with the community in GTA Online.Thanks for reading this.

2018-11-21,0,0,75,False,Recommended,If you want a game that's fun to mess around in this is a game I would highly recommend. Especially if you have friends to play it with. You can go around stealing things doing heists rob a grocery store etc. It's pretty fun but here are a few notes I have about the game.This game has two options when you launch it. The GTA online mode and the regular game. If you want to play online then you have to boot up the online one. But if you want to play the main story campaign you need to launch the base game. When you boot up the online version in order to actually play online you need to complete the tutorial because otherwise it won't let you do certain things in the online session. For example it won't let you use car shops to sell or edit cars. The tutorial takes at least 2 hours to complete but it's better off doing it that way you don't encounter that issue. When you're playing online and trying to get the money it can be draining at the beginning. But once you get more and more money it gets easier as you go.Otherwise I don't really have much else to say about it. I think that it was worth the time and money I put into it.

You're pretty much invicible with the Kuruma while you can zoom across the map quickly with the MKII using the speed glitch. Just please don't go about griefing other people with the MkII.

2018-11-25,0,0,771,False,Recommended,GTA V Online in specific is a fantastic trip. Rockstar pushes out free content frequently. They are always adding new vehicles quests advesary modes community events clothing and other content. As par for course for Rockstar they charge their players nothing for all this. Thanks to the developers being on top of it GTA V Online stays fun fast and relevant. My only complaint about the game is Rockstar definitely needs to find a way to end the modding. When a player is able to mode game code to the point of making the game physically unplayable for another player a line has been thoroughly crossed. I would give GTA Online a 10/10 if not for the modding which forces me into about an 8. I and my friends absolutely love this game but there are HOURS many nights a week we are unable to accomplish anything due to being in a cage or locked in an apartment or constantly hopping sessions to find one without UFOs being dropped on our heads.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-16,0,0,41,False,Recommended,Would recommend it with friends soloing online is a big nope. There are many hackers and most people only have a high level character by now and enjoy themself exploiting their level and wealth to make new players wanna uninstall.If you have friends to play with you can make a private session and do jobs or minigames with them and you'll get guarenteed fun.I must warn that you need to grind alot untill you'll be able to get into money making(what needs you to be in a normal session from what I've seen so far) and it can get tidious but that's when the minigames come into play and lighten up the grind.A bad point is that npc's give jack about you driving there and just turn left/right at the moment you are speeding next to them and this might up some things. Also some hitboxes aren't alligned properly and have a lil wider hitbox then they should but you'll never know where and when that'll happen.Physics are 10/10 realistic I myself fly through the air with a motorcycle everyday to and when I drive my car and hit something irl I also do 7 360's.,Grand Theft Auto V

(Weapons and cars can be modified)You can own pretty much anything drug labs bunkers and more. (All of those have their own missions for instance the bunker makes money by you producing weapons and ammo but to make those you have to bring materials into the bunker and when your bunker makes the stuff you have to send the stuff to the clients)Cons The game takes forever to load. xdSometimes the missions bugs out or the game crashes it self.You require 4 friends to play it would be nice if there would some thing you could do with only 1 friend.

2016-07-15,0,0,87,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto VI've been looking forward to a follow up to Grand Theft Auto IV for quite some time and after far too much waiting and an asinine delayed release compared to the console versions V is here on the PC. The question now is whether it's worth the price. Buckle up kids this is going to be a fun one...GraphicsGrand Theft Auto V is designed as a third person shooter. While it has a first person mode you will quickly notice the lack of smaller details (high resolution textures models etc.) if you stay in it. With that said the fact that they modeled interiors and instruments/gauges for every vehicle is appreciated and adds to the immersion. It features a nice color palette and a decent enough level of detail on most levels. As a result it is fairly appealing to look at and definitely works well. However it isn't perfect. Wilderness can be lackluster with plain ground textures and no modeled grass in quite a few locations reminiscent of old pre Source engine games. Some textures appear overly flat some are too shiny and others not enough and there are some other annoyances. So while it won't set the standards for graphics it's appealing enough as long as you can get past some annoying minor issues.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 426135917AudioThe voice acting is quite decent and I have no complaints there. Vehicles all sound decent enough but weapon sounds will be where I raise issue. They simply don't sound powerful enough none of them. I highly recommend looking into mods to resolve this. The ambient music is pretty good but most of what you'll be listening to consists of licensed tracks on the radio. I won't get anywhere near that because I don't know much about music besides that I hate pop and rap.PerformanceWell it isn't bad but it isn't great either. You definitely need a decent graphics card for Grand Theft Auto V and I highly recommend that your system exceeds the minimum requirements if you want to consider this title. Low graphics settings look abominable and you'll need a respectable system to run higher settings. There are also some bizarre performance hits with certain graphics and gameplay options so keep that in mind and consult guides to fine tune your settings.GameplayThis is an open world shooter with a large open environment relatively realistic cityscape and far spanning countryside. The controls are decent enough and feel a little slow on purpose as they do with some third person games. First person mode has slightly more fluid controls but it's still very similar. There is a run of the mill cover system you can carry every weapon you own at the same time à la Doom and the weapons feel like you'd expect out of a third person shooter. Vehicle controls are acceptable but they're far from perfect and definitely feel like a step back from Grand Theft Auto IV. Helicopter and aircraft controls in particular are very poor. It is still quite fun though and there's a wide variety of things to see. While you will eventually become bored of the gameplay that won't be until after you finish the campaign. The AI is problematic though. Pointing a gun at someone won't make them put their hands up and surrender to you. Instead they simply flee in terror. They will also call the police on you for simply standing nearby them a strange quirk to say the least.SingleplayerThe singleplayer campaign follows about 70 story missions typically ranging between 10 and 30 minutes in length each with a large variety of side missions to complement them. The side missions truly are extremely varied from assassinations to playing tennis. The detail that has been put into this game is rather impressive and this covers both ends of the spectrum On one hand police can be found sitting on the side of a highway sipping coffee and snoozing instead of monitoring their radar guns. On the other there's a fully functional strip club which you can visit. Not a game for kids.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 623658469The plot isn't anything revolutionary all things considered. It's about what you'd expect from Grand Theft Auto A satire of American culture to the tune of high risk high reward felony. You'll spend less time stealing cars and more time stealing assets from banks in this game though as that is a major focus of the campaign and where much of your characters' income will come from. On the whole the singleplayer world is the highlight of Grand They Auto V and where you'll get most of your playing time if you're like me. It was fairly enjoyable and managed to avoid either overstaying or understaying its welcome.MultiplayerAlright I've got a bone to pick with this part of the game 'Grand Theft Auto Online'. Quite simply Rockstar's handling of it has been abhorrent. It is essentially an MMO version of Grand Theft Auto that locks you out of most items until you grind enough to unlock them in various gamemodes which are separate from the ""overworld"" of Los Santos. Doesn't sound bad at first but it's bogged down by some serious issues. First you can purchase currency for Grand Theft Auto Online on Steam. This gives whoever does so a direct advantage and is quite frankly disgusting. It has no place in a sixty dollar triple A title like Grand Theft Auto.The loading screens are incredible I've spent more time sitting in them than I have actually playing Grand Theft Auto Online. It is also plagued by hackers and griefers you'll be hard pressed to find a server without either a hacker who ruins the experience or somebody who simply takes either an MRAP vehicle an attack helicopter or the armored sports car and attempts to kill every player they can find. And of course we have to make an honorable mention to Rockstar themselves as they have banned players for simply being in the same game as hackers without actually banning the hackers themselves. Bravo bravo.Community ContentRockstar's policy towards community created content so far has been deplorable to say the least. Many times in the past their patches broke mod support for some time and they offered no support themselves for modifications to Grand Theft Auto V. Their publisher Take Two Interactive has also shut down any attempts to create third party multiplayer with extreme prejudice on one occasion dispatching private investigators to harass the developers of such a modification. They are decidedly shooting themselves in the foot by acting this way.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 462165197In spite of the issues with modifications community created content has been released and some truly impressive stuff it is indeed. LSPDFR is set to be an impressive overhaul of the game from crime simulator to police simulator. You can find mods that replace player characters with Iron Man complete with functional suit if that's not big enough maybe you'd like to try a Hulkbuster suit on for size. Those familiar with Superhot can find a mod that slows time when the player isn't moving. No matter what you're looking for Grand Theft Auto V's modding community has something for you and with this community I can almost recommend the game.VerdictThis game has its fair share of flaws but it is also a splendid open world one which plays host to an entertaining singleplayer campaign and one which the modding community has taken full advantage of despite its lack of development tools. With that said thanks to Take Two and Rockstar's absurd handling of mods for the game they have earned my ire and I'll likely not be supporting them as a result.I do not recommend Grand Theft Auto V.",Grand Theft Auto V

But the people who cheat for invicibility and then shoot you over and over or the people who hack away your items or the people who manage to get 1 second race times in a 1 3 minute race those people aren't really a concern for Rockstar.

2017-05-02,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be absolutely great before Rockstar decided that griefers needed a help in ruining the fun for other players by adding flying motorcycles and cars that can shoot missles and what not at other players that are minding their own business without putting themselves at any risk. This prevents many people from doing any sort of missions such as Headhunt that requires the player to roam the city as the you will be constantly bombarded with missles from flying motorcycles and cars. Not only that but Rockstar decided to charge high prices for those vehicles so that only those who grind constantly or decided to fork out their wallets for Shark Cards can actually afford them. If you want to make a lot of money in the game you need a lot of money to start up businesses if you dont have a lot of money then you can either buy Shark Cards for the easy way or grind hours upon hours upon hours to start making a good amount money (hoping that the griefers wont come along and ruin everything which they can easily by destroying any resources your carrying from point A to B resulting in a lot of money lost).Of course this isn't the only problem with the game. The long loading time freezing texture pop in overpriced vehicle the time needed to dedicate to buy anything fun or interesting in the game and many more just ruins this game for me and personally I really don't recommend anyone who is debating whether to start playing this game to actually play this game save your time and money and use it somewhere else worth investing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-23,0,0,164,False,Not Recommended,Its a fun game at least until they ban your friends for getting griefed by a cheater... Cheaters are rampant on the servers and really ruin an otherwise decent game. I was willing to put up with it until a cheater recently managed to kill a bunch of people in a lobby in a way (I don't understand how exactly) that put all the deaths in my friends name. A few days after this happened he tried to log into his account and got a message telling him that hes banned for 30 days and will have his character reset. This after he bought the Criminal enterprise starter pack a few cards and put in over 200 hours. Tickets put in to complain about it have been totaly ignored so hes out everything he built up over months because Rockstar can't control cheating on their own servers. I can't go 2 hours of playing this game without running into modders but regular people are getting banned. I can't help but feel that the devs have no idea what they are doing.None of this impacted me directly but I'm done I won't support a company that treats it's repeat customers this poorly. I'm applying for a refund from steam as soon as I finish this. Even if I don't get it I'll never be playing a Rockstar game again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-02,0,0,1962,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Sorry but I'm not gonna defend this broken game along with R*'s shady practices including flagging legitimate players as false positives by banning them because they received modded money against their will or being at the mercy of hackers. And the fun part? Hackers get away with it unpunished and are never banned. And even if they are banned so long as they keep buying the game just to evade the ban they'll continue on with their reign of terror and R* are obviously blinded by money.Wanna know the fun part? Those billions of dollars R* has earned from the game alone are being dumped for their latest game that is Red Dead Redemption 2 instead of spending their money of fixing their broken servers constant lag and most all getting rid of the hacker problem. They are completely devoid of their fanbase and their fans as well. And their customer support is one of the worst as well.In case anyone wonders no I have not been banned nor will I ever be. Sadly real hackers will never be banned either.The hacker problem has gotten worse long and inconsistent load times are persistentYep the hacker problem went as far as to reach to Single Player/Story Mode hackers can now kill players in single player with just a click of a button which makes Online look like Disneyland. No lie. Look it up and you'll see what I mean. In addition loading times have become seriously problematic when booting up the game and it's not just Online even Single Player is having persistently long load times as well so unless you have a supercomputer grade PC along with ultra fast internet speed you're out of luck.And because R* is completely oblivious with that kind of issue it's a gamble in itself.Servers are becoming worse because R* depends on P2P and not dedicated servers nor are they bothered to fix the servers themselvesTitle says it all. R* doesn't learn a damn thing when it comes to dealing with broken servers. Even if you have an internet speed that's of perfection constant lags and frequent disconnects makes Online feel like a total chore than fun. But most people have the gall to tell people to say ""it's on your end"" proves that they are basically insecure kids who constantly beg their parents for them to get overpriced content.And speaking of overpriced content...Overpriced content and griefing / funGrinding is a chore and not fun just to get nice things and griefing (unless if it's a vigilante kind those who have grown tired of kids blowing stuff up because it's considered to be ""fun"") just adds insult to injury and it clearly causes a friction to friends and allies alike. And that's because R* here has the nerve to push Shark Cards for easy transaction which is beyond EA (Electronic Arts) levels of greed.And don't bother reporting people if they are intentionally trolling you not only will R* ignore it they will actually ban you while hackers/griefers only get a slap on the wrist and allow them to continue on. As for innocent players? They obviously refuse to give them second chances much less listen to their reasoning. Even with proof R* will simply shut them down by blatantly saying ""all bans are final and may not be appealed"".Community is toxic because the forums are completely un moderatedAgain don't bother reporting people who brings up toxicity especially since the majority of Steam moderators don't seem to pay much attention to them and even if they do they'll end up getting swamped by having to deal with kids who think that the devs are basically the gods of gaming when they're obviously not. They have billions of dollars yet prefer to dump all of their earnings for their new game over fixing GTA V/Online altogether.ConclusionIt used to be a great game but with overpriced content coupled with constant server issues including long load times no matter how good your PC or internet is it's overall quality is dwindling pretty fast yet people will still thumb it up because they want to support greedy devs (or because they simply write down one liners or none at all mostly because they might be obviously underage) and eventually find themselves at their mercy at the hands of hackers who will delightfully cause serious problems by bombarding them with modded money insta kills and use invincibility for them to be as good as un killable be it on free roam or Deathmatches. And R* will not be entirely bothered in dealing with an ongoing hacker problem so long as money talks and they walk away with them leaving everyone else to suffer all while hackers have their fun and not get punished whatsoever. It used to be amazing but it's now a hollow shell of it's former glory.And no I didn't give R* a penny for buying their game. If any I did got it for free a few years back.",Grand Theft Auto V

I was not disappointed The set of characters for the game are what's to be expected out of a GTA title. You've got your stereotypically dumb celebrities corrupt police force mixed in an overall insane world which are complemented by the simple yet well written main characters going between rags to riches no longer retired heist lords and crazed homicidal maniacs.Going through the main story and exploring Los Santos and the surrounding areas is incredibly entertaining and enjoyable because there is simply so much see and do especially in the backstreets. And then you have the multiplayer which albeit a microtransaction hell there is a tremendous amount of content to enjoy with your friends.Overall this game is worth just for the singleplayer OR the multiplayer.

Disappointment is just around the corner through trial &amp errors and or countless hours devoted it is bound to happen.But honestly that's the beauty of it.This game is so much fun to mess around in with friends.

Overall just ignore the critics out there who like to nit pick at the smallest of things and enjoy the game as it is. If you find it distasteful by all means stop playing.

Grinding for money is intentionally made to be as difficult and time consuming as possible while new and better vehicles are ridiculously expensive. 3 All that said it's still pretty fun.

2018-11-22,0,0,201,False,Recommended,"I've played GTA since the first one. Religiously. And this one is yet another great release.I have trouble finding time for SP nowadays though so I have not completed the SP (TBH I did not complete GTA IV DLC's aswell due to having to restart it several times trouble with savegames) and I basically jumped straight to MP in GTA V.Sadly though GTA V MP is legendary for its' ""Loading simulator"" feel where you spend a bunch of time waiting for the loading to complete and often enough questioning if it will complete or you are better off restarting the game. The lobbying partying up etc. part of MP is really bad but when you are playing together the game is really great. Laughs oddity absurdity tension etc. all seasoned with good old R* humor. There are TONS of different things to do in this game and it gets plenty of updates aswell. I haven't played this all that much but I always find so much s#it to do and even the simplest activities end up being a bunch of LOLs.What I'd change 1) The in game ads for ""buy this and that via. the browser on your phone"" are disturbing and even moreso when they are replayed on every reconnect. This is annoying as f#ck and should be possible to turn off. There is no need to remind me how good of a purchase a nightclub or a bunker is. I'm not gonna buy shark cards anyways D2) Joining Online &amp Friends/Crew etc. it's absurd that the fastest way to join your friends is for one to invite everyone to heist setup then quit the heist setup and have everyone at his Heist room. This way joining takes almost no time at all and nor does the exiting of Heist setup. This is what assures me that the painful loading times could be fixed. I don't get it why they haven't been fixed to this day as the game gets updates (great) and has been around for a while. All other ways of joining sessions are a lot slower and also bugged meaning often times it one of the guys joining fails to connect.3) Re joining heist/mission when playing with friends (upon d/c) this should be enabled... re entering lobby and restarting the mission from the last ""checkpoint"" would be great it's really annoying when a long mission gets failed because one of the members dropped. Basically a party system would be great.4) Joining lobbies from phone should check if the lobby has been filled in the meantime before letting you join a full lobby meaning you have to rejoin online. Meaning if a session is full it should be known before it's possible to attempt to join only to be d/c'ed.5) When someone is attacking you (specially if it's constant spam killing) it should not be your burden to pay for their equipment if it gets destroyed meaning provoked attacks would leave the burden of insurance costs of destroyed equipment on the attacker (for their gear). This should wear off with a cooldown.Currently it's pretty annoying if people annoy the hell out of you with expensive ""easy killing lock fire forget cant dodge"" equipment &amp you really don't wanna kill them because the only way would be to destroy their equipment meaning $$$ lost.Which brings me to ""Misc"" 1) Some of the content is just tooooooo unreal for me lol.2) A bit cumbersome using the map a dedicated key to display full map and not canceling actions (driving etc. like in PUBG i.e.) would be great. Also an easy way to set relevant waypoints maybe a favorites system &amp a hotkey to toggle favorite waypoints (+ current mission waypoints). This way you could drive &amp do everything + set the waypoint at the same time.Great game anyways. I wish GTA VI fixed the connecting lobbying up etc. MP issues this game faces. The loading times are just wayyyyy tooooo looong this might also be an issue why I haven't played it THAT much.",Grand Theft Auto V

I even reported them because at that time I did not realize that they were lagging I thought they were hacking.not to say there are no hackers in the game the game is full of hackers from exploding everyone in the session repeatedly until they all leave to inviting people to their apartment an invite they can't reject then they killing them.and then there are the opressers. i dont know why that bike even exists with 0 counters to it if any of this happens to you and believe you me it will happen to you alot in this game switch sessions these people deserve to play alone. there is no point reporting them cos rockstar makes it super hard to report someone and even if you successfully manage to report the guy it feels like a waste of time.ps(shutup grammer police),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-17,0,0,77,False,Recommended,This review is only for main story mode I've been a big fan of the GTA series on PC and console since the beginning. The open world sandbox coupled with sharp witty writing made me come back time after time. I love just driving around in the city exploring all the nooks and crannies while listening to the radio. GTA V is a faithful sequel to the series but I feel that some of the magic sauce from the previous iterations is missing. First up is the story/gameply I never felt drawn to any of the characters or their plight. The introduction is Trevor is a well needed shot in the arm yet he arrives much later in the game. The two other protagonists Michael and Franklin are pretty cliché and dry. Some of the missions are pretty original however by the end of the game it become quite repetitive. While driving around the city is still fun the city feels very empty. Even though there are sometimes random events such as robberies and surprise side missions these boil down to escort or kill missions. If you're solely coming to GTA V for the story mode only buy the game when it's on sale.Secondly the graphics and controls The graphics are definitely impressive. I was impressed by the animations reflections and lighting effects. I can't really compare this game to others since it came out five years ago (2013). I especially like the explosion effects and sunsets. Controls are pretty good. I tried playing the game with keyboard and mouse yet I find the console controller more comfortable. I could never get comfortable with the cover/shooting system. Half the time it would work. I always hear people complain about the driving controls but I've never had a problem with driving. This game is just like the previous ones. I love driving and it mostly depends on which cars you're controlling. They did a good job giving each car its own characteristics with sound control and physics.Wrapup Purchase on sale. The story mode is good but not great. It's a GTA game through and through just not as memorable as the previous ones. Besides a handful of chuckles the characters are a tad dry and the missions get repetitive. There isn't enough innovations in gameplay or story when comparing the rest of the GTA lineup. Now I'm waiting for the PC versions of Reddead Redemption II.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-26,0,0,620,False,Recommended,GTA V is a release of a long going chain of games inevitably all following a similar playstyle just like GTA 4 this one also has online play which is alot more polished and a much more investable time sinkProsGood time sink for you solo or with friends as the multiplayer and singleplayer to some extents both have story if you call the cut scenes story ofcourse. Game play is what you expect from a GTA V game Shoot em up car theft robbing banks and running down yobs in the fastest car you can acquire its a really big time sink making sure you come back through the means of a repeatable online experience as missions have a multitude of roles you can take turns in performing through heists missions and more player vs player oriented content to participate in if shooting the ballas over and over while nicking their car isn't your cup of tea.doing some player versus player missions like races can unlock you things which aren't buyable till you do the mission such as the tron bike and outfit.the other mentionable feature is that there is some map creation I think for the PVP/Races? I've never gotten into the nitty gritty side of things personally not being very creative without re inventing the wheel first.The consIts big open world daunting to the newbie where the fastest catch up mechanic is paying for the criminal enterprise pack or buying shark cards levels will leave you feeling weak in open lobbies as alot of players have the best obtainable attachments and upgrades so PVP in free roam atleast is a No go. Costs can be very off putting as for alot of the snazzy cool stuff your asked usually for 1.5 2 mill its a long tread mill without much incentive bar levels new clothes and the such inbetween while you aim for the long term goal.I would rate/reccomend this game to friends/others as theres big goals to be achieved despite the time it asks to make these big goals achieveable and it is seeped content or bonuses to doing x content every week or so while providing a very strong singleplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

The freeroam is overflowing with modders who will either give you tons of free or kill you and stop you from being able to make money. This said the minigames and missions are extremely fun and I've had tons of laughs playing with friends. The actual added content despite how overpriced it is is quite fun to play with and the toys they add are poorly balanced letting you dominate other players in freeroam if you purchase wisely.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-10-23,0,0,849,False,Recommended,I love this game. I've played the story countless times on both pc and ps3 and have been playing since the game came out on each platform. I've also been playing GTA V Online since I got wifi on my ps3 (I dont know when but it was about 1 2 years after I got the game) and Online has got me hooked. Online has changed a lot so its kinda difficult to be a new player but the point of Online is the grind and it never really stops but I love that about Online. They have a lot of new missions that can give decent money and they're pretty cool. And the reward of getting something new is fun and now there is a lot of cool stuff to spend your money on. Also with the price going down on this game by 50% I don't think you could go wrong with buying this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-23,0,0,332,False,Recommended,So. How to describe it ? Grand Theft Auto V It feels like it was yeasterday that I played Gta San Andreas and now what we have here this third/first person open world action and all this stuff game. Is it worth it to buy this game you asking ? Well yeah it is but if you have friends to play with or its gonna be little boring without them. But I must warn you. Game have some bugs that are annoying many kids that using cheats and other bad sh*t stuff. But when you give it more and more AND MORE time its not that much annoying. Graphic is good ( yes its not NEXT GEN graphic and all that stuff but its not bad )SP story is good because Trevor. MP is like 80% of game. And you can build your own Cartel Industry Gunrunning business and other event games like golf ( darkest game in gtaV ) races and other cool stuff.So yeah I recommend this bag of (sh*t) diamonds kittens and all that cute things xd,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-29,0,0,46,False,Recommended,Absolute mess of tryhards and broken weapons and vehicles. Gameplay is a huge grind with no real end goal. Infuriating experience. However it's kept me playing for a really long time regardless and is worth the money if you actually play the game how it was meant to be played and do heists and the likes. Just know that the game looks a lot more glamorous on YouTube than it actually is and that the community is a mess and the game is a major grind if you dont want to put down 400$ in shark cards.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-22,0,0,147,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto. What a game. With over 300h on the playstation and a couple dozen more on PC I have to say that this game definitely deserves a solid 10/10. GTA V has an expansive world with a lot of things to do but the singleplayer is only the tip of the iceberg.For those of you who have been in multiplayer we all know there are fun days and there are bad days. I usually have fun when I team up with some friends. Why? All those stupid ragdoll moments are just that much more fun the missions aren't as tedious and generally having a large group of people in a gang ensures immunity against everyone else in the server which in turn helps you do your Motorcycle Club missions at ease.I've been playing this game since day one and have only recently returned to it. In those past two years I missed out on SO MUCH content that I can't even name most of them. Rockstar updates online on a regular basis in order to keep its playerbase happy with fresh content. I wouldn't mind paying full price a third time. Honestly you get a 60 dollar singleplayer with a free multiplayer. Of course Rockstar has their notorious shark cards for the online version of GTA V but seeing as they invest their time and money into improving it regularly I am fine with having microtransactions even though I personally wouldn't buy into them.Overall good game. 10/10. All I'm hoping for (but probably won't happen) is that singleplayer DLC they promised before launch.,Grand Theft Auto V

But there's defiently is some fun missions with creative action scenes. But luckily the PC version allows for mods which can really boost the fun. Now the online part is really where Rockstar hit the jackpot. You create your own character and persona and with some friends you can have some serious fun with all the different activites missions and challenges. But you can still get some fun out of the online mode alone.Though i do recommend buying the game with a shark card so you can get easily started with all the fun. Hope this review helps.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-24,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar needs to revamp their control system and RAGE engine. Their animation system was nifty a decade ago but even by the time of this game I couldn't handle it. It was frustratingly unresponsive. It's a common problem I've always had with Rockstar's open world games. They design richly detailed vast worlds to explore which are great fun but then tie in some awful controls and mechanics to their games. Luckily the world story and characters make up for it most of the time. I didn't feel like this game achieved that. The story was traditional GTA over the top but it felt far too much like palying an updated San Andreas except with less to do. The triple character selection I also did not like at all. In this type of game I want to play as one character I want to build that character I want to grow that character and I want to dominate as that character. With this triple character design it means resources had to be shared. You had to decide which properties and businesses each one bought. Certain characters were better at other things forcing you to play as them even if you enjoyed other characters better. It felt like a weird addition to a tired game formula.As far as PC aspects go though. Game has tons of graphics settings. It runs well. All is good.,Grand Theft Auto V

The voice acting and cutscenes are quite hilarious albeit not as great a storyline as III IV Vice City and San Andreas but it retains the GTA charm.Very immersive because it has a lot of content customisable weapons and character(s) purchasing properties upgrading cars and flying planes side missions races jumps punching hookers.

2018-11-24,0,0,156,False,Recommended,I love the story/singleplayer mode a lot more than the online multiplayer. The story mode gives purpose for gamers who like objective type of games. Also it creates different missions help the gamer experience almost everything the game has to offer such as the Stranger Things missions (like side missions you talk to certain strangers to get them). Additionally the story mode has 3 sets of characters with difference personalities which are Michael Franklin and Trevor (I love him the most cause he be wildin). On the other hand I'm not a real fan of grinding but online multiplayer is alright at first (because of the customizable character and beating random people) but it's highly recommended that you play with a friend because things can get lonely when you're soloing the missions or VIP/CEO works to earn money. Overall this game is all about the grinding to get more money to buy whatever when you're in online multiplayer mode and story mode lasts about 40 hrs? but it's imo worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Online used to be like hell when hackers would lock you in a cage or kill you for no reason but I've been playing it recently and haven't encountered any hackers. A big improvement over GTA 4 is obviously is GTA Online with a lot of things to do like heists and missions things that you couldn't have done in GTA 4. Overall I'd give it a 9.8/10 just because all the vehicles on GTAO are overpriced but besides that it is very well made. ),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-28,0,0,686,False,Recommended,Singleplayer is a lot of fun. Multiple characters that each have their own story. Most heists/missions can be played in multiple ways each with their own benefits. Shame about the promise of singleplayer dlc that was made in 2013/14 and to this day still hasn't been released.Multiplayer is only recomendable if you have friends to play with or are willing to search for people to play with. Since atleast from my experience playing gta online alone is far from interesting. There are quite a lot of free dlc added to gta online but most of them are just items like cars airplanes buildings etc. And require you to either pay money or grind for ingame cash. Every mission is kind of fun to begin with but after you played them a few times for rp or cash the boredom kicks in. The one dlc that doesn't require too much of a grind to start is the heists dlc and those heists are without doubt worth your time.For 30 bucks this game is definitely worth it even after all this time. The singleplayer on it's own is absolutly incredible and the multiplayer is fun with friends. Though it does suffer from hackers.,Grand Theft Auto V

Yes it has its flaws and yes I would've liked to see some things done differently but it's still one of the most solid GTA games ever made in my opinion (don't cry San Andreas you'll always be my favorite baby). The thousands of mods available will make sure there's always something new to do in case you ever get bored of the vanilla game. Props to the developers on delivering this to us gamers!OnlineUnfortunately a lot less great. Don't get me wrong it can still be fun. In fact I used to enjoy playing online a lot. Heists and all that were great and just free roaming in the world was fun most of the time. For me this all turned around the moment the update with the big expensive ship was released. From there on I felt as if the most fun things were getting locked behind such a high price tag that you'd have to grind hours upon hours to get the money for it. This is not at all what GTA is about in my opinion. I do support having to earn money to buy things but as it stands today it's all way to much of a grind.Another unfortunate thing is that there are still a lot of ""modders"" to this day. On the one side you've got your fair player grinding away to unlock stuff. On the other you've got modders spawning everything they want in a matter of seconds and if they want can really annoy other players.A third thing is the shark cards you can buy with real money. Apart from the fact that I totally despise this business practice the prices are so outrageous that I'm just not going to waste any more time on this matter.So...I originally thumbed down the game because I felt the devs went the wrong direction with the online part which to me is a very big aspect of the game. However the game is still worth its money to those who mostly care about singleplayer. I figured it would be fair enough to thumb up for the good but with a mention of the bad.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-22,0,0,247,False,Recommended,As has been the case since 2001 Rockstar has created a large beautiful and rich open world full of surprises and fun activities to take part in. And once again accompanying this world is an even richer action packed thriller of a story full of amazingly written and acted characters.As well as providing the usual singleplayer treatment Rockstar have provided a massive in depth multiplayer experience letting players work with and against each other in the construction of their own criminal empires. The only major complaint I have with Grand Theft Auto V is the major inflation introduced to the Online economy thanks to Take Two Interactive's greedy reign making the journey to any significant purchase a very long tedious grind. Thankfully Rockstar know how fun works so the grind is still fun enough to stay engaging.,Grand Theft Auto V

For this title in particular I really wish they left the shark cards and other monetization out of it but everything is acheivable with some work put in. That and smashing your friend's cars with a hatchet has never been so fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-23,0,0,162,False,Recommended,Very interesting after 51hours of playing. I m really addicted to it. You should try it when it s on sale especially when you have friends. Encountered modders or cheaters sometimes but just don t let them ruin your game enjoying cause you can simply change to another session when they try to destroy your day. Hope I d never meet any kinds of money dropping in the future! Strongly recommend to you!,Grand Theft Auto V
