2017-05-04,0,0,162,False,Recommended,"*NOTE* Be warned it's not to a game ruining extent but there is an unfortunetaly large amount of people cheating in this game. Watch your death cam and you will see people shoot you through rocks and other solid objects land headshots while firing five yards to your left move and spin to headshot you inhumanly fast while in a firefight with someone else and much more. It happens seldom enough that I still enjoy the game but it can be very frustrating to fight your way to third place over fifteen minutes or more only to be instantly taken out by someone using cheats. I don't mind loosing to a skilled oponent but loosing to someone using a program or the like to cheat leaves a sour taste in my mouth.*EDIT 3* Alright so I feel comfortable recomending this game again now. Is it perfect? Absolutly not and keep in mind that while it is running well for me now I am still intermitently experiencing issues as are many of those I play with. This game REALLY needs better optimisation There are many better looking multiplayer games that I can play on the highest settings where as this game starts to break for me when I try to boost things abose medium and only runs consistantly smoothly is I drop things like shadows down to very low. However it is leaps and bounds better than the orrigional 1.0 release which was broken and buggy as well and they are consistantly patching the game I just wish they focused more on optimization and less on adding vehicles such as the van that or weapons like the repeater rifle and tommy gun that mechanicly don't add much to the game as they are not superior in any way really to the already existing arsenle. There is a lot of work to go but it is honestly fun and especially a blast with a crew of friends to play with. Just keep in mind before you buy it that I would only recomend it if you have a relitively powerful gpu and pc as a whole and a solid internet speed with a consistant conection.*EDIT 2* So we have the official full release. Yay. Servers are broken games load in while all you can see is the loading screan (but don't wory you can hear yourself die) all career progress and stats have been deleated and if you DO manage to get it working long enough to get into a match and actually play enjoy dropping through the ground/clipping into areas you can't get out of/having cars clip into walls and explode/having cars clip through the ground (though that one can be fun when you pop back out and are catapulted across the map)/people swiming through the air/furnature popping in in the same space where you are and insta killing you/and much much more buggy ""fun"". How about fixing a game before spending your resources trying to port it eh? Or at least try and get stable servers set up... I loved this game when it was working and I really want to give it a good review and recomend it but in this state I can not. Wait until they have fixed his mess of a release at the very least. At this point this game feels like were back in the early 90's when pc gaming was one part buying a game to five parts crossing your fingers and praying to the pc gods that it worked.*EDIT 1* So here is the thing.. I stand by what I said before about how fun this game is but in all honesty the broken state it is still in is really not okay. This is getting a full xbone release?? If it's not broken there cool glad for them but either it is broken as hell for them too or else it is complete bs that they haven't taken the time to fix the pc version (you know the whole reason they could afford to port the damn game) and did for the xbone. Sometimes the game just crashes and breaks my whole computer. In about 1/5th of my matches buildings take at least 3 minutes to load in which either ends with me unable to get in and being shot or clipping into a wall and getting shot. This game should be a blast and one of my favorite games but I have to change my review to negative simply because the state it is still in is really unaxceptable and I can't recomend a game to people when I can't honestly tell them if it'll work half the time for them or not even on a great modern pc. I'll change this back to a posative review once I see something actually happening about these problems. Until then I would say if you have waited this long to pick up the game wait a bit longer and see if it gets fixed with the full release. I doubt it will but we can hope...*ORIGIONAL REVIEW* Lol so here's the thing. This genre of game? Not really my thing. This game? A bit janky feeling sometimes tbh. This progression system? Slow AF (at least it is untill you get good haha I've still never made it past being the 3rd person alive so never having won a game I don't get that many points). And yet.... This game is honestly just a blast to play and I'm not sure why. Every round leaves me saying just one more and playing it with two or three friends is an amazing time. I'm sure that over time this game will get more polished and better optimized and all that good stuff but even as it is now and even if it seems interesting but you aren't sure it'll be your thing it's still worth trying out. You can get a lot of hours of fun out of this especially with some friends and some beers.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,56,True,Recommended,For what little time I've had playing it its blown me away with its supreme quality. It doesn't seem to take any shortcuts. It knows what it wants to be A Battle Royal game. It pulls this off fantastically. Though the price is high I think it is worth it for the quality of product delivered if you have any concerns about that. Please realize you're buying this for 30 you're getting something very niche it is fully worth the price. It feels AAA to spite the slight graphic bugs.If you liked h1z1's battle royal mode but hated the devs / bugs this game is perfect for you.If you like competitive games this game is for youIf you want head to head pvp combat in short bursts in a competitve enviroment this game is for you.I have only great things to say. I'm sure the only issues (the slight graphical errors in textures) will be sorted out.Worth a buy even for 30$. A MUST buy on sale.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However this game has potential to be awesome if you compare it to H1Z1 KOTK you'd be giving this a thumbs up too. The game is beautiful has a variety of weapons and vehicles weather it has everything dude. It runs choppy for my $1K gaming build to be honest but that is expected because it's not well optimized yet. If you're coming from KOTK expect slow movement and a new way of combat...The only reason I am not avoiding this game is because I know some day it'll be amazing I am very glad to have participated in the early access! **DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A LOWER END COMPUTER JUST PLAY H1Z1 KOTK FOR NOW UNTIL IT'S OPTIMIZED!!**,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-05,0,0,56,True,Recommended,After feeling an urge for a PvP shooter that had a different feel than the Overwatches the Counter Strikes and whatnot I discovered this game through seeing a friend playing it. I always felt the battle Royal game mode was somewhat born from DayZ and H1Z1 at least the way most people play those games Gear up quick and kill anything that moves. Sadly DayZ's shooting mechanics (and the rest of the game for that matter) remain half baked at best. Thus the Battle Royal mode was born.I eyed KotK originally wondering what the difference between it and PUBG was. After seeing the more methodical pace of PUBG without the absolute strict adherance to realism I felt I found the game I wanted to play.This is not a game to go into expecting to win or expecting to rack up as many kills as possible. My personal best is 12 with my first (and as of writing this only) win. The real joy is learning to think on your feet learning to be more tactical in your movements and engagements and the feeling of elation when you come out of an encounter on top.If you like the idea of what essentially is a deathmatch on a massive map where it's just as important to sit and observe as it is to frantically move around to avoid getting shot and that unique feeling you get when it's down to you and a handful of other heavilly armed players in a field looking to be the last man standing then this is the game for you.Thigs to note As of writing the game is in early access. Crashes are somewhat common. However the dev team has thus far proven to be very proactice on patches that improve stability performance and playability. Bonus that they prioritize such over just blindly adding content. Thankfully there are no microtransactions or paid lootboxs while the game is in early access. The devs have stated they will include them but not until they have left Early Access. Individual matches can run upwards of 30 35 minutes depending on how you play. I would HIGHLY recommend playing with a good headset. It will save you more times than you can imagine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-05,0,0,91,True,Recommended,"PUBG The Review.At first glance the game does not appear to pack $30 of content. One map the norm face editor upon first launch and a UI that may confuse some.But Content is not where the value is (at this time). Given some credit as an early access title the value is purely the experience.As my first multiplayer ""Battle Royal"" that I've had interest in PUBG takes whatever style you play by and turn into a primal survival instinct forcing to adapt in the process. How your skill develops is dynamic you must truly adapt to survive. Whether to move around or sit still to engage another player or not to engage or whether to stalk another opponent or lure them to you... All while trying to stay in bounds of the shrinking safe zone.Contemplating on buying? Look at 2 or three youtube videos. Thats what I did and now I own it. I truly hope it maintains momentum and that dev's with their newfound fortunes can make this a true masterpiece at final release!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-05,0,0,197,True,Recommended,Product received for free. so far i have many matches and wins under my belt and i can easily say that this game has become a contender for one of my favorite games. coming from having around 900 hours on arma 3 to this i am very happy that the control scheme is very similar. im running on a FX 6300 and GTX 1070sc and i average about 90 fps in game so thats another plus. my only real complaints about the game are as follows UNSTABLEin my experience this game is extremely unstable. it tends to crash to the point where i must hard reset the PC. (early access blah blah blah) HITBOXESi have found that ADS with particular guns such as handgun is entirely bugged and your rounds will not go where you are aming SOUNDmy last issue is that Plane/Wind tend to be overpowering to the point where i cant hear either my teammates or anything else around me.

2017-04-05,0,0,580,True,Recommended,"(EDIT SECTION)(THE BAD Somewhere along the way this game got raided by the general ry that enjoys breaking games with hacks. I have a large dislike for people who enjoy destroying great games with buffoonery that should be the domain of those who find single player games too challenging. I have hopes that Bluehole will find a way to stop these people but hold little hope do to number of people dedicated to perverse methods of fun. THE GOOD Since buying the game months ago I have put hundreds of hours into this game and I will continue to play it. The amount of enjoyment I get out of this game is not ruined by the people who choose to abuse the loopholes. Since the beginning I have seen consistent improvements in how the game runs on my PC. And while there are still incidents that are frustrating the generally happen early and if you die you can restart with the loss of minutes. New guns and continued developer involvement give me hope that we might one day see a full game that continues to have support. THE FUTURE Like all opinionated people on the internet I have desires of where I would like to see things go to. The possibility to of a rough ranking system for matches seems like a good place to start. this could help keep us middling skilled players from being matched with cheaters who regularly score well do to there ill gotten advantages and put them in the realm of the more skilled and streamers who have more abilities to identify and end these players involvement in the game. Any method to permanently ban proven hackers accounts can only add to the bank for BlueHole as these people will most likely continue to buy new copies of the game in order to have their ""Fun"" or perhaps they might just move on to a new title. Every other thing I would currently like to see in the game appears to be coming in the new update that is currently on test servers.)(END EDIT)I loved the idea of Battle Royale games since the first day I saw h1z1. So I bought it. But for gods sake I am a fairly old school first person and third person shooter but I couldn't get a kill on that game to save my life and just could not get into it. Yet I loved the idea of the game style. Fast forward a few months and I watched a couple of streamers playing this game and I rather liked what I saw. So I took the risk that I would not like it and bought into the early access.This is one of the few games that engaged me to such a degree that I would continue to jump out of my seat when I was shot fifty hours in. It sucked me in and left me wanting more. I can't put my finger on the reasons why I liked it so much. But in my reckoning it beat h1z1 kotk largely do to the engine attachments and hitboxes. The driving in the game is very manageable and the transition from third to first person is seamless. I am not great at this game but I usually manage some kills and top thirty or better. Its just fun as hell. Now this is not Call of Duty. You do something stupid you game instance is over. Kaput. You do everything pretty well but some guy third person scouts you through one of a hundred windows and your dead. Kaput over for that instance. That though is part of the beauty of the game. Each time you queue for a game in solo you have a 1 in 96 100 chance of winning. Everyone else is a loser. The game for me broke after about 44 hours. By broke I mean the servers where dropping so many packets so frequently that things would go nutty as all get out. On my screen I would be moving the right direction on my roommates computer sitting right next to me I would be moving into the shock field. I would approach an enemy and pop a few round into them and then die because the server read he killed me yet he never fired a round on my screen. Despite this break which is currently supposed to be fixed I am waiting on confirmation it was one of the best games I have played as far as engagement for me personally since james bond golden eye. I would totally recommend you pick this game up if they fix the server packet dropping problem and you don't mind spending fifteen minutes walking around and then dying without ever seeing who kills you.Pulled from PUBG website ""We are very aware of the issues you have seen on our servers over the last week and we have been working hard to resolve them. Simply put this is not any issue with the number of servers we have for players but rather it is down to the optimization of the server code. Over the last week we rolled out daily updated to the servers to improve profiling of optimization bottlenecks and yesterday these actions finally paid off! We found a bug within the Unreal Engine core code which led the server to believe that it was being DDoS ed due to the number of packets being sent between the clients and the server. When this detection was triggered on the server it would drop 90% of packets received resulting in the lag/rubberbanding seen over the past week. We pushed a hotfix to the servers earlier today which should resolve these issues. We will continue to push daily updates to the servers to further improve both stability and performance.""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-06,0,0,105,True,Recommended,This game is overrated addictive and unfair..Yet has its moments of being fun. Full of hackers even though they said they are on the look out for them last ones alive can sometimes shoot through walls somehow know exactly where you are even though you are hiding somehow do extreme amounts of damage even though you have high level defensive equipment. without a kill cam its pretty depressing getting shot from incredibly far away and not able to escape or know what direction your getting shot at. Bluehole buffed zone damage which is fine but the speed that it moves can be way too fast for running or swimming removes any fun in the game when people are camping a bridge and theres no boat. Loot system is unfair can be very unrewarding when getting multiples. these are most of my complaints.otherwise it can be fun when playing with a full squad or a friend. Raiding houses finding gear and going out as a group can feel satisfying even if you don't always win. At this moment in time maybe an 7.5/10 but it feels generous. Awaiting new content but honestly they should focus more on hackers too.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-16,0,0,245,True,Recommended,i recommend this game to anyone who wants some action filled fun. its an addicting game that makes you come back for more.til now the game is pretty stable but with some frustrating glitches whom can end your match.cars for example are unstable if you crash into another car they might glitch into each other and blow up or if you hide under a tractor you might get stuck. nevertheless the game is so fun you'll have so much fun that the glitches won't really matter. ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The other 25% are ""perfect"" no lag... in fact... there is always lags u began a game you don't lag and when u're almost 50 to 30 it begins to lag like if a pig was eating ur fiber. I understand that that's an ""Alpha"" but... They care more about the weapons in the game than in the game himself.But don't care every call of duty player is playing in low to ""see people which are on the ground"" So you don't need eyes anymore cause everybody want to kill and only that they don't care about The Last Man Standing they want to have more and more kills they'll camp outside of the safezone until their death they'll rush you at the beginning of the game even if u're running away like at 1 mile...The game is good as always but when I speak with people it's like that (Them) I killed 20 guys in a match ! (Me) Which rank ? (Them) Hum 40/100... (Me) I was 1st by killing 5 guys... (Them) You were camping all the game ******* noob ! (Me) No I just wait the good moment to move and to shoot I'm not rushing everywhere I'm from Battlefield not Call Of Duty sry...

2017-06-04,0,0,208,True,Recommended,I have read a lot of mixed reviews on this game which had me worried for a bit but the gameplays of this just looked so much fun that I risked it. I have at best a mid range pc (more lower end of mid) and literally the worst adsl package available in South Africa. The fact that this game is multiplayer only had me even more worried as I waited for it to download.The game is awesome. Performance wise it works great but I did set some settings to low (on the advice of the youtubes) supposedly doing that makes you die less because you can see better (negative on the less death). Playing online is a pleasure even on my line. I'm sure people have their reasons to dislike the game and I'm sure much of it is valid. For me this is this is just too fun. I die often and most of the time i don't even know how but I'm getting the hang of it.The lobbies are always ready to go and I have never waited for a game.The ONLY issue I can report is the time it takes from game ending to being in a new game. I don't think that's down to the game too much rather my slow line and the fact that I die QUICK.All in all in the opinion of this nobody... 10 / 10 mopani worms.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-30,0,0,299,True,Recommended,This game is extremly intense but its great overall experience! Coming over from H1Z1 King of the Kill I feel this game is a little more finessed! Not knocking KOK at all because I love it too but this game feels a little more tactical and I love the game mechanics like adding attachments to your weapons and gear which lacks in KOK. Because of that alone I feel that one had a slight advantage if they can get good gear and optimal possition on other players. I hate to be that guy that compares the two games. KOK is a lot more faster pace but PUBG has a good balance too. There are some minor glitches but they can be fixed. Like game crashes here and there and main menu bugs. Also the player zone is harsh toward the end. They need to bring that downa noch but I guess that just me. These are just some minor grips that don't shouldn't take away from the overall greatness of this game. I have to play this game daily just to get my fix!! Its downright addicting! I highly recommend it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-30,0,0,2856,True,Recommended,One of the interesting games i ever played so far.Even it's early access the game is more then playable. Hopefully they will work more on optimizations of the game but so far is more then fine.Devs keep up with good job.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-30,0,0,188,True,Recommended,I love this game yea it has its bugs but that is to be expected considering it is an Early Access Game. I have put in many hours as you can see and I enjoy this game very much. The game really is about surviving and not just killing. It feels great to get to the top 10 of 100 and winning the whole game feels even greater. There is not that many bugs little things here and there but nothing that will take you away from the experience. It is worth the 29.99 you will get your money worth. I also reccommend playing with friends because that just makes the game so much more fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Combat is balanced (*cough* except shotguns *cough*) and the map size is great thanks to the shrinking boarder.

2017-06-06,0,0,156,True,Recommended,this game is a much better uptated version of king of the kill. I personally am all about this game because of the more realistic recoil fetures that happen with movent unlike KoK which is just a bunny hop fest spray and prey. Also this game puts you into a true first person view if you want the best accuracy. Also devs seems to be listening to the community and not just making this a cash grab.Also I have a gtx 1090 with an i7 4.2 GHz with 32 gigs of ram. Game runs liquid.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-12,0,0,808,True,Recommended,This is a great game!!! I highly recommend if you played H1Z1 King of the Kill or Arma Battle Royal. Those 2 just had a baby and named it PUBGrawl. However you must take the time to adjust alot a settings and tweak things or you may find yourself very unhappy. Their is a learning curve for your first couple of adjustment matches and you will start having fun. The game may feel laggy at first but its not... Its your sensitivity settings. Find them Fix them fast. I recommend 70 for General 60 Vechicle and 40 for guns. Rebind keys to what you are use to asap. Get a friend and go DOU's! I find that DOU matches are optimal for me. You have to have team work for Squad and solo can be fun but honestly unless you download your skill you wont see number 1. Please spare yourself the I was killed by another hack line and go watch some tips and tricks videos before you know it the next noob will be saying that about you. Anyone hacking in this game will get caught its only a matter of time and they will be spending over a $100 a month to be the best... Either way they will lose. Thanks Battleye!!! You can take down a hack easily just watch videos on positioning and camp them out. Figure out fast where the center of the shrink is and get there before the other guys. Pitch a tent and colllect the rent before you know it youll be in the top 10. If you get a buddy and learn to commuicate and you will be top 10 in dous almost everytime. Shoot Move and Communicate!One last thing... Dont jump from a moving vehicle.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-12,0,0,141,True,Recommended,Think arm3 br dumbed down instead of h1z1 with intelligence. Plays on unreal engine not optimized to the best but not even close to most other games at beta/open development. Game has higher bullet drop at longer ranged you can tell when shooting with a 4x scope. You find lobbies fast the lobbies are pretty toxic like most anonymous open mic lobbies. Overall game is really good for being out for so little time and can only get better has weekly updates.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-12,0,0,1,True,Recommended,Great game awesome idea... just needs optimization.My PC can play games like GTA V Ark and Arma 3 easily but one step into a town on this game and the lag gets too sticky it freezes for 5 seconds at a time.

2017-12-06,0,0,1512,True,Recommended,"I wanted to get this game a month after it came out but the reviews on this game were very negative and some were very possitive. I stuck to the negative because at the time I also couldn't spend a dime because I was on a strick budget. So I did not get it. Foward to November I started watching some streamers play PUBG and it looked amazing to me and every bad review I saw before went out of my head. I bought the game and started playing right away. It is an amazing game for being an ""EARLY ACCESS GAME"". I have played it for about 50 hours and the expirience is always different and always challenging. In every round I have played I would have to play it differently. I have only gottent 1st place once and it felt amazing. I have gotten top 10 a couple of times and it is still an amaizing feeling as well as an adrenaline rush to get to the top 10 circle. I wish I would of gotten this game sooner. I have not seen any glitches and I have not lagged at all in any of my games. It has been a very smooth experience for me.The only thing that gets a little devistating is the crates. It takes a little while to get the free once and I am not planning to get the PAID boxes. Don't spend your money on that.

2017-07-10,0,0,36,True,Recommended,S'all good man. This game is the type of game where you get frustrated but you cant stop playing. The tension really gets high when the last 20 are alive and you know that you could make it. But alas somebody was hiding in a bush or something and jumped you out of nowhere. So you go into the match again determined to flush out the bloody campers before you become a camper yourself.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-10,0,0,372,True,Recommended,Worst part about the game is when you get sniped from across a field with no chance of survival or when your getting lit up with a silenced weapon however its a blast when your behind the gun. Brilliant game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-10,0,0,479,True,Recommended,I would highly Recomend this game now I may only have a little amount of hours on this game but I would gladly purchase this again if I had to. It's a fast paced battle a fight for survival now it can get frustrating when you die at the start or if you die near the end but overall a fun game. Scavenging for weapons with your friends and killing people (it's better with friends) and trying to avoid that dam blue circle also while your loading and waiting for the game to start you can test weapons out and also listen to the idiototic ramblings of other players overall 9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-11,0,0,1472,True,Recommended,I do not write game reviews. However in this case I will make an exception! I have played online games for years! The first being Ultima Online. I have played all the shooters COD Battlefield etc. But I have to say the Player Unknown is the BEST and most tense game I have ever played! Not just a run a shoot it requires skill stratagy common sense and instant planning! In a nutshell without them saying it it is The Hunger Games with an upgrade to weapons! You may play an entire round and not fire a shot until the end! You must gather weapons and supplies as you struggle to stay inside and ever shrinking area. This game is very addictive! 5 Stars from me!!UHS FireCapt,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-11,0,0,60,True,Recommended,It's simple. Playerunknown's Battlegrounds offers an exceptionally tense yet fun experience.Right from the get go you jump from a plane fighting for the best landing areas and hoping that nobody lands close to you.As soon as you land it's a mad scramble to get a gun and armour before anyone else can. Fail at this and you're deader than dead.Once you've got yourself a gun and some armour you've got 2 choices. Run further into the combat zone and try to find a good position to take everyone else out or hide and hope nobody finds you.Running into the combat zone is a good idea if you're looking to get higher tier loot but others will have the same idea. This strategy is a high risk high reward strategy if pulled off correctly. Fail to do so and you will be punished heavily by people with better guns.Hiding works well but can be quite boring for the most part. You will occasionally get people skulking around and trying to scavenge left overs which can lead to a tense stand off. If you have a better gun and faster reflexes you win. If not you're getting shot to bits in a corner while crying.You can't hide for the whole game however as the dreaded blue (death zone) circle closes in and the white (combat zone) circle shrinks and relocates forcing you to move or die.Red (explosion) zones can force you out of hiding spots unless you're in a building. As the game progresses the blue zone moves faster and gives you less time to get into the white zone and the white zone shrinks in size forcing players into a smaller kill zone. The most tense part of the game is when it gets to 2 players in a tiny white zone and it all comes down to who is the fastest on the draw.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-11,0,0,282,True,Recommended,"So I Jump into a solo game on the SEA server. Once I go over a probable car spawn point i dive straight down. Thankfully I get to a car before this other dude and then make an effort to run him over. I failed. So I stopped and decided to offer him a ride. Take note that I had muted voice chat so I couldn't hear a word he was saying. As we were driving liesurely towards the first circle we happened on a crate. Coast was clear so I stopped by it. Instead of making a break for the crate I stay in the car and let this dude go for it. It was the ultimate form of trust. This man this nameless man in his undies now had the power to take the life of someone who only a minute before tried to kill him. He began reloading. ""Don't you do it! Don't you do it!"" I shouted to my screen. He finished reloading his tommygun...And ran back to the passenger's seat. At that moment I knew this was gonna be a fun match.We spent the next two circles looting and shooting the item that we wanted each other to take watching each other's backs as we looted two more buildings. As we were driving up to the ruins we were ambushed by a lone gunman expecting only one passenger and easy pickings. Big mistake. Undies man returned fire nearly killing ambush dude who runs for cover. ""He sure wasn't expecting that!"" I cuckled. Sadly we never made it to our destination. We were ambushed by another. Dropping me first and my friend right after. There were 45 people left. We never got each other's names. The dude probably din't speak english anyway. But for the rest of my days I will always remember that nameless undies man who I tried to kill at first. He returned my trust despite past misgivings. We put our differences aside for the greater good that chicken dinner. He was my friend.10/10 Would try to run over someone only to make an unexpected ally on solo again.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-27,0,0,251,True,Recommended,After 152 hours I have made a conclusion about Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.The game is great. The thrill variety playerbase (sometimes) is great. Yes the optimization for the game is not good I find that I get a late start because I have to wait for my game to load but it is pretty minor. The game crashes sometimes but that comes with a game in Early Access which I have to say for a game in early access this game is a monster. Already creating records in several different aspects of the game. The gunplay is great too. At many times you feel like you are at a disadvantage but I find PUBG very fair besides third person sometimes but that's a whole different story. I also feel like some people you meet in this game are very nice. They seem toxic when youre playing solos but if you Solo Queue in duos many of them are nice. I know this review was all over the place but thanks for reading and I would reccommend this game to you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Very poor optimization developers took time to port this over to the Xbox One before finishing or at least optimizing their game. I should NOT be getting FPS drops and anything below 60 on Medium settings. Added paid crates when the developer promised there wouldn't be any until the game has reached it's completion and full release. Mentioned ""taking further action"" against Fortnites developers for their ""Battle Royal"" mode. And it is STILL full of numerous bugs. Ads in game if you are connecting from China (I myself do not but still scummy they do so). The servers are terrible as well there is NO reason for the servers to be laggy and as bad as they are. The game was fun with friends for a good while before becoming plain frustrating and could be a great game overall if Bluehole wasn't a terrible company.

Thus having to jump 3 stories down into a courtyard/hide for 10 minutes only to try and loot a body in the gym where someone tries to shoot you and dying shortly after due to poor aim when you've got the drop on some poor bastard in the hallway.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-08,0,0,193,True,Not Recommended,"Overall I like the direction that this game is going and I want to see the devs prosper. But I just do not enjoy playing this game for more than 15 minutes at a time. Most of my time playing feels forced with friends and even then I find myself tab out in a corner waiting for action or my team to move.PROS The game is easy to pickup. The devs care about the game and want to see it succeed. Reasonably priced. More content to be expected down the road.I feel like I have to explain the cons because they are some of my big gripes in why I don't enjoy this game.#1 The game is extremely slowI understand that it is a big world and players are expected to run from point A to point B but honestly I feel as if I am wasting my time. I spend most of my time walking around trying to get to the safe zone and in the end get shot by someone I never see. In solos I feel as if this is worse becuase it seems like I am the only one getting shot at and no one else is having to deal with the same issue. The only fun is at the very beginning and the very end of the game where there is the most action.#2 The gasGas camping is rampent especially towards the end. Getting shot by people who are in the gas on 5th gas is the worst. I guess this is just me wanting the devs to make the gas more damaging or RESTRICT VISION TO THOSE IN IT. The amount of times I was killed in the end by people in the gas has me off to uninstall the game for some time before reinstalling it to play with friends again. I just feel like players in the gas need to be punished and right now there is no punishment for sitting in the gas.#3 Weapons/attachmentsWhile the line up of weapons are perfectly fine and I am ok with them adding new ones. I cannot help but bring up the issue that it seems like the devs just want to put more weapons in the crates instead of spawning them in the world. If the main arguing point is that the weapons would be too overpowered then that is BS since they can easily balance these weapons and give them specific roles instead of having them be OP and restricted to crates. Another issue is the spawns. The amount of times I have found no guns after searching 6 to 10 house has seemed to increase. The inconsistancy in weapon spawns is enough to give me a headache and just leave the game and never play it for the rest of the day.#4 3rd personI know it is the big selling point of this game but let's be honest third person shooters promote the worst type of gameplay. There is nothing fun or enjoyable about someone being able to see you on the other side of a wall. It makes breaching houses a nightmare (or just walking by a building) knowning that someone got the advantage over you by abusing the 3rd person camera mechanic. This alone makes me not want to play but I have been playing more since the first person mode has been released. Just to clarify some of the hate on the 3rd person aspect of the game I generally play FPS games and understand the problems with 3rd person games.#5 ServersI know the devs are working on fixing these types of issues because they are important to address and take care of. But The amount of inconsitancy in firefights is abhorent that I have to add this in.#6 The game is boringLike I stated earlier I find my self playing this game tabbed out more than anything else. If my team is running somewhere I will just autorun and tab out. If we are driving I am never the one driving I just tab out and do something more interesting as a result. I think most of this comes from feeling forced to play the game but the overall mid game is just boring. There is nothing exciting that really goes on and many of my games are spent trying to move to the circle with little to no action. Smaller maps increasing player counts or making the games shorter will fix the waiting issue. The ARMA style gun play is another issue that makes gun fights later on very slow and tedious. Couple that with 3rd person and you have some of the worst gun play ever. Slow unsatisfying and BS. #7 Early access?!?This one is more of a personal rant but I absolutely hate when devs advertise their games as ""early access"". I feel like when people see this they should be wary that they will be paying for a full priced fully developed game that will be recieving fixes along the way. I just have to bring this up because I am tired of people defending these types of games that are obviously not early access. DayZ is a big one that advertised as early access and hid behind that to explain every problem. All I have to say is any game you can buy and not be a streamer or actual game critic then it is not early access it is a full release and I will treat it like a full release because that is what it is. I hope that if you do not own the game that you do take caution into buying it and make sure that you will actually enjoy it first. As for the community of this game I guess I can say that it is the same H1Z1 community that left that dying platform for this one.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My suggestion If you are a good FPS gamer then don't buy it because you are definitely a cheater under the publisher's view then the 30 bucks gone! This game casually bans players' account. I was pulled in this game by my friends last Friday I tried to block the bridge and killed 9 people then I received a message saying I I permanently banned.Two of my friends have encountered the same situation after they succeed to block a bridge in different rounds.I doubt the game publisher did not checks want players data were anomalies and even do not understand how to figure out who is a cheater and who is not maybe its benchmark to define a cheater is simply how many reports by other players this account Yeah many guys were finished by me on the bridge I believed those birds reported me due to anger then the PUBG Corporation sacrificed me and my money to dispel its dads' anger.To be honest it's a huge honor to me that the publisher treats me my tactics and accuracy like a cheater unfairly. But in my opinion the game publisher and manager are the biggest cheaters I do not think my friends and me were the only three victims under the publisher's chaos management.This game was launched almost one year but the environment of gaming is continuing to become worse and ""PUBG Corporation"" did nothing to change and improve the environment. they just ban anyone in this game if they want to and makes some players who are indulging in this game pay another 30 bucks.

I realize that immediately disqualifies my opinion for some.Secondly let me say that I'm not entirely sold on Last Man Standing or Battle Royale as is the popular tag now. But it's definitely addictive and begs for that ""just one more turn"". That being said I think there's a very good game here. It's simply buried in a lot of technical issues apparent hackers (I reported someone) and frankly less than stellar graphics. This game may bring your PC to it's knees but it's not because it's pretty. It's very drap and reminds me of Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl (which frankly looked better). The draw distance which is critically important with maps this large is kind of a joke. The vehicle mechanics are wonky at best. There is enough ""flashing"" going on with the graphics especially the interiors to make a Non epileptic have a seizure. This would all be acceptable if this were a mod to an existing game. Or if this game were still in beta. It doesn't seem acceptable that you have to pay for this mess even $30 is steep. I'd pay half that in it's current state. I may keep tabs on this one to see if it improves if the developer abandons it or worst of all if it becomes a DLC nightmare. For now I have gotten a refund.

2017-11-30,0,0,577,True,Recommended,"Guess I should review this game... I have a love hate relationship with this game. I love it when I win get close to winning or even when I get more than 3 kills in a match. Other times I hate it because of ""Network lag detected"" hackers or simply the desync between players.The desync between players is marginal doesn't happen all the time but you'll know it when it happens. Hackers... (As I've found) are mainly on the NA servers so I just play EU and I haven't ran into a single one yet (Jinx). Network lag detected is usually server wide so all the players in the server typically experience it unless you're having serious packet loss then it'll just be you in which case you should probably find a single player game to play until you have more bandwidth to begin with.As for the love (Saving the best for last)... this game has it's ups and downs. It has emotion it has buildup it has climax and sometimes it's so anti climactic that it makes you want to pick up a bad habit. How many times I've had level 3 everything 200 rounds in my M4 and a 4x with a silencer and I get shot in the back by some jerk sitting in the blue zone. But that's part of the game it's a strategy. It's a bs one but it's a strategy. A lot of people in videos complain about campers or people hiding... what they don't realize is everyone has a playstyle. This game forces you to work outside your comfort zone it forces you to adapt to different players different situations and because of that I find my hands shaking sometimes after a tense confrontation or even in a nervous situation when I know people are around me and I have a Machete. The game has it's moments that make it great and those (to me) far outweigh the few unlucky games I've had with hackers lag and the unlucky loot spawns.The updates for the game are immaculate. A lot of people say you need a super high end computer to play this game. That's not true. Let me give you an example. I have an AMD FX8350 and an R9 290 4GB. Bad CPU pretty decent graphics card. When this game was first released I'm talking first week. I was getting maybe 20 to 40 fps in all areas of the map and lets not even talk about poly. (It was atrocious). After months of updates and optimization. I can now get upwards of 60 to 90 fps and that's with Re Shade! Which depending on your settings can drastically reduce your fps. While I don't agree with their minimum specs as the game becomes prettier and more optimized maybe you can play on ultra low settings with those specs. I wouldn't advise it if you want something playable though. Having played on the test server multiple times I can say that the updates are pretty thoroughly tested between the small community that's on the test servers before they are pushed to live although there's always those people who can find weaknesses or possible abuses in the system and that's why the game is in early access. To attribute for the ""inequality"" that may arise during updates. While I have a soft spot for these kinds of games since my days of an Amateur Counter Strike Source Semi Pro the thing that makes this game great aren't the graphics the unlucky loot drops the desync issues (obviously). It's the tension you feel EVERY SINGLE GAME. I get so into it I jump when I hear a shot from somewhere I didn't expect. 7.1 surround baby )This review is really long. The game though is worth it. Is it worth 30 dollars at it's current level? I've been playing since the game was first put out and I have 380 hours (Will be going up) At 10 dollars per 100 hours I'd say that's a pretty fair trade. So in conclusion if you don't mind the occasional bug if you have a halfway decent system compared to mine or better. If you have really cool friends who like to have fun and shoot the occasional baddie if you don't mind running hundreds of kilometers over the course of 10 games (Running sim 2017) then I think you'd enjoy this game. It's improved a drastic amount don't listen to the people hating on everything about the game pointing out all of its flaws acting like nothing has ever been fixed. If anyone has been around since the beginning you know how much the game servers and optimization has improved since first release. Have a wonderful day. )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Here are my main complaints and why I took a refund over waiting to see how the game pans out 1. The pace of the game is maddening. It is slow and drawn out. You walk slow. You ""run"" slow. You play slow. You loot slow. You drive slow. 2. This is not a skill or reflex based shooter. The advantage goes to the guy that pulls the trigger first. This sounds fine but with a deeper look it just isn't fun. Why because for a vast majority of players that means find a dark corner in the middle of the safe zone and sit until someone walks by. If the camper is anything other than a complete potato you have no chance to win that fight. Many refer to this as ""tactical "" but it is nothing more than a dressed up word for a camp fest. More often than not you will have one of two types of deaths. The guy in the corner that shoots first or the guy in the third story that picks you off as you speed walk across the field trying to stay if the safe zone.3. A complete lack of balance. The basis of the game dictates that the lucky looter has the best chance of winning. If a potato finds the best gun with the sick sight and level three armor in his house and you find a skillet and some super cool khaki pants what is the outcome? There is not a KoTK option where you say I will find a gun and a helmet then get to killing. The game forces you to keep looting and hoping to find the rare drops before the guy sitting in the roof of that building that you can't even see yet rips you head off with an easy shot through his 4x scope.4. The feel of the game mechanics is off. Movement feels like it has the slightest of delay. Controls and jumping are not precise. My guy especially when jogging or strafing feels like he is running on marbles. Vehicle mechanics are horrible and unresponsive.Many other reviews mention the horrible optimization and the long time between playing games so I won't go into detail. However you are paying them to be a beta tester after all and I would imagine those issues will eventually be fixed. I very much wanted this title to be my next big game. Sadly it's about as much fun as a trip to the dentist... ***",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-17,0,0,144,True,Not Recommended,Original review July 17 2017 I really enjoy this game. Unfortunately there is a lot that still needs fixed. The pre game player lobby is ridiculously obnoxious with the gun fire. The textures make the hair look terrible and the screaming from everyone is even more ridiculous. I know you can mute people but that doesn't make it any less obnoxious. One thing I don't enjoy about this that I do like on KotK is that the parachute automatically opens and then it seems to take forever to get to the ground. The airplane noises are deafeningly loud... and I'm getting really tired of blasting people in the face with a shotgun to have nothing happen to them but then I die with a pistol or something just as stupid. Also when you jump out of cars you should just get damaged even going slowly if I jump out I somehow manage to die which is totally unrealistic. There needs to be more loot in the bathrooms/bedrooms of the houses. I can't really think of anything else right now though but I enjoy this game. Can't wait until more fixes have been made. Update August 20 2017Still a lot broken in this game. But they added horns so who cares! /sarcasm... So aside from the glitchy menu and constantly having to refresh to UI I'm glad they added in the ability to rejoin a game. That is very needed. The matchmaking is pretty instant which is great. It's a great game to play with friends. Though since the last update my game has been crashing and it has never done that previously. The BP takes forever to get and then you get the most loot I've ever had in a game... like ever. Two red hats and dirty tank tops later I'm annoyed... this game is fun don't get me wrong. Just fix it. I punched a dude no exaggeration about 15 20 times and he didn't even get knocked out. He had enough time to load up a pistol and shoot me once and I'm down. That parts a little more realistic but the fact that I punched him so much and nothing happened sucks. The repetitive gas cans everywhere and lack of decent weapons is slightly annoying. SK12 shoots WAY too far as compared to the other shotguns which seem to do absolutely no damage sometimes unless the barrel of the shotgun is in their esophagus... pistols don't do enough damage. Not enough decent gun attatchments (i.e. I hardly ever find silencers for the gun I am using unless I go into the middle of a city where I ultimately end up dying because everyone else is there too.) The plane sound at the beginning is ridiculously loud as well as the dropping wind after jumping out and we should be able to turn that down if we want to since it's not something that will change the gameplay. There should also be a way to turn down public voice chat as I would love to listen to the random crap everyone is saying I just don't want to hear it screamed in my ears. It would still be nice to drop lower before the parachute opens up because it just takes soooo long to reach the ground. The damage from jumping out of cars is also ridiculously insane as even if you slow down you still end up getting knocked our and/or dying. Still no loot in certain rooms of houses and buildings. Updates are coming to fix things and they are listening but voting down because there is so much to be fixed early access or not.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-20,0,0,246,True,Recommended,PUBG is a very relaxing game where you have to create your unique character dress him in fancy clothes and meet others in a giant chat room on an island where you can choose between a small chat room of four or two or a big chatroom of 100. I usually go for the smaller more private chat rooms since I one time heard someone fart in the big chatroom also I got hired by ISIS there twice. ! One of the coolest features in the game is that you can purchase new clothes for your character out of surprise boxes which you can open for in game currency. You get this currency if you jump out of an airplane and walk your character around another bigger island where you constantly get yelled at by a russian guy and sometimes you can hear some twelve year old discuss the latest news in school with his mum while she is vacuuming right next to the microphone of the other player which is nice.I rate this game a solid 5/7 in future updates please add some more haircuts you can choose from for your character,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is better optimization.And those features that should have been from the start like vaulting / better jumping (jumping over fences was pain before). First person mode is also very nice because it changes the combat tactics drastically. 3rd person mode is still an option for those who prefer that and they have different statistic tracking.But then again... When I first tried vaulting. I ""died from falling"" after getting stuck in the vault mechanism when trying to climb over staircase railing.... I got video of it but no idea where to post it. I had a good run (Early Access review Kind of a high price compared to other alternatives.Crashes every now and then but crashes have been reduced since launch.Beginning of games with 100 players can be very laggy and everyone struggles to hit.Draw distance is problematic as you can not see tall grass from far away but players hiding there will think they are hidden in the grass.But I still like the game.

Hopefully now that its technically 'released' the devs will put the time needed to prevent cheating. If anyone is skeptical of whether or not cheating is exagerated then look it up. Outside of that the game is absolutely amazing and a blast to play!Early Access ReviewIt seems like most early access games I take part in I find the games swarmed with cheaters. I have not seen any as of now nor have I been reading about there being any. So far the game is extremely fun and you can enjoy it the way you want to. You can play solo with a teammate or a team of 4. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a shooter.

This is still an early access game and they're about to launch a new update on the test server which is part 2 of (i assume) a 3 part saga until we finally get the 1.0 update on the game itself along with console versions. People make the game seem absolutely unplayable but I've got a few wins this week so I do not believe it is unplayable.

2017-11-21,0,0,380,True,Recommended,"Simple yet intriguing. Each game is consistant but different from the next. As of this review there is only one map. You start in a plane flying on a random course over the island. At a certain point the door opens and you are free to jump out at any point. The fight has begun. The conventional beginning period is for gathering supplies and weapons. I say conventionally because in this game you are on a pretty open canvas. You might grab a shotgun and go on a rampage or lay low until you have armor and a weapon. But get used to absolutely nothing as seemingly everything apart from the map is random so a great deal of luck is involved. This can be very frustating. I could be playing it safe and minding my own buisness in with great gear and the ""red zone"" (a random event were a specific area of the map gets glassed) starts. I've been in games were the red zone has consistantly been over me four times in a row. Needless to say I didn't survive. That's the thing with the game you build your tower so high and the higher it is the harder it falls. In a solo game it's you verses literally everything with your only ally the weapons on your person. It's hard but you know it and every time you die you are reminded of it.But you are tired of being thrown down by the world. So you decided to be thrown down in a group. Pubg also features a duo and squad (four man) system. But there appears to be one issue with this. Your ""allies"". If you just came from a community like Counter Strike's then you will likely be disapointed by the pubg community. Not to say everyone is toxic because not everyone is. Just how do I say it? No ones makes callouts despite having a mic. Your team games will likely be pretty silent. Not that it is nessicarily bad thing but to me coming straight from CS I have to admit we could all improve. Another note even if you select your region you aren't garunteed to be paired with those from said region. All I have to say is I always pick the NA (North American) option but every 1/3 games it seems like someone who belongs on the asian servers are there. It doesn't make much of a difference to me where they're from but 9/10 times I'm paired with someone from a different region they can't speak English (or Spanish) very well or at all. Don't be discouraged though as long as you pull your weight and try to lend a helping hand when you can you will be ok.My verdict despite all the bashing I've done the game is wonderfully fun I would recomend it to anyone considering purchasing it.

2018-07-22,0,0,191,False,Not Recommended,To be fair i do enjoy the game from time to time even with its current issues. The only reason i'm not recommending it is because i think at the current price ($29.99) its not worth it. I bought on sale ($19.99) and didn't regret the purchase.IMO I enjoy the mobile version of PUBG way more because the details and features it has make the game way more enjoyable then the PC version. (I'm not great at either game but i can tell when more effort is put somewhere)Mobile PUBG pros/cons vs PC PUBG pros/con the loot system is is much generous with crates clothes skins points etc. (more F2P friendly) missions/rewards system actually give you something to look forward to while PC pubg doesnt have this incorporated the options of auto pickup/reload weapon modes peek modes auto chosing best health to use and being able to disable/enable all these features is a HUGE plus. (if you've ever played mobile to for awhile and then go play PC you'll see what i mean) having an actual chat where you can type (even its on a small phone is a nice feature) being able to choose which map to play on &amp auto matching not required (even though its between 2 maps currently) arcade mode (gives you 3modes to play other then just playing the regular game) I know PUBG released custom matchs open beta but they are actually looking at CHARGING people $$$ for that in the future Training grounds... totally forgot about this great feature. Allows you to try out all the weapons get your settings right and actually practice before just throwing you to the wolves.

2017-12-30,0,0,248,False,Not Recommended,The game is a meat grinder now. My past 2 nights of attempting to have fun in this game go as the following I felt like playing an fps saw pubg had a new map etc. loaded up the game perfectly got into games quickly first 2 hours I would aim for bigger towns to get more and better loot. Wouldn't have an encounter unless I did something very reckless like follow a guy into a house. Every time they went into the house and I attempted to lay a trap the guy would be able to hear my footsteps from a block away leading him to stay absolutely still for 2 5 minutes depending on how far away they were from the circle. Sometimes they never come out and i'm not about to open a door to an uzi. So an encounter doesn't happen until there's only about 14 26 people left and it's a campers game.Spend the next hour and half with the same situation reaching top 10 maybe twice with maybe 1 encounter either in the beginning of the match or towards final 10. that's like 10 minutes of walking around or fooling around trying to run someone over. 10 minutes a match with maybe a match lasting 20 minutes that's practically an hour of my game time that I spent trying to actually have fun.After realizing how boring it was to be fully looted for 20 seconds of action led me to go to player dense drop points. At this point i drop mil base and HDP etc and tonight after trying for another 2 hours to have decent action in large groups my best battle was my last one. I picked up an sks at HDP after TWO ing minutes of running through that ers mansion. JUST as I was loading the gun I got hit by an autoshotty. EVERY game before that was my pistol against an AR or at least a smg...I can't enjoy a game where a session based game allows you to be so screwed over in such a short amount of time that your best options are either put the game down or spend 15 minutes running.I've been trying for the past 6 months and the enjoyment of losing has almost run dry.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-23,0,0,268,False,Not Recommended,Just as everyone else I hate the fact they refuse to region lock China. Adding on to that you entice people to cheat by having loot boxes that you get by winning games and kills. Some of the items sell for over 1k and sure you can ban them but as soon as you do all that happens is they create a new account. All the while the corporation are just getting their pockets lined with cash. The icing on the cake though has been the recent bans of players for harrasing streamers. An innocent player just having fun and honking the horn or sometimes they kill the streamer without cheating. Next thing you know you are banned for something you didn't even realize. Trying to get the ban reversed is impossible as the developers no longer care about the players. At first the game wasn't that bad you could deal with the cheaters and still enjoy the game. Now the whole thing is so overrun by cheaters I can barely land in any area without getting shot and I can't even findout where from. With the new death cam I can see a player just shoots randomly in the air and I'm dead. Like come on this has got to a point where this game has just become a cheating gambler's playground.

2017-05-08,0,0,40,False,Not Recommended,"I see a lot of people saying that the game is ""Great"" or it would be ""Perfect"" if there were region locks in place. The game is a pile of honestly. It was an almost bearable disappointment when it was in early access but at this point whether the game is okay or not really all depends on whether you run in to people cheating whether or not you get Desperado crates that require you to pay for keys in order to open them or whether or not the game runs buttery smooth like warframe for you instead of it being a buggy mess. It would be nice to be able to choose whether or not to play with players who have pings in the hundreds but that's not important because if it was we would have that option. There isn't really anything rewarding about playing this game and anyone claiming that it's the best thing since sliced bread is in denial. The people who enjoy this game are most likely enjoying the company of their friends while cheaters one shot all of them from accross the map with a UMP.

2017-11-14,0,0,465,False,Not Recommended,Review update The old review at the bottom is still true however there are some things that must be said.I will continue to play this game as there isn't a game in the genre with the sheer volume of player base except Fortnite. After being 1.0 for some time now the early game is a fight against the server to see who picks up weapons first after 4 to 8 pick up attempts. Hits not registering is still very much a prevelent issue even mid to late game when the servers are supposedly able to perform at a higher rate.The melee weapon mechanics are so bad that most just avoid them unless it's the pan for that lucky bullet deflect. There are still videos you can find on the internet of them implementing melee executions but have not heard anything more on those in nearly a year. I can understand why if they choose to keep them the way they are there is no point because no one will use them. Hackers/cheaters are still a major issue instead of resolving the problem they just ban a particular account and the same computer/same person can just spend 30$ to get the game again. At this point it feels like the develepors are more concerned with counting their money then fixing the issues that have been a problem since day 1 beta. I truly hope i'm wrong but at this point it is starting to lean the same as H1Z1 and past game in the genre with a wonderful idea but horrible implementation. Here's to hoping that those high hopes prove to still be honored eventually. Definitely love this game.. Have very high hopes for it. At least it has already made waves for instilling the battle royale as a standard genre for years to come. The future looks bright ...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,15,True,Recommended,Every match follows the same basic premise a collection of up to 100 players are airdropped onto an island where they must scavenge weapons and supplies all while vying to be the last player alive. While both veterans and newbies will start off on even footing experienced players will quickly outmaneuver those with less experience. An inexperienced player is capable of catching someone out of place but familiarity will allow vets to orchestrate these instances more adeptly rather than relying on luck.One of the mechanics that has helped spur PUBG s growth especially as a popular game to stream is its drop in/out mechanic. As soon as you are taken out you can immediately quit back to the main menu and get a new game started in as little as one minute. This is helped by the constant flood of people who are currently playing meaning you will likely find yourself in a full game.What ensures no one player will ever have the advantage is a giant wall that closes in with decreasing intervals of time. Any player caught outside the zone takes periodic damage which will result in a death if one does return to the confines of this barrier. However some players will opt to trade health to try and catch unaware opponents from a more advantageous position that may lie just outside the barrier. This also serves as every match s primary driving force allowing games to last no longer than 30 minutes as opponents are forced to move closer and closer together increasing the chances of engagement.PUBG is responsible for creating a genre all its own adding a fresh coat of paint over the more established tactical war genre. It is also conducive to some excellent dynamic narrative as even players who get lucky and find themselves well within the confines of the zone will see other players begin to encroach on them. While some degree of skill will determine who will emerge the victor a player s initial placement what gear they find and random chance will often have as much if not more to do with being the last person standing.Because no two games will ever play out the same the streaming community has fallen in love with PUBG turning it into the most played and watched game on PC. It has become so wildly successful that PUBG frequently has more concurrent viewers and streamers than popular mainstays like DotA 2 and LoL games that have taken years to cultivate their audience. Short match and queue time has likely contributed to PUBG s spectator appeal as viewers are able to see more matches over a shorter period of time.Being an early access title the game has had a number of fixes and additions but so far the most notable has been the zombie mode that was added turning the majority of the participants into the undead removing their ability to loot and wield weapons. Another exciting addition that is now live is the inclusion of 1st person only servers adding a layer of stress and intensity that cannot be found in a 3rd person game. Future additions include a parkour mechanic that would allow players to vault over cover and dive out of windows providing fluid movement options not present in most other tactical shooters.For only $30 PUBG offers adopters a hefty package for the price tag. Although it is arguably more expensive than your conventional early access title Bluehole and Greene have promised to release the game by the end of the year meaning that you are getting what amounts to the full experience now.However PUBG is not without its flaws. It has received almost unanimous praise which can be more detrimental to the game s continued growth than had it received criticism for its failings. The false consensus effect tells us that we can experience a cognitive bias towards something and assume that everyone else shares our opinion on it. Because of this almost universal agreement that PUBG is such a good game and all the news that covers it talks about how successful it is and continues to be the game has received little in the way of criticism. While this isn t a measure of a good or bad game PUBG is a definitive example for a game that has great depth but little breadth. It succeeds greatly at the premise it presents and at this time we have only seen the game continue grow. But will the game continue to evolve and maintain its player base or is the bubble of success destined to pop as competitors arrive on the scene and offer up their own take on the battle royale formula.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-04,0,0,11,True,Recommended,First experience in Pubg Went into the game my mouse doesn't do anything. I can only run forward and strafe. Alt+Tab a couple times and it corrects itself.Jump out of plane accidentally hit F twice and pull my parachute. Can't cancel the parachute. I enjoy a scenic 17 minute decent.By the time I hit the ground 35+ people have been murdered. I find a couple of houses and loot them.I have NFI how anything in this game works including the inventory. But apparently I have a first aid kit assault rifle and shotgun.I see a house with open doors I can hear someone outside.Palms get sweaty.Let's do this.Pull out my shotty go in and check corners not on the main floor. I approach the stairs and we see each other. He fires first.I retreat down into the kitchen and he follows me to finish the job. I empty 5 rounds out of my automatic shotgun into his vicinity at about 1.5 meters.Apparently that doesn't kill someone.He retreats up the stairs and tosses a couple smoke grenades. I decide to pursue.He shoots me in the head.25/10 would be unknown again.75/2 sweaty armpits.In reality though this game is addicting and fun. It's really screwy as my system gets lower FPS on medium than it does on Ultra. The optimization is ludicrously poor. From what I've gathered the developers seem like turds that are more about the money than their game after it's insane success. I do not have high hopes for this to ever reach a state stable enough not to have poor experiences now and then. Basically my purchase of this game has supported nearly everything I hate about how this industry is ran but the game is just so GOSH DARN FUN BRO!This game will obviously be compared directly to Fortnite and after 100+ matches of Fortnite BR and half a dozen in Pubg I much prefer Pubg. This game is far more realistic and has better engagements where being smart and having a tactical advantage almost guarantees you a win. Fortnite is a lot more hectic and random. I found myself having a lot of what I would consider bull**** deaths in engagements I should have won in Fortnite. I'll still play Fortnite as it's free and has more of my friends playing it but my preference will be Pubg. If you are looking for a Battle Royale style game Pubg is definitely worth picking up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-03,0,0,1279,False,Not Recommended,Rating 3/10Of course this is an actual review so please understand the rating is a personal opinion and I will explain the reasoning behind the low rating as well as rating from 0 10.Initially as of right now I'm currently on 901 hours in game I had left a great review when I had first bought the game and reached my 100th hour. However after a short amount of time and a minor upgrade (From I5 to AMD with increase of RAM and CPU) I started running into a few issues which seem to never get patched.First lets start with the common bug AMD Processors If you're running an AMD you probably know what issue i'm talking about Yes the requiring to ALWAYS change your affinity during game or upon launch up this has been a known issue for me personally about 4 months now however i've heard others have had this issue for longer only person I know personally who has this issue was my older brother whom I game with Of course my older brother has the better computer as he upgrades as often as possible. However even he consistently crashed day after day after day of attempting to play PUBG because of the affinity bug until finding out about the supposed fix to the problem.Second The Fix PUBG button wow did they really put a fake FIX button? I'd personally love to send Bluefoal all the issues with the game however they seem to run away everytime we have a complaint about the game and why of all things name it FIX PUBG but then have it link us to a website with them 'stating' what they'll do to fix pubg when clearly on the website it has nothing we're looking for to be fixed on the list.Faster &amp Smarter match making Bluefoal are you ing stupid? We wanted region lock cause you allow players with excessively high ping to play in a country they don't live in then we either have to deal with the fact we got shot from an invisible player teleporting around or a language not native to NA.Third Event mode TPP optimization 3 times I went into event mode forced as TPP with my friend I encountered this bug If you swap to FPP while on the ground and end up dying FPP you'll respawn in FPP and be unable to move your character until swapping back to TPP or dropping on the ground.Fourth Anti cheat now this is where the jokes really begin idk how many times i've seen cheaters but man let me tell you this will never stop as of today there was a new cheat going around where players are allowed to swap from FPP to TPP during a FPP Squad match. Previously my teamate today was using it I confirmed it by watching him camera peek players while on a FPP server after reporting I went for a new match me and my squad made it to last 5 where suddenly the last player was tilt peeking and instantly sniping everyone in my team I made sure to test the player and see if he was TPP cheating I pretended to poke out but only tilted enough to have my full body behind the wall however when i had tilted without actually peeking out he started to spray directly at me each time i attempted to peek he shot directly at my head (aware it was my head because whenever i rotated to the opposite side there were bullet holes all in the same spot never straying from where i was standing).After dying to him and spectating him I noticed he was on TPP as well.Personally if you have friends to play this game with it's fun lots of action and very extensive mechanics to allow many types of playstyles however if you're a solo player or play games often alone paying for this game will only make you regret wasting your money as the community is extremely toxic and null of common sense when working as a team (You'll find players reeeeeeing in voice chat or players who are in discord unwilling to work with the rest of the squad)I enjoy playing this game however as of late this game has just been getting worse and worse and likewise with the community as I've seen more hackers and more players who aren't capable of speaking english or just start talking to teamates then kill them.As for the reasoning behind 3/10I gave it 1 point for mechanics 1 point for realism and 1 point for content as for the rest of the points this game misses is Community 1 Bluehole's lack of affection for their community 1 Server lag 1 No region lock/Max acceptable ping 1 Long term bugs not being patched 1 Adding content and creating more bugs instead of resolving previous bugs 2.As I said before I initially gave this game a better review as I was on I5 and didn't care so much for in game bugs however after switching to an amd and constantly having to deal with the Affinity bug finding more bugs during my games or hackers makes it all the more stressful to even bother with this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-15,0,0,401,False,Not Recommended,"Several months on after purchasing the game...Overall game play and features have significantly improved! Unfortunately the Wall Hacking and Aim Botting is rampant. Such as it is game security (if you can call it that) isn't being taken seriously. (Only PR &amp Lip service) Please consider that less than .005% of the player base has been banned for hacking. This is out of 10 + million copies of the game sold to date. Of those banned odds are they'll just get another copy (legitimate or otherwise) and Smurf their way back into community. This is in and of itself very telling about the direction the games development will take. Other Developers that have followed a similar path found their game all but dead after the first year from release. This is due to either cheating being so common as to make the game unplayable or game monetization that's gotten out of control. While we can tolerate a certain amount monetization the cheating must dealt with in a very wide sweeping and public way. However this step is highly unlikely to be taken as this comes into direct conflict with the Developers desire to profit from and further promote PUBG's sale.Suggestions...1) In game reporting that works rather then just being ""Lip Service"". 2) Dual perspective Kill Cams only available when a report of suspicious activity is made.3) Empower the player base to police themselves by giving them the tools needed to do so.4) Player bans that follow a player across multiple accounts and platforms.5) Add ""optional"" game modes of play. Maybe something without the circle but rather a fixed objective.6) In game latency &amp tick rate shown on HUD. (Yes PUBG's tick rate is poo poo)Further thoughts...1) Posting comments that are counter to what the PUBG's dev's want to see will get you banned from their forums. Developers that can't handle constructive criticism need to find another line of work. (Aka ""PUBG_Hawkinz"")2) Selling keys to unlock boxes is a bad idea and only further pushes the game towards Pay 2 Win system.3) The PC player base may all but drop the game once PC vs. Console games become possible. Why would any PC player want to go head to head vs. someone with a built in aim assist? Other developers have tried this in the past and all failed due to significant differences between platforms.4) This is a prime example of a game that's falling victim to it's own hype train. Obviously the hype is used to generate interest and sales. Unfortunately such levels of hype have lead to expectations that apparently the Developers are unable to provide due to 3rd party commitments with other publishers / platforms.5) The endless prattle from PC Gamer that passes as ""News"" is just sickening. It's like having a drug endorcement from your Doctor knowing he's taking a big fat commision from ""Big Pharma"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,371,False,Not Recommended,"Latest Review The state of the game right now is just pretty pathetic. After 1 year of developping the game they finally ""fixed"" their game. It was running smooth (even when streaming) and it finally ran well. But then... for some reason they thought it was usefull to release a new patch with tons of new (useless?) attachements... ""we dont want people to use their AR as snipers so remove the 8x scope from the ARs.... But.. Lets add a 6x scope which basicly does the same.. Lets add some other random useless attachements. Let's break the state of the guns by making smgs broken. And last but not least. Let's make the game Laggy as .... again. Why BlueHole Why??I really believe this is/was an awesome game if it wasnt gotten this popular early on. It feels like its still an early alpha game. And in my eyes they pushed the game into 1.0 just so they can have more microtransactions. Crates require keys which u buy for clothes and camo's. U can buy skins for your guns from big streamers like Shroud and Doc. Instead of fixing their game they begin a lawsuit against Fortnite... cause they stole BR?? LOL h1z1 was there before pubg Battle royale (the movie) was there before pubg.. BLUEHOLE STOP BEING GREEDY and fix your stuff!!! Listen to your community which is looking to other games cause u don't support your playerbase!So of right now I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore. It was a cool fun game but after being screwed over by the devs for a year im kinda done with it. Original Review Dont understand why people are crying about the micro transactions thing. Devs can make promises but sometimes they have to break it for the better of the game. U can decide if u want to spend the money! U are not forced to spend the money to make the game better! Its your own choice to do it or not! Spending the money doesnt make u any more powerfull in the game! And microtransactions are a thing of this time so I dont mind it as long as it doesnt give u any advantages. The game can be really fun but sometimes really not fun ) When u get crappy loot. It's fun alone but better when u have some friends to play with. The game can be pretty tough on your computer esspecially when u stream it. A lot of long range battle and a little close combat. Once u get that winner winner chicken dinner its really rewarding.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You can get stuck in some random corner and just die to the blue zone2. You can randomly hit invisible walls with vehicles3. Motorcylce ing flip into the for no reasonm.4. Patches are 8 10 GB5. Game shuts down for FOUR HOURS DURING PRIME TIME GAMES IN NA. Which is so ing stupid because they have servers per region... ing update them accordingly...6. Game has issues loading. This can range from guns not spawning on my client until later to not loading into game until i jumped off the plane and drowned (or killed by a random player)7. Fortnite is free and at this point looks more fun to play.So ing stupid for the price you have to pay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-05,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,The game is great. Played H1Z1 and I feel that PUBG is filling in the holes that H1Z1 had and never bothered to fill. The first person sights and zoom is a great feature and has generously helped me get more kills than I could in H1Z1. Yes it runs choppy but it has not cost me a kill or a life yet. I have most of my settings on low and the game is still very much playable and stills visually looks like alright.Update I can no longer recommend the game. When I first got this I was looking for anything to replace H1 and this game was promising. Then like most developers $$$ were in their eyes and each patch had less and less quality. I don't understand they're working on a 4th map and the game still feels so un optimized. I did get my moneys worth but I can safely say I am done with this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-11,0,0,167,False,Recommended,Product received for free. As you can tell from my playtime i haven't owned this game for very long however after having played other battle royales like fortnite and h1z1 i can safely say this is one of the better battle royale games in terms of game play. However this game was not ready to be released and still is not ready to be released. For one i personally feel that the movement mechanics are a bit clunky it feels like your floating ad when you try to go somewhere you seem to over shoot your destination however this might be only a issue to those who are used to the source engine where movement is very fluid and smooth or maybe it's just me idk. Furthermore the game still has optimisation issues the graphics are pretty bad yet on a ryzen 5 1600 and a rx580 8gb you only get 70 fps when there is almost no action (excluding the random fps drops). Compare this to a game like fortnite where the graphics are much more beautiful and the textures are more detailed you can get 144fps at all times on the same PC. Also this game has massive cheating problems and bugs that still plague it and limit it the former problem especially an issue in North America where the players often encounter Chinese players which are hacking however if you live in Europe or elsewhere this shouldn't be too much of a problem. The latter problem however is obviously a problem that affects everyone and the devs need to patch this up and according to their blogs they are trying to do it but the community thinks otherwise according to the devs recent actions you will have to make your own opinion on that matter.Other than that this game is great i am having a lot of fun and i am trying to learn how to play this game as quickly as possible. I love the fact you can customise your gun and that you have the option to use third person or first person perspective. However i often get frustrated when i am getting shot at and can't spot the enemy as i feel the directional sound is pretty under developed ( if you have any tips and tricks or things i should change in my audio settings pls tell me cos idk what to do and i might be doing something wrong). In conclusion i recommend this game (7/10) to anyone who is a fan of battle royales however if you take the game extremely seriously and hate bugs or hackers stay away as this game will make you rage unlike any other game. (UPDATE Also i heard that blue hole were gonna change their servers from 10 tick to 60 ticks if so then i am excited. good job!),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is quite literally zero skill involved find the best place to camp all game and you've won. If the devs added some kind of hit detection so you could actually see where the shots where being fired from it would open the game up for people who like to run and gun and move on to the next house.

2018-01-13,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,You work hard to earn points. All you want is to earn a loot box AND get an item you haven't received before. Then they add these keys where you have to pay 2.50 to open a loot box you already have. So you have a diminishing percentage chance of getting an item you don't already have from the normal lootboxes (also the models for MOST of the items look like something a 12 year old would think is cool but a few look nice) and NOW there is a 50% chance that you will have to pay 2.50 to get an item at all. Considering earning points is hard enough now unless you want to shovel more of your money into the game 1/2 the time you are just wasting points. Clearly the public has spoken about loot boxes but I guess Blue Hole didn't hear them. It's not enough that literally millions of people bought their game now they have to milk it. This is potentially a good game it has WAY more problems than a game that generates this amount of money should but I'm giving a negative review on the basis of corporate greed ing over the player once again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is alot of fun and does have a steep learning curve. Make sure you have a good graphics card and good cooling for it. As for now I do love this game. Personally I have alot of fun even though I have not won yet but it is still enjoyable. Especially with friends its even better. But I would wait for this game to get better and make a decision then. I do also have to criticise Bluehole for saying they wouldn't add payed content but then later on adding it in.August 31st 2017 Edit Right now I think the game has gotten a bit better and I am enjoying it a lot better and am deciding to change my reccomendation. I hope to see what they do in the future with the new map guns mechanics.December 18th 2017 Update The game has been released on Xbox and I am sad to say there has not been much improvement to the PC version.

Therefore when I do have a couple hours in the evening or on the weekend to sit down and play a game it is dedicated time I've set aside for it. PUBG is usually fun to play those times I'm actually able to get a couple hours in however there are just too many reasons not to bother spending money on this game. First are the cheaters/hackers and this has improved by the time of this writing only some of the games I've been able to play have an aimbot or speed cheater on them but when they're there it completely ruins the time spent playing. Another problem is lag that even on a broadband connection in an urban area not only affects combat in the game but simply opening doors driving vehicles or attempting to place a landing while parachuting in. Another and probably most infuriating issue is the constant client and server updates being performed during prime gaming hours on the servers in that region which make it unplayable for me that day. I'm a fan of updates to fix the issues with the game but they are clearly so poorly timed and without any warning that it is a complete crap shoot whether I will be able to sit down and play that day or try again another day in hopes the servers are not ""too busy"".

This game is good and have a good potential but still needs a huge work from devs in order to be ""playable"". I recommend you this game but not for the moment you should just wait that the game is developed most. For the moment it is just a bugged version of H1Z1.

2018-01-07,0,0,1873,False,Not Recommended,I couldn't tell anyone to buy this game right now. 3/10.The bad The hackers every other review addresses these. As a fairly high position player(under 1000 rank in duo third person) I see hackers atleast every 3rd game. Its rampant and awful. It will be the death of this game if they can't correct it soon.The map it has random point on it that you will hit while driving that will bring you to a dead stop damage you your passengers and your vehicle. These are undetectable and strike at random. The desync at points you will shoot an enemy and see blood sprays but they will not register with the other player. Sometimes you will shoot at a distant enemy and your bullet will seemingly vanish. Or from your screen you will be softly peeking over a hill but on the other side you will be exposing yourself fully. This is especially noticeable early game. It's hard to say how bad it is on a normal basis but its there and leaves the game feeling imprecise. This is perhaps most noticeable as a passenger in a vehicle. You will see it hitting objects and going in all manner of odd directions while the driver is driving perfectly normally down the road. Its rather bad.The good When you don't encounter cheaters this game is highly rewarding and challenging. There is a wide range of ways to play that can all be effective. My squad won a game yesterday without firing a single shot in fact we simply out maneuvered all the other squads and had a zero encounter game win. Not saying this is my ideal but it shows that no matter what type of player you want to be there is room for the play. Guns feel distinct and different. Action is fast and intense. Ability to aim and fight is equal to the need to use cover and plan your positioning on the fly as the randomized circles don't allow for the same plan every game. My conclusion I will change this review to a 9/10 if they could simply reduce the hackers. Its rampant. From full blown shoot you through the wall at 800m away all the way down to rampant no recoil scripting. Depending on the day anywhere from 30% of my games to 50% of my games have blatant hackers. I am sure more than that have the recoil scripting. The other issues are nominal and could be addressed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-07,0,0,255,False,Not Recommended,This game is decent addictive and at rare occasions fun. But I can't recommend it with a clear conciousness as the hacking community is strong and vibrant the game is optimized horribly the servers are bad stuff takes ages to load. The community is probably the most toxic one I have encoutered so far (I dont play any LoL/DOTA etc.) on North American servers there is like 98% chinese players who do not speak english even tho they claim they do. On EU you need to play with voice off otherwise it's just Russian Gopniks shouting insults and playing hardbass. The amount of times I got screwed over by someone shooting me through a wall by shooting the ground or just dying randomly due to a bug is insane. Things got a bit better after it went out of early access but a few weeks later it's back to the good 'ol PUBG with it's random crap. If you have some friends that also play this and you can team up for some quality fun I reckon it might be worth it cause at least you can share the pain.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,60,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is easily the best anime beating out cult classics such as Spongebob as well as OverFortress 2. The characters are superb as we see them bond and go through an easy to understand yet engadging story. While characters such as UMP9 are easily forgoten others easily make up for this such as Kar98k or M416 not to mention the cast is expanding with interesting and amazing characters. While we still don't know much about characters like cowboy rifle and short dck double shotgun they keep the series interesting and freash.Over all I give it 9/10 underaged anime girls.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-27,0,0,723,False,Not Recommended,Update After playing since the beta I can no longer reccomend this game. First there are an insane amount of Asians on NA servers. This is a huge problem as there is a language barrier but more importantly theres more hackers. I have never seen so many hackers as I have these passed 2 months. They need to region lock the game. 90% of the games I have played recently me and my team have died to hackers https //plays.tv/s/L_91utyCWJWyhttps //plays.tv/s/L_924yWy5tcjhttps //plays.tv/s/L_928vbGpLLshttps //plays.tv/s/L_92DeFEfOXIOld Review I reviewed this game shortly after buying it which was a few months ago. Since then the devs have made great improvements. There is still a lot to be done but they are releasing updates frequently and adding helpful things to the game. There are still some CPU and crashing issues but the devs are ing slaying the update game.Old Review If you like bad graphics and dying to players you can't see this is the game for you. I wanted to like this game very much but the graphics are extremely blurry to the point where you can barely see other players. There are lots of proximity sound issues and my game crashed a few times. The play style however is way better than H1Z1 better weapons better vehicles. Would not recommend until they make some major changes. 2/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-07,0,0,240,False,Recommended,Personally I love this game. It always has my heart pumping and terrified for each corner. But all biased aside it can be slow. The circle moves slow to the middle so it can be a while with out seeing combat. But as it does move closer you can constantly hear the rattle of gunshots. The vehicles in the game are janky the motorcycles you can flip and instantly die. But I guesd that just offers to the extreme realism this game offers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-02,0,0,211,False,Recommended,This game is by far my favorite game on the market. Many poor reviews are frustrated players who can't seem to win. This game involves skill tactical skills awareness etc. There are many pros to this game which include the realism to it. Bullet drop/ trajectory damage dealt by certain guns and overall just very realistic. Although this game does have some pretty bad cons. These include hackers glitches and laggy servers. HACKERS Honestly everyone complains about hackers but i've only come across a few in the 200 hours spent. I've only ever died by a hacker 2 times and this was when i was playing duos or squads. GLITCHES I've encountered a glitch one time and this was a motorcylce getting stuck and blew up randomly. LAGGY SERVERS Sometimes you will be put into laggy servers from time to time do not get frustrated it usually passes within the first 10 minutes. ps Not all servers are laggy about 10% are laggy *stick to your region* Overall the game is very competitive and very very fun... once you get used to it. SIDE NOTESGame involves skill dont go guns blazing into a firefight time it perfectly and always be aware of your surroundings. Do not be shy! You need to be aggressive and not be scared to fight when it is needed. Always keep your inventory clear and not filled with stupid items like 5 grips for your m4 that you already have equipped etc. Always play with a headset so you can hear footsteps and gunfire. UPDATE REVIEWSome things i noticed with the new update as of April 2nd 2018 is that the redzone has become much more dangerous. Guns seem to be a little bit decreased in damage such as the sks. UMP has seemed to increase damage. (that is not 100% correct just what i feel i noticed),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Winning is indeed the rush it should be but I mean I don't even like running in real life why would I enjoy it in a game?Then you'll have connectivity issues and I must ask how can your servers be down this much?

2018-01-06,0,0,95,False,Recommended,It's a fun game which has a load of potential.Don't buy it just yet tho. 1) The servers are like they're being hosted in North Korea you often rubber band and can never actually pick UP.2) The net code is also complete trash meaning there's a huge delay on when damage has been taken and you can end up like me where you're halfway across a field and then fling back and are dead cause the game took 5 minutes to register you got hit.3) The game shouldn't be out of early access its unfinished buggy and it feels like the devs don't listen to the players.Overall it's a good game with just some game breaking bugs.

2017-08-28,0,0,643,True,Not Recommended,The biggest complaint about the game itself is the performance. I don't like having to turn my high end pc to low settings to play anything. I'm sure this will improve as time passes but I wouldn't recommend buying unless you have the hardware to run it.The real reason I'm giving thumbs down is the problematic dynamic that exists between players streamers and the developers. This game has been succesful because of effecting WOMM (word of mouth marketing) on the part of the developers using streamers as influencers to attract a wider audience.However this has resulted in streamers being put on a pedestal on part of the devs and mostly this haas been ok. However some entitled why brats who don't realize how good they have it to get to play games for a living have totally ruined this wantonly getting people banned. It's the equivalent of a 5 year old getting to kick anyone they want out of the playground.Until the developers realize that ultimately it's the players who put in their dollars into the game and not streamers my review will stay like this and I won't be recommending the game to any friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The combat flows well from encounter to next encounter but is tight enough to land shots move possitions and play with your enemies minds. The zone can feel slow in solo but fast in squads making those two moods feel like a different game. No other battle Royale game is as serious as this game takes it making sure everything feels as realistic as possible.

2018-07-30,0,0,184,False,Recommended,Battle Royale is kind of a mess right now. All these games are scrambling to be the best when there is no such thing.PUBG is for those who like it a bit more realistic. No 6 damage shotgun no giving weapons tiers no flying around or getting flung by impact grenades etc etc. PUBG feels more like a royale closer to ARMA. You have to be tactical and working with your team actually feels like you're a squad. Solos give you a spooky feeling and you either go guns ablazing or take the sneaking route. Vehicles are a little hard right now and have some issues but they work. Bikes are scary to use as you can hit a small texture and fly away or die. Gun fights feel very smooth with bullet drop being decent and many scopes available. There is quite a few attachments a variety of gear and getting a win feels damn good.

This mode is much more fair and I have seen less cheating. Much less. My deaths have been reasonably fair which makes me feel a lot better about the direction of the game development. This game would be super fun if it weren't for the fact that 7 out of 10 times I am killed it's by a person who is cheating and doesn't even have to target me correctly. They just barely have me in their scope and they can shoot anywhere and I die. I was killed with a headshot while I was driving a truck the person was aimed behind me not in front of my direction of travel and they were 1000m away. Boom headshot. These people suck at this game and they are ""winning"". Pathetic. I bet they can't keep a job because they have to actually earn a living.

2018-03-29,0,0,104,False,Not Recommended,For any of those who were around when BattleField 4 was released that is what you will get with this game. This game suffers from so many issues when it comes down to lag. I would watch my death cam and watch helplessly as my bullets strike my opponent but no damage is taken. There s even blood being displayed that my opponent was shot BUT nothing! There are times when I m running and I ll die right after I get behind cover. Other times I ll be completely covered by a wall and I ll still take damage from enemy fire. The peek system is also contributes to the problem. There had been many times I ll peek to fire back and peek right back behind cover and take damage. Reason why the game lags behind so bad that even though I m behind cover on my screen the death cam reveals that I was still peeking out of cover. I am so thankful the death cam was added so I can make sense of what happened. There are many times I swear it s a hacker but the death cam just reveals that it is the games horrible lag to be blamed.The final issue I have is the character unresponsiveness. It is such a dumb reason to die because your character finally went prone or crouch down a second later when you pressed the key or command. In this game a lot can happen in a second. This leads to another issue. Whenever I discharge my weapon tag the unresponsiveness on top of the slight lag and it s a pain to hit anything that s moving and jumping around. Should you ever buy this game and be the lucky few to make it in the top 5 see players sprinting jumping and bunny hopping. It s because we all know how speed combine with lag and unresponsiveness nearly makes you impossible to hit.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Great game great rush one of thr lower levels of netcode out there but still good. Its gotten to the point that wins are dull and the old mqp is jisy chock points qnd needs to be re made vut some people like that map. This game cares about its gamers even if it wants you to die. New map is actuslly very thought out no major chokes like the firdt map. Lot of skilless players out there that talk and need to be taught a lesson. Thats now the best part. GreAt with friends avoid the new small map tho thr netcode is not ready for a pubg fortnight map. Rip BR so tired of you. This br isnt about dumbing down a game so everyone can play.

2018-02-03,0,0,196,False,Recommended,The game has a really competitive action based and fast paced gameplay but as it has those good features it has some really bad features too. As an example the most annoying one is hackers (any type of hackers aim asists recoil asists speed hacks and stuff like that) and bugs (which are always being fixed but always exist) and the loot problem actually game's loot is pretty cool but you always need to land the main areas (in miramar we can say hacienda in erangel we can say military and school for the most known ones) if you land to a suburban area doesn't matter how many houses you loot you will only get tons of equipments.So i can say that if they find a solution for hackers and bugs this will be my favorite game i have ever played.

Cheaters exist but good to see they're working on their anti cheat every few updates and banned ton of cheaters.vehicle crash physics is F U C C D! you can't even go over a little bump without flipping over and also you cant crash another vehicle or they will become conjoined and explode.This game is still not good enough to be labled as ""out of early access and launched"" It still needs ton of work to be even considered as such. Do I like this game? hell yes Do I like playing? Sometimes and sometimes stupid things like hitreg and vehicle physics cause my death. PLEASE WORK ON THE GAME RATHER THAN IMPLIMENTING MORE LOOTBOXES! FIX THE VEHICLES AND SERVER SIDED HITREG!! until these are fixed I will not recommend this gameAlso the directional audio is basically non existent on this game. the sound is either on the left or right no proper direction. PLZ FIXupdate 2018/4/14I rarely play the gamr anymore mostly because there hasnt been any major changes in the game and also very presistant bugs from the Alpha state still exist bad vehicles physics and very bad server side hitreg throughout the game. Sounds are have been reworked but still alot left to be desired because there's still no surround only Stereo its very difficult to know from where you're being shot at because the game lacks surround sound.also I'm getting about 3 5fps higher in both erangel and miramar but I think it needs to be optimized further more at the same settings as before and The new map which is still very much in alpha runs a little worser but its being worked on so I hope it runs as good as the current maps already in the game and also the new map is much better 1/4th the size of current maps 16 km2 compared to 64km2 in erangel and mirarmar which makes the game more intense and closely packed together player locations.The number of cheaters have reduced greatly since the major ban hammer wave during jan feb but 1/10 chance of getting into a game with a cheater compared to 1/3 games. 5 things that need to fixed/optimized and also addedBetter Servers futher more optimization surround sound vehicle physics and Map selection.I still do not recommend the game because they seem more interested in loot boxes and key sales rather than fixing major bugs from the alpha state as mentioned. UPDATE 2018/06/02I haven't play PUBG in eitherity of may because lack of content but today I decided to play it again just to see the improvements madeThe game finally has Surround sound/HRTF. the game runs much more smoother and the freuqent stuttering is gone I can also see about 15 20Fps gain in different areas compared to before new weapons have been added and also a new car New map is right around the corner from release and Well i'm just feeling better about PUBG again like I felt a year back when it came in early access.The game is getting the updates and changes I wanted for a really long time hopefully when the third map is out. I'll get back to playing it more regularly.for the first time of multiple review updates and changes I can finally recommend buying this game but you can wait for a bit longer until summer sales and see then if the game is even better by then or not.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-18,0,0,101,False,Not Recommended,Updated review as of 17th August 2017.The game is poorly optimized both in terms of GPU and net code.As of now I can safely say that PUBG is the current big of gaming and the trend that many companies will try to ride on. While at first I couldn't get into the 'play worm simulator for 30 min die from a random bullet in 1 second' a dozen hours is enough to get hooked and realize that there's much more to skill in this game than luck.If Overwatch / Battlefield is too fast and too much arcade for you and ARMA is too hardcore try this. The pace of this game fits its own niche and the game mode is far too unique to be ignored.While the game still has some problems (high tick rate and questionable gameplay fluidity) one can't help but notice that it's very polished for an EA game. Also devs are rolling out patches very frequently and if I'm any judge they'll actually leave Early Access soon enough as promised.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The map is a good size for 100 people with fun variants like rain or fog. I play the game solo which is a lot of fun since I don't have to wait on others but there is something to be said about the duo and squad queues where you can revive downed (but not yet killed) allies.

2017-06-24,0,0,695,False,Not Recommended,Dear developers I like the game. Let's start there. Battle royal is a fun concept and sure is addictive. I understand it's early access. I do. But your game exploded and gained so many players and you sure have made a lot I mean a lot of money. There are NO excuses in this situation to not work on this game around the clock. Expand your team whatever. This should have massive improvments. Weekly. In other words don't be DayZ or H1Z1. Otherwise people will hate you. Trust me it's not recommended in this industry. Probably the main issue for people would be the performance side. Optimaztion. the content for now it has enough and people are enjoying it so far. Get the game to work well first. Edit 360 hours in 8 months since my review and the game stands still. It's addictive I'll give it that.The loot box system is a complete insult. There's no performance improvements and the audio of the game really makes it difficult to understand your surroudings. The amount of money they made is ridiculous. Considering that I'd say this was a classic early access money grab. New lootboxes which can give you a paid crate you didn't ask for and purchased with your hard earned battle points and when you do get free one it's a pair of ing brown shoes. your 86th pair of brown shoes..A new map you know to keep us happy. Get your ing together BlueHole.Edit 2 Well yeah I've kept playing. But that. This is a very very poorly managed game company. I don't know who makes decisions there but this just isn't good.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-25,0,0,259,False,Not Recommended,A game with mechanics and genre i dreamed about long ago as a kid. But there never was a chance of seeing something like that at the time.Time passes things change. And so did gaming industry. With all the money and technology coming into the industry it quickly became a place for passion and fun that some people like me enjoyed for some time.But time still passes and things still change. You start to see less titles with proper design and solutions and more moneygrab half raw products with no dedication to the final product.Then crowdfunding comes in. We get promises devs get final user expectations to meet(or do they now?). Plus making a game is no longer that much risky if you get your money first and then stretch time frames to the ones you are comfortable with. And you also have a wall to hide behind if someone is getting impatient. Because early access right? Sadly yeah.Then come the consoles with which you need to cut production costs by all means to gain profit. Console hardware becomes less competitive so what do you do? Develop for the consoles first and then port usually making pc experience somewhat hindered.Money took over the industry. The most of it. Its not that bad but i really miss the times where i bought a game and could expect full scaled single player proper settings(hard fps locks on pc? please!) fresh titles new experience and so on.Then with industry rising come popularity. People make games a meaningful part of its society so now its on the devs to make games appeal to buyers investors managers so they would sell more. Its just not about passion or fun anymore. Not about perfection or stuff that makes sense.Greed corrupts. Not really an eye opener i know but i miss skill ceilings of classic CS or UT or quake. I miss believable sandboxes i spent days in. I miss myself enjoying all the little details games threw at me. Not much of that going on now.Same with this game. Get money then get even more. Throw the words at you so you stay for a bit longer. Spend some more having expectations. So far it works wonder if it ever won't.I like how competitive shooters always want balance included. And it usually works by just oversaturating the game with guns or some t nerfs or other lame design choices that smell of laziness.But you will always have some loot crates be sure of that.I just wonder how bad can products get in the future with trends like that.Still waiting for bullet penetration?

He simply held down the trigger and wiped out all players in his vacinity. I do not recommend this game as of right now as the anti cheat is obviously out dated.

I've won about 15 games over my time of playing PUBG and I gotta say theres alot wrong with it and alot great with it. CONS the circle of death stupid wayyy too RNG heavy in a skill based game can get lucky with it and auto winred zone stupid almost no threat have only died once to it bullet mechanics mediocre alot of ""HOW THE F*$# DID HE HIT THAT SHOT?!""Vehicles greenlight indie game level driving 2/10 especially with motorcyclesMelee combat realllllyyyy dummbbbbb you can basically remove melee weapons and just hope the PUBG gods smile upon you you can either never hit a single punch/slash point blank or you one shot somebody getting lucky superman punching themMisc Absurd RNG sh!t you can either get lucky with the circle of death or you might not and when you don't suddenly theres not a single vehicle on your half of the island even though theres typically 80 spawns in that area or perhaps you drop in one garage someone drops in an adjacent garage they get full lvl 2 gear and an M4 you get a revolver and a gas can.Bugs. It doesn't require a whole lot of explaination theres alot of bugs its dumb whatever. PROS Looting is incredibly satisfying when you get lucky with your areas it fun to get fully kitted and absolutely merc anyone who comes in your wayBullet mechanics I know this was also a con but honestly it can be just as satisfying as it can be stupid sniping requires some skill theres bullet drop zeroing and guns aren't just lasers but that doesn't excuse when sometimes a point blank shotgun shot to the head won't down somebody but when it happens to you you get blown back into another time period.Combat Overall combat can be alot of fun its alot of skill and requires alot of attention and when you win a firefight the rush of adrenaline can be great. You have to be able to predict what your enemy is thinking know where they could be hiding and keep in mind everything in your surrounding like ""do I have the ability to loot this body out in the open"" ""where could somebody be able to see me know"" ""where are those shots coming from"" etc.Overall 87/100 As much as it seems theres alot of cons once you start playing the pros outweigh them",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The Chinese desperately need to be regionlocked due to their poor connection to other worldwide servers and the painful language barrier. It doesn't make auto matchmaking fun anymore. This is also exacerbated by Brendan Greene the creator of the game. He blames the community for xenophobia when we just want to have a fun game not filled by cheaters or hitreg issues. Furthermore the Chinese players were advertised a third party VPN for the game (which is illegal in China so it is probably going to get banned) which worsens connection and compounds already existing connection issues.Fun game sometimes with decent mechanics but right now I just cannot recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-14,0,0,60,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE Just play fortnite lol its way better nowI was initially hesitant to get this game being very scared that it was just another early access horror story. However at the time of writing this review my experience has been pretty positive.The gameplay was never what I was worried about not liking. It seemed like a nice blend of tense but also straight up fun gameplay. This is the case... for the most part. You see I think there is a very specific way you have to play PUBG not competitively. Don't look up guides on how to win. Don't try and learn different strategies. I believe these things will ruin your experience as they have with numerous other shooters for me before. Once you start to learn these ""tips and tricks"" every encounter becomes very formulaic. You follow an algorithm in your brain that tells you exactly what to do in any given situation. But if you avoid this type of ""how to get good content"" the game is infinitely more rewarding and one of the most ingenious pieces of multiplayer game design I've seen to date. The feeling of being a noob makes each encounter with an enemy feel like a opportunity where you decide freely on how to approach the situation with so much potential for really creative takedowns. The thrill of thinking on your feet is so exciting at least far more so than following the checklist that some YouTuber told you to go through every time you see an enemy.Now onto the bad Optimisation is mediocre right now. At low settings the game doesn't look that great at all but yet I still get poor frames in dense city areas. I believe optimisation should be the number one priority right now (although I am admittedly biased given that I have a fairly weak rig but even so with the low graphical fidelity this game has at lower settings I should be able to run it just fine).Microtransations while not an issue at the moment could become a problem. There are RNG loot boxes in the game for cosmetic items (which can be bought using in game ""battle points ""for an incrementally increasing price each time you guy one or using real money on the steam marketplace) and while 2/3 of them are free to open as of writing there was a gamescom crate released for which you had to spend real money to open. I understand it may not be in the financial interests of the company to refrain from using this kind of microtransactions but they sure would gain an enourmous amount of respect in (and also outside of) thier giant community. While I do believe that this RNG loot box system is a negative thing in the games industy it can be used to your advantage. You see the steam market integration means that you can sell the crates you earn for steam wallet money thus meaning that TECHNICALLY this game can pay for itself on a long enough timeline. I have no intention of opening any of the crates I earn and fully intend on grinding as much of the money that I paid for this game with over time. On a related note I do ask that the developers don't add ridiculous demon skulls and stupid looking holiday themed cosmetics to the game like H1Z1 has. They are tacky and really ruin the great atmosphere that this game has by making all the characters look really silly.Overall I'd say that this game is pretty great with some rough around the edges but nothing that ruins the core gameplay experience (which really is excellent).",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-22,0,0,296,False,Not Recommended,Absolute garbage. Game full of bugs glitches hacker... devs don't do about any of that only adding crates and making the game laggier in each update. The game runs like s*** and looks worse than runescape (at least on the setting you have to use to make the FPS bearable). Every single match is filled with hacking teaming chiners wearing red shirts making an army and headshoting you with a revolver from the other side of the map and the devs instead of region locking them release new crates. Don't buy this trash game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-15,0,0,522,False,Recommended,This game when people play it honestly is a ton of fun. Even more fun when you have a good group of friends to play with. However the cheating that has been occuring (aimbot shooting through walls etc) can make the game unbearable. So for now I'm not recommending the game due to that. Once the developers clean that up however it happens I'll be happy to recommend it again. As far as glitches I haven't experienced a whole lot so I don't have that to complain about but others have.*Edit* So I'm not all that good at the game but I usually get 3 4 kills so I'm not all that bad and recently haven't had a whole lot issue with cheaters. I say to noticeable improvement that I would recommend the game. It is still a ton of fun and good adrenaline rush. Enjoy!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-13,0,0,152,False,Not Recommended,1.) The amount of reviews of hackers would have you believe it's unplayable. If there were actually hackers in every match I wouldn't win any games but I do. It's mostly very skilled players and the base of this game can't get around that people are better than them at an FPS. The death repcap system is so it will appear that people don't have their crosshair on you. This has been a problem since the beginning when you would spectate teammates.2.) I can only vouch for NA but China invading NA servers was months ago and they no longer jump into NA lobbies with their immesive lag.3.) Optimization is trash. I have a i5 4690k GTX 750 Ti PCiE 16GB Ram and still have to play on low with occasional lag screens during the beginning of games. It has improved much since but be warned it will still have console graphics unless you have an i7/Ryzen 7 and a beastly GPU.4.) I still don't recommend this game.

I love it to death but there is something nagging at me and I can't get rid of it. So as my usual format I'm going to say the Pros and Cons. Lets begin Pros The tensity of the situation. The game can be really tense at times which may be percieved as a bad thing however I believe that as the tensity increases the games true colours shine. Getting that kill to be able to survive as the circle gets smaller and smaller and smaller It really is ingenious. The amount of loot/customisablity. This makes the game beneficial for you and those around you. Not only do you get to mix and match weapon attachments to suit your playstyle but the cosmetics it adds just brings some colour into quite a dark game(expanded on later) How fun it can be with friends. I have spent more time messing about with friends than actually playing the game itself. I guarantee you that I have more team kills than actual kills. That may seem bad but trust me it is a blast to play. This gmae is more fun with more people. 'Nuff said.Cons The LOD/L aaa g. This makes the game borderline unplayble at points. Picture this You are in a tense gunfight both of you one bullet away from riding the reapers ghost train and... you're game fails to load/lags to the point where you are looking at a frozen screen and you die. Great. Uninstalling. The tedium. This game can be so annoying. The first 20 30 games I played consisted of 2 scenarios. 1. I don't find anyone for an hour than get shot in the head by a Kar98K at the back of the map. 2. I find someone but I lag and (see point one of cons) It takes too...goddamn...LOOOONNG. Kind of like this review. I have spent 84 hours on this game of time of writing and I have only gotten into the top 5 TWICE. And it's not because I'm bad at the game. (in those games I got 7 kills both) It's because I got so bored of waiting that when action did arrive I was so tired I didn't pay attention. I hate that. I just hate it.In conclusion I still recommend this game. It's just that you have to be prepared for long grindy hours of annoyance and frustration. But they are constantly adding new content and it is a ton of fun to play with friends. My rating? 5/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-25,0,0,888,False,Not Recommended,这款游戏 总体来讲 可玩性很足 无论是胜利还是失败都有足够的看点 可以说这款游戏就是为直播而生 但是同样 在当前的很多游戏系统设定中 很多很好玩的东西都被这款游戏完全限制住了 赢了的局 看技术 输了的局 就当看了一部 孤岛上的一百万死法 因为目前来讲这款游戏还是抢先体验 所以有一些设定还是处于摸索状态 不过就目前来讲我发现的问题主要是集中在 武器系统太过单调 快速扩容这种双料配件就不应该存在 既然有快速扩容 为什么还要有快速和扩容 明明就是需要玩家来选的东西 结果偏要搞出一个双料 弹药量太过于充足 前期泼水 后期弹药无用 大量的主武器弹药导致了游戏中手枪和近战武器几乎可以直接删除了 没有丝毫的存在感 目前来讲设计那么多种近战武器 除了锅能用来挡枪顺便搞笑以外 其他近战武器全是摆设 而武器系统的不平衡则导致了这款游戏的根本问题 从头打到尾 能用的枪就那么几把 其他武器基本上都可以无视 一把HK416或者SCAR L直接全程通吃 可以适应任何情况 作为一款随机性如此之强的游戏 设计了几乎没有任何缺陷的武器难道就不觉得有问题 vector这把枪现在定位超级尴尬 明明是.45大口径ACP弹 伤害反而比UMP9低 而且最重要的是备弹本身就少 伤害还不够 射速又快 一梭子打出去打不死人很正常 如果我来设计这款游戏的武器系统 我觉得这样选择比较有可玩性 7.62mm阵营 SCAR H 20发备弹 定位为短管卡宾枪 SCAR H作为卡宾枪射速慢但是伤害更高 但是后座强大 远距离射击如果采用全自动方式几乎就是乱打 扩容弹夹+5 AKM 30发备弹 整体属性和目前的AK差不多 但是后坐力要比SCAR H小 远距离精度也要更好 扩容弹夹+10 5.56mm阵营 G36C 30发备弹 射速快 后座大 伤害略低于目前的SCAR L 但是无论远近精度均非常出色 易于掌控 但是远距离弹药伤害衰减极大 超过100米 只要有防弹衣伤害基本可以无视 15 25 武器授权问题可以有无数种方式规避 当然也不一定非得是G36C 只是要选择一款有特性的武器 扩容+10HK416 在目前的HK416基础上削弱射速 比AK稍高即可 扩容+10弹药系统 目前的弹药量太过于充足了 我们其实可以增加弹药的出现率 但是每一盒弹药的数量大幅度降低 目的有三 一 在极少的弹药量下 手枪和近战武器的必要性就得到了凸显 尤其是前期大家找枪很随机的情况下 即使你得到了枪 也只能让你在敌人近身之前削弱他的血量 二 可以防止交战靠泼水的情况出现 前面已经说过了 现在绝地求生这款游戏 中期就是泼水打法 弹药多到打不完 有的时候为了捡别的东西甚至要丢弃弹药 何必呢 三 可以增加我下面说的武器系统 机枪机枪系列 首先我们要做的是将M249移出空投武器列表 首先我来说一下增加机枪的原因 在弹药量受到大幅度削减的情况下 机枪可以作为一个关键时刻提供压制能力的重要武器 但是注意 极少的弹药储备可能会导致一杆胡乱操作的机枪在1分钟内耗光全队伍所有的弹药储备 M249直接作为5.56阵营的机枪 同时7.62阵营添加M240或者是PKP Pecheneg 每一款武器都应该有自己鸡肋的地方 而不是像现在一样一把HK416或者一把SCAR L通吃全场 最后说一句 第二主武器的存在没有任何必要性 反而影响游戏体验 取消第二主武器 可以极大增加手枪的出场率 另外 M16A4的存在意义到底是啥 先不说连建模都是错的 M16A4的功能完全可以直接并入MINI 14 各种BUG 各种外挂 锁区吧,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I was going to give another negative due to the game not focusing on optimazation. This doesn't feel different than any other declining early access,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-19,0,0,541,True,Recommended,Edit I find the amount of VAC banned people commenting and blaming streamers makes me laugh. This game has a hacker problem in early October 2017 and they all seem to take their bans out on streamers. The game is good hackers are not everyone wishes the servers/gameplay would be a bit more optimized but they have worked hard and everything has been steadily optimized over time so bear with take everything you read with a grain of salt.I first heard about this game due to streams on Twitch. The gameplay was so enjoyable to watch. It was the perfect balance of intense moments and slow moments for people to interact.Enjoying these streams is what lead me to purchase this game and my god I have been hooked.First of all let's get the elephant out of the room this game is in early access so is by no way finished. The biggest issues are optimization and server desync which make it difficult when things get heated...sometimes the better frame rate wins sometimes the server desyncs and it feels like you get hit when you're behind cover. HOWEVER there does feel like there are ways you can play around these things based on your strategic gameplay and your map knowledge which is really cool.Having said that though I have not had this much fun playing a game ever. There are a myriad ways to play a really high skill cap every match feels completely different even if you do everything exactly the same from the previous and the multiplayer allows for plenty of laughs and hyped moments all at the same time.I highly recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy themselves be it solo or with a group of friends. My favorite way to play is Queuing solo into squads with auto matching as you can meet a lot of new people and find out completely new strats you never thought of! Having a mic helps a ton though!I hope you try it and love it as much as I have!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Very nicely decorated interiors of buildings. Very good graphics on high and ultra. Low amounts of server lag. Wide selection of weapons and clothing. Overall nice community. Only $30! Fantastic developers!!!!! )Now for the not so good parts....Cons Only one map (more on the way though) Must have reasonably good pc to play on higher settings. Can get dull without your friends. A few different startup issues (at the moment) Gets annoying if you die early in the game and have to wait for your buddys to finish. There are real hackers right now (which is why the report button is there when you are killed)As you can see there are very good reasons for why you should or shouldnt buy pubg I will leave it up to you to decide if it is for you but in my opinoin it is a no brainer for the price point and the fun to be had with or without your friends!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-09,0,0,247,False,Not Recommended,Okay look. There are really great features in this game. I love the different guns that are available even if selection is a tad bit limited. The concept is really neat with trying to be the last man standing blah blah blah. Honestly though this game is so ridiculously broken it makes me laugh. The audio bugs out all the time sometimes making it seem like someone is running right behind you but no it's your own footsteps. And it's often very hard to tell if shots are coming from behind or in front of you. If you want realism then act like it. Fix your game. On top of that the amount of people I see using some kind of aim hack or hit scan or various other hack is ridiculous. (And yes I mean when it's very obvious) Not only is it disappointing knowing how many people use them but the fact that the developers haven't put forth any proper effort with stopping this just makes me so sad. If you want people to choose your game over other battle royale games you need to fix your game and make it much more difficult to hack.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The only problem in my opinion is the bugs and bad optimization but this game is still verry new so they will fix it in future uptates. The reason why they dont do it now is basicly because they dont want tu put a lot of effort into fully optimazing a game that is not finished that is just stupid. It is in my opinion the best battle rojale game out there. On the other hand if you hate playing games that are not fully optimized wait a couple of months before buying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not all streamers are good at this game. If you liked a streamer who played this game and they were in your match and you targeted them and killed them for just being in your game Would that be fair?Yes I do understand that this is a early access game and that it has bugs.

The microtransactions dont affect the game much. They dont give an advantage whatsoever. Anyways...PUBG is a fantastic high performance battle royale game. You need a pretty hefty computer to run it. Im going to break this down to a Pros and Cons list.Pros Fun gameplayGood combat mechanicsFirst and Third person modeFun with friendsEasy to find everythingCons Very unoptimizedBuggy but it is in alpha.people getting banned for being near a streamerBy good gun mechanics i mean that combat is not about who shoots first or who has the better gun its about who is more skilled.Easy to find everything as in you can find guns in the first 10 seconds of landing easily. Their is a firearm in most buildings/houses throughout the entire map. I like that because that makes it somewhat fair.I do reccomend this game. It is very buggy and sometimes laggy and unstable but the great fun gameplay and good looking visuals easily make up for it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-16,0,0,258,True,Recommended,I don't buy many games partially because I'm close to broke but also because with many games I don't feel like I would get my money's worth. The 30EUR I spent on this game was the best investment I've made on Steam by far. Countless hours of entertainment regardless of the fact that I kind of suck at FPS games and have a potato PC (playing at around 20 30FPS *sad face* ). Even though the game is still in Early Access I find it being a pretty good game and the dev team is working hard to make it even better.Many people left negative reviews because they included microtransactions in the game.. I can understand the fact that many people don't want them but I don't consider that being a strong reason to leave a bad review for a game you've probably played hundreds of hours of and still continue to play it.

THe game does need optimization at times and can be glitchy. Not game breaking though. There are a ton of chinese in the 3rd person squad games. But I havent seen a hacker yet. Foreigners can be good and bad. Had a great team full of guys that didnt know a lick of english. But were good team mates none the less. Ive also had a team that after they had 10 seconds to go before the barrier moved I drove halfway across the map to pick them up and they ended up betraying me and shooting me. I also had a crazy ride on a motorcycle trying to get away from a bomb zone. The game is intense and there are many playstyles to employ. All in all the hype is real. You get because you get merced but you keep coming back. 9/10All in all i would optimize the game more and add more weapons like remote bombs .50 barrett bear traps flying vehicles and maybe finding a special remote that lets the player pick the next bombing zone.

I then shot a third and he killed me but he had a bolt sticking out of his neck/head with only a gas mask on. Kill cam showed no damage to him whatsoever.

GAME PLAY Looooooooooong durations of running looting getting shot at where you dont even know fishy plays by some of these people.NETWORKING Lag lag and more lag. Im not sure if the people who unirronically say ""China numbah one!"" are actually from China but it sure damn feels like it.TL DRDecent game with its issues fun with a friend boring/stressful alone.EDIT With recent updates and the games release it helped with the technical problems listed above.

Bought it 2 days ago and whilst I'm terrible at it really enjoying it really seems to capture the thrill of being in the last 20/10/5 etc and trying to avoid getting headshot by someone with an SKS with an 8 scope...BUT.Only when I can actually play. I seem to have spent over half my time playing clicking a button to re connect and it is honestly so frustrating. Shame I can't refund it because honestly I paid full price and expect something that isn't fundamentally broken. I'd absolutely understand if servers were down for maintenance from time to time but to have to re connect after EVERY SINGLE GAME and spend minutes of my life re clicking the re connect button is a joke (Also the number of times I get teamkilled is getting ridiculous.

The longer you make it the more the tension rises.Pro's Great application of the survival/Hunger Games concept Big map (and new maps are coming) Good variety in Weapons and attachments Good variety in Character customization (could be more though) Map is well made good variety in terrain. Loner Co op &amp Squad option 1st person view AND 3rd person view (great!)

2017-07-06,0,0,234,True,Recommended,I've only played one solo game on this and thoroughly enjoyed it. The real jewel with this game is playing with 1 3 friends I haven't had as much fun on a multiplayer game since the (me and my friends) glory days of R6V &amp CoD4. Sure there are issues but the devs are quick to address them and are very much in communication with their fan base on the twitters. You won't always have a fun game bad things will happen and you may not be certain of the cause these issues have decreased over time though and this is what we should expect from an EA game. The fun games though.... WOW! So many varied and fun gunfights so many funny random moments the adrenaline and satisfaction of winning a game the sense of failure and regret from coming 2nd....I've nearly 130 hours on the game at the time of writing and far from being bored some people think it is slightly expensive for an EA title but in terms of value for the playtime you'll get it's incredibly cheap! One of the big draws for me to purchase early was the promise of mod support upon release where the potential is massive. Optimisations will come zombie mods will come wasteland mods will come new maps will come (btw the standard map is one of THE best maps I've ever played).I'm totally hyped for Sacriel's upcoming game but that's some way off and I think I'll happily be playing both of them when they both have had their full release.

They need to beef up their servers optimize alot of things and make sure you can't shoot people once they have moved behind walls. Once they fix the issues with the game it will be the perfection of the tactical survival shooter genreUpdate Nevermind they fixed some issues and there is some optimization but this long after the release people can still shoot you after you get behind walls they dumbed down and messed up all of the shooting mechanics that were really good in early access and with some mediocre attempts at stopping the hacking there are still issues with that. Not server locking players was a serious issue. They needed to put more time into fixing the core game than doing cash grabs with crates and kept the shooting mechanics how they were.

2017-08-03,0,0,435,True,Recommended,Don't listen to these whining about microtransactions. They're clothing items completely irrelevant to any gameplay. You can not buy an advantage in this game which is the REAL downside of microtransactions. You will read reviews complaining saying that the crate system is akin to gambling (I agree) but if you don't want to gamble THEN DON'T GAMBLE. You can get a ton of cosmetic items (many of which are very similar to those in the crates you can open with the paid keys just by playing the game. At the time of this review there are two kinds of crates you can get free one you cannot. I understand wariness about microtransactions but if you're like me and your concern is how they actually effect gameplay then rest assured that there is no impact. As for the game itself it's great. You will encounter the typical early access bugs but the devs are very active and engaged with the community. This is not a cashgrab as other reviewers might have you think. This is a game with solid core gameplay constant free updates and a bright future in store.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-13,0,0,54,False,Recommended,"7 June 2018 We as South African players are forced to play on EU servers as the developers always ignore our requests for local servers. There is a huge gaming community in this country. And BTW our 200ms ping does not give us any form of unfair advantage. I got killed plenty! All of my friends hate cheaters and we game because we love it! So sad that we're excluded from the ""first world countries"". There are world class gamers here in SA. PLEASE DEVELOPERS JUST ONE SOUTH AFRICAN SERVER!!! Great game though!!!13 March 2018 Sadly South African players are yet again not taken into consideration even though a HUGE gaming commuity exists in this country. PLEASE ADD A SOUTH AFRICAN SERVER!!! Developers will certainly benefit financially from this as their are hardly any games (especially Battle Royal type) that have SA servers. Do some research developers and you'll notice that SA based players have enormous numbers playing other games that accomodate them and they're very keen on PUBG but are holding out because their PING is 200+. Come on developers make a gaming community happy! We'll even lure some of those incompetent cheaters from other servers if it makes you happy!Awesome game bad support for those that could actual thrive from better latency.

2018-11-07,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,"This game started as a good idea. I had a lot of fun in the initial weeks of the game. As time has gone on they've hidden more and more content behind paywall after paywall. Advancements and rewards for just playing the game are hidden behind the season pass. I already bought the game and they expect more money to unlock the incentives to put extra time into the game. I don't want to play the game very much anymore and if anything this incentivizes against playing as I feel like I'm wasting time without the season pass.Every new update pushes more content behind paywalls.There's not very many weapons in the game which is the main source of varried gameplay. In addition there are ""best"" weapons. You are always working towards the ""best"" loadouts because keeping something else tends to lead to a loss. The final circle is typically all people who got the best or close to the best builds.If you like highly competitive battle royals with very little room for fooling around mistakes or enjoyment this is the game for you.

2017-07-31,0,0,296,False,Recommended,If anything the game has very much improved since its release. People will bash it for cheaters but I've never seen one in my entire time playing. I certainly prefer it over Fortnite probably because of my experience in ArmA games. I don't understand why it has to be an argument and why the games cannot coexist. People quit bashing on H1Z1 so they could bash PUBG. Now as for a review the game features two maps a desert map and a map filled with various forms of terrain. I do not enjoy the desert map because of the enviornment. I don't know what it is sand and sun just doesn't mix well with me. I do wish there was an option to choose but I understand why there isn't. They don't want one map populated and one not. Now as for weapons there are many within the game. I think the variety is great and they continue to add weapons that do not harm the game's style. As for looting there are many areas with good loot and if you have half a brain you can fight it out in those areas to win that loot. Air crates are very common but the demand is high so you will encounter fights for aircrates. As for loot within those air crates a lot of the time it will be a Groza which is good don't get me wrong but I do think the loot tables for air crates need to be changed. Vehicles are only still somewhat useful they can get you to playzone and also get you killed. There are little microtransactions and the game is in a good state for the devs to start rolling those out. The biggest problem I have with it is the game time. It can take up to 40 minutes to finish one match. This is due to the map's size and the time playzones take to shrink. If they lower the time on circle shrinks then more people will die resulting in a shorter match. Overall in its current state I give it a 7/10. It has its issues but is closing in on a state where there can be no improvements because that's just the way it is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The cryogen engine is superb but still has not reached it's peak as you PUB utilizes the beast to offer a very challenging game.You are dropped into a battleground against 100 other players who scramble to find gear and weapons. As the knifing small arms and shotguns rip flesh without armor the semi autos build amoungst the lucky. Every building every hillside every vehicle might have a surprise for you. Be it lethal wounds or lucky loot you will not find a moment to breathe.The game's timer pulls survivors unkown to focus zones where all players must hustle to get there. These zones are both for attacking other players and avoiding a built in damage modifier to your character if you fail to reach killing zones.My only thought beyond the obvious is aiming seems a bit clunky add recoil and you might miss an unknown player less than six feet away. Realism? I belive it is over done.Good times ahead!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Funny enough though the latter hack gets mitigated when im carrying a frying pan.

2017-12-19,0,0,341,False,Not Recommended,So many bugs and hackers that honestly completely ruin the game. The concept is great but the bugs and hackers just make it so even if you have someone down dead to rights the game can screw you over and get you killed. And no I'm not bad these bugs don't happen extremely often but they happen enough for me to give this game a thumbs down. Fix these bugs for the love of god. Please PING LOCK CHINA.Edit 2 months later still no ping lock. But more importantly this game is a broken ing mess and literally seems like an early access torm that was thrown together by a ing greedy trying to milk as much money as humanly possible off of the hype. There are so many gamebreaking bugs (hit detection issues hackers not being able to use health items items floating hitboxes broken getting stuck on seemingly nothing invisible barriers etc) and the devs would rather release new lootboxes that only promotes the hackers and stupid t that goes with them instead of fixing those issues.

I highly recommend grabbing a squad of friends and trying to progress on the leaderboards. This negative reviews are accurate however the game literally over balances them. There are occasionally hackers there are glitchy deaths and there are lag spikes in the beginning of the game but this game is still the best on the market right now. The gameplay and the necessity to survive literally still gets your heart racing when its just you vs another squad or two fighting for the top prize... the chicken dinner. There is no better feeling than erasing another squad from the game and no better feeling than putting on an amazing play in front of your buddies who hype you up after getting a disgusting 3 piece on some scrubs who thought they were smart trying to push you.

2017-08-06,0,0,212,False,Recommended,PUBG is a good but flawed game. On the plus side Erangel (first map) is great there are plenty of weapon mods the item spawning is fairly good driving is smooth there are plenty of good mechanics such as vaulting prone peek left and right etc. But with these come with a plethera of issues namely the hit registration. Often you will shoot players and the shots won't register. Other issues include lag in early game due to low tick rate a massive amount of cheaters (over 90% of which are from China the new map is godawful there are many bugs and instead of fixing these bugs working on the new map fixing the hitreg or region locking China the devs decide to add weapon skins.

2017-09-22,0,0,766,False,Not Recommended,This is a Battle Royale game (Last man standing type of deal) you play as a custom made random character who is dropped into a large explorable world in order to fight to the death and be the Battle Royale king. You loot you fight (But mostly loot)Changed my review to not recommened as their Anti Cheat system is horid came back to play this game after a brief long break and couldn't believe how much it felt like the Beta when hackers were huge was killed by a hacker 8 times (yes I counted) only 4 of which were banned and yes I am 100% positive they were hacking.Pros World The world is very large an 8 x 8 square km island set somewhere in the Pacific or Indian ocean (Most likely the Indian ocean close to Ukraine) It offers many different variations of gameplay. From tightly packed towns to wide open fields. With things like rivers and bridges inbetween everything. It doesn't lack variety at all and still being the only map it is still fun to play on it daily.Variety The variety in this current game is large (even though there is only 1 map) What im talking about here is the amount of different playable play styles. There is so many weopons to suit your needs. From a tommy gun or a shotgun for closer quaters combat. To a m24 sniper rifle for longer range combat. And funner things inbetween. The game is set in a way that forces you to pick an playstyle as you progress depending on where the ring moves in. Fun The game offers constant fun because most of the game is random. Where the plane spawns and the plane flight path is random the loot drops are random the air drops are random and of course The ring is random. Meaning even though with the same map over and over it offers fun every single match due to it being different every single game. Cons Bugs The game does fall victim to many game altering bugs these bugs can get you killed or give your oppenents an advantage on you (which will still get you killed) Of course the game is still early access so you can't expect much on the bug side to be fixed already but it does need to be addressed.Optimization This game is obviously on the Unreal engine 4 which means on terms of Optimization not much falls directly to Blue hole developers and more onto the Unreal developers but when my computer can run dyling light on Ultra settings without vsync at a stable 60 70FPS but can't run Battle grounds on meduim at a solid 60fps (Drops to 45 occasionaly) Then that does say something about the optimization that is needed (yes I do understand they work with different engines and coding indices it's just an example)ConclusionAll things considered this game is my Favourite game of the year I orignally played Dota to fulfill my needs then switched to overwatch and now switched to PUBG (although I still play the others) It is a fun game that I highly recommend to lovers of Battle Shooters. (Only if you have a beastly or Moderatly Beastly PC) I give Pubg 8/10 based of the only 2 points lost because of bugs.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

2018-04-01,0,0,536,False,Recommended,Having 400+ hrs in this game means I'm not tottaly crazy about this game but I have a decent opinion about it. Personally I don't agree with the ones who compare it to Fortnite. Even if it's still a BR game Fortnite has a more arcade ish feeling to it whether you like to admit it or not. PUBG on the other hand is more realistical (not completely) and you get to put much more effort into playing it. I enjoy it a lot even though it has some major issues like Constant lack of working anti cheat (the servers aren't full of hackers as some say but there are enough of them). Servers aren't always working at full potential which means you have to refresh UI everytime you disconnect from a game and after new updates is common for them not to work at all. Vehicles are pretty messed up especially motorcycles ( 3 seaters too) and I think they should try to fix the interactions between minor objects such as poles or lights because you can stack the vehicle in them and they would take continuos damage which leads to the vehicle exploding and you dying (this type of death also brings a lot of rage and usage of alt f4) About minor problems there are things like Visual bugs where you see weapons combined or can't aim if someone's proned behind you Dying immediately if you exit a boat even if it doesn't touch you Taking lots of falling damage if your parachute messes up in some kind of building I think these were all the cons to it but it would take a lot to tell you the pros about it and even if this game has some problems the fact that the developers listen to user feedback makes PUBG one of the best games out there. 100% reccomended it to all my friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-10,0,0,344,False,Recommended,Very good game improved loads with update and runs so smoothly. The MASSIVE problem lies with the servers the initial 'elastic band' lag can be severe at the start and can be very annoying ending in a b******t death and lots of salt. But that goes quickly and won't be too bad if you don't land in a large area or with a lot of people. The problem that ruins the game is not being able to load a game. It varies based on time and sever but I can often not load into a game (recieving the 'Connection Lost') for 5 10 tries or more. This is how I usually end a session getting annoyed I've wasted more time on the hub screen than playing the game. Overall a beautiful game but they need to improve servers. One big worry is there are 2 maps (both very fun and different styles) right now it is a random choice selection so there are 6 game modes (Solo duo squad x2 due to Third person and First person). But due to popular demand Bluehole will be changing it in January so people can select the map they want. They have acknowledged that this will make finding a game harder as there will effectively be 12 games modes now. So the future of this game relies on servers and the company working out how to increase the chances of getting a game for now I recommend the game but just be prepared for frustration.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-30,0,0,305,False,Recommended,My first short Review!After appr. 100 hours of gameplay i reached the bottom of midskill rank and think i can give a small review especially after so many bad reviews for the game lately.At the beginning its a very hard game for noobs.. rounds and rounds all you do is more or less fast dying. This can be frustrating for some people but others might take it as a challenge.After some hours it gets better and when you got you first 4 people kill streak the motivation to get better and find out more details of the game is very high.I played appr. 100 hours till now and im still very excited to play it.Playing as duo/squads brings much fun too. The developers are always busy to bring out new content. The cheater many people mentioned here i cant confirm. The only thing that happened to me sometimes were some kind of bot players who automatically went to houses got gear and wait there till they get killed. But i guess no aimbots or something though the deathcam is still a bit inaccurate. PUBG is actually at least trying to do something against the cheating problem.The gameplay physics and sounds are quite nice &amp realistic so the immersion of the game is very pronounced.Graphics could be better.All in all i can recommend this game totaly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-30,0,0,279,False,Recommended,"Pros Its worth the money. I'm glad I bought it. Choose first person or third person for added view. You can run straight into action or stay on the outskirts and wait until the very end if you go unseen. Hiding inside the houses and listening for other players footsteps has an almost Resident Evil horror game tone especially if they have a gun and you dont yet. If you die the next game starts in about 60 seconds or you can spectate your remaining team or the person that killed you.Buy this game if you like Sniping Stealth Driving Vehicles Looting Moding Weapons Needs Fixed It does have many bugs they need to fix though such as servers busy black screen sound cutting out etc. Globally everyone plays the North American server for some reason so expect to meet people on your team that might not speak English and have high ping. The overall graphics could be a little better. They need a night mode more levels (maybe with civilians) a little bit better fluidity of motion in the graphics like falling jumping etc they are also missing an easy way to ""add friends"" when playing with new people text chat and in game leaderboards showing my current kill count which hopefully will come in updates shortly.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Only if you can manage a get an assault rifle within 20 seconds of your drop every time.To sum up Too few weapons too few modes of transport for this game the way it is. It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to wait 2 minutes every time you die to rejoin the action especially when the lobbies are filled in seconds.Still somehow addicting in the few instances you don't get killed 20 seconds in or die running in a bee line for the center.

2018-09-26,0,0,1402,False,Recommended,I have a strong love hate relationship when it comes to this game. One day I'll have multiple 5+ kill games and win a couple dinners and the next I'll be dying before I see people and never even get a shot off half the time. I really hope this game fixes its server issues and opens up a NA west server because getting 100+ ping in the midwest is aids. Despite its faults though no game has ever brought me as much enjoyment and thrill as this game. That's pretty much the only reason why I'm willing to give this a recommendation.If Bluehole gets their act together and really improves this game I'll probably go full fanboy again. If they fail to do so I'll probably jump ship with Blackout and only play this when major updates come around. I wish this game had fallen into the hands of more competent developers but beggers can't be choosers I guess. I've tried most of the other Battle Royale games (Fortnite IoN RoE Realm Royale H1Z1) and none of them even compare to PUBG for me. I do realize Fortnite is the better game but I just can't get into it. I really hope Bluehole can do something to seriously impress me and make me fall in love with this game again but maybe I'm holding onto a thread of hope. I will always recommend this game though because its like that crazy ex that gives the best head. No matter what I'll always want to go back and scratch that itch.UPDATE 10/23/18 I'm a man of my word and I said if they fixed update 22s lobby connection issues I would change my review back to positive. That being said I am still on a Blackout binge and I probably won't be playing this again until they make some big updates. Love the game and always will but I have a shiny new toy.

2018-01-23,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,"Well its good enough just and involved enough to stay interesting for now. Average PC peformance at best it will struggle on many PC's and laptops but is MUCH better after the latest driver release from NVIDIA. Stll a glitchy little bugger at times but decent graphics and good if long winded gameplay. Collect hide stalk get shot from behind. Many complain about hackers but to be honest I havent been able to notice the huge numbers of them yet. But they are definately there.Aiming and the interface is a little clunky and aiming down sights feels as wooly as a battlefeild game. Very realistic bullet mechanics I must say and no real way of intuitively predicting without practice. Difficult to master a long shot or even close range at times. Despite its flaws it just about passes not going back for refund so sticking with it for a while. No easy way of finding a clan or team but going through ""discord"" can work.Lack of content is the main issue no chance of having a jungle map in the future I suspect as it would probably even melt the met office computer.One thing I will say is that the game is pretty much got a massive flaw from the start. A reduced map area over time is still open to abuse and poor goodwill among players. It also means that by the time the map is reduced to a small area of effect there are maybe 10 20 players left. This provides an impetus for even the most avid camper and can also give advantage to people who are more aggressive and can aim better (or teams). So whilst a good idea there probably should have been a better strategy of forcing gamers to move there camping asses. Like UAV's etc would have been a better idea. Also the crate system is pure",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-28,0,0,868,False,Not Recommended,I am here about to delete my PUBG and figured I would write a fair review before I do so. 850+ Hours in this gameLoved the realistic type graphics and the general idea of gameplay for a Battle Royal. But there are more bugs in the game than well written code. Months and months ago BlueHole was updating and creating hot fixes for little bugs every week or so. Over time these became more and more delayed along with ignoring game breaking bugs and cheats. When Fortnite started to pick up pace PUBG started to copy the little things instead of FULLY completing their product. THEY DIDNT EVEN DO THIS BEFORE THE OFFICIAL RELEASE. I have endless clips of bugs and game breaking elements that I sent in. None were ever addressed nor do I think they want to put the hours into fixing the game. s new focus Emotes Skins more bs microtransactions (WE PAYED FOR THE GAME BY THE WAY PLEASE FIX IT) Stopped consistent hot fixes Stopped consistent large bug fixing patches no innovation/creativity behind game The one thing that changed while playing over the months was a vaulting system that was questionable (but good direction) addition of new weapons (not enough if you ask me) and a super NEW (some people love it to be fair) map. (2nd map introduced) I had lots of fun at first but playing a broken game and being promised it would be better for months on end becomes very annoying. Your friends make the game anyways so take them and play a better game! Just play fortnite for a battle royal and if you want a more realistic element look into games like Rainbow Six Siege. But PUBG will just take your money and time. 1/10 RATING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME OWNING6/10 If I only played it for 1/10 of the time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It seems that its developers are in a state of delusion or just plain incompetent when it comes to programing. For instance this last upgrade has sent numerus systems into a tailspin and players have to go through extensive reprograming of there system files just to get the game to work. well even after following instructions that lead you through the back end of gaming files and restarting your computer a few times the ""operation fix pubG"" may still not work on some cpu's.

2018-10-17,0,0,246,False,Not Recommended,"TLDR Had a great time exactly game I wanted at first. Sliding quality has led me to recommend potential buyers to HOLD in the meantime until PUBG can return to the postive experience.Playing in early access and throughout it's life I can say that I have truely enjoyed myself the highstakes competition and euphoria of that ""chicken dinner."" The Battlegrounds dev team and Playerunkown himself have put a lot of love and inguinuity into PUBG its alpha beta and release not in the least as the first real attempt at releasing a standalone battle royale game (starting as an ARMA mod of course!). The devs have the right idea with new locations new guns new attachments better auto controls.HOWEVER followed by a big BUT. I am writing this as a negative recommendation due to the deteriorating quality of gameplay compared to development time the whole experience has significantly faultered in quality of late. Several massive issue (not including the whole cheaters mess) have slowly grown to what I can call an elephant in this every crowding room sync issues confusing Menu and UI microtransactions and bait n switch item tactics show me that the dev team has not put true heart into what should be considered a battle royale crown jewel. Metaphorically you do not use spit and sandpaper to clean a 100 carat dimond.The deteriorating quality of gameplay is a bit of a hearbreak. I emplore the dev team to find new motivation learn from growing critisism abandon their eagerness for post sale monetization and build the game back to the grand battle royal experience. In the meantime I would tell fellow gamers to hold their money and invest elsewhere.PS graphic improvements wouldnt hurt either.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

We the customers who paid to establish this product were told we were racists xenophobes and that we needed to ing grow up.In over a year since the games official release there are still game destroying glitches on the first map that anybody who knows about them can exploit. For almost a year. THIS GAME WAS ONLY THAT ONE MAP! We reported bugs were ignored spoke out about it and were banned from blueholes forums.

No talk of a new game no talk of establishing better servers etc. I'm done.The lag and desynch are terrible. Players with higher ping are rewarded. The player with higher ping will have the advantage of only hits registering within the first 5 seconds of the enounter. This will never be fixed.

It is scattered with t crates money making schemes and they say the fix bugs and issues with the game but what I have found is that they have only made the game worse instead of optimizing it. And don't get me wrong I have more than a powerful computer to run it it just seems that it gets worse and worse as time goes by. I cant even load into the game properly anymore because of whatever reason...it just takes ages to load. I honestly wished it stayed in its older stages back before its official release. Its sad to see such a great game go down the drain.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-20,0,0,582,False,Recommended,I reccomend but there are multiple huge problems with PUBG.one. Fix your damn landing system. It is the shttiest out of all the battle royale games. If I land on top of radio tower at military base do not glitch out and spawn me next to it 50+ feet in the air just so i can fall to my death.two. REGION LOCK CHINA. Im sick and tired of playing random 4 man squads on the north american servers and getting stuck playing with 3 Chinese players that do not speak my language (this happens literally 90% of the time).three. Fix the hacker problem. Too many times have I been having a great game (aside from almost dying from parachuting and the fact I cannot communicate with a single one of my teammates) and then all the sudden I will get killed so I dont think much of it. I check death cam to review how I died and to my surprise or lack of one now as this happens about 1 in 15 games there is a person on the complete opposite side of the map from me and they have locked onto my character and killed me with a pump shotgun from miles away.four. Please listen to the community and fix the things that need to be fixed. We honestly dont care if you changed the energy drink texture. It makes not difference and its a waste of an update.Other than that this game is flawless. Even with these problems I can still sometimes enjoy myself but fixing these is very important to a lot of the PUBG community as fixing these problems are vital to making this game successful.6.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-24,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,This game could have been amazing but the developers are the reason for its downfall.When this game came out it was unpolished and didnt work well much like it does now. The developers have done nothing to stop cheating they have banned people for honking horns and they are selling loot boxes and in game items like EA wish they could do. Instead of fixing the current content they release more broken content and MORE LOOTBOXES. The currently loot sets are up to $20 now which was the cost of the game when it first released. Not only that but they game still doesnt work. Hit registration doesnt make sense recoil is a joke and you can kiss region locking goodbye.just to show you what kind of developers these guys are. In the time of its release they have put ads into the game for chinese clients they have added lootboxes and cosmetic items (breaking their promise) they brought the game out of early access just to raise the price tag AND NOW THEY ARE SUING THE COMPANY THAT MADE FORTNITE. PUBG RUNS THE ENGINE THAT EPIC GAMES DEVELOPED. THEY ARE SUING THE COMPANY THAT MADE THE ENGINE BECAUSE THEY MADE A SUPIRIOR GAME AND DIDNT GO CASH GRAB.I hate fortnite too just saying its superior.PUBG is going to dwindle off and die like it should. I hope this developer gets countersued and buried in so much that player unknown loses everything.Update CSGO is now free go play it and do the 16 man mode its more interesting than this game.

This game defintely falls under that category. Every match is different Every match is fun and most matches have an element of suspense too.I strongly recommend this game and I strongly suggest you get a couple friends together to play it.NOWI can sadly no longer reccomend this game to ANYONE because of literally countless bugs glitches and honestly the game is just a huge mess. It runs on a HIGHLY modified version of Unreal engine and ill tell you.. it sucks! ever since 1.0 the game has gone severely downhill the devs care only about adding useless t to spark interest in the game while overlooking every single thing that makes the game actually work.In the past year 1. the menu has gone from a clean looking and good sounding place to an utter MESS of adverisements for streamers and new useless features2. the landscape has gone from a vibrant green map to a dull almost smoggy and grey feeling one (and im talking about the same map they just found a way to make it look bad.) 3. countless bugs have arisen due to oversight of worthless devs and worst of all Brendon Greene himself.But what really bothers me is that not only is the game a dumpster fire but the devs just sit there and watch it burn and the features they add are just adding fuel to the flames. THE DEVS JUST DONT CARE but worst of all they still want $30 for their game that is currently on life support.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,614,False,Not Recommended,Hello.The nice thing is this miracle game.Big hopes from the start big promises by devs but nothing at the finish. But actually not at all looking so bad.I started playing this game almost from the start of this project. I saw different bugs sometimes it was unbelieveble but it was good anyway. To be honest when i started this game i liked it. It was something new and good on the market. The game with the big future but now not all of my thoughts are positive.Long time ago i told to my friend that this game will have a lot of skins and weapons skins aswell and as i told this game will be like a cosmetic garbage. Now game looks like Gucci Gang with bugs freezes but what a graphic... I like the world in game i like the first map where i started. It was good experience but now its nothing to me.I dont even know how pro league living there.. Its not a game for pro scene. (imho).Cheaters glitches. Devs do nothingWill i recommend this game? Yes and no. If you want to have some fun and price isnt big for you. Buy. If you wanted to try it long time ago but only was watching videos on youtube and still want this buy. I dont like this game for many reasons and im writing only my own thoughts. Why i will not recommend this game Devs are always lying. Imagine that your parents told to you that on the weekend they will go with to the scatepark in the cinema or to the amusement park but instead of that they are going to their friends in the evening and in the moment where they putting coats they aare going to say to you that you have to go to bed at 11. And you know they dont care that you were waiting for the weekend the whole week. They just left you alone at home.All promises from devs looks like this short story.Cheaters glitches in 50% times community is awful. Not tradable items. Hit reg made in Hogwarts.This game get hyped so fast. We had a lot of good times in this game. But buy it or not its your choice.Now at this moment or in the moments when i have nothing to do i'm never launching this game because it's dead for me.Thank you for your time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-08,0,0,67,False,Not Recommended,While PUBG went into early access as a revolutionary game creating massive hype and many heart stopping moments it never really left early access. The game plays extremely poorly mostly due to what seems like lack of optimization and the faulty game engine. You need to have extremely powerful pc to be able to run this game properly and in good graphics so that you can enjoy it properly. Often those components cost too much so most people can't afford them (exp. GTX 1080 GTX 1080 Ti RX Vega... ) After that the money issue. It costs 30$ and even though that isn't expensive as other games for the game that was in early acces and badly optimize with massive multiplayer it sure is. If you want to buy the game wait until its 10$ or 15$ or possible when its free to play. Otherwise don't waste money. Cheater problem. Really soon after the game was released cheating began to be a common thing. Cheats such as wallhack aimbot teleporting flying and other... was pretty much constant. The issue was partly solved due to ban waves new anti cheat and report system but still you can find cheaters when you play. The game has no story. You just jump out of the plane land loot and then shoot who ever you see. In the begging it was really fun and exciting especially when you play with friends over time it just gets boring and repetitive. Nothing is new other the occasion new map or weapon in the drop that you rarely have a chace to loot. Microtransactions problem. What is it with those microtransactions ? What is the purpose other to rip off money from people ? You can buy skins but you can't trade them ? You can buy the skin and clothes that you can practically loot then in the game. The maps are huge and there are 100 people and everything is so far away so nobody will actually check you skin or clothes. On the market they are expensive some of them cost as much as the game and more but you can still loot them in the game. So the only purpose is that if you buy them they will be shown in your inventory and your wallet will be dry . All in all it's a bit fun game when you play it with friends but due to too many flaws i wouldn't recommend this game at this time at this price. If its on sale or when if free for weekend try it out and decide for yourself.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-04,0,0,1010,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY! I've played this game for over 1000 hours. It was fun at first but when the hackers and performance problems lingered it was time to move on. I've been looking for something to replace it ever since. Fortnite is too dumbed down for me to enjoy however the Call of Duty Black Ops 4 Beta was promising enough for me to switch. On to something better. To the Deveolopers Thank you for trying. I know its not easy to make a game like this. Performance optimization is one of the hardest things to fix. I think you would have less cheaters if there was not money to be made from selling skins to other players. I made a fair amount of money selling crates to other players but ultimately that system incentivises cheating. If you sold skins the way League of Legends did I would have given you a lot more of my money. Best of luck.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-28,0,0,422,False,Not Recommended,"The game is fun and the squad based fighting is just amazing. It really is fun and I rather dislike battle royal games only one I liked so far. Every game feels completely different and unique with how much of it is randomized. Very fun.. However I cannot recommend it for the following reasons 1. HACKERS There are a ton of Chinese hackers and they are not really doing anything to stop it. They could at least region lock China to stop about 99% of the hackers. Oh and the hacking is horrible snapping insta killing insta killing from 1 000m insta killing through mountains buildings etc. And there is nothing better than struggling and getting to the top 5 just for a hacker to kill you after all your hardwork.2. LAG The game is very laggy with terrible netcode. You will very frequently die in a fight after going behind cover just because of the lag.3. MICROTRANSACTIONSI wouldn't mind all that much it is afterall a 30 dollar game however you will open probably around 3 4 chests every week if you play casually and do okay. Before you could just open these and enjoy now most of them will be behind paywall a 2.5 dollar paywall. You used to feel some small reward for playing now it just feels like a punishment. ""Oh you did well and earned some chests? Oh well now you have to pay to unlock those 'rewards'!"". EA level garbage.4. GRAPHICSLike high graphics with max view range? BAD! WRONG! Put most of your settings to very low and put view distance to the lowest possible. You cripple yourself if you don't. With lower view distance grass disappears after about 100m giving you a HUGE advantage as people can't just prone and hide in grass. Absolutely moronic.For the most popular game on steam ever this is just unacceptable. Stopping the out of control hacking should of been their priority before microtransaction money grabs. I suspect they don't really have a solution and don't really care (i.e. no region lock of China).",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-15,0,0,94,False,Recommended,I really like this game. Its a good combination of desire fun excitment nervousness and skill. It is very good at accomplishing satisfaction for example In the begining you decide where to land (Desire) high risk good loot low risk bad loot . Now when you do land you start scrambling for loot before anyone else. Once finished you most likely will need a vehicle (especially on Mirimar.) But toward the halfway mark there will be an air drop. Again high risk good loot low risk bad loot and the airdrop is EXTREMELY high risk with players aiming at every square inch of the crate (Skill) but after that comes the Top 10. The top is when things get real the remaining 10 players all in a small cirlce you also most likely don't know where they are so you have to listen VERY carefully (Nervousness). Lets say you made it to just one other person your blood is boiling heart pumping finally you see him and BOOM. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! (Satisfaction).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The dull loading screen with the pubg icon should be changed into something moving because you don't know how much it loaded.

It happens sometimes but not as frequent as previously. Region lock helps too although worked the opposite on the first day of that update.. Anyway I like it again and recommend it. PREVIOUS REVIEW That's it. I'm done. I'm ing done with this game. I've been playing since May 2017. 408 hours. Had a blast until they released it from EA. Ever since then it's been worse and worse with every single patch. 408 hours and I feel like I'm a ing gear delivery guy. I'm shooting at a ing guy 10 meters from me M4 fully geared up 40 bullets go into him he turns around and kills me with 3 shots. I look at the kill cam and the guy heard me walk turned around and killed me but I haven't fired a single bullet. What the ? Or I'm shooting at someone further away and my shots disappear. I'm not hitting the target (who is prone on a slope) and my bullets are not hitting the ground. Where the are my bullets going then?Oh and another thing. Recently after one of those excellent patches the game started dropping FPS. I get 60fps when I'm outside ultra everything etc then I enter a ing shed and it drops to 30fps... ON A ING 1080Ti !!!!!!! What the am I supposed to do then??? Buy a better card? There aren't any! you PUBG Corp. Go ahead and release new maps and new ing clothes. You lost it anyway. To a cartoon game. Because they knew what to focus on. No wonder you're dropping the price. All those bad reviews are 100% correct.I do not recommend this game to anyone. Uninstalled.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,1779,False,Recommended,Reviewed 12/20/2017 RECOMMENDEDMy first review ever. This game is revolutinary. I honestly mean it. If you ever played Tlou Factions and had to 1v10 a group of people this is the feeling your gonna get but 10x more. Its all about skill mind games and being one step ahead of your opponent. Yes there are a number of hackers you will come across thats really the only down side and bluehole needs to be on top of their game to stop this but other than that i give this game 9.9/10 the .1 being hackers!UPDATE 6/4/2018 NOT RECOMMENDEDThis game needs to be optimized to the max. Fartnut has it down to a T when it comes to optimization AND content. PUBG stopped skin trades stopped free crates and theyre constantly holding back updates on these features. Im still a fan but i see my favorite game going downhill. Look at my hours Bluehole listen to your fans and players! open up the market again! release AVIATOR CRATES to the market! OPTIMIZE THE FPS! You are losing your crown to all the clones and theyre doing it BETTERUPDATE 11/23/2018 RECOMMENDEDThey fixed alot of the issues that the community was concerend about now i get an average of 75fps that would drop only in certain situations that seem rare for about 20fps drop the servers dont seem laggy anymore to me and im connected through ethernet cable. Market is open again but no trading. Give the game a go,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-24,0,0,919,False,Recommended,This is legit one of the hardest games I've played in my loife. I have played this game for an unholy amount of hours and I'm still learning and I am somewhat still bad at the game after SO long playing I still suck big pp at PUBG.No less it's a great game the best BR game in my opinion the maps (notice how it's plural unlike fortnite.) are all really fun and all different. It's more realistic than fortnite too if you care about that.All in all PUBG is still interesting and fun most days I play it even after all this time. However there are still a few annoying problems witht he game that really grind my gears. For example the driving in pubg is appalling the simplist mechanics for driving are completely broken. In general there are a few glitches that still exist. With the game being so successful I expected the bugs to be fixed by now but no guess not. If you have friends and are somewhat into FPS games AND most importantly you can deal with the game being as hard as it is you will be more than happy with this game.9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-01,0,0,125,False,Not Recommended,Today I came to evaluate this game very seriously.In theory it's a great game but it's been badly ruined by the developers'mindlessness rampant plug ins and missealing.In order to make money developers launched a variety of clothes and gun skins after the game went live most of which were very expensive such as a key that opened the Spring Equinox box and sold for 18 yuan ($2.5). There are also changes in the content of the game the original version of Thomson and 98K belong to the airdrop now the game content is greatly changed so that some old players have to re familiar with the rules of the game. Now pubg is panicked when it sees a huge drop in the number of players and comes up with an old version of the model (I forgot the name) that wants to save the old players. Then there's the plug in problem and now the game is full of plug ins acceleration locks perspective self aiming through the wall...! Surprisingly the game hall all kinds of publicity plug in pubg has no ability to manage so indulge and those publicity plug in will not get off the plane (reason I think). Finally is the issue of mis sealing teammates hang up they also have to be implicated teammates fly hanging you will be blocked teammates open materials show hanging you will be blocked! Even if you use a grenade to kill several people the system will judge you to be a plug in!I hope that pubg can collect the suggestions of the majority of players do not blindly pursue the interests when the players are satisfied the interests naturally exist the players are not satisfied you are likely to have no money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Being someone that has played pretty much every big title for the past 10 years this is definantly up there and its not even fully released. this game has a lot of potential and with server stability updates and the slow introduction of more maps/weapons it could really take off and hold its popularity.Ive never played Fps on a pc previous to this (competitive fps) but this was so easy to jump into and enjoy even if your skills arent there from previous experience.

2018-03-07,0,0,1097,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?Mistakes / poor decisions First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players but I guess they went with the cheaper solution. Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping. No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection. Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes so you play to get your points to get the rewards and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace). Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player. STEREO sound... what year is this?? Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest slowing the circles down a bit etc. But compared to the above points these are pretty minor.What would make this game better? Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate. Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate). Actually ban cheaters (IP MAC address etc.). I know there are ways around it but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game. Sell rare items like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace so keep that if you must but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items) it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50 they would make millions. Win win for everyone.If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff. Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their I will never buy a key to open one and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward greedy Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.If they made these changes I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.Why is it so popular then? It's exciting really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn so everything you do matters and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you where to drop what to loot how long to spend looting where to go when to go there when to fight when to flee etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo duo or squads each mode changing the way you play the game.All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them) or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window sill etc.The most frustrating thing about all that is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese and they make a lot of money from them especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism that's fact.There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers many of them are cheaters some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short sighted money grab when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm surprised that I liked this game as much as I do cause I'm not that good at competitive shooters. You can play in a squad of two to four people or just you against the world. Each game starts with about 100 people the last person or squad alive wins a chicken dinner. In the beginning of the match everyone choose when to drop from the plane that fly across the map and every couple of minutes the play area shrinks damaging everyone outside the circle. You gather armor guns and supplies to survive. The combat is pretty satisfying when people aren't hacking. It still has a couple a bugs but they don't really take any thing away from the game. This is a great pick up and sit down game as well as a spend hours on too. And I give this a 8/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-29,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,I suck pretty damn hard at this game. But for the time I manage to remain alive before I'm gunned down I do enjoy it.I seem to be pretty good at being sneaky and getting to the final small group of people but my cross eyed attempts at weapon handling really let me down. But hey I'm just happy to take part.I love the minute or so of banter at the start of each game you can have a good laugh with people or really rile people up. I managed to get half the plane to jump off at the school on a few occasions to fist fight me. Of course I stayed on the plane and jumped at the other end of the map haha.So I guess I play this game more as a bit of fun than to win. I understand there are some people who take it quite seriously though and thats fine.The whole lootboxing thing is of no interest to me I just grabbed a few bits of clothing from the marketplace for a few pence just so I have a bit of choice. I'm certainly not going to be spending money on keys and crates or whatever the deal is but again some people do that and thats fine. So its there if thats your thing.Theres alot of mixed reviews on this game but I think it comes down to your personal expectations of it. I play a few games now and then for a laugh and I enjoy it. I don't take it seriously or play competitively and thats fun for me.It does seem like the game is headed more in a microtransaction way from what I've seen of these updates recently. Its a shame but its happening alot in gaming these days people gotta make money. New maps and game modes would be nice additions or a more in depth character creation. I'm not sure if these are planned or not but its a couple of things I personally would like to see added instead of lootboxing.This brings me to my conclusion. And its not a good one. Although the game can be fun the constant money grabbing by the devs and lack of attention to fixing bugs and problems is going to kill this game off. There are also many issues with hacking I hear China is one of the main culprits and it seems like the devs are ignoring this or refusing to do anything about it.Stop money grabbing.Stop releasing skins.Fix the game.Add content.Stop hackers.This game had so much potential to be a genre leader for years but thats now been ruined. Just look at the reviews. Mostly negative.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-09,0,0,237,False,Not Recommended,I love this game so damn much. But I can't justify suggesting it to anybody due to the practices of Bluehole. It has been in 1.0 for just about a year now and while many fun things have been added there have been next to 0 optimizations of this game in areas that it desparately needs. The new map Sanhok is great and is a lot of fun but in my mind it's just a little too late. For a 30 dollar game you get brutal lag spikes boatloads of cheaters/hackers car physics that will be like driving a piece of paper into a tornado (seriously you'll just end up at a crazy high velocity and die). This was my favorite game for around a year+. I can't support Bluehole in the direction they've been going while neglecting the most important parts of the game that make it enjoyable for everyone.

Currently it is unplayable. I will update this post if that changes which is highly unlikely Blue Hole dosn't give a hoot they like thier money. Whats even worse is it seams like they care about Game play by allowing you to report. However this results in an additional sale when the hacker rebuys the game... they don't even acknowledge all the types of cheating (there are way to many ways but the aim bots are the worse). SILVER LINING Honing your skills in PUBG has never been easier... Plus giving hackers a taste of real skill has never been sweeter.

2018-11-26,0,0,921,False,Recommended,The grrrr I want to uninstall this piece of #!) %&amp game and never recommend it to anyone days You land together with others and weapons spawn too late or you can not pick up the weapons due to lag/desync/hamster potato servers etc. There is still alot of bad funkyness happening with the animation side of things vs the server and all the animations played vs the animations seen from your opponent. Did that guy lean? Did he really? Death cam did not register it. How the hell did I NOT die there? (A nade gets stuck in a toilet or sink and the damage you take is zero.) A game that does not allow the player to opt in and perform their best. Simply put. The game holds the player from being able to fully operate alot of times. You know you will have a good game when the players of the game turns to talk about the game the match the shots and strategies instead of talking about the lag desync or how broken the game can be at times. This game promotes and rewards action per action chess like movement overall. Find your spot hold position zoom shoot. nade. pray. loot. repeat. There is alot of unpolished stuff going on under the hood here and we all see it while the studio tries to refine the outer layers and fix some of the tricky stuff going on below. Lots of more to add here...But then.... some days and with the right couple of friends in the side seats... this experience are great if you overlook the other funky stuff...The awsome days and fun side of this game That feeling of doing a crazy game wild shooting and lots of action keeping your team alive. Noticing that mid game does a hard circle switch. Burst into tears but your team does not give up you jump into vehicles screaming while you drive through bullet rains and red zones but you somehow manage to survive then shortly after do a drive by and manage to pick up a crate and continue driving into late game and land perfectly on a roof top and go down the stairs... bang goes the flash and manage to kill the last couple of guys.

First of all you guys should implement a map switcher. Secondly i think you should be able to make custom lobbies so you can 1v1 your friends and get better at playing with a certain weapon. Thirdly there should be a night mode in this game because I belive it would be more challenging trying to spot players and a completely different experience than normal in the game.

2018-05-11,0,0,37,False,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battleground's or as it is called for short PUBG is a Battle Royale shooter that puts you in one of two maps with other 99 players. Let me not exaggerate here LARGE maps. Not really exaggerating. There will be alot of walking in game. Which brings me to it's gameplay... For most of my gaming experience I have been walking. Alot of silence and camping in PUBG. Which can be actually boring at times. It brings short bursts (if any) of thrill shooting down a person or team or car (i like the cars).You can actually sell your crates! Which is what I do! Got a decent amount of money of selling them in all honesty. If you play PUBG you should sell your crates (if you are not interested in crates) but you might have the chance of getting a rare weapon skin that you can get even more money with.And the chat or community can be fun! But most times when I am in a VC in the plane or something someone is playing earape music or a horrible meme through the mic. (really hate that can ya' guys stop doing that kthx)And lastly frames oh the frames. This has improved through updates which I am actually pretty happy about. But you are going to need a gaming computer to run this properly. To run it at 1080p 60 or 1080p 30.So then I come up with a full conclusion (2 actually).If you like shooters are okay with waiting and camping and want to make some money from selling crates in the long term or something close to that Go ahead and buy the game.If you like shooters and you hate camping and want non stop action and are okay with still dealing with earape music (buddy that is everywhere) and don't have the PC for it.Don't buy it and go for an alternative (fortnite.I recommend it anyways because it's really not a bad game.The short bursts can be rewarding and those who are prepared to camp and maybe work with thier team mates looting the large maps and having some fun with the proximity voice chat.I listed alot of negatives.

2018-11-21,0,0,1207,False,Recommended,Then there's the general gameplay bugs. You can easily clip on something while driving and then your vehicle is destroyed. This type of bug has never been fixed.Other random collision issues on objects when shooting sometimes you think your shot should clear an object but because a collision model wasn't done correctly the bullet will hit something else. Especially prevalent around window frames the top of fences and walls.The general player base is terrible. There is no region filter so a lot of people get stuck with players who don't speak the same language. I've been demanded by Chinese players to speak Chinese on an Australian server.These are some basic ideas that should have been implemented at the start back in early access.1. Have a language preference. You should be able to select your native language and get paired with other people on the same team who speak your language. This will solve the issue of having team mates you can't communicate with. 2. Default to the server with the lowest ping but also give the choice for server selection.3. The ability to report bugs through the player death cam. You can only report cheating in the current state of the game.Please don't give this company your money. They don't deserve it.I do like the concept of a battle royale game but I'm sure another company will do a much better job. This is what happens when you only care about money instead of improving your product. I have no idea how they can call this a proper launch it's like the game never left early access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Despite the criticisms about technical glitches and lag from the previous versions I am happy to report that the December 28 2017 update of PUBG 1.0 runs super smoothly for me i.e. on a Razer laptop equipped with Nivdia GTX1060. No lag or problem so far. And everyone in the family enjoys both playing it and watching others play. Highly recommended for a family therapy. Here are my recommendations for future developments 1. The next map should definitely take place during winter with a lot of snow white gears etc.2. Enable players to climb up high ladders towers and antenas.3. The crossbow is useless.

2018-04-19,0,0,506,False,Recommended,Up until this most recent update I thought the game was progressing towards a fun game. But as I said this most recent update has turned a fun game into complete bloody diahrea. I can't even turn my character anymore with out experiencing latency issues. I first thought it was the opening rendering that had always occurred like with weapons load in for the first time. But it continued on past that. I then thought okay well it was be my graphic settings since there was a new update maybe they reset ... nope still diahrea. I turned my settings from High and Ultra down to VERY LOW and I still couldn't turn or move with out latency. So I restarted my computer and router/ modem and attempted a second time. Low and behold it was ... Bloody Stool still... This game took a Battle Royal Concept and built upon it and I enjoyed it far more than the others at it's time of release. Then I saw as Fortnite came out with a version of their own. Player unknown watched as the players that filled those servers in pubg then filled the Fortnite BR servers instead. So what did PUBG do in their ultimate wisdom? They added emotes to the game as to think THAT is what they went there for. Not the servers not lagging why would they want a game that didn't lag? I will answer that for you because when there is a guy standing to our left we want to turn our camera and kill him. Instead on Pubg we turn but not to him 90 degrees ... no you turn 180 deg and then die because you lagged while trying to turn and shoot someone....The Dev team really needs to stop worrying about other games they will always be there. The Devs they need to focus on making their game function the way everyone would like it to not how they want it to because they saw it in a different game.Devs if you read this (What a pipe dream that is) focus on your game get the new weather system released get more maps released get done and for Christ's sake OPTIMIZE your damn game. For now I am Up voting you I believe you guys can get it done and done correctly. Do that. But if this game continues to end up more ed up than the last time I played it you will be Down Voted and just be another un happy person ... well more so than I already am ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-08,0,0,259,False,Recommended,November 2018 EDIT PUBG is in a much cleaner state than it was even 6 months ago. With training options better optimizations and more reliable net code. It's not perfect but other than BO4 its the best FPS BR. It's easily a 100hour buyTL DR Don't buy it until the devs get there together use the millions of dollars they have accumulated and fix the boat load of problems and dryed lake of content that is PUBGPUBG is a game I love and also love to hateComing from a background of TF2 and CSGO the idea of having 100 other people starting out at the same place as you and trying to get to be the last one alive seemed like something I would both be good at and have a lot of fun doingThe problem is the game is broken from the core. With an engine that would have been considered average 5 years ago terrible client side hit registration and net code that rivals ubisoft launch server levels of horrid. If you like rubber band guns this is a game for youThe good PUBG is an incredibly fun game with a good team. And there is every now and then a game that will get your heart racing and make you feel like a god. Driving is fun its got an easy to learn hard to master arcadey vibe Weapons have a nice feeling to them and bullet drop feels good enough First person exsists so you arent locked in the third person like you are in other popular royale games.... Getting into a game takes little to no time at all. But if you have a speedy SSD you spend enough time waiting for all the other players to load in that it really makes no diffrence Adrenaline factory The bad Damage feedback is practically non exsistant. Blood splatters dont mean anything half the time and just because you see blood from the head doesnt mean you actually hit them there (I have had highlights with proof and there are youtube videos galore with it) Netcode as mentioned before Player base. The cancer from every oozing inch of the internet has infiltrated this game and makes it so you cant have dry eardrums without having microphones muted RNG sometimes youre blessed with a crate. Sometimes youre blessed with exploring half of po i and somehow only having an a M16 and a shotgun with low ammo and level 1 gear. Othertimes you drop and instantly find an M4 and KAR98 You will die from stupid places. No matter how good you are or how much attention you pay to your surroundings you will die to some form of trash. Nades are insanely powerful and underused Boring gun variety after 20 hours of play Severe lack of maps and map diversity. Seriously generic desert map with 5 diffrent buildings and stupidly open bush camping green boi. Erengel is just more fun in my opinion Weird texture glitches and shuddering. You'll be running and things all over the place on your screen will wiggle and have weird clipped shadows The game gets broken every other update Seriously the net code is awful even after 4 reworks or however many they have had Beefy computer is needed for the game to be enjoyable (in my opinion)Don't buy it until its been polished,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-04,0,0,260,False,Recommended,I hate reviewing games. Absolutely. Hate. But I felt the need to say something about this game because it certainly doesn't deserve the amount of negativity it has. Most of the people you will encounter who will talk poorly about this game will talk about the bugs and how poorly it runs. I currently run a system with 16 GB DDR4 RAM an i5 7600k and a 1060Ti 6GB. Not an incredibly high end system but I don't have trouble running many games at maximum/near maximum settings. Point is I run this game around 150fps without a problem at full Ultra settings. So this game's optimization is perfectly fine. It's not as broken as Ark Survival Evolved is/was I think we can all agree on that. So the bugs in this game. The bugs are ing hilarious. It's rare that you run into a bug that absolutely demolishes the game for you. Sure you can crash your bike into someone's car and send it hurdling miles into the sky but it brings a chuckle out every time. You can take this game as seriously as you'd like but this game is harsh. Personally I've run into less people hacking in this game than I have in Rainbow Six Siege or Counter Strike Global Offensive. To be fair I have more hours in both of those games but the ratio still feels entirely off. If I had to take a guess I would say I've run into a hacker maybe six times total in PUBG. This game is horrid on your own. It's brutal you sweat and try your damn off and it only pays off if you end up being that 1/100 that wins the game. But. If you can get off your and make some friends (Quit clocking months of hours into a game by yourself it's not good for your mentality bb &lt 3) then you'll have a great time. Some of my favorite memories from playing games over the last few years with my friends come from this game. It's buggy and hilarious. Winning feels so gratifying especially when you do it by running people over in a Dacia and wacking people with a pan. I feel that many people take this game too seriously when they play. This isn't CS GO you aren't trying to reach Global Elite and inevitably give up after hitting 2500 hours. No. This is PUBG this game is a great time with friends. All around I'd give it a solid 7.5/10. I have yet to try the new map but from what I have seen the map looks like what the game needs. Smaller more action less walking/driving and a lot more to look at.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However don't even consider solos it will suck out your soul. Infact I am the only one out of my friends who likes the game I find that im constantly defending it. And today I gave up I have officially decided it's a bad game I haven't even mentioned that at least 1 out of 3 games will be ruined by bugs every single game you will have the most t deaths from t bugs or just players hiding the combat is not fun unless it is snipping. So overall im my expert opinion it's a game that will bring you missary for the price of 26.99. Save your money and save your rage don't by PUBG today!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Be expecting that the game may have glitches but don't refund if you don't like it PUBG has gotten better this year than most of the other years which I think is a huge Improvement and the game is coming to be an even better game than it is now.

2018-10-13,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,This game could have been great but it is in the wrong hands. This game needs a development team that listens to its fans but unfortunately they have one that completely ignores its fans. Although this games developers claims it has amazing audio it doesn t. I don t want to be playing a game where when I get shot at i have no idea where I m being shot from. Those reasons I mentioned were minor to me what really killed the game for me is the hackers. This game has an in game marketplace where you can buy crates with battle points which are earned through winning matches. In the crates are a random piece of clothing or weapon skin that you can either equip or sell for real money. This is what brought the hackers in. If you can hack and farm battle points to then purchase crates and sell the things you earn then you can make a good living doing this. I can t stand playing a game where every 5 matches I get undisputedly killed by a hacker.

2017-05-24,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,I've been playing pubg since it's initial steam release and this game has always been massively overrated on every level. For a while it filled a void when the hunger for BR's was overwhelming and people were sick of H1Z1. Pubg has improved greatly overall.HOWEVER! Pubg is still incredibly boring. This game has always had a pacing issue. I just got done playing for around 2 hours and in all that time had 3 gun fights. If you drop hot you could insta die due to loot RNG but if you drop out in the boonies then get ready for 15+ minutes of driving running and looting.The time you spend in this game running from zone to zone looting and driving vastly out numbers the time you ACTUALLY spend in combat. Probably 50% of matches you only get into a fight in the last few circles and the other you have one on drop then another the last few circles. VERY RARELY do you get a match where it is non stop action EXTREMELY RARELY.PUBG is chalked full of boring slow dead time. The maps are far too big and when you do get into a fight it almost always with 4x 8x scopes at range filled with stutter step peeking.None of this is helped by the player bases reactive and defensive play style where they wanna drop in the middle of nowhere or are driving the vehicle your squad is in and don't wanna stop and fight the guys who took a few pot shots at you. Everyone is so consumed with being in the top 10 they ignore that this is a FPS shooter until then.Solos are unbearable because again the massive amounts of dead time in the game and not having people to share that with makes it a chore.There are many BR's out right now and if you are like me fortnite is a little kids game COD everyone is a bullet sponge(although it has the best pacing of all the BR's out right now) H1Z1 is dated asf so all you are left with is PUBG. This game could have been great if it shrank the map size and increased loot spawns so you don't have to loot 50+ houses just to get level 2 armor and 2 decked out guns. Sadly this is never going to happen so we are left with a running sim.6/10Incredibly overrated and all around average from graphics to combat to gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Hello steam wanted to give a quick review on this game months after review this game is very brilliant but suffers from many obvious errors such as lag spikes and many things that cause FPS drops for no particular reason. the maps are beautifully designed and the game always brings a new and vibrant feel every game you play. being a person who loves first person shooters i managed to crunch out many hours in this game with friends and collegues from work. as the hacker issue for me has no been almost non exsistent i have been able to enjoy this game massively and would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a competitve enviroment. The other downsides of this game is it can sometimes be frustrating when radical things happen and the damage and hitbox can sometimes be annoying and doesnt add up. They should develop a new system that can properly disperse damage. I will most likely update this review in the further months if i have decided to completly quit this game.update after another amounf of countless hours and at the time of this update at 1.4k hours i have to say its depressing where the game is at now. its really disappointing that this company couldnt and hasnt fixed the desync issue as for some reason it got worse and worse over the patches i wish this game was where it was at before the big updates such as the sanhok one but so many bugs came with the updates they pushed out and its really sad as im at the point where i may not longer be playing this game im selling all my collected items and wont be playing this game until they fix the issues.update 2 although i quit this game i still believe that this game should win game of the year as it is one of the most played games of the year and up until now it might have been one of the best games on the steam market.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The gameplay makes me want to play a Free to play Battle Royale instead that is a complete knock off of this game probably made in under a week still managing to feel and play better than your title priced at 29 99 .You'd have to pay me a hefty amount of money for me to even consider reinstalling this utter time waste of a game filled with horrible experiences.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Wouldnt be surprised to see this game dies not too far ahead should the developers not fix these basic fundamental elements of a game. A smooth and stable gameplay ahead of ANYTHING else (new skins backgrounds effects textures etc are all secondary) simple and easy to understand. One simply does not and should NOT need an godlike computer setup and internet speed just to run a single damn game smoothly even on low graphic settings.

2017-11-15,0,0,848,False,Recommended,A year ago I reviewed this game in that time several look alikes have come and gone yet PUBG is still here. I have had my monies worth out of this game and the developers have really tried to address a lot of my issues. With all its faults there is really nothing out there that competes and its the only game I feel I am fighting real people. There are cheaters and they have tried to do a lot to combat them but there are cheaters in a lot of online games.

2017-11-05,0,0,216,False,Recommended,Optimization This game is poorly optimized. I will about 20% of the time not load into the game until Im halfway through course of the plane's full ride. Maps They recently created a new map based off of a desert terrain. This new map added many good things like new cars and new buildings but the map itself is not good. The original map is better in almost everyway in my opinion. GunPlay They recently added some new guns to the game. They added a Win94 which I love a lot for early play. They also added a new AR called the AUG which is a better Groza. I like a lot of the guns but they also messed a lot of the older guns.They completely screwed up zeroing distance which messed up sniping and long range battles for most of the players relying on it. They also nerfed the S12k(which is horrible now) and the decided to strip certain guns of the 8x scope privelage. Cars They added several new cars which I love to drive and run my teamates over with but they also need to fix certain things. I was playing a round on a bike and we ran through 3 fences and we went for a fourth but that fence wasnt breakable so we blew up and died. They should make it either all of a certain type of object is breakable or none of them. Others Players When playing this game I almost never play with randos because 97.42% of the time its a 25 year old Chinese Male. When considering to buy this game make sure you have a couple of friends to play it with or it wont be as fun. Overall thought I think this game is very fun with friends but far from what it can possibley be. I would and have reccomended this game to many friends of mine.Optimization 2/5Maps 3/5GunPlay 4/5Cars 4/5Overall 3/5 or 7/10 SaltShaker Reviews,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The price has remained firm at $36.99 CAD dispite pretty much all other games going on sale on Steam multiple times a year.Similarly the gameplay has remained virtually the same as it was when PUBG was Early Access and you still get bugged out and have an unoptomized mess. You want to heat up your whole room and have your fans spinning at 9001 RPM??? Well here's a piece of software for $37 CAD that turns your desktop into a space heater.Honestly play Fortnite COD BO4 or anything else instead.

The menu doesn't load right most of the time. Alot of the time you can't all ""ready up"" without restarting lobby.

So if you are bad at shooting or just unlucky you are gonna die very easy. That means you just spent 15 minutes on nothing.But on the other hand it can be quite entertaining to run arround and loot. The more you play it the more you get used to it. So i actually quite like it ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Can you pick up something to kill your opponent with before he makes a bump in your head with a frying pan and mocks you in a really bad Eastern European accent?At this date it seems like you have about 28 weapons and 40 attachments to loot +/ As the game progresses there is an electrical field that makes the playfield smaller and forces you to engage the opponents until there is one person/team standing victorious. Winner winner chicken dinner.This is a very good game and I think it will be even better when it is complete. As for now it seems like the publisher is keen to update the game.If you don't own the game yet get a copy.

This game is still not fantastic and has some rough edges. The prevalence of Chinese punks is still ridiculous those dorks need to be kept from NA matchmaking. The hit detection / *desync* issues still rear their ugly heads. The in game story is greed af.BUT pubg runs smooth for me. The FPS no longer hitches. The game no longer crashes for me. My bullets *mostly* hit players again. There ARE fewer Chinese in my matches. The Chinese that are in matches cheat *less*.I'm having fun again. I didn't have fun with this game for a LONG time.

Now you can't even select a server where you can enjoy the game without any cheaters because the server is region locked.

2018-07-07,0,0,340,False,Recommended,PUBG is one of those games which you hate but still love to play. This game is really fun to play but is hindered by gobs of issues which at this stage I believe will never be fixed/resolved as the Devs are more focused on milking more and more money out of the pockets of their player base.Instead of fixing severe issues like fps drop/stuttering laggy servers and overall optimisation of the game they are updating the game with more cosmetic items/Weapon Skins to get more money. IMO they even surpassed EA Electronic Arts in terms of Greediness. I really like this game because it's fun and challenging at the same time. I wish this game was never developed by BlueHole or was atleast developed by someone competent enough to develop video games.At last I would say this game is really good besides the issues that are on the end of the Devs I will continue playing it as long as it is fun for me and really hope this game gets fixed one day.PUBG 9/10 BLUEHOLE 4/10Thumbs up is only for the game not for BlueHole,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Neutral things things that aren't necessarily bad but could've been better. Negative things explaining the things that somewhat ruined (my) experience playing this game and/or things in general that need work. Ratings giving a grade to some core concepts of the game. Verdict Final grade and some explanation.IntroI was interested in the BR mode since the Arma III mod launched PUBG gave me the impression it was the same but better. Positive Engaging requires tactical approach. Nice variety of weapons. Airdrops are gathering people resulting in big gun fights Choice between 1st and 3rd person. Available maps are original and nicely made.Neutral Graphics they're not that bad but far from good. Sluggish movement. Servers can often be laggy. Opening doors/vaulting needs some tweaking. throwable object indicator seems off on my screen. Sometimes hard to pinpoint where gunshots are coming from.Negative Optimization The game still suffers since the start from very poor optimization. They did work on this but in my opinion still unacceptable. Vehicles are dangerous can get stuck objects resulting in exploding vehicles. Game crashing often especially in lobby. Render distance is bad if you zoom in with x8 scope on a house you're suddenly playing Minecraft.Ratings Graphics 6 Sound 6 Content 5 Controls 4 Gameplay 5 Verdict 5.2I would lie if i say that i never had fun with this game. I had fun at times while playing with friends but the bugs are so plentiful that it ruined my game experience as well.The game definitly had improvements but were closing in on 2 years of release and i think developers didnt have their priorities set right. Instead of fixing the most crucial and game breaking issues in the game they decided to focus on some sort of DLC and skins neglecting the most important thing of all improving their bug infested frustration causing game.I will definitly try it out once more in some months to see what it has become but in it's current state i just cannot say that i enjoy playing it because of the issues it has.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-25,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,It's a fun game but the experience is annoying and frustrating considering that my game keeps crashing everytime I try to play it. Usually happens 1 3 matches and I'm using a core i7 with 16gb of ddr4 ram and a geforce gtx 1080ti. I'll change this once they fix this. Editors note from April 2018 Ok so I figured out the root cause of the problem. Apparently my video was overclocked out of the box so I had to resort underclocking the GPU. While it did fix the crashes it resorted to a new problem where the match faces network lag but this is only a problem on my end and not everyone on the server so during a battle if this happens most likely the other person is going to win the fight. I have a feeling it has to do with my underclocked GPU as it's trying to keep up with the visual effects happening in the match. Bluehole needs to optimize the game so that it can be overclock and underclock friendly without these issues. I have a strong feeling that they test the game based off of the original nvidia and amd video cards so maybe the game is best played on those types of cards.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-06,0,0,543,False,Not Recommended,A year ago I recommended this game to all my friends. I loved PUBG with all the firefights and ear cancer. The game has been out for almost a year and a lot has changed. It was slow in the beginning but the game was updated to the point of it actually becoming a really competitive shooter. Unfortanetly the passion in my eyes has come to an end. There are far to many hackers playing on the NA server for this game to be fun anymore. Im tired of getting all sweaty 10+ kills a match running down several crates and then get killed by a hacker at the end of the match. What's the point of playing if every match I play ends with me getting shot in the head by a guy who has been watching me through 5 buildings behind a wall on the otherside of a hill. Only to shoot me when a pixel of my head appears on their screen? I cant afford to spend 30 minutes of my life on a game that rewards hackers and punished good players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is by no means perfect or even really finished but it is fun and it is at times both frustrating and hilarious in its occassional bugs.May 27 2018 After the last 2 updates the changes to firearms damage and hit reg This game is broke AF! Probably not worth it yet again. Which is a shame cause for awhile there it was getting fun to play. But I guess Blue Balls is just trying to make some of that sweet sweet micro transaction money cause all they have really made any progress in with PUBG is adding mediocre skins to guns and parachutes and adding stickers randomly to their small assortment of building models. Hey guys maybe make the game playable fun and balanced before you start adding meaningless garbage? Just a thought.September 8 2018 Ok. They may have nailed it. It seems like since the Fix PUBG Campaign started in early august 2018 this game has gotten noticably better. There are still many issues with DSync do to client latency and there are still some occassional bugs... But the weapons seem to finally be balancing out hit boxes are better and the features they have added and are adding in game and in menus are fantastic frame rates are solid and the game looks great. The problem as of now is keeping everyone interested in a game mode (battle Royale) that is styarting to feel played out... I believe this may be to late for this title. It is not going to grow the player base all they can hope to do at this point is lessen the number of players that are just over it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Is PUBG fun yes it's very fun but that doesn't mean that it's good. I just can't fathom how they've had all of this time made so much money and the game is still in the poor state that it is in. Do I recommend this game? Right now... No I would not recommend buying it. If Bluehole wants to step up and fix the mess they've made and turn this into something that has the potential to be one of the best games out there I would have no problem recommending it at that point.

The rush I get the closer the player count gets to 1 does not compare to any other game for me. The gun mechanics in this game are better imo than in any other BR at the moment including Blackout.That being said...PUBG Corp only cares about the money. 90% of the rewards for playing you have to pay real money to unlock. The lean/tilting feels slow and unresponsive compared to R6 Siege. so TLDRIf you dont care about being rewarded for playing the game and are only looking for fun gameplay this game can easily provide a couple hundred hours of fun.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not always...This game manages to raise my heartrate over and over again during intense battles and sophisticated tactics. There is currently no game out there who manages to do that to me! While one match you can decide to go in 'Call of duty style' and 'run and gun' another time you're going for a more stealthy 'fully silenced' approach. It's all possible with PUBG!But the flipside of this is that you sometimes get killed in weird ways. Also I and many other with me are really interested in what the developers actually did with all the money they earned from this game. Because this game lacks optimizations performance and good support. If they used a larger part of the money on actual development I think this game would've gotten more support from the community to eventually grow to one of the biggest e sports games out there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Playing on Asian servers in this game only exacurbates the awful netcode that was never fixed in this game and with pings over 100 the Australian experience of PUBG on SEA servers is lagged enemies almost teleporting around and spotting peeking and killing you before you can react. This game could've been awesome and was a strong competitor to Fortnite because it was realistic and lacked the building aspect of fortnite which many (myself included) found annoying. PUBG had its own crowd and couldve been a major competitor. However the developers were money grubbing scum bags who were only obsessed with making money and sucking streamer coc.k refusing to fix massive problems and driving away most of the playerbase.Rest in hell PUBG you didn't deserve this fate but that fat cun.t Brendan Greene did this to you.Look at how they massacred my boy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,1117,False,Recommended,It's hard to say PUBG is a good game or a bad game. The concept behind the game is brilliant. The execution is almost unforgivable given the resources available to Bluehole. Some moments of gameplay remind players this could be one of the best games in a decade others are nigh unforgivable. I'll start with the good. No modern online fps rewards stealth and tactics like this game does. Proper use of camoflage and cover and people will nearly step on you without noticing. Weapons are balanced and dynamic map design is incredible. Three maps offer a widely variable gameplay experience and success is highly satisfying.Now the bad. This is a split second online shooter with servers running at 30 tics and client client latency is really never effectively lower than about 300ms and often much higher than that. (Modern high end computer proper networking proper broadbad connection etc.. the issue is not on my end.) I am constantly killed by impossible shots only to see in the death cam what's happening on my opponents' screens has little similarity to what occurs on mine. Many other issues have been addressed but without fixing client sync this game will never achieve it's potential. Somebody else will make a similar game and make it right. When they do I will dump this game like it spends its days eating junk food and watching daytime television.P.S. Bluehole calling Fix PUBG a success is an insult. It's We're going into 2019 online FPS games are old enough to have children in school. Stop pretending players don't understand client sync latency compensation and hit detection mechanics. If you don't understand them ask somebody for help. These are core mechanics and you have the resources to make them right. Don't be another EA be another Valve. We could use one.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-02,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,So given that I've logged over a hundred hours into this game after owning it for awhile. . . I think it's safe to say that I can honestly judge my opinion on this game. I think PUBG comes very close to getting it right but through cutting corners it falls short of a game really worth playing. The servers seem to be lagging down lately and the player base must be dropping significantly as the match times take upwards of 5 minutes sometimes. There's a huge problem with cheaters and glitches that randomly mess you up. The graphics are lower end and it's clear the design team is green. The menu system is behind it's mobile and console counterparts. This game probably won't be around for much longer. I'd say save your money and play ring of elyisum for free. You'll get much of the same experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-12-03,0,0,377,False,Recommended,Very fun game at first and really intense and exciting experience if you have never played a battle royale game before. However instead of pushing more content updates the developers decide to focus on cosmetics and paid lootboxes so the gameplay gets boring after awhile with nothing much added aside from a few weapons and a map. Servers are really really bad cheating problem was really big but they managed to tone that down a little. Game needs a progression system or something to keep people hooked. If you have friends to play with there can be many funny and enjoyable moments but playing solo or even duos is pretty boring. CoD blackout or fortnite are probably better battle royale games than pubg.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-03,0,0,590,False,Not Recommended,I loved this game. I built my PC to play this game. I convinced my friends to do the same. It looked like a ton of fun and it met all expectations for a good year. The large amount of downtime and goofy bugs created a perfect recipe for messing around with friends and then suddenly an epic battle would come out of nowhere. The silent solitude of solo games immersed you in what felt like life or death situations where your opponent was just as terrified as you. In game all chat added an extra dynamic for spontaneous exchanges with random people and kept the community vibrant. It was accessible to people who didn't grow up playing shooters and it challenged those who did. The maps are well made. Although there are hiccups the game runs fine overall. All of this added up to a phenomenon which we may never see again.If you're thinking of buying this game you're too late. You missed out. The community is dead. You can't stack boats anymore. All chat has been disabled for some reason. It's a death by 1000 papercuts. They're eliminating all the things which made the game unique to try to position the game as a serious FPS esport. I think that is a terrible idea. Anyone who is interested in that will go play CS GO or something. Unless you have a big group of friends committed to this game I no longer recommend it. I still occassionally play it but the magic is gone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's sad that such a great and fun concept got taken over by a F2P game that honestly is not fun at all.It honestly astonishes me how badly a company can do supporting their own product that made them a crazy amount of money.

Desync has been greatly reduced frame rates are getting better (my 1080 can actually hit in the 144hz range) and weapon and game balance is pretty good allowing for varying styles of play. Still feels highly unpolished with a dire need for QoL improvements but at least now it works on a technical level.Hopefully they keep the momentum going and maybe capitalize on how shallow Blackout turned out to be and Battlefield V's flop as the fragmented population over 6 game modes 3 maps and however many regions has started to adversely affect queue times (good luck getting a Miramar game outside of peak times at least NA FPP).Turns out the pubg killer is still only likely to be pubg in the long run.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

With 3 maps training map custom modes and many other little nuggets added to the game this game has a good foot to stand on. The realistic feel of the game gives a fun yet stressful feel in its hyped moments. PUBG has given my family and friends hours of fun anger and even some laughs. The gun play is enjoyable and fulfilling. Not to say it is perfect in anyway shape or form plus with the rise of really polished competion it is still worth trying. It can feel slower compared to the other BR titles out there. Still has some lack of content in certain aspects of the game (i.e. progress and ranking). Skins sales can give the feel we are getting gouged sometimes.But with that I would still recommend PUBG for BR players new and old.

2018-12-08,0,0,1274,False,Recommended,"PUBG is a game that fulfills what im looking for in a FPS at this time. I started playing very soon after it entered early access and have seen it through all stages of development and at times it can feel a bit broke. The game has improved drastically and I do think that if they continue to ""FIXPUBG"" that it can be a sustaining game in the BR genre. Personaly I've been looking for the most realistic challenging not as hardcore mode like yet fictional game since I got Call if Duty 3. This is the game that is currently available that has been able to meet those needs. Getting kills and wins is still rewarding because the gunplay can be challenging. Each gun has its upsides and downsides that must be weighed when deciding to swap guns or not and can directly impact your abilty to win. The gunplay is among the best I've ever experienced. Getting into a SR duel is a favorite of mine. Trading body shots to ultimately get that headshot is just effin rights bud! sometimes it can feel unfair but I think this is a result of in game decisions. I mean do you really think you should win a gunfight if you decided to run into an open field before making sure someone wasn't behind 2 boulders and tree camping it?Headphones are a must as the sound and lack of HUD notification where you're being shot from can take time to get used to because of that though I feel transported onto the maps as opposed to just running around on a screen. Running...yes this can feel like a running simulator at times but this can be overcome with your choice of play style. I'd recommend hot dropping every match. With hot dropping you're more likely to get into combat and die so you wont be running for miles on end. However that is also the beauty of PUBG because you can play how you want. If you want to drive around all match and fight everyone that shoots at you you can! If you want to hide in the grass and ride the wall all match you can! Playing the smaller maps also makes it feel less cross countryesque but I feel that the running after the first circle is a direct result of in game decisions The in game items and weapons management is something that meets my needs. I can see what's attached to my gun and as long as im not carrying around a bunch of random ammo everything in my bag and what is on the ground easily. There haven't been many instances where I've run into hackers. I've seen a few but playing FPP in NA exclusvely is a mitigating factor. I used to come across a lot of Asian players months ago but I haven't encountered any for a long time but I've also been playing solos for a long time so take that for what it's worth.Currently I find myself needing the new map but I do like that they are adding more skins I just wish I didn't have to pay for them and I wish skins were tied to progression. If the game was free then I'd be more accepting of the number of things one can buy. I despise how you can get locked crates with earned in game currency. It's like ""I just paid you $30 or whatever for the game spent however long enough getting 700 coins to get a locked crate and oh don't mind if you do but now I have to get 1400 coins to get screwed by another locked crate."" Personally what I want to see done is all of the locked crates opened for free attach new skins to challenges make changes so that BP can be used for other things like 7000bp $4.99 or something so that if you really want that new skin but don't want to pay more money then you can grind for it. Or make the game free and give everyone that paid for it like 60000bp and the choice of any single item that's been available except for PLAYERUNKNOWN's Bandana (even though I don't have one). For the most part I continue to play this game because I love the core game and gunplay eventhough it may honestly be the only thing it has going for it but I'm willing to be optimistic because if they fix it then I it'd be hard for me to think of another game that would be able to meet my needs and more.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-19,0,0,161,False,Not Recommended,"NVM. In my previous review i said ""they fixed tons of issues and optimized the game quite a bit"". Then i uninstalled the game because once again they messed up the whole thing and it was a buggy and unplayable game. Now i gave it another chance (i've tried to give it another try like 6 times by now) and what did i find Terrible FPS. At a certain time my PC was able to run it around 90 100 FPS. Right now i get around 30 FPS as soon as i drop and then the rest of the match i get around 54 which is terrible. The servers are trash once again. Bullet reg is terrible player movement seems laggy from time to time and sometimes even with low ping you can't get loot because it will literally put it back on the floor. Sound is even worst. You hear someone coming from the right when its from the left which is stupid considering how important sound is. Sometimes a car or the plane suddenly increases the volume to like 500% which makes impossible to hear anything else than their sounds. Hackers are still a thing. First match i got into i got killed with a pistol from 200m away which makes no sense. Then i spectated the guy and he was literally sniping with a pistol. I reported him but i guess he'll continue to hack.From what i remember they did a campaign called ""Fix PUBG"" but looks like it was only to hype players and make them come back but it ended up being ""Break PUBG More"".Terrible game go invest your money on a game where developers care about the players and not the money they can make by hyping but never delivering.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-25,0,0,2217,False,Not Recommended,"Mixed feelings here and hard decision which way to point the thumb.Let's get one thing straight right from the bat this game is fun and is even more fun with friends. But I have very serious issues with some aspects of it.Mainly net code/servers servers perform poorly which affects the game in various ways e.g. you cannot pick up items you get stuck in doors you see doors closed but they are open for other players you get shot before you see your enemy or after you get to cover cannot see grenades flying your way or you see them bounce elsewhere than they finally explode your bullets disappear your audio is all over the place etc.What I feel is frustrating is the fact that the development team doesn't address this in appropriate manner.Almost year after version 1.0 with many updates and bug fixes the game still doesn't feel right because the source of the ""bugs"" is often poor server performance and it seems like developers are more focused on adding paid cosmetic items (hard to consider them ""micro"" transactions with prices like $10 for some of them) than tackling the issues head on.This game must be FANTASTIC LAN experience with proper server settings but it is somewhat random and at times frustrating online.I am giving this game a negative review not because it is not fun to play. If you are more casual player looking for a little harder game to try out or if you just don't care about the issues I mentioned BY ALL MEANS BUY IT.I give this game negative review because as a competitive player I have a high standards and I don't like the game becoming a cash cow instead of what it deserves to be well optimized e sports title with a team of people behind it who want to make the best possible battle royal game out there.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It has come a long way from it's Early Access beginings and anyone who says it's worse than it was in EA is full of Desync has recently been solved (during routine maintanence no less) hackers are getting squashed region selection is gone and combat feels good most of the time.

Variable zoom 8X and 6x scopes varying reticles on weapons very nice. Improvement of healing in vehicles and what not is a good start.Optimization of course is terrible my PC will max out Crysis but won't on this game.The game has seen a lot of improvement for sure. It is much better off now than it was a while ago. The stuff like vaulting and new map and weapons and what not plus optimization improvements make this game's future look bright.

2018-11-25,0,0,310,False,Not Recommended,Biggest i have seen now. At the beginning nice game and very well made but now after a long period of so called fix PUBG still 500+ bugs. Cars flip over and over and over again. I get hit full life by a car with like 2 miles per hours dead. After a flip with a motor bike i got knocked up into the air about like 5 kilometers. Lobbys won't start. I hit people 5 times at the exact same spot where they hit me 2 times with the same weapon and i got killed and they still had half life. Cars bug into into walls and grounds. Also bugs do exist since the Release. Do i have to mention other examples or is it enough? I would really like to refund this t bader than Wolfteam and also bader than Tetris. Would enjoy every game more. Can i still refund it pls? And Yes i got 300+ hours gametime and now its enough if u think the game can't get worse wait 1 week. I don't care of any wrong written word or wrong grammar.

2017-11-04,0,0,2468,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive) after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60 70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! But alas...you make an idiotic mistake. You end as #2.....that moment will haunt you forever...This is what will happen every game you'll feel rage anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over....until you start the next one.

2018-06-08,0,0,123,False,Recommended,What can I say about this game that hasent already been said. Sure its the most played game on Steam atm but I think when a new Battle Roayle game comes out that is more polished and better designed I think this game is going to die. The devs are very slow to make changes to this buggy mess and are more likely to sue someone for using the BR formula even though they were not the first to do it themselves. I must say if they think they can sue Fortnite and get away with it they are going to be so suprised when they cannot use Epic games Engine for this game anymore. This may be a smaller gripe about the game but its too realistic. Gun shots that hit your body sounds like your hitting metal and not flesh The movement of your character is too clunky and heavy feeling. I know this game is going for that realism but I think it takes it too far. The game even a year later still has bugs and all the devs have done is add a new map and weapons. Not a single thing has been done about the extrodinarily intense recoil of the AKM or the fact shots that should hit when your point blank range from someone and then come to find out in deathcams that not a single shot hit. Overall this game needs a complete overhaul before I can recommend it to anyone. If you like the realism I think this is a good choice for you. But im just warning anyone thinking of playing that it could be too much for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-24,0,0,395,True,Recommended,"An online first person shooter currently the game is not yet fully completed and there is no campaign yet. The game starts off with you on a plane that is slowly crashing the aim is to jump off the plane and loot buildings for weapons and armour to fight against other online players in a quickly closing circle. If you get caught outside the circle you slowly die and as the circle gets smaller the health loss becomes much greater this is known as the blue zone which more often than not will kill you. If you are new to the game be prepared to die a lot in order to learn how to play and hopefully fight back. Im over 100 hours in and I am still bad at this game but it is highly satifying to get more than 1 kill in a game.I quote a friend of mine that has also reviewed this game and I couldn't word it better myself ""Somehow even though this game hates me 90% of the time I still keep racking up the hours of playtime because damn it's good!"" DemolitionDemon.It can be played alone or with a squad of 4. It is highly addictive and a lot of fun with mates.

2017-09-04,0,0,281,False,Recommended,Only reason there are negetive reviews is because people are bad at this game so they blame performance.My friend has an Nvidia 970 and an older gen i5 and he gets a solid 85 100 FPS everywhere.The ingame purchases are all cosmetics and you can buy them by winning points by just playing. You cannot buy crates in game with real currency but you can in the steam store which is optional unlike CSGO where you have to spend money so there is ZERO reason to cry about it you can literally make money on steam playing this game.Andd if you do not like this game which is understandable don't lie and say it runs bad because you're sh!t and die at school all die scrub.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You will give money for a game you won't be able to play.Every game will contain of at least 15 cheaters if you play solo or of at least 70 cheaters if you play Squads. You will never be able to connect to the loby and will always tell you that an Error occured and offer you to ""reconnect"". Reconnect of course will take you back to the ""An Error has Occured"" screen and offer you reconnect again and it will get into an infinite loop of reconnecting. If you EVER get into a game you will try to pick up a rifle or a pistol you'll have to hit your pick up key at least 15 times before it takes the shirt that's under the gun you want to take and get shot. If you ever manage to pick up the gun and load it you will shoot at someone blood will fly out you'll hit them at least 10 times but it will do absolutely no damage to them and they will down you with just one shot from a .45 acp pistol thoguth your Level 3 helmet. Developers have most likely given up on this game since it's made them enough money so they don't have to do anything in their lives anymore. They will never get rid of the cheaters and never fix the servers. This game will never work as one would expect it to. They had more success making a mod for Arma 3 than this load of.... In my opinion all the current developers should be fired and have their names tagged so they can't ever find a job in game industry again.

They bring us scheduled weely and monthly updates which all have new features and fixes. The possibilty of actually finding a glitch in this game has decreased substancially the same goes for cheaters. Maybe i m just lucky to not have found many cheaters but i think others need to understand that this is one of the biggest games in the world and its not going to be perfect but to me its a really fun game and would recommend it to others. Also fortnite is a trash game let it die already.What can i say it's brilliant. I started playing battle royale games with h1 and i liked that too. When pubg came out i was eager to try but my laptop hardly ran it now with a proper pc i can enjoy what ive been missing. I love all of this game (but mostly cause im a fan of br games). The gameplay is realistic which is what i strive for in a game and why im starting to get bored of fortnite. The combat is nice and mostly smooth. And as much as people dislike the new map i think its really fun and i can still enjoy erengal.Pros RealisticGood Graphics (On PC)Combat is funFunny momentsGood rewards (seriously just sell your crates u will get a lot more than opening them)Nice customizationCons Driving Mechanics (but its sometimes funny)bit of lagThe start of the game requires skill to survive but the end is mostly whether the circle is on you or not.I would definately buy this game if you're unsure.

Great game First I was a bit uncertain if I would give an ""Up"" or ""Down"" on this one but with the amount of time and fun I had in it ""Up"" did win with a narrow margin and did come out as my choice.A game unfortunately plagued with an ongoing cheater problem of the highest magnitude So spent a lot of hours in the game with friends but even now after more than a year the cheater infestation is worse than ever why is that?During more of a year of development we have crates and keys and a market and just recently a lobby/friendslist that starts to work only a year later still audio (voip) problems but not as many disconnects as before but still IMO an apparently extremely weak underdeveloped anti cheat package.Sure I understand that any server side check for flying boats and flying cars etc do cost money with the need of more server sided power which do cost but does not unhappy customers the game reputation also cost in real time and definitely in a future venture when they try to sell the next product?There have IMO been many very valid suggestions on how to tighten up the anti cheat without causing a major impact on the server I made a few my self and one from a friend that I know would work and I will give some samples here 1) Grab the replay files after the round is over for lets say the 4 in top or 4 random of the top 20 and let an external server do all the sanity check of speed heal time reload time height distance on kills movement speed and so on so forth from that replay file.Should at least be easy to find flying cars and boats and would not cause any server load cant grab one or no data to grab? Try some more and if not possible flag the account.2) A Server side load efficient client sanity check of the client reported data.During lobby phase use clients stats to decide let's say 3 of 100 clients to monitor for the sake of server side load use stat as selection criteria.During the round could even be in periods do a ""sanity check"" on those selected client's reported data like rate of fire movement speed heal time height movement over water and so on and use result to flag or not. 3 event mode) Self sanitation from tk'ers can easily be achieved by add 5min to 10min block time before you can enter the next match even 5min/tk block time and a 24h event lockout after let's say 10tk's. Popup window for the killed person Was the team kill intentional? YES / NOAnyway Still like the game but not so much the road it's heading down or even lack of a road.IMO some cheap shoot grab it now never mind the future beancounter rulings is probably causing major damage because I have a hard time imagine that gamers/developers with some soul would handle the PUBG big ship of opportunities this bad.Last Personally I hope for some redemption and a bright/brighter future for this game that really had everything going for it. cb99",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Call it hypocritical but the core game is still enjoyable and I'm mainly riding on that high until I inevitably get banned for nothing.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS PUBG Plunkbat or whatever you want to call it is a sensation in more ways than the obvious.Is the game fun absolutely... when it works.Do they update frequently? About enough and they keep it to the important However this does not excuse PUBG Corp. and by extension BlueHole Inc.'s actions that have been brought to attention recently The liberal banning of so called ""stream snipers"" and offering privileged support to popular Twitch streaming personalities over the average user rather than applying proper justice and chastising the streamer for not hiding their map with their streaming overlay.The implementation of microtransactions and a loot box system in Early Access going against a prior statement they made about not going to do such a thing.The poor optimization across the board delivering sub par performance even on the lowest settings.The server issues that result in game breaking lag unfitting of a simultaneously tactical and reaction based game as this. (The BETA servers usually perform smoother than the vanilla ones!)Finally the crashing is just absurd spitting out cryptic error messages and never crashing for the same reason twice alongside rarely being able to rejoin a game following a crash.The implementation of anti ""hate speech"" guidelines for a ""T"" rated action game where the primary goal is to kill everybody.And perhaps the most offensive act being the threat of banishment for editing .ini files to gain performance by reducing graphical fidelity due to the poor optimization every PC game allows the player to edit their .inis to gain clientside convenience over how they configure their game they should just block in the engine any commands that might override the graphics of the game in such a way that they offer an objective advantage to a player over someone playing on in game settings only.While I wholeheartedly enjoy PUBG (like I said when it works) and everything it offers truly I've played nothing quite like it but I seriously advise any prospective buyers to wait until the game is out of Early Access before diving in the strikes against it in its current state I believe make it not worth the $40 not even $20.

Its not optimised very well so you will need at least 16gb of ram for any decent framerate. You'll need the very best internet to lower their +80ms ping though you'd probably still get shot around corners because of desync. You have a huge advantage if you have good internet on this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

BP are useless in this game they've added real currency to the game which disregards BP all together. Even rewarding yourself with a random crate with your BP only to find out the crate you've rewarded yourself with requires a key which costs real money.It's a load of people spend real money to play the game to end up having to reward theself with items to add to their inventory with real money because the in game currency and reward system is ing shitful.Don't recommend play something else.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-23,0,0,752,False,Not Recommended,So after 49.1 hours playing RECENTLY To play this game you will have to accept that YOU cannot cheat but if you are a Twitch streamer (most of whom have thankfully moved on to other games) the developers will allow your cheats in order to rack up as many kills as possible and show how awesome it is to be successful at this game. If you are not a Twitch streamer you will eventually tire of constantly being killed by cheaters from SE Asia. The developers in their infinite wisdom made the servers random. Since they can only control North America the rest of the world does whatever hacking they please. This makes the game into complete garbage.There are people who get 45 kills in a match and average 99% headshots.The cheats are Name Hacks(other players see your name over you at all times) Supply Hacks(other players generate guns from nothing) Headshot Hacks(other players pull the aim button and it centers on your head) Aimbots (other players sights follow you) wall hacks(they can see and shoot through walls) lag hacks(Pull the trigger and your game freezes so you miss) speed hacks(other players move so fast you cant hit them) dodge hacks (other players press q or e while walking so you cant hit them) ammo hacks (their mag never runs out) instant kill hacks(one shot one kill any weapon). Oh there is nothing else to do with the money so you buy crates...that are 99.99% worthless since you rarely get anything useful.I bought it so I'm playing it but...the game is irreparably hacked.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Devs are putting new emotes like that will make big game change but so much fixes and optimization need to be done that should be priority for fixing. At any case i change review to RECOMMEND because in past couple of months only this PUBG is that I am playing in free time.RECENT REVIEW Terrible performance of servers for game that costs 30 euros. Until there is no fix dont pay for this game. So much months waiting and hoping something will change to better but you are always hoping that you will have good 2h of play without network lag. Shame!FIRST REVIEW If you put on side all bugs server stability and performance issues this is one of best FPS that I ever played. Graphics are not on level of another games in this moment on market but gameplay is 10/10. Personaly i prefer big maps slow progressed game 30 minutes round is in my opinion perfect scale. Game have still place for improvements but compared with another games in battle royal franchise this is simulation not arcade game.From another side like I say on begining performance issues server problem can sometimes kill your energy and make your blood presure very high but as soon you jump in next game you will just forget about issues and transfer to new problem loot kill and survive )From this hours spend on game I am suggesting it even if you play only solo games but full potential is playing team.In time writing this review still it is having so much MIXED review results I think game definitly deserve POSITIVE reviews.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Capped it on 60 fps even though I have a gpu that can handle more but I am awfully poor that I cant even buy extra vrams and 144hz monitor to support it. Ive set my settings on the lowest settings to get higher perfomance but the game is still laggy. I would not recommend this game at its current state right now. Oceania servers is dead but I can still play with guys on NA servers decent ping but man the lag. I can move freely no lag spikes but everything is lagging.(December 22 2018) this what the hell is happening the game is broken Im stuck with the menu screen with icy mountains with nothing on it. It says that TSLgame is notresponding on my task manager I ended its task but the game is still running I checked the task manager again its still there but I cant end its taska anymore so I had to restart now my computer is not working and I had to change its bios settings I thought it was my computers thats at fault but when I opened the game again its still the same. Its telling me access denied wtf? I cant even uninstall the game.Everyone is telling me to restart my pc after this I will uninstall and refund this (December 23 2018) I swear to god if this game crashes again I will tell everyone I know who owns to refund this game and play ROE how is this possible BlueHOLE I uninstalled the game but tslgame somehow doesnt want to end its task.

2018-11-22,0,0,833,False,Recommended,This is probably the best game of its type. I know many will disagree but its a true battle royale for these simple reason.1) Loot is random and varied with no benifits or downside beside the weapons inherit atributes.2) The selection of map from large to small to suit all types of game play.3) Realistic mechanics i.e. bullet drop/leading sots.4) The last moments are more intense than any other battle royale making winning feel much more statifying5) Its always fun by yourself or with a team of friends.I know many other will say fortnite is better but a game with chests in the same place/house and people surfing on rockets isnt a battle royale its a clown fiesta of random where someone can pick up the exact same weapon as you but have a better grade and win what should be a fair fight. Not to mention bunny hop shooting battles quick inform themilitary they have to jump up and down while shooting to be victorious.

2018-12-01,0,0,486,False,Not Recommended,I mean I could talk about all the other stuff every other review talks about but the one thing that really me off enough to come write this negative review wasn't even a bug or any lack of optimisation its something far more petty but that I really cant understand. why the hell are crates allowed to land in parts of the water behind the freaking invisible wall in the sea? bc 1) I had no idea there was such a wall for starters (granted its likely bc its a big map and there's nothing at high sea but still) 2) as the name implies it's invisible so the only way to see where it is it's to hit against it and be unable to move forward 3) and lastly I just watched a ton of time going after a crate that in no way was shown to be outside of my reach by the game itself. the crate landed inside the circle normally no problem I went to loot it and look at my surprise when as I'm about to reach it I hit a freaking invisible wall I had no idea existed or at least allowed crates to fall on the other side of it. as I said this is a really petty complaint in comparison the other reviews many that I agree with. but i've never felt the need to write b4 bc I expected the game would improve. but when this happens I feel like the people behind the game couldnt even think of something as simple as somehow telling the player a crate is offside or just not letting the damn thing fall outside boundary. feels like there's a lack of care tbqh.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-18,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,In all honesty Player Unknowns Inconsistent Battlegrounds is the best Mediocre game I can think of at the moment. Why? because between the genuinely enjoyable moments this game provides it has severe persistent quality of life issues the Lag still being the most egregious of them. half the games I've played are smooth while others are rife with rubberbanding characters and bullets that seem fly through hitboxes and even curve around walls. considering most of the game's netcode is still trash after all the patches this isnt a BETA anymore this is a release and it seems like the quality has barely improved past that and YET there are still expensive asf Microtransactions in a game that costs $30 ($10 for a silver skin for one gun) the MOBILE version is free and offers a more complete experience.. wait for COD Blackout or Ring of Elysium to release if you want to play battle royale that s pseudo realistic. if I have to use call of duty as a benchmark on GOOD hit detection GOOD level design and GOOD microtransaction implementation then a lot needs fixing TECHNICAL BREAKDOWN***optimization is terrible. If you dont have anything better than a 960for nvidia users than this game'll be a struggle to run properly in general. summary It's a gigantic pain in the for something that works well 20% of the time. The hardware requirments are pretty insane and even at low resolutions the game tanks. Granted I have a gtx 860m which is very dated by todays standards and it can reach 40 60 frames on all maps with most setting turned down and resolution scale set to 94. still despite all that tinkering the game FPS can drop wildly. During gunfights (THE MAIN PART OF THE GAME) the frame rate can tank from a smooth 60 to as low as 25 in microseconds it's jarring on my hardware and Ive seen similar drops and hitches in much more powerful rigs too. it has to do with the items and the character models guns and gathering loot s with the frame rate so its not the environments of the game but the static objects that kill FPS for some reason. It doenst help that the tickrate (which its claimed to be 60hz) feels below 20hz at one point the servers were at 17HZ. all you need to know is that Low tickrate means you're going to be missing a lot of shots even when youre on target because the animations and server dont refresh fast enough to register your shots. I've had shots visibly GO THRU enemy hitboxes at close range center mass. And sometimes objects in the gameworld will clip thru static objects ie backpack stuck in floorboard even though it looks interactable like this hurts the quality of the game and he devs seem to have no interest in fixing it. to end If the shooting such a main aspect of your game is broke then it wont be an Esport. Ever. Even if streamers and popularity say otherwiseThankfully I havent run into any cheaters but Im in North America where they enforce anti cheat more strictly Asia and Oceana is different. Save your money and yourself from frustration. fighting the flawed mechanics of the game just makes it sweatier not better. This game'll just give you a headache. This isn't entirely some Indie Dev either at first it was but then was acquired by another publisher. the time and money theyve recieved to fix the games issues IS WORTH criticizing. this isnt because fixing the game is too hard and this isnt some small indie studio in this case the devs and publisher are blatantly pockeitng most of the revenue PUBG generates anyways not bothering to care whether the product works or not. SO if you pay $30 full for this game. shame on you .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To survive you need to tame your nerves and ride your fear use strategy tactic and luck.The maps are huge and the weapons are plenty and with beautiful mechanics.Sure there are some bugs but honestly nothing that breaks it and the game has DRASTICALLY improved in the last months. In regard to performance with competitive settings I get reliable 100fps with a gtx970 and 40ms ping on EU servers.While the developers may not be the most skilled they keep working on the game continuosly trying to improve its experience.

2017-08-23,0,0,816,False,Not Recommended,Waste of money DO NOT BUY. In the beginning pubg was a rough playing game so of course early access was expected to lang and have low fps. Then the golden year 2017 early 2018 and the game was looking promising it was running well genuinely fun and was giving me consistently over 80fps on very low settings with a couple things turned up like shaders and textures. With the #fixpubg the light was glowing brighter and the future for the game seemed promising even more so now than before but as soon as that innitiative ended the game once again fell into a buggy and laggy piece of crap. The game constantly gives me splashscreen and i know i've loaded in i can hear the play and look around which changes direction the splashscreen stays on the menu too i have to go into inventory to stop it. Second WHEN I SHOOT A GUN MY FPS GOES FROM A NICE 100 to 3 and almost always results in me getting killed for no reason despite having the time and aim advantage. If you are looking for an alternative look at Ring Of Elysium its made by tencent who run pubg mobile (a far better game) and is free to play. Pubg is no longer early access and a fullpriced game yet they constantly roll out cosmetic garbage instead of fixing their game having spent money when i thoguht the game was looking good i feel so stupid i was like lets buy skins beause the game is getting fun and consistent.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-24,0,0,76,False,Not Recommended,"Battle Royal is fun and PUBG implements what a battle royale fps should be like it has the most realistic visuals and combat systems than any other battle royale game out there. However this game was doomed the moment it was entrusted with a Korean developer team. Koreans absolutely suck at making games and this is a fact. PC Bangs dominate the gaming market in Korea so there is no emphasis on making a ""good and well polished"" game. All Korean developers need to do is make a multiplayer game with a cashcow system such as adding cosmetics and lootboxes which they eventually did in PUBG. There is no real incentive for Bluehole to make this game better by fixing bugs optimizing it better because the real money for them comes from loot boxes and cosmetics.PUBG was ""OFFICIALLY RELEASED"" out of open beta on December 20th 2017 and it did not feel like a fully finished game then and it still does not today November 2018. Optimization is still terrible there are tons of bugs out there hackers roam the servers and Bluehole continues to milk the cow by making PUBG mobile starting COMPETITIVE PUBG when the state of the game is laughable compared to other games and making more cosmetics available.Bluehole made a ton of money from an incomplete game in open beta so why make the game perfect at all if they could just continue the cycle?",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I think the servers simply broke and the developers are not fixing it because of its small playerbase.For players who are playing in big servers such as Asia or North America the game is always laggy and desync is everywhere and this is after I used a gaming VPN.The game developers are not putting effort into the game. This game needs some evolutionary changes instead of just adding new guns and vehicles.Last thing is the anti cheat system. Although hackers are no longer frequently seen in this game obvious cheats are still everywhere. In lots of games that I started there was someone selling hacks using the voice chat.Recently I got banned for literally nothing. I never used any hacks or insulted any players. Playing this game is now more frustrating than enjoying.The reasons I still stick with the game is because it has realistic graphics sounds good shooting mechanics and lots other that other BR games can not beat.

2018-11-29,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,Overall not a bad game. The concept itself is absolutely fantastic and despite its flaws one can still have a great time with it. So why the negative review? Because PUBG Mobile is just so much better! It runs better has better netcode has Facebook friend integration there is better loot it's just as intense while being more accessible and best of all it is FREE! That accessible point might be a bit of a turnoff to some but let me explain. Yes there are some bots in matches especially at early levels enemy fire and footsteps are shown on the map the direction you were hit from is shown on your screen and there is likely some aim assist working alongside the netcode... but so what? It is still challenging intense and most importantly it ends up being more FUN. Isn't that what is important in the end?Now if you are turned off by touch controls here is the best part of it. There is an OFFICIAL EMULATION PORT of PUBG Mobile you can play on your PC. You can download it at https //syzs.qq.com/en/ (in case the link doesn't show Google 'PUBG Mobile PC' and it comes right up). The controls are very similar to the PC version and it has a similar setup to Fortnite in that emulator players are matched up against each other but you can also invite any of your friends playing on mobile into your party. Lightning and Quantum Studios did an incredible job with this title.If you like the idea of PUBG but just find that you are not 337 enough to get ahead in the title or just want to play a better optimized and more accessible version then definitely check out PUBG Mobile PC. You can always move to the Steam version later if you want a greater challenge. Even if you are a PUBG vet you should check this out so you can play with your friends who have phones but not high end PCs. Finally if you enjoy this version let people know about it. There are probably lots of people out there who have had bad experiences with the Steam version and have moved on to other games (coughFortnitecough) and may find PUBG Mobile PC to be the perfect experience for them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-22,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,A fantastic game with heaps of positives and few negatives. However the negatives are the thing that drags this wonderful game down.1. The chinese. They have their own servers but instead decide to invade Aus and U.S servers. I've been team killed often by them since i cannot communicate. Region lock and vpn ban please!2. Lag. I know its a beautiful game but it lags like a on weaker PCs3. You must be a pro instantly. Its too hard and I'd much rather have a tedious rank system than none.Now the Pros 1. Controls are awesome especialy in dire situations2. Maps are pretty big which is good.3.

2018-12-27,0,0,260,False,Recommended,I've had this game from almost the start. I've seen a lot of different changes and bugs that either made the game better or worse. The new Vikendi map is easily the best map they've made. Friends and I have been absolutely hooked on this map since it launched and the new weapons vehicles and challenges really help keep you playing. This game is by no means perfect but you should already know that. The people that hate/complain about this game probably don't have the hardware to really max frames and get the gameplay they want. The engine isn't optimized as much as you'd like which raises the bar of hardware you need. Even still before I got my new PC I could still win while only hitting 30fps (gross I know.) You'll never be able to get a sense of this game if you play it for the 2 hour refund mark and give up. You have to hone your skills and really dive into the locations and tactics that will keep you alive. I'll be playing this game for as long as it's being played.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-22,0,0,431,False,Recommended,Good and fun ballistics and gunplay graphics and visual style is decent (I'd only like some military apparel to go with you know military guns and all).You can customise your character with plenty of clothing items to choose from of various civilian styles I'm still waiting for something I like though pilling up my BP. One set I like I got from a Twitch prime drop and the other few items were ridiculously overpriced on the market (like the black coat). Finding what you want also isn't easy as the game uses the cancerogenic horrible lootbox system lately the new items have also been available as a direct purchase (good) BUT mostly (all the good ones) cost more real money not BP (horrible).The gameplay is often intense and engaging battle royale with 99 (not really at least half of those die within the first 3 minutes...) other people last person (team) is the winner.The game used to have many de sync and network issues and whatnot but recently it's been getting a lot better. I haven't had any bad experiences due to network issues in the last 2 weeks of playing (at the time of writing this comment.The ranking system is broken at the moment I wouldn't recommend 'grinding for rank'.The game is receiving relatively regular updates and patches and seems to be going in a good direction overall there have been several set backs in the form of faulty patches and questionable mechanics released.Overall I enjoy the battle royale gamemode and PU's Battlegrounds offers enjoyable gunplay for it. Based on that I'd recommend it.P.S.

2018-11-23,0,0,612,False,Recommended,Not a bad game but it needs better optimization instead of more content at first.As someone who played both PUBG and Fortnite nearly the same amount of time I can see why people tend to complain about PUBG. At first you have to buy the Game for 30 bucks only to be faced with terribly overpriced In Game Skins (at least they don't give you any advantage and you don't have to buy them but to be honest the Sanhok Event Pass seemed like a scam) Then there are tons of hackers and I can say I've seen many of them. Most of the time they're using an Aimbot or Wallhack (but you can report it after getting killed by them and in the end they often get banned and you receive a message about it but they won't stop to exist in my opinion like in every online game)And like I said in the beginning the game is quite unoptimized. I experienced it myself read about it everywhere and my friends who all have decent machines experienced the same. (but it's hard to tell an example because in my opinion 90 % of the time these are minor issues and the devs are working on it even when it takes a lot of time as you can see)So in the end you can see it's hard to tell wheter to recommend it or not but I guess 600 hours speak for itself D,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now look at the triple A title's trying out the battle royale genre. This game has came a long way from its times with a lot of bugs de sync and frame rate loss whenever a huge update has came out. But right now i would say its playable even for me with bad to mediocre internet connection with my family memebers using the internet most of the time. Only gripe i have is the frame rate drops plus a bit of de dync im having in Vikendi which i hope they can improve upon. I get that its still a new map lot more effects is going on especially with the dynamic weather and the foot prints being there for only 15mins but its honestly hard to tell if the problem is because of de sync due to my internet connection or to frame rate suddenly dipping below 30fps. I have a medium spec pc with every option running on low excpet view distance on medium and i usually get a frame rate of 60+ but never 100+ for me im fine with it being as constant 50+fps and above as i dont have money yet to upgrade to a better gpu(graphics processing unit).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS REVIEW PUBG is a battle royale style game where 100 players are dropped off a plane without weapons and fight to the death on an island till the last player/team wins upon winning or losing the game is reset with the only thing carrying over is your gold you earned in the game for player accessories in short 100 player king of the hill. PROS Still Pretty Popular despite being overtaken by Fortnite but reduced to only a fraction of what it was before Occasional updates to the game although very few map updates it feels lately Very Fun + Thrilling for first 100 hours Stealth is an option Extremely high Victory satisfaction Challenging to the point where winning is quite uncommon Vast variety of playstyles even going to the point of only sitting in bushes the entire game using fists to kill other players Bullet travel and range finding at long ranges Large map that takes multiple matches to discover it all Occasional crate drops in the middle of the zones movement which contain power weapons and items like a ghillie suit the AWP from CS GO (Well its actually the AWM but close enough) M60 Adreneline Syringe etc Unique locations on map often containing good loot Fun for friends up to 4 players (currently may be more players per team later) Customizable outfits CONS While updates are made to the game they can take more than 4 weeks sometimes to make meaning no new content is put out which can lead to repetition While there is occassional bug fixes there are many bugs that I have encountered since launch that still have yet to be fixed even a year later with more bugs being added than I remember the first time Very Buggy High End PC needed for decent framerate Occasional server issues Pre game mic spam goes unpunished often No single player Potentially rage inducing Developers lied to player base stating they wouldn't make micro transactions in PUBG which was during it's time in beta but ended up making battle pass and locked loot boxes like cs go Developers sued Fortnite for ""copying"" them (I'm not a fan of Fortnite but this was a childish reaction to it's popularity) Boring after 100 hours (Personally) On a steady slope downwards in player count over the past year According to some players in Australia the game has severe performance issues as of this review Cheaters are prevelant Developers sometimes ban honest good players in the game because some streamers on Twitch blame ""Stream Sniping"" happening (2017 Version of this review still worth mentioning)My current recommendation for this game is VERY MIXED because while the game has many good points to it there also are many problems which are just as impactful therefore I only recommend it for the first 100 hours of game play (at this point) and for playing with friends unless if you would rather the many other alternatives. As my personal thoughts on the game I would've buy the game again in a heartbeat if it wasn't gifted to me by a friend in 2017 but now I have gotten quite bored of the battle royale genre as a whole and haven't played in around 6 month's as of this update to the review and while I may dislike the game for many reasons it was quite fun.

I can say that I'm quite used to this kind of games.The game was amazingly fun with all this bugs and everything. Over hundred hours of gameplay I've seen only like a 3 or 4 speed hackers. Hey! You can't really blame the publisher for that the game was early access bugs and cheating is understandable.Then 1.0 came nightmare began.If you are an old school FPS player you'd easily understand if someone is cheating or not all you need to do is checking the recoil of the player that you suspect.Maybe it is gone mad after 1.0 maybe always was like that we are just realizing it now. They implemented kill cam I can assure you that there is no other disappointment in the world that can match yours when your squad got killed by 1 man from miles away with his AK 47 with no scope attachment or whatsoever with no recoil at all.The list goes on and on I'm sick of playing this game till the last circle and getting killed by some cheater there. THAT DRIVES YOU MAD. And believe me I ain't no guy who can get mad over a game easily.I don't expect them to remove all cheaters from this game I know that's not possible whatsoever. But facing a cheater every single damn game is so annoying.Also region lock became a must thanks to chinese people using hack on all servers.Till they implement some sort of solid cheat protection and region lock. I will not recommend this game. Please check if there is any update after reading this in case I might forget to update this post if those are solved this game would be the best online game I ever had. If there is no update after a while you probably won't be reading this since the game will die as quickly as it rise.EDIT Now it is much more better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-22,0,0,500,False,Recommended,This review rambles a bit but I'm not a great writer so boo hoo! pWell a while back I left a negative review and deservedly so. But I came back recently and all the problems I'd had seemed to be gone. I no longer question whether or not I should have won a gun fight. Things seem to run really smoothly. No longer am I see micro stutter during gun fights like I always did last year. One criticism is the options in the custom game need to be streamlined BADLY! Different modes are restrctied to certain weapons. I want to have a crossbow warrmode! And why is the VSS mode limited to one map only? What happened to the ability to customize every single weapon option for any game mode? I LOVE war mode but most of the hosts are AFK FFS!! Almost no one in NA plays the custom games except for private matches. I am constantly trying to get a match going but it seems only the AS and EU servers get any players. This may be because of the lack of options for custom matches that used to be available. IDKAnyway the game is as smooth as ROE now. I do think the new snow map is a bit too open. I think a smaller sized map would improve things especially the action. Hot dropping lasts about 2 or 3 minutes before the action dies down for instance. Maybe it's just like that in solo mode.

2017-06-02,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,Honestly want to like this game I really do but the negatives to this game just simply outweigh the positives too much. I used to have fun playing this game but not anymore. The glitches and unoptimization have just become to much to handle. And PUBG Corp has just become greedy and given up on their players they'd rather sue Fortnite instead of fixing this unoptimized garbage. I feel like at this point PUBG is just a complete money grab. A $30 game mind you has MICROTRANSACTIONS. Now this is justifyable if the game is F2P but that is far from the case. It's a shame too as this game really helped pioneer the battle royale game scene and had a lot of potential to be a very great game. But now PUBG has just devolved into a cash grab and a game that is slowly but surely going to die out.I'd rate this game overall a 2/10 it could be a better game if it wasnt so glitchy and unoptimized and if it wasn't such a blatant cash grab.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Third match our fully kittted out squad all died to the same player that knew exactly where each of us were and pelted shots at us even in cover clearly cheating literally shooting at the other side of the wall tracking my movements as i walked from one point to the other i went to revive a teammate in a spot he shouldn't have known only to be hit by 2 grenades and him running inside and prefiring that specific spot...

2018-12-06,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,This game was fun during the initial launch hype (before Fortnite took the nation ) but it has since then gotten bad updates which I do respect the updates being pushed still but its just so toxic and glitchy. It still runs bad on most computers (I run a GTX 1070 Ryzen 5 1400 16GB RAM) Its not that I hate to hate but when there are so many other battle royale style games taking over our generation of gaming this one just doesn't take top anymore. It feels clunky and feels that their nearly putting more hours into graphics and new weapons than they are optimization and good gameplay.

2018-12-02,0,0,1266,False,Recommended,A pragmatic and objective review . Overall The game is frustrating at times but generally quite fun (it's better with friends!). It has some bugs but in my six months of playing things have steadily improved. There's a definite ebb and flow to stability you'll need to be patient as unexpected bugs occur occasionally (usually after major updates but that's pretty standard for the tech industry in general) but generally it's quite playable.. The community of this game is definitely competitive and at times can be quite judgemental but there are definitely good people here too. (I recommend finding a discord server that's associated/affiliated with PUBG).. Driving cars is pretty fun you can do a lot with them in game.. The projectile physics seem pretty spot on and the weapons seem well balanced.. Loot spawning for the larger maps isn't balanced at the time of this review. It's pretty bad you better be prepared to play the game with a pistol sometimes!Regardless of its shortcomings definitely a fun and addictive game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Battlegrounds is the refinement of a new language of play but what may earn it a spot in the video game canon is that conceptual efficiency. It isn t accessible for every player but it s understandable. Anybody can easily learn to read this game to watch it to spot the tension and excitement and drama. Critics and fans have speculated on how PUBG will operate as an esport whether or not its pacing works for competitive play. But that ignores the obvious fact Battlegrounds works as entertainment. Sport or not it has found its audience of players and viewers alike.P.S. Proud to have presented and played this with a crowd on IEM 2018,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-16,0,0,679,False,Recommended,"The following is my Pre Release Review It was negative However after the official release most of the problems have been fixed there are still a fair number of cheaters and hackers but gameplay has improved dramatically. Some work is still needed but I feel the game as it is now warrants a positive review.**********************************If you are playing this game and everyone else is playing fair then it is brilliant. An arena/hunger games style game that is fun to play solo with a mate or even a squad.The biggest issues are 1) The RNG placement of weapons You can hit a house or even an apartment building that has absolutely NO weapons/gear whatsoever while the guy in the next house gets level 3 backpacks helmets body armour a full selection of automatic rifles/smgs/sniper rifles and craploads of ammunition.2) Cheaters There are any number of hacks/code injectors/Aim bots/Kill bots etc that can be downloaded free or for a small charge that make this completely unfair and a waste of money. Why buy a game for $29.99 when all you do is chute in land and get 1 shotted by a guy with a mini uzi from 500m?There are also some guys who can stand there and take 5 shots from a AKM 7.62mm rifle who kill you with a frying pan because they are using an program that sends incorrect info to the servers about being hit.The anti cheat measures in the game are useless In 1 case an update to the program which ""stopped"" cheaters using Aimbots was patched in less then 3 minutes.3) The sheer number of Hackers who dominate the game using these bots makes it impossible to play I recently had a game with my Duo partner we hid in a building for 1/2 the game and saw a group of players single shot more then 40 people with crossbows. When we ran towards the circle and were in the open both myself and my partner were killed within 1 second with crossbow bolts to the head by the same person a weapon that takes 5 seconds to reload and is very inaccurate in the game from over 200 meters... I mean seriously?Look if you can find a match NOT hacked or filled with cheaters this could be a great game. If the developers were more concerned about stopping cheaters rather then helping them (no poof but there are a lot of rumors going around about this game right now) then It would definately be worth the money those people who got it for free were lucky but others like myself who paid full price? We got wroughted.I'd like to give this game a positive rating because it is quite good on the VERY RARE occasion with no cheaters but in it's current state?No.Maybe after it comes out of early access.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Between the desync *yes its still a common problem despite the patching* and the lag that will get you killed behind cover too often the game is still a mess. Not to mention you spend all of your hard earned in game currency on a random crate that will 9 out of 10 times require you to buy a $2.50 key to even unlock meaning even when you do the work to earn your reward you still will usually have to give up real cash to even redeem your reward that will almost certainly be a pair of brown shoes or a dirty stained tank top that looks like it was fished out of a dumpster. None of the issues compare of the overall horrible hitbox recoil mechanics and the general lack of any real optimization. Play Ring of Elysium and skip this game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Lots of people are saying bad servers I havent had ANY trouble with servers could just be people who dont connect to thier region on the lobby screen.I hope the game continues improving such as the vaulting system thats coming up aswell as the future maps.

2018-01-03,0,0,209,False,Not Recommended,EDIT Just Play Rings of Elysium the only reason this game was good was because it was new. Had they fixed the game it would of had alot of potential. Many people hate it because of the hackers and the bugs. There is alot for both i will admit but ive had so many hilarious times with my friends in squads and duos. Even solos tbh. I will agree its annoying as when your killed by a hacker or bugged out and die. My bike literally glitched into a wall and blew me up I also onced bugged into a counter in a kitchen and couldnt escape it eventually having to blow myself up with a grenade cus i wanted the BP. This game has many flaws but the pros outway the cons by miles.The game in Early Access admitidly was a trash bug filled game crap FPS terrible rubber banding and a massive onslaught of hackers. But since the games official release they have fixed the FPS improved the graphics the servers and hit registration have gotten much better and an overall decrease in hackers. This is a great game with few flaws even if theyre big flaws.The game is definatly worth the price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-19,0,0,83,False,Recommended,So. Where to start?I'm honestly going to come right out and say it I love Player Unknown's Battlegrounds. I bought it not to sure about it. A number of my adult friends had been playing Fortnite and I am not a real fan of that game so I was looking for something else and I found this. I knew alot of people played PUBG but I wasn't really sure how fun it would be. Within the first few minutes of playing I immediately fell in love with the game. Compared to Fortnite PUBG is alot better. Bullets and the way they travel is simulated alot better than Fortnite and the maps seem almost endless. I love the variety of guns and how they actually require an amount of skill to get a well placed shot with an SR. I would reccommend this game. This is also the only game I have downloaded in my Steam Library. Now lets get into the details shall we?Pros The game has a four large maps with alot of places to explore and vehicles to run people over with. The gun mechanics alot better than most Battle Royale games (Ahem ahem Ring Of Elysium). Alot of customization though some of it costs money (Alot of money) and I am not really a big fan of spending my dollars to buy a new T Shirt in a video game. But alas customization is always cool! Alot of things to destroy Windows doors tires car engines fences etc. Even if I don't win just playing the game for a bit is always fun! The game requires quite a bit of strategy to which is always good. Lucky for most of you battle royale players their are no Peter Rabbits constantly jumping their way across the maps like Fortnite (Actually that doesn't even deserve to be capitalized!) I mean fortnite.Cons PUBG requires alot of camping strategic waiting in houses which isn't always the best thing so you must have patience young grasshopper. Stuff costs money! (GASP!) For instance with my first few hours in game I unlocked a crate and it was an Aviator Crate! I was excited and went to open it because for those of you who know Aviator Crate has some of the better gear in it. I went to my items and lookie here! You need an Aviator key to unlock the Aviator Crate! That me off pretty bad and almost made me write a complaint but I held back. Oh! Forgot to mention the Aviator Key is $2.50. For one piece of gear. Rip Off. Hope you guys liked the review if I missed anything crucial you would like to mention please do so in the comments. Thanks!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-01,0,0,263,False,Not Recommended,The best battle royal game out there gameplay wise. First hours with it was unlike anything I have ever played. Truly revolutionary. But as a fully released game i got to say it's disappointing. I forgave all the bugs crashes and unoptimization when it was in pre alpha. But now this has turned into a money milking machine. It has more micro transactions than a EA game. $20 for a skin and $10 to change your in game name. This is just madness. Everyone has asked pubg corp. to make replays re playable even after a new update. It's been a year and nothing has changed. But ohh wait something HAS changes...more and more loot crates and skin packs that almost cost as much AS THE WHOLE DAWM GAME. I'm pretty sure it doesn't cost you that much.I loved the game will still have fond memories of it but I don't think I can recommend it in this state anymore.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-11-26,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Most of your playtime will be nonviolent running. Players are only likely to get a handful of kills per match. There is nothing graphic or disturbing about the deaths. Just cuz a game has shooting in it especially if its for the sake of survival doesnt mean its going to derange anyone under 18. If killing in a T rated game like Uncharted wont derange a young teen than this wont either. Game is very basic deathmatch yet in a huge open world where vehicles items and gear are scattered at random. I like how despite the aesthetic the gamendoesnt attempt realism. Health bars are adequate damage is balanced and bullets go wherever you aim. Younger players may be bored. As longs as you dont expect anything fantastical or large scale battlefield devastation pretty much anything can happen if you are patient enough. Every online game has its toxic players. Even the kid friendly Overwatch.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,520,False,Recommended,I really tried hard to like the game. I cannot say that I do after 80 hours. update Still there are issues about liking the game. UPDATE 400+ hours into it and it has become way more entertaining after repeated gaming with my gf. And we became better during the phase. 1. Learning curve it is very steep and requires some time but basically it is a FPS or TPS depending on your settings. You need to find a strategy and some tactic to survive but in the end you will wrap your head around it. It is way more fun together with people/friends. UPDATE Nothing new to it but I seriously recommend playing it with friends and watch some streamers.2. Gameplay UPDATE + mechanics it is simple drop out of a plane look for a good starting point loot drive shoot. Not more... and that is one of the let downs. It has become better since I just play Sanhok since then the loot part is way more easy. UPDATE But there are a couple of mechanics in the game which I just purely HATE Jumping like crazy not only are the pubg soldiers the toughest sons of very nasty women and run around in full speed no they also jump around like some athletes on steroids Russians you could assume. Next thing is the friggin leaning lean to the left and lean to the right... spectate some gamers and see how just purely pathetic they lean towards left and right but the mechanic obviously allows more accuracy. It should be the opposite you are less of a target behind trees but you may shoot but at the moment it is the opposite you are less of a target AND you shoot more accurately. And sadly sometimes the rng of bullets not hitting is annoying. 3. Luck it is also simple... the loot is distributed purely on luck. You may get a good starting point or some lone guy with a rifle picks you apart because you run for 10 minutes with a shot gun on open field and sadly there are no ducks to shoot with it... and even more sadly since you need to be in a zone to survive you need to be heads up to it all the time which requires a car since running for the zone takes ages. And that killed me in the last 10 games five times to be just outside the zone and running senselessly for 15 minutes and not finding ONE vehicle. Frustrating loot things frustrating running and pure random drops on weapons and vehicles. UPDATE Playing on Sanhok is less of a luck thing... so try there. But still the Zone is sometimes annoying and even there you run after it like hifi geek around the super known online shop salesweek. 4. Fun there are fun moments but in the end you need to sit wait for a poor guy to show his head at the wrong time shoot him loot him proceed to the next zone... do the same and HAVE LUCK! Could be called Player Unknown Battlefrustration/Battleluck or any way you might put the words. And I didnt even mention the cheaters. UPDATE Some situations are awkward and I encountered some Chinese cheaters but not too many. Those guys just stayed in my mind. BUT playing more and with another attitude gives some experience and therefore also success. So nowadays often in top ten and also earned some chicken dinners with GF. 5. Performance it is a very consuming game and there are a lot of glitches lag spikes not rendering buildings drop outs the need for restarting the pc and so on... so performancewise it is way below optimum. Need for improvement. UPDATE They improved it a lot. Still there are some issues but it is more stable and less of a problem. So I can nowadays say it is good enough.6. Conclusion At the moment I regret buying it since the 30 Euro I could have invested elsewhere... it has its moments it is addictive but also super frustrating. A nice game for people with paranoia and some skills... but a pain in the a$$ for people with above mentioned problems. UPDATE New conclusion is of a mixed type. There are funny games... but sometimes it is very frustrating and not always good for my nerves... or my keyboard... or my mouse. 7. And more? Well... try it on a free time or watch some vids. Problems is the name of the game Problemsknown Battlegrounds. Cool idea nice features but performance issues like crazy. UPDATE Still there are problems crashes glitches spikes and crazy vehicle stuff BUT.... get your first chicken dinner and you know why... and after houndreds of hours gaming like a dork I became better watched some replays and got some advice and learning by doing you improve and get more secure then a chicken dinner feels seriously earned.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-15,0,0,655,True,Recommended,PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds started off in a rough patch in the earlier times even to this day it still has its qwerks. But the Developers have gone to great lengths to improve their game by adding new content fixing up OPS fixing servers hunting down cheaters/hackers and so much more. They Delivered a solution when there was a problem. They have continually put in the man power to insure the game not only survives in the market but also keep interesting in playable over the course of its realese. This game has been one of the greatest BR I've played. (Obviously not the best but still good). PUBG will give you the fast and fun gameplay of the Battle Royale genre and give you the skills to improve yourself on the platform. whilst also giving you the option to enjoy funny moment's and extreme scenarios with your friends or strangers across the globe. The game still has a lot to fix and a lot of room to improve with things like connections with servers bugs and OPS. But it has gone far over the time span. To conclude my review I would recommend PUBG greatly for those that are looking to start in BR and to gain skills while having fun with other's. FP_DP,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And instead of making an attempt to fix their crappy servers they added new skins ed up the weapon system COMPLETELY and they made the game look uglier than it did when it just came out. Overall I do not recommend this game. Purely because of the way the developers treat it. If your community asks you to fix something please do.

They keep adding new weapons and items that keep the game changing slightly. Slowly releasing new maps. I enjoy all 3 current maps and they play very differently. Cons Too much money grabbing for a game that you already spend money on to play in the first place. I used to not mind throwing a bit of extra money at the developers but it has gotten to the point that a majority of the loot boxes I get require me to purchase a key to open them. The addition of a season pass has made me decide to never spend additional money on this game. I wish I coule rate the game and business practices seperately. I still enjoy the game but the current busness practices make me not want to reccomend the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Until this day there are hackers still roaming around the battleground it is sad to say I don't really like this part and I'm not so sure about how the developers are going to settle with these problems at least the game is still playable and I'm OK with that.After all battleground genre is not for everyone but for this price range it is worth playing it let's not compare this to Fortnite maybe?

It's true there are still some problems which developers have to fight especially optimalization and one thing I can complain is that these changes are being introduced to slowly. Beside that it all goes in a good direction. Anyway I think nowadays it's definitely the best battle royale game on the market which I can recommend to all fans of this genre.

2018-02-01,0,0,464,False,Not Recommended,This is NOT how you make video games. Development is so awful that I can hardly describe how broken this game is. Infinite loading screens (loading finishes when I already landed from the plane) when my rig handles GTA 5 on ultra settings. Awful stereo sound image and sound quality by itself is terrible. These guys should really hire some good sound engineer trust me they can afford it after selling tons of copies for 30$. RAM memory leak. It runs good for first game but longer you play the more game becomes laggy until you go mad and restart it from steam. Graphics are that blurry that people install some third party utilities to sharpen image to spot enemies better. Synchronisation is so bad that you can get shot even when you have already ran behind a wall. No latency compensation cuz devs dont know how to make online shooters at all. Kill cam is absolutely terrible. You can see enemy shooting in one place and bullets flying to other direction. Terrible usage of Unreal engine. While engine by itself is very good movement and driving in this game is the worst I have seen in my life High amount of hackers. Devs dont care when there is a guy in top of a leaderboard with name advertising website with aimbot. Buildings dont load sometimes. They remain as low poly distant 3d mesh even when you are very close to them and you cant enter them. You get stuck somewhere in textures way to often If you alt+tab a game there is a chance you can not go back to game and many more bugs and glitches.And they want 30$ for this unoptimised piece of crap full of bugs.

I havn't played this game in over 6 months simply because bluehole are complete scumbags who care about making money more than finishing their game.

2018-05-08,0,0,299,False,Recommended,"Imma be honest this game is absolutely fantasic! Tho it does require a somewhat good graphic card to make the game feel less choppy. There is also many bugs that causes quite some negative feedback to the game. Such as the extremely buggy death cam i've seen many people raging over how they got killed by the ""hacker"". They would continue raging as how this game is a piece of sh**it and how many hackers there are. I do admit that there are plenty of hackers but what game doesnt? But i can tell from my own experiences that i haven't met a single hacker except for one when i went for the care package and the guy perfectly sprayed me down while i was driving full speed.(Maybe he was just lucky).Another stuff that's been happening is the new big update where they increased the AR's recoil and made some bug fixes+added a new gun. People now are saying SMG's are way too OP. But i feel like this new update forces us to actually aim and percisely burst fire enemies instead of spraying them until one of the bullets hit them in the head by the small recoil before the update was made.I do admit that SMG are pretty good but if you were to get good at ARs you would be much better vs the other people using SMGs.Back to the positives. It really rewards the people who knows how to aim rather than being lucky involves positioning not just point and click with the new nade's deafening effect whenever it blows up near them allows for more strats. Feels amazing to get a kill Feels even more amazing when you get #1This game overall just a feel good kind of game with great strats.(about the hacking ""problem"" i doubt that people actually meets 1 2 hackers EVERY game or two.

2017-05-14,0,0,742,False,Not Recommended,"*Update* My original review was from a couple months after this game came out in early access. Since then I've logged over 800 hours on the game (700+ on live 100+ on test+experiemental branches). After playing so much of PUBG sadly I can't recommend anyone buy this game in its current state. The game uses client side hit registration and the netcode is a mess. These two aspects combined creates an FPS experience more ""laggy"" than old peer to peer hosted CoD titles. If I had a dollar for every time I've been downed or killed even though I was behind cover on my end for multiple seconds I could retire already.The developers say they're working on fixing this and according to the ""Fix PUBG"" campaign it should be done some time this month. But until that happens stay away. Stay FAR away from this game don't get addicted to the concept of it like me and so many other players already have. The gunplay feels amazing in this game...when it works. So at least currently it becomes a game where you're riding the highs of matches that worked perfectly only to have it ruined by ones that are so desynced you get killed through solid objects. Because on your end you got behind cover but on your enemy's end you're still wide open...and for whatever reason this game doesn't have the server reject hits that don't match up with what the server ""sees"" happen first. If a client sends a packet that says ""i got a hit!"" the server just accepts it no matter what. It's incredibly frustrating to deal with and causes more stress than enjoyment to come from the game. If they fix this problem then PUBG is a great game worth picking up. But if not don't bother with it because it's like being in an abusive relationship. The game just keeps slapping you around with desync but every once in a while gives you a great experience to make you forgive it. Original Review I was super skeptical of this game at first. But after playing it for a couple of hours it's a blast. If you like PvP games that actually can get your heart pounding I highly recommend it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm not even someone who expecting changes that would benefit my experience but many other players experiences. The core issue of this game is the over whelming Chinese and Vietmanese players who are cheating non stop for 2k hours plus on accounts without seeing bans. This is just like the CS GO epidemic but far worse. CS GO system is dodgable in terms of cheating which the community has known for sometime now with no fix. CS GO ATLEAST GETS PLAYERS BANNED atleast some of them while PUBG many of the cheaters that I see never get banned. They all have chinese names or vietmanese accounts... even in duos watching them cheat isn't enough for my report to mean anything. This game is awesome but ing blows and doesn't deserve 30bucks. It doesnt deserve any money. give the game 8.5/10... give the community 1/10 all i get is chinese in my duos who don't speak a little bit of english.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you play the game for how long I played you can really see that this game is going down hill. Some bugs like invisible barriers are still in the game even after half a year.The developers are taking a completely wrong turn with squeezing every single penny out of the game while they still can. Instead of fixing bugs and putting more content in the game to keep the game fresh they keep adding new skins and loot boxes in the game. And let's not forget about the hackers becauese there are a ton of them.

The grand majority of the time you'll die without ever seeing who shot you and the game controls like too. I can't really explain it but in any other game I can dome someone from 100m but in this one I can't even shoot someone point blank accurately. Could be my computer but I can run Dark Souls 3 just fine so if I'm having trouble with this game then it's probably still optimized poorly. Either way I just can't have fun with this.

2018-09-03,0,0,160,False,Recommended,"So I feel like most of these reviews either do not play multiplayer games much or they are just ragging on this game for vague and pointless reasons like ""poor optimization"" which only shows they do not know what the word optimization means. I used to drop in and wait in the grass while the surroundings load in now its always loaded before i get near the ground. The game is optimized your connection will be the bottleneck for most of the game breaking bugs that are possible. Decent connection ignoring most bugs that are mentioned in the reviews.The game is alot of fun escpecially with friends. Less kiddy than Fortnite but more relaxed than games like CoD or Tom Clancy stuff. That being said it's not the easiet of games if you are not on point with aiming then you will feel useless for a while. This leads to a nice satisfaction boost when you realize you are improving and can hold your own in a fight.The content seems to be coming out regularly with microtransactions being limited to cosmetics so you cannot pay 2 win.Hackers are a problem in every game but there used to be alot and that seems to have been mitigated so something is obviously being done about it.All in all a solid game that will get your heart pumping and great for a laugh with friends.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are some problems which will probably get fixed since it's in early access (such as random crashes and FPS issues). Also the game can be annoying at times (like if you get killed from out of nowhere) but you'll have a love hate relationship with the game that forces you to play it. Please buy it now and it's also better than King of the Kill in every way possible. Best game on Steam right now imo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-24,0,0,620,False,Recommended,In my 30+ years of gaming i ve never been so thoroughly addicted to a game such as PUBG. i m 500+ hrs in and don t see myself stopping anytime soon. PUBG probably is the perfect blend between a realistic hardcore shooter and a fast action game. Sure it s been bug ridden from the start and in some respects it still is. Also server performance leaves a lot to be desired. Then again all Battle Royale games with more than 60 in game players appear to suffer from this.. Likely it s a matter of server technology that needs to catch up. Regardless it s tons of fun never grows old and a crazy adrenaline rush to boot... times two when played with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,374,False,Recommended,Lately PUBG has been a ton better since my last review. Since my last review the game has been updated plenty where the feel of the game is almost buttery smooth. I rarely get frame drops anymore atleast not as bad as before.It's so much more playable now I'd say the only problem at this point is there is still a little bit of desync within the game but still manages to be fun and enjoyable especially with friends.Though content hasn't changed much within the past months the game is still super fun to play with very satisfying gun mechanics.FPP mechanics personally aren't the best considering the game was never meant to be played in FP anyway this was a game made to be played in third person. If there was ever a way to make FPP mechanics feel better and smoother it would be much better.The games biggest problem right now is new content needs to be added they aren't really doinig anything with it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-20,0,0,1590,False,Not Recommended,Okay so as you can tell by hours i got into the game after leaving this review. Now I am not recommending it for another list of reasons. First and foremost the lack of oceania servers means any Australian has to play on South East Asia servers which means getting killed behind walls... shooting someone and doing no damage because they always have an advantage against you. There are constant hackers in the game but you can't always say for certain because the death cam is so borked you cant say for certain what happened. There are chinese spammers advertising hacks in every region. Even when oceania had players there is a desync from the server so even if you don't have 400+ ping you still will have a disadvantage.

For the first couple hundred hours or so you can get past the buginess and lag because you are just focused on having fun and you are still kind of new to things. After that though you start to realize how desperately bad this game is. Horrible optimization terrible physics and movement desync hackers.... etc. I owned this game for around a year before I finally decided to uninstall it and leave this review mainly because throughout the entire year that I owned this game nothing got better. The only updates that changed anything were adding new guns or skins or the new map. They can do all of that but for some reason they can't ing make parachuting physics work worth a Games that came out 10 years ago did parachuting better than the sad excuse this game has.

You may start with this one... or you may try another one. PUBG is a very interesting game of its genre and may definitely keep you entertained for a while if you have the right conditions with you (no bugs some friends and a good sense of compromise).No matter what I tried when giving grades to this game it would not go above 70%... I felt a bit embarrassed for it at first but eventually I guess it deserves that harshness. PUBG has too many flaws while it could be so good even great! I still recommend it because I believe it is one of the most sober and entertaining games of its genre which I know very few so take my review with a grain of salt!

A nice FPS although I hate bending with Q and E not my style of FPS but you can play kind of okay without! Note however that many people play in 3rd person which I hate and find anti fairplay and such. So do not consider my review in terms of third person analysis... CONTENTstory world solo immersion multiplayer depth overall idea... 8/10And this is where the other half of the games shines a battle royale is a unique genre extremely trendy for a few years now and created many many clones. For me this is the only one I tried and I am content with it. I find it very pleasant addictive full of adrenaline and although it would deserve more content (more maps etc) I find it great the way it is. OTHERlength replayability price community economics devs... 4/10Finally this is where the game is hurt the most I will not talk about the community (lots of cheaters apparently though I am not good enough to notice that) nor about this game history (lots of turbulence even now) but about present facts I know very slow and poor developing an economic scene (costumes and lootbox land...) that I despise bad servers bugs disconnections platforms problem (do you know for instance that in my country the FPS mode was removed entirely? reason given not enough players used it...) all of this will probably make people flee away from that game and that would be well deserved. It should have been better it should even be better now it could be one of the best games ever it could be classic but I am afraid it has not this status because of its own flaws. Too bad. DISCLAIMER I never won yet (ie ""finished first"") so my review is not complete sorry about that. And I do not play it anymore recently because FPS mode has been removed from my country and I would rather play it with friends... so all in all... it takes dust in my library.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-15,0,0,227,False,Not Recommended,"I love PUBG it is by far the most fun and realistic battle royal I have ever played. That being said the DEVs lack any care for fixing this game. To list a few very simple fixes Parachuting is still broken I have landed thousands of times and I cannot begin to the frustration of still being kicked off the roof of a building and taking fall damage because it is STILL BROKEN. The same can be said about hitting trees or power lines still drops you every time at a decent height that does (while minor) damage. DESYNC holy cow is this atrocious now. Whatever you did DEVs to ""fix"" the game you've broken it more. I have been behind many many many buildings walls trees rocks anything and everything and still been shot. When watching my death cam not only was it from someplace that was impossible it was THROUGH the wall. Being killed when it is physically impossible is not fun. I truly think that while there are complaints about other things in the game on this review my biggest issue is desync. The DEVs have to have to have to fix the net code for this game without this being fixed the player base will continue to be angry. The gun loot on the bigger maps is still minimal. It is frustrating at best to enter multiple houses upon dropping to find nothing not just ""nothing"" but literally nothing at all. No meds no gun and no ammo. The blue zone is frustration waiting to happen as well. You can see into the zone but not out the zone. This needs to be fixed. Either you see in or you don t being shot from outside the zone as you can t see out makes fighting very difficult. Also whatever anti cheat they are using isn t very effective. I run into many an instance where there is obviously someone cheating in game. I am never happy to die to someone who snaps their gun on me and misses no shots. Another while minor fixes that could be implemented is the vehicles could handle way better. The UAZ now feels like a piece of paper when driving. The UMP does far too much damage now I understand that they are trying to equalize the guns but it is now WAY too powerful. Not only is the UMP too strong the beryl has now been stripped of recoil where the recoil previously was far too great. While I may have only 151 hours in this game compared to people who have many more I still think this game needs so much more fixing.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-24,0,0,1342,False,Recommended,I am frustrated with this game. I sometimes get long waits to join and it annoys me. I sometimes get thrown into a server in Asia and my teammates don't even try to communicate with me (not so much that they can't speak my language but that I was put there in the first place). That annoys me. I have been playing FPSes for over 15 years. I've played with some incredibly good people who practiced several hours daily. I think I have a pretty good idea when someone is playing straight or when they are doing some fairly impossible shooting. It annoys me that some of those people are still playing. But when I do report those people I'm pretty sure aren't legit I have a decent record of the Devs actually banning those people. I appreciate their involvement and their communication back to me that my concerns were addressed. This game beats up on my video card but it is by far one of the better looking FPSes I've ever played. I wish that this game didn't give such an advantage to people who are able to spend much more money on their rig than I am willing to do but it is what it is. I hold this game to a higher standard than most but I do that because I really do like this game. I criticize this game just like I do any other game that I see a lot of potential in.

People i still play with all the time. But now none of us can Touch PUBG. No one can stand where this game is heading.

Bye pubg I will miss youTip if you saved an older version of the game with all the bugs and everything then you should release that instead,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Maybe it is what the developers want not sure but the fixes that are wanted by the community are not coming to this game. Currently in this state the game is playable but there still are some major issues and major RNG factors in this game. The game is very frustrating if you have a mid tier rig and the system requirements are much higher than mentioned.Despite all this this game is very fun to play with friends and also very competitive to play solo.

Seriously it's no fun dying by enemies who has an AR and you only have body armor to protect you. Give every house at least a good enough gun. Granted it is ""Battle Royale"" but comparing the house loot to Fortnite and even Tencent's PUBGM they got better loot. Hell I was even surprised the mobile version of PUBG is actually better.2) Thanks to Tencent's PUBGM + Emulator who needs the real deal? Better optimization AND better loot. Oh and it's FREE.3) Optimization. Period.Don't get me wrong I still play PUBG from time to time but the broken loot and the hit registration throws me off most of the time.Here's a clip of J9 experience PUBG 1.0 https //clips.twitch.tv/NurturingRamshacklePuppyTF2John",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Unlike in other popular shooters like CS GO you can enjoy the game in peace when going Solo no screaming kids no need to ask for people to talk English please no flaming no spamming! If you want the teamplay you can go Duo or Squad preferably with your friends+ Battle Royale I like it!+ It's up to you how to play the rounds you can go all out and try to make as many kills as you can but you can also play sneaky and just survive till the number of opponents shrank to a minimum basically 1 kill would be enough to win Solo D. + Well done for an Early Access game and developers keep on workingStill I wonder as priorities of the developers seem wrong... the game has quite some problems they should attend to Performance. Facing problems like for example random game crashes disconnecting canceling matchmaking doors not opening properly lags ... Graphics basically nice but All over you can find floating stones or loot stuff is also sticking through walls just like you can get unluckily stuck in them by landing with parachute or if you drive a vehicle into a house for example. What annoys me too is that when you look though your scope and have free sight on target you shoot but actually hit the wall/wood or whatever in front of you if you are too close fine with me that I cannot sit too close but why can I not see that? Shouldn't it be in my sight then?(On this point I want to mention that this is not gonna be my final version of the review.)So even with those rather important issues the game has developers work on new loot new map and money making.I admit I would love new maps comming up but I even more want the game to run well!As I do have hope that they will take care of that and in my opinion the game has a lot of potential I will for now recommend it nevertheless!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-31,0,0,461,False,Recommended,Up front because this review will sound very negative I just want to be clear that I 'am' recommending that you try this.PUBG is a battle royale style FPS/ThirdPersonPerspective game. The gist is this You and up to 99 other players take flight on a large plane that traverses the battlefield once. Players choose when to jump and then parachute in to. On landing they scavange materials (weapons armor fuel grenades ammo medicine weapon attachments). Whereupon they have a short time (about 5 minutes) before a blue wall begins encroaching from the edges of the map. Get overrun by this blue wall and you begin slowly losing health (in faster increments every time the wall constricts by another phase).PUBG has a fairly steep learning curve owing to a few factors 1) High lethality characters can only withstand a few hits before being knocked to the ground (in duo/squad) or dying (solo).2) Rampant cheating. Like you won't believe how common this is. When combined with the former you're going to be looking at a large number of restarts.3) Tower of Babel syndrome. You'll frequently find teams with 4 people none of whom speak the same language.4) Frequently disconnecting teammates (probably caused by #3 but this usually isn't that big a deal and not at all in solo mode).The one silver lining of the massive population of cheaters is that PUBG's mods are actually quite responsive when you find someone who's blatantly wallhacking (and there's a convenient death cam provided that usually makes it clear if an opponent was).The other irksome? downside is that there's a wide range of pay for add on skins most of which can only be gained by those willing to pay money on top of the game purchase. I find that fairly unpleasant as a business model but there it is.Still despite all that PUBG does the battle royale style of game well and it's worth a try.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-24,0,0,781,False,Recommended,Hi friends! Welcome to this update analysis on Bitcoin! Let's get right to it! Looking at the daily chart you can see that the breakdown below the rising blacktrendline is sustained. This is technically concerning but I have noticed that several of my followers did not seem to recognize the importance of this event. Perhaps it is due to the fact that my charts were zoomed in too far for people to see the actual points of contact on the trendline but nonetheless I will explain why this is concerning price action. We all know that there are rising trendlines falling trendlines and parallel trendlines . In terms the current bull/bear cycle of Bitcoin 0.54% the rise to the all time high produced several pivot lows. Those pivot lows can be used to create rising support lines to gauge the sustainability of a longer term bullish continuation or a turning point in the bear market. As you can see the two points that create the rising black trendline are the lowest pivot lows that are relevant to this cycle. In other words that was the last hope for rising support. Sure there are other parallel and descending trendlines in the mix but for a gauge on a bullish continuation this black trendline is pretty significant. Now that it has been taken out some significant technical damage has been done. That's not to say thatBTC 0.54% won't continue to form a bowl like structure which it appears to have half way formed already (meaning we could be bottoming soon.) However the deeper technical picture tells a more bearish story.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Whenever I launch PUBG I don't get a warning or anything It's just plain black screen. When I check out the details in the task manager It's labelled as ""Not Responding"". I tried everything. Restarting the game Restarting steam Validating files etc. But it just doesn't work. My opinion will change about this game once I can get at least one hour of actual gameplay instead of just Black Screen.Edit I now have a better opinion about this game.

2019-01-04,0,0,211,False,Not Recommended,Great concept poor execution.GRAPHICS Seems like a lot copied and pasted assets from the Unreal store. This leads to poor optimization.GAMEPLAY The BR concept was already overused before PUBG ever came out. Now it's just more of the same. With PUBG specifically the gunplay is awkward and sloppy. Movement is terrible and very floaty. If you hold a direction to move and then release the key your character will still surge a bit in the direction you were moving (momentum based). While this is slightly more realistic it makes controlling your character really awkward and fails to feel as tight as other accomplished games like CSGO COD BF etc.SOUND Not the worst but a lot of the guns sound farty rather than huge and explosive like they would in real life. The footstep sounds are mediocre ambient sound is almost non existent.NETCODE Was bad at the start and is still bad. It's better than it used to be but there are still many issues with interpolation and latency.PACING Games are usually like 30 minutes of hiking and looting followed by 15 seconds of gunplay. Terribly slow can easily make someone fall asleep while in the middle of a match.MULTIPLAYER The best part about this game. The game is paced so slowly you can queue with friends and catch up on lost time. It's kind of like you aren't even playing a game it's so boring you just chat with people. This is also why it's so popular on Twitch TV. The awfully slow gameplay allows the streamers to constantly interact with their audience.TL DR If PUBG was created by a company who knew what they were doing it would probably be one of the best games of all time. While Bluehole has managed to make a solid profit and create a popular game it dwarfs its own potential by being riddled with technical bugs and sloppy gameplay.Overall 4/10 Not recommended.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game is full of major issues including shutters horrible optimalization laggy servers laggy gameplay sometimes you just want to kill someone and shots doesnt register you see the blood splatters and when you watch the replay opponent is intact. At the start of the game if you dont have high end PC you will experience serious lags if you land in highly populated area. Gameplay itself without the bugs and lags is excellent and i guess thats the only reason why i keep playing it there is many similar BR games around but i think after all the PUBG is the best.

Quite recently i was playing the game and i saw that the plane had a banner on it stating that there was an event going on between the 25 29 today is the 6th and it is still there i believe that this was done simply to remind people on what they missed out on if they didn't attend it.

2018-07-25,0,0,364,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I personally don't think the game deserves as much bad reviews as it's getting. But I can still agree that there are still some unrealistic implements in the game that could've easily been fixed months ago. Some examples are Cars that instantly kills you when they're going 5km/h ( The fact that you don't slide down cliffs to reduce fall damage (because of friction) instead you just keep picking up momentum just as if you were falling and NOT sliding. You often don't land on what you're on top of after you've parachuted. I'd say those are my only complaints on the game right now. Other than that I'd recommend this game to anyone else reading this. People should also stop complaining about the ingame transactions. They're not necesarry it's just more of an add on if you're interessted in supporting bluehole or collecting skins. Optimizations in the game are decent they're not trash like everyones saying I'd say that the system requirements are very accurate if you want a smooth gaming experience. My system has worse pc components than the recommended system requirements but it can still run the game with a solid 100fps+ on (avg.) medium settings.I mean is aight.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-21,0,0,967,False,Not Recommended,Can honestly say im very impressed with this Early Access offering. Ive had plenty of fun with it and have met some pretty decent people to game with. As it stand this game tops a lot of others the devs seem to be involved at just the right amount they dont bash people for neg reviews or comments yet they are active in getting things tweeked. They are trying to clean house of all those pesky cheaters that everyone but themselves hate. I think I read 20 000+ banned which is def a step in the right direction. The game is very fun at first you dont mind if you get killed as it takes a bit to get your inventory built up to be able to even consider going top 10. Then as the game progresses you really start to feel the pressure. You hear shots off in the distance and are basically forced to go that direction as the map starts to shrink in on you like that Red Hot Chili Peppers t shirt from when you were 15. The only issue I really have with the game and its a small one because im well aware of the strategy behind the game is that usually those who have a decent long rifle and an 8x scope are usually going to win. Especially if you have the high ground or were lucky enough to be in good position when the map comes in. If the devs could the whole waiting for the game to start while every 10 year old on mom and dads pc trys to annoy you into being a snake should be changed. Able to mute players would go a long way during that wait time or when your waiting to jump in the plane. Overall this game does kick booty in its current state im very excited to see what the future holds for this. 8/10Edit 10/25/18Dsync Hackers no working region lock NA servers are full of Chinese hackers.

( Extremely disappointed....Update June 8 2017After trying multiple different work arounds and fixes spending $1200 on computer upgrades and getting the game to play at least occasionally....this game is A LOT of fun...and I would love to recommend it. I still can't in good faith recommend it however due the inconsist playability...every time I get a work around and think I'm good...an update happens and I'm right back to square one. That being said...the developers are EXTREMELY active and are openly trying to fix and optimize the game for the customers...I sadly am one of many who have yet to see full fruition of it...but I do have faith that they will eventually fix it and are not just making a cash grab and leaving you with a broken game.The game is in a real good state for an EARLY EARLY access game but with the current server stability...I would say wait for an actual release to buy...that being said...the minute the server issues are resolved...my recommendation changes to ""BUY BUY BUY"" whole heartedly!Update 2018While still somewhat frustrating at times this game is fun and well worth the money!

2019-01-07,0,0,231,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Disclaimer I got the game from a Facebook giveaway (from a fan page not related to Bluehole/PUBG) free of charge.After several tweaks and new maps I think the current game is quite playable and fun to play with friends. Of course there are some flaws and things that Bluehole has done wrong the overall game is quite good and deserves a recommendation.Things the dev did rightContinuous updatesLet's be honest guys the new map (Vikendi) is actually well made and good looking. It has a lot of buildings for lootings while the size is not that big (as compared to the original map and the desert map) / small (as compared to Sanhok). It is a right direction of making maps and Bluehole definitely deserve some praises here.More new guns are always welcome but they should put more attention to gun varietyLimited time game modesNot as frequent as it used to be but the deathmatch mode is actually quite good to practice your aiming skills without all the hideous looting processVarious optimizations to the gameThe game has become more stable in terms of FPS consistency players with a mid range GPU can enjoy the game at 60fps with acceptable graphic quality.Continuous and improved cheater detectionMaybe I am lucky but it has been a long time I saw a cheater on the server. I think Bluehole is improving their process of finding a cheater and actually banning them. Anyway they should NOT rest now they should keep on improving their anti cheat system other than announcing something like ""We have caught a number here cheaters today"". I think all of us can notice the work they did and they effort can surely attract old players back to the game.Things the dev did wrong/not enoughPay to reach season pass with difficult and tedious missionsThe new season pass is a joke I cannot see the point of paying a large sum of money (nearly 40% of the price of the original game) for getting cosmetic items which REQUIRES repeated tedious grinding within a limited time period. This system is suppose to attract players to play the game but the whole season pass has transform into a easy cash grabbing system for Bluehole. Secondly some of the missions on the season pass are just impossible to complete and/or uninteresting. It makes the whole season pass unattractive for players to purchase. Bluehole should re think the design of each missions carefully and keep them interesting for players to reach. Some of the great examples are on the subreddit of pubg and worth considering.Thirdly the whole pay to reach system is just outrageously wrong. I don't know what they are thinking when they decide to add the option for players to ""buy"" season pass levels directly and I cannot see a reason for players to do so. Come on guys you have charged them for the season pass and you charge MORE for ""helping"" players to reach certain levels. It is just ridiculous and I don't think any players will support this idea.I know that the dev needs to earn money for the sustainable development of the game but the whole season pass is just a joke to all of us. I surely think that Bluehole can think of better ways to earn our money other than some ridiculous pay to reach season pass that has very limited duration.Inconsistent network latencyThis has been a problem since early access and it seems to become more serious since the release of Vikendi. Network delay and packet loss makes the game stutter even though the player has a powerful PC to run the game at consistent FPS. It is understandable for players to become furious when they died in a match because of network lag. If they can reduce the network lag I am sure that players will enjoy the game more.Lack of different gamemodesAs mentioned before the dev should consider putting more time on bringing new game modes that is different from the core gameplay to the game. It allows players to experience the game in a whole new perspective and sparks interests among players.Lack of communications and interactions between the communityAs mentioned before some of the suggestions from the community is actually quite good and worth consider implementing into the game. If Bluehole listens to the community and cooperate with us I think the game will become a lot better over time and attract new and old players to the game.In conclusion the gameplay is quite fun and enjoyable. This game is a great for playing with friends as each round feels different when you land on different places/has different weapons/faces different enemies. The game surely has its flaws but overall it worths recommending to new players to experience the excitement of battle royale while spending time with their friends. The dev should put more efforts on fixing the problems they should think of a better plan to develop the game sustainably without losing old players. The new map is just a right direction and I hope they can continue on putting more effort of putting new elements to the game in the near future.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-07,0,0,659,False,Not Recommended,"First of all The idea of this game is good. The concept of this game is good. And this game would be amazing if it was not bad. But unfortunately it is. Now PUBG is a sort of an E Sport game however it comes with several flaws. These flaws ruin the game experience so much that you actually get way too frustrated. Don't get me wrong I am not an idiot in CS GO I am ranked LEM so I am not complaining about ""cheaters"" and being too bad at the game.First of all performance and lag. To give you an idea I am not playing on a potato. My PC achieves around 600 points in Cinebench. But still it is not enough for this game. And it is not a matter of refresh rate but also technical game design. So I achieve something around 100 120 Hz which is decent on a 144 Hz screen. However at certain situations the refresh rate drops down to rates as low as 30 Hz and the game becomes unplayable. That happens especially when there are enemies around. And that is quite unfortunate. The next big problem is that this game is technically made for GAME CONSOLES. So it plays VERY mushy and steering wheel like. Do you know the swift feel of CS GO? Forget it. PUBG sucks at giving you a decent quick gameplay. Which leads to the next big problem. LAG. This game is full of it. You want to pick up something? Click on it and wait. It does not pick up for ages. Sometimes you even click on it and nothing happens. When there are enemies around it kills you. Literally. Also the game does not come with a limit for latency. Which means that you might end up playing against enemies with latencies greater than 50 ms. They are unhittable. The worst thing though is that in the death camera the aim of these enemies is virtually off always. They cannot hit you the way you see it from their perspective. The aim is 100 % off target and still the game registers a hit. It is not a rare occasion that you on the other hand hit the enemy several times but nothing happens. In situations that require quick action the game is dead and unplayable. It forces you to play defencively and refrain from fighting. That makes it sort of boring.Second instead of fixing bugs and improving game performance the developer focusses on adding more and more features to attract new players. The game is not about being a good game they start milking it not caring at all. It still feels and plays like Summer 2017 the performance is still horrible. There is a bug? Don't expect it to get fixed. You see a cheater? Don't expect them to get banned. One of the most annoying things in this game was the lack of map selection. In April 2018 they had finally added it however with the introduction of the third map map selection was REMOVED from the game again. Seriously? The desert map sucks and nobody wants to play it! By forcing players to play a map pool instead of letting them choose the map they want to play on the game just becomes more frustrating. By adding event modes the developers have tried to make the game more appealing. But often the event mode feels like a DLC nobody has ever put any bit of effort into. I don't want to play a shotgun gamemode when the shotguns are random and the enemies spawn with S12K automatic shotguns while I have an S1897 pumpgun. Sorry but that sucks. Especially when your mates immediately disappear after joining.One thing you won't find many people complaining about are the vehicles. But again they suck. First of all they don't come with a manual gearbox. That means that you might end up going uphill and it decides to shift up and down up and down up and down... you cannot decide to put it in a low gear or something like that. No. Next The parking brake is buggy. In the vehicles that were available in the Early Access Version of the game it works. In the vehicles added later it does not. You pull the parking brake when getting out? The vehicle keeps moving. This is true especially for the trucks. I have been killed by that way too many times. In certain situations you would want to turn off the engine or at least cost with the clutch disenganged so you can approach enemies quickly without letting them hear you. But no it is not possible. Lifting your ""foot"" off the accelerator leaves the vehicle in gear. So it brakes and shifts down It is slow and loud. Insanely annoying. And last but not least there are vehicles such as the boat or the minibus that come with more than four seats. Why would they need that? I mean you can play as a Squad but not a Quint. They minibus is a cool concept but while it has a very weak Diesel engine it is not particularly fuel efficient. I would appreciate if it would be more fuel efficient than other vehicles. But it turns out that the fuel efficiency of all vehicles is exactly the same. That means that the faster your vehicle is the better your fuel economy will be. And I still wonder why they have not yet added drivable lorries to the game. I would appreciate a drivable URAL 375.Let's talk about the maps. The game features three maps. The original map the Asian map and the desert map. The desert map sucks as I have said. The other maps feature a neat design and the gameplay would be great if the game was not so buggy. Back in 2017 I could forgive the buggy and laggy experience since it was Early Access. But as of 2018 they have not done anything about it. But they could add two more maps to the game. And new weapons. And new vehicles. Sorry but that is unforgivable. After one year the game idea is still amazing. But what they have done about this game is just sad. You could say that they have wasted all the potential. That is sad. Sorry but I gonna go switch back to CS GO. Or maybe one day there will be a copy of PUBG that is better from a technical standpoint. If you have not yet purchased this game. Do not buy it.And I have to make edits to this review. Now they have issued the ""Fix PUBG"" campaign. It feels like a really bad joke. The technical design of PUBG is underwhelming it sucks. I keep falling through the map in ten per cent of the matches I play. I have to face death so many times due to bugs they are not fixing. Actually when I die it is most likely caused by a game bug. This game is not out of Beta yet. The game developers are abusing the players as beta testers.Great. Yet another update that changes the controls of the game. It renders it useless. Before the recent update controlling the player whilst parachuting was fairly easy. Now there are no more 3 dimensional controls instead of rotating the player model moving the mouse now rotates the camera which is a fairly useless function. In fact it is so useless that precisely landing is virtually impossible now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've had multiple people scream hacker at me shortly after killing them so I'm not convinced that you guys aren't just crying over losing.The devs listen to the community despite what the whining comments here say. I can't name a single thing they haven't fixed or updated (multiple times) in order to satisfy the community. Yes it still has a ways to go but it's still a great game at the end of the day and I'm excited to see where it will headEdit well the games still fun but the creators are being right about pretty much everything.

2018-10-28,0,0,310,False,Not Recommended,"With no explanation Bluehole refuses to host servers on the West coast US despite millions of players playing from this region. This would fix a large number of what people know as ""desync"" issues and significantly improve the overall gameplay experience for both west coast and east coast players as everyone would have lower ping/latency. This would benefit EVERYONE. Amazon their server host offers west coast servers all Bluehole has to do is ask for Amazon to re allocate SOME PUBG servers to their clusters in Oregon/California instead of purely using Ohio. Throughout the course of the ""fix PUBG"" campaign there have been no significant improvements in the great complaints plaguing the game and more bugs have actually been introduced. Currently vehicle physics are significantly out of whack causing vehicles to occasionally go flying when striking a player on foot and to explode much more easily than before. Bluehole does not inspire confidence in their userbase. Bugs are reported on the test server and are put on the live version of the game anyway. Even game breaking bugs like the bug that allowed people to play in 3rd person while on 1st person servers. The maps have far FAR too many gaping wide open areas particularly in final circles. This means that in a lot of end game scenarios you'll be forced to march across a wide open field towards your enemies that are sitting safely behind the cover of houses edges of hills rocks etc thanks to pure chance. You can hedge your bets as much as you want someones you get lucky other times you're screwed and have 3 different teams all shooting at your team at the same time as you try to move to the next circle. The game needs significantly more objects towns POIs trees need to be bigger not a bunch of big flat open terrain. It makes for extremely unsastisfying game experiences. The recoil control is done almost perfectly except for the ""settling"" guns automatically do to auto recover from recoil after shots which can cause your aim to be thrown off by the game trying to ""correct"" your recoil for you. In other FPS games like Planetside 2 this behavior was actually considered a BUG. In a game going for ""realism "" why is my recoil being auto corrected for me in any capacity? It should work like R6 Siege or any other mil sim shooter you the player should have to control it 100% with no unpredictable ""correction"" mechanics messing up your aim for no explainable reason. The performance of the game is summed up in one word inconsistent. You can get a smooth 120FPS but then you will inexplicably stutter hitch pause have a significant frame drop or some other inconsistency no matter what drivers you use no matter how low you set your settings you'll experience these stutters intermittently that can get you killed in the game.Overall if it weren't for the fact that all my friends are always playing this game I never would have bought it I never would have played it and I can't understand how so many people continue to play it so regularly. I just can't stand it anymore. I'm fed up with the game and it's broken shenanigans. The frustratingly broken elements of the game make it very difficult to actually have fun while playing the game and fun is the most important part of any game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Encountering people with radar hacks at the end game like mushrooms after rain. Its no problem to get to top 10 for me but then these ers are closing in on me carefully even if i am not moving or making any sounds walking with cntrl but still they know exactly where i will exit or my head will pop up they are running just in the open. Why Blueballs! You fixed the chinese problems thats very good i really aprreciate that. BUT! Radars and macros. I have been killed so many time from like 300 metres by guy who shoots AR like its a airsoft gun. NO ING RECOIL! I don't believe that there are so many skillful players that can control a gun like that. But the radar is the worst. Whatever i do wherever i hide or make my plans to further move to circle it has no meaning because they will know exatly where i am and put a bullet straight trough my ing tier 3 helmet without recoil.. I have seen many videos of streamers AND OOOHH BOY half of them are cheating. Is this how you want to make a game? I really like this game but devs like money more. I cant say i will quit because sometime i am playing this game with my friends time to time but i will not recomend a game at its current state.And the last one is shotguns worst weapons in the game! (they didnt even fixed taht) The shotgun must be deadly accurate in close range by all standarts. But when a guy walks like 5 meters from you you miss because shotgun in blueballs universe is the most inacurate weapon in close range. So dont bother its better to pick a sickle or pan and kill someone. Ive seen how to guys trying to shoot me with shotguns and they missed i killed them with a pistol. Pistol Carl!

2018-02-01,0,0,195,False,Recommended,Definitely a game I would recommend to an individual if they had asked about it however this is under the assumption that the quality and performance of the client/server is going to have a complete optimization which is needed ASAP. This can effectively &amp efficiently be accomplished through an established company by increasing the number of dedicated minds towards the specific project. In the case of having an initial resource shortage make the necessary decisions to mitigate that factor and ultimately better secure your entire team's position/value against any dedicated and hungry competing company. The developers have recently made a deadline promise on a top priority task they are carrying out and it is towards exactly what I had written about in the initial review post. To say it simply the developer's actions towards the consumers regarding customer satisfaction is exemplary when referring to optimization of their product.

2017-11-17,0,0,1013,False,Recommended,considering recent updates and some well needed fixes this game has improved overall however there is a contrary alot of the times the chinese come in troves to the US servers and ive had to litterally avoid playing squads for a bit duos are okay if you can find a buddy that speaks your language even somewhat. However id say if your not looking for teams and you can play solo then this is the true battle royale and when i mean true battle royale i mean based off the japanese movie. It holds its title very well. PUBG isnt about the chicken dinner its pushing yourself to be the best player you can possibly be. Winning in those tiny circles at the end game is all about location location location.... there is no way to win without being in the correct defensive position And getting there is easier said then done. This game is the only game that can still get my blood pumping with the thrill of a drive by with a shotgun ( its more effective than you think) popping a motorcyles tire and watching them crash to their demise. Jumping off the rock by Bootcamp onto the island across the river on bike in high speed. Sniping that perfect 1000m shot at just the right time. nailing that guy with a winchester 94 at distances you didnt think were possible on it. This game is more about the satsfaction of beating another player at their own game of camping. There is nothing more satisfying that pushing yourself to be better win or lose. I have killed streamers without their streams. Ive made friends just by being me and having fun with this game. I wouldnt trade it for h1z1 or Blackout or fortnite. This to me is the original battle royale since i played the arma 3 mod for it back in 2012. The game itself now feels like a cleaner more crisp version of that arma 3 mod speed up by the circle. In the End it doesnt matter how much anyone can claim that chicken dinner but the satisfaction of a kill and thrill of a chase is all i need to be content. Thank you playerunknown for making such a delightful hunt for the next player no matter the equipment.... its a game of brawn and brain like a true battle royale should be..... learning its secrets has been a wonder on its own in the high pitched combat realm that is.....

2017-11-23,0,0,448,False,Recommended,Awesome fun &amp exciting game. Though it puts quite a load on my PC (I'm running I5 6500 GTX1060 6GB 16GB RAM) it's well worth it. For new players there is quite a learning curve but you'll get a hang of it in no time. Do not be shunned off by its price tag though as you can sell the crates that you buy in game to recoup the price you paid for the game (Well at least I did). The game servers does crash from time to time but that is expected of since its early access. A number of hackers exist in this game (obviously) but sometimes you'll beat them sometimes you'll lose to them. Main con to be concerned about is the poor optimization. You can either wait for the full release for less bugs &amp better optimization or jump the gun &amp charge right into the game without giving a single f**k.

Very sad to know that being part of this game since its pre release the game just seems to be as annoying as it was in the beginning the only difference being the fixes for the old problems seem to be bringing in newer annoying glitches.

2018-07-15,0,0,678,False,Not Recommended,This game is literally the epitome of garbage. I have so much time in this game and 1/4 of the time was just a cumfest of desync and lag. If you're playing with friends sure buy it and around. If you really value where your money goes don't touch this game. Pros It doesn't look like some cartoon bs like Fortnite. Gunplay better than Fortnite but subpar to games like Tarkov. Killing people is still fun.Cons They hold maintainence at the most r3t rd3d times possible. Get home from work on a Thursday and you want to PUBG with friends? Sorry maintainence. Rendering strategies for the game is terrible as well. Objects at a distance don't render to reduce load on weak machines but that literally destroys the shooting. There are many clips online where shooting a gun in the head doesn't hit them because there was an object not rendered in the distance. The devs are just complete potato. It started well when crates were free and you didn't have to spend on a key to open. Now 75% of the crates you get require and key and it's literally disgusting how money hungry the devs for this game became. Never going to buy a key and hoping no one else ever does so these devs can go back to sucking DlCK for money. Desync. Enough said.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And still I face the following bugs #FPS drops ONLY when enemy close to me. and sometimes I use this bug to hide and kill the enemy near by. UPDATE FPS been fixed but still game doesnt feel smooth .#Servers The servers are really bad sometimes my hit does not register or when I land and take weapon I shot the other guy first and he shot back I die while he stay alive even if we are using same shotgun. UPDATE This happens only at the beggining of the matchs .# NEW Keys While using healing items it block stand button for no reason while causes death. UPDATE Most keys priority been fixed . UPDATE Nov 2018 The game forums says the devs reached the right optimization level. But it doesnt seem they did. ________________Why I still recommend this game Even with the bugs I mentioned you will find out this game is fun because every round is different and unique from it combat.________________What I hate about it #Lower Spec PC's have adventages over the high end. Because of some rendering is not showing on low end pc's Its always problem with PC games .#There is lot of cheaters / Hackers which means the anti cheat system is really bad and need to be fixed. As you can see all I mentioned can be temporary from bugs to bad points about the game.

2017-12-28,0,0,229,False,Not Recommended,"I really enjoy this game....when it works. There are serious issues. Since the latest patch (28 Dec 17) i have been having serious lag issues that will freeze the game for up to 20 seconds at time over and over again for about 2 minutes at a time. The game isn't playable in its current state.There is also quite a toxic online culture already. I have had to turn voice chat off because people in the lobby will play loud music and abuse one another over comms. There are also serious issues with hackers wihin the game (from all nations) that make it difficult to enjoy.Finally they need to considder a Chinese only server. The constant abuse (some of it exceptionally racist) being sprouted in chinese is terrible not even looking at the constant screaming of ""China Number 1"" at the start of every round. Please Dev's the anti Chinese messages you are getting are coming in for a reason (not because everyone who posts one is a racist) you may have a lot of Chinese players but their methods of interacting with the rest of the community are currently very poor. TL DR they need to optimise their game to fix the lag issues the need to region lock their servers and they need to add in functionality to see ping and who is playing in your game....same as every other online game out there.This game has so much potential and I have enjoyed it but in its current state I can't recommend it to anyone.

2018-08-20,0,0,810,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun in its own way few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking however my porblem with it is the lack of things that this game offers specially when you have to pay to play it.I was wondering why the Pubg Mobile got so much more to offer?It's a free to play graphic is not that bad and people found ways to play it on pc using apps and such so why it got so much more to offer?Some of the things that the mob version offers 1 Tutorial a shooting range with all the guns in the game that you can test as much as you like.2 Huge store with so much more stuff in took me 15 min to take a look at it and didn't even finish.3 Events and you don't have to download 9gb for them.4 Lots of options for Player camos and Guns camos (the camos in the PC version are really bad not attractive and only a few are available). 5 We all know that you need keys to open locked chest in the PC version and it's the same on the mob version however there is key shards in the mob version you collect enough you get a key to open a locked chest with so a player that paid nothing for the game gets the chance to open locked chest while a player who paid for the game have to pay more to open any!!.It feels like the owners are Ignoring the PC version and tryin to move on to the mob version since according to the number of players active says it all on both platforms (PC 600k mobile 3 million).PS for all new players don t buy the PC version get the mobile one it got more to offer and its free (you can work around and play it on PC too) PC version have nothing better to offer other than better graphic that you need a super PC to enjoy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-22,0,0,231,False,Recommended,"FIX PUBG simply the best. But game is dying and the only one way to return players is to 1. Game engine development people are beginning to get used to the smoother and more drawn picture as in Fortnite of COD so one of the ways could be to improve graphics by creating more simple graphics (I'm not saying that now the graphics are bad it's great but for most people it seems to me to be too hard for people to even come and relax to play their favorite game and not sit and look out for a bush or a man lying down).2. Creating smth new like a large number of """"pleasant for the eye"" animations"" or the innovation of new maps and interesting daily challenges (i mean i could be random Snow map (for the time of winter it would be Supper interesting and attract alooot of attention) for 60 70 players and only for 3 5 month (like test map) )3. The idea came when I wrote point 2 of course you might be a little violated for plagiarism but what about the idea of changing weather? It will be winter now and on all maps there will be snow frozen lakes and water and so on.

If the network delay is not getting fixed soon I am going to uninstall the game there is no fun left.My personal impression is that they prefer to bring out new skins to earn money than fixing bugs or trying to improve the games performance shame shame... and even more shame.I hope they are going to give me the possibility to edit this review soon but I do not believe in it anymore.JUST WOW! They really fixed the network delay with the last server patch! Thumbs up for this ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Love how I can press f on a gun 5 times and my guy still doesn't pick it upEdit I've played many hours of this game. It has gotten much better in the lag and such and since battle eye has been adopted I've only come across one blatant hacker who was speeding around 1 tapping everyone. Parachuting is much better than it was but it still sucks every now and again when you get caught on nothing or a nearby building and have to wait like 10 seconds to cut it away and take damage.

Frankly if there is more of a story line than this I don't know what it is. Maybe a bunch of prisoners are dropped for a deathmatch and the last survivor gets to come back to society? Who knows and who cares?This is probably one of the most fun shooting games I have played in recent memory. I tend to play solo but when playing with friends it is still very enjoyable (maybe more so in fact).

2018-11-23,0,0,1645,False,Recommended,To start this game has come extremely far in it's efforts to provide it's consumers with a very promising product for only $30.00. I am extremely satisified with the abilities of the development team and it's quickness to action based on community needs and demands. I believe this game has alot to improve upon like any other game but if it's team maintains its current posture I believe it would be the greatest game I own in terms of performance and experience. This game has alot of issues regarding dealing with hackers and organizing it's servers by region ( BUT THIS IS JUST MY OPINION ) and I think there are some minor issues with vehicles that need to be addressed in the coming times. Overall this game is the perfect representation of what a battle royale should strive to perform like and I'm HIGHLY impressed with the game overall in every fashion.

I really do wish the best for pubg and I hope the devs can get their act together but I can't recommend this game to anyone (unless your looking for a very competitive experience that is about the only demographic this game can appeal to but since I discovered EFT I realized that that can be found in a better game with better devs.) All in all if you are looking for a battle royale don't waste your money on PUBG it'll let you down eventually. If you're looking for a competitive game go with siege or try out Escape From Tarkov.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-24,0,0,45,False,Not Recommended,"When this game first came out it wasn't revolutionary in anyway but it was one of the best Battle Royale games since the Minecraft hunger games mod (we don't talk about the culling here I'd like to forget that even exists) but as of now with the game being out for almost a year. There's almost nothing new about the game. All Bluehole has really done was add 2 maps and skins/loot boxes to make more money off of people and copy fortnites ""progression"" system.+Tactical gunplay(?) Almost nothing game changingly new to the game since launch Most games consist of just waiting in the zone for somebody to approach you Or you get sniped randomly while running to the zone and wasted 10 minutes of your life just running in a game Slow paced gameplay (can be a positive for some) Maps are generally empty and too big for their own good Hackers still common Servers/Hitreg are garbage Added loot boxes after stating they would never add themConclusion At this point you're better off playing Black Ops 4's Blackout mode if you want a semi tactical Battle Royal game.

2018-11-22,0,0,9,False,Recommended,Product received for free. So... Pubg... I see alot of negative reviews that are quite frankly somewhat fair and unfair to the product. I can say having paid for a few keys and the pre release game that for the $30 $50 that this game has cost me I have gotten my moneys worth. Over a year of solid online play has been had with friends in squads and thats definitely a ton of time. The issues suggested by others are many 1) Region blocking due to cheats2) Cheat protection was poor3) Network Latency/deseync is high and still a problem4) New content has been very slow to release maps guns etc5) Poor release schedule on updates almost always ran long6) Game seems to have become a skin engine (like Counter Strike)7) Map glitches causing damage/movement issuesSome of those issues are with the company and some with the gamer design. Here's the fundamental goods about the game.1) Methodical paced games.2) Solid gun play feel and weight3) Great positional audio/sound work 4) Enjoyable coop feel for a small team6) 3 large/well placed maps.7) Decent transport systemOverall I'd say this game when played with a good group of well intentioned fun seekers is still a fun game. Part of the original fun was in the jank from the game and as BlueHole has tried to push this game into a more polished and e sports capable state it has suffered some with the crowd due to the ridiculous nature of deaths and general fun/sillyness dropping away. At this point the game has large flaws map issues with odd placement of momentum stopping dips vehicle oddness in movement code general desync between players engagements and some basic problems with region protection and cheater prevention. It is still however fun with a good group of people. Is it worth the price now? I don't know but I will say that it was for me and I've enjoyed my time with this game. Will I continue to play? Probably because its still relatively enjoyable with the right friends. However I will likely move on eventually to another more polished game due to the slow release and often poorly defined release cycle of the developers game updates. I think it is getting better but I'm not sure if the future holds any meaningful updates for this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-05,0,0,285,False,Recommended,When this game was first released I had a blast with my friends. The original map is still my favourite and I didn't mind the long trips in a Dacia to get to the next zone. The best part for me was grouping with 3 of my goons experiencing the game and having a laugh.With that being said the updates to the game made the game less enjoyable. The second map (although I do like the city designs) was very barren and wasted. The colours of the map are utterly disgusting. This and the lack of any Life or Charm to the map made it unenjoyable. I know that the original map is arguably just as bad but in my opinion there was a lot of variety. The mountain beside the hospital the shooting range the military base. All of these created a huge variety for the map. What does the Desert Map have? A city... And a city... Possibly a graveyard or some Furthermore they added a few more guns to the game which don't break up the hierarchy of guns whatsoever. Don't get me started on the attachments... God... The attachments...Regardless I'm gonna rate this a positive review just for PUBG being one of the best experiences I've had with friends when it came out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-29,0,0,3196,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS THEY REGION LOCK. The number one issue in this game is the De sync caused by players from around the world with different pings all mashed into the same game you will experiance being shot well after you have gotten behind cover and bullets that disapear in mid air. The number one thing that players in this game have asked for is to region lock and the developers have spit in our faces with a new matchmaking system that doesnt even allow you to pick a region It forces you to play with whoever their broken system syncs you up with. I end up matched with players on my team from around the world who have a ping of 200plus while I have 35 40 ping so I know my enemys are also all over the place which makes for a terrible time in a game where fractions of a second make the difference all the time. The PUBG devs do nothing but try to squeeze every penny they can out of this game with in game purchases of skins but absolutely spit in our faces by refusing to address the matchmaking issues the vast majority of players complain that they want region lock and instead they took away regions alltogether and mixed us in to one big laggy pool of players. I have never hated anyone that Ive never met as much as I absolutely despise the people who make the decision to refuse region locking I seriously HATE HATE HATE THEM and wish many terribble experiances upon them like their ghame has visited upon me by killing any joy Im having with network related problems that they refuse to change!!!

At the moment it has optimisation problems and struggles to get a decent fps UNLESS you have a high end PC then it becomes playable. I have faith that this game will become good as it is in PUBG's best interest to fix the game otherwise everyone will abandon it and switch to another battle royale game. I can say I enjoy playing this game a lot but there are frustrations with the optimisation.

2017-12-11,0,0,871,False,Not Recommended,The game is absolute fun to play however there are some major issues involving game play strategem that the developers can't seem to understand about a game that has a pro/tournament scene along with a casual scene. I refuse to play this game again until they make every item in game usable in some scenario rather than utterly useless as the game progresses in each match. RNG is a factor in this game however due to poor implementation and balance of certain weapons that RNG factor goes up even more after factoring in if you can or can't grab certain items in the start of a match let alone if you see some of the items you just run past them because you can't be bothered. This company needs to look and analyze other FPS/TPP games to really understand what they're missing when it comes to concrete gameplay versus drastically unreliable spawns and uses of certain weapons at any given time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When I first started playing I could hardly run the game now she is smooth. Granted I have a first gen i7 if I had a better computer I am certain I could enjoy it more but with the rig I have it is no problem to compete. I personally reported 2 people that I knew for certain were hacking due to what I saw in the replay. Within a few hours I was sent a message stating the users had been removed for review and later I was contacted to say they were banned and thanks for the heads up.

SMG still need 10 bullets to down a guy and AR 6 to 8.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,253,False,Not Recommended,Back when the game was more popular this game was extremely enjoyable. Whether it was alone or with friends this game was always fun. The weapon system/RNG felt decently fair the gunfights were enjoyable and overall the maps were good. HOWEVER ever since the game started to become like fortnite it all went downhill. With the addition of more complex skins emotes different maps (I know fortnite doesn't have different maps but they change it) dift. game modes etc. What I actually liked about this game were some of the features that were unlike fortnite. As an avid fortnite hater I felt like PUBG's style of gameplay&gt skins/looks was awesome. But then... the game became more like fortnite... and dropped dead. I do not enjoy fortnite but the way the game works fits well with their system of skins/map rotations and everything.If you want to play this game now be sure to check in to a mental hospital beforehand so that you can get through all of the paperwork. After several hours at a time you will want to take that frying pan in game and smash it on your skull until your face has been beaten into a pulp. After getting killed by a chinese hacker and having to pay 45 dollars for skins that you may have wanted I guarantee that you would rather suck on a massive sweaty chode than play this embarrasment of a game.

2018-10-08,0,0,1049,False,Recommended,This game is much better than it seems. Its the best game I have played ever. Pubg has some bugs but they dont occure that much and arent really a thing. Most times its just one small annoying thing that doesnt matter alot(died once to a bug in 1k hours of pubg and me and my friend thought its actually pretty funny). The lags are as bad as pictured. It runs slower than a dog with 2 and a haf legs. The game gave me and my friends alot of good time and will always be memorized as on of the best or the best game I ever played. I love playing the game for what it is. Its a semi realistic game and I love that style. Im certainly too bad for Arma but I dont really like CS GO s realism but PUBG just hits the sweet spot. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into some more realistic stuff than CSGO or just Battle Royale itself. (I came here from CSGO and learning the game is hard but awesome) The graphics are pretty good and I like themAll in all this game is very awesome with bad perfomance a few but not really important bugs good graphics and a great gameplay.9/10 would recommend,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-01,0,0,240,False,Not Recommended,I ve played PUBG since October 2017 so a bit over a year. I ve had a lot of fun and have enjoyed many of the updates. However I feel that the company doesn t care about improving the game at all. I m often left feeling that it s SO close to being a really great game but that the network/performance issues are COMPLETELY negating all positive aspects. It doesn t matter how great the gunplay is or good the ambience is if it s all detracted the moment lag sets in. I ve tried and tried and tried to give game more chances I WANT it to run well. It isn t even worth it to TRY to play because it s a toss up as to whether or not anything will even register or be worth the effort. All of these feelings have been amplified by the silence that Bluehole (PUBG Corp) gives towards criticism. They haven t completely abandoned the game and community but #FixPUBG was a failure and there s been no official statement on it s future. The people who love this game are constantly left with the quandary of whether or not to quit playing it forever. We re hopeful and holding out but I m losing hope because of the company. This game has been incredibly successful compare the success and growth of Mojang and Minecraft with Bluehole and PUBG.

In my (currently) 68 hours which translates to hundreds of games (yeah I've played a lot of 5 minute games....) I've experienced hacking twice only. I can't recommend this game highly enough the thrill of winning a match is just insane.EDIT I'm now well over 400 hours and still give it a glowing recommendation. I tell all of my friends to buy it and play with me because it is just amazing (and more fun in squads). Yes there are issues.

Small EA style micro transactions are another thing that bring this game down. Game has been out for awhile and it feels the same as it did when it was in alpha. When this game is working like it should it's great but it doesn't more than it does lolEDIT (changed to recommended)Bluehole has actually been improving the game recently quite a bit. New daily and weekly missions give more of a reason to play. New items in the shop that support twitch streamers and imo steer me away from buying keys for crates (which I still think should just be removed from the game) Various permorance tweaks bug fixes a competitive system has finally been implimented and they still promise more to come out soon. Good steps in the right direction and i have to bring that up. Hackers are less common now because of a forced region lock which until they can figure something better out is working just fine for me. Optimization is much better too.

2017-11-23,0,0,1343,False,Not Recommended,"Having played circa 500 hours won and lost matches I can tell you the following This game is ridden with bugs (and I mean Starship troopers sized bugs) It's so poorly optimized that even mid high tier PCs can't run it at stable +60FPS It's been developed by a team that despite good intentions is not up to the challenge they're learning on the way and have (shocker!) under delivered so far. It's trying hard and failing miserably to become a viable e sport Server tickrate is the worst I've ever seen in an online game. There's also de sync issues and lag. At the moment the anti cheat engine is deficent to say the least. In game vehicles are broken specially the 3 seat motorcycle which seems to randomly explode at whim. In game sound is terrible unbalanced to the point where some sounds are so loud they can even affect damage hearing of the player for life. It's extreme RNG may cause the best of players to be killed by a CS GO silverThen why the upvote? There's 2 main reasons. The first one being the very basic reason I play videogames at all it's fun with friends even the random vehicle explosions are fun. The second one is that having used the test servers and being part of the reddit community I see this didn't turn out to be a cash &amp run scheme. BH has hired more devs partnered with MS and is hearing the community. I can see they are working hard to meet their goals finish the game optimize it and add content. UPDATE Feb 9th 2018 I'm revisiting this review to point out that 2 months after the ""1.0"" realease (which by the way means nothing but a rename) hardly any new visible content has been deployed. The efforts have supposedly been put into the so called anti cheat system. But cheating is rampant and I doubt they can ever fix it since the very issue allowing people to tamper the game lays within games infraestructure itself (client side detection low server side refresh rate unencrypted packages). Other than this it's stil unfinished unpoolished ridden with bugs and still fun... when you don't run into cheaters. UPDATE Nov 20th 2018 Probably my final review. During the last 9 months things have nothing but got worse. Player base has shrinked to 1/3 it's still large but because of faulty MM algorithm it still results in relatively long queue times (depending on game mode region and time of the day). Cheating is still a problem. Basic issues related to game mechanics haven't been addressed. PUBG Corp. created a campaign to fix the game called #FIXPUBG to appease the public claim for quality they gave themselves a 3 months deadline and still fell short by a large margin (and even introduce new bizarre bugs!!). I've found myself playing less and less my squad jumped ship game is no longer fun for me. Would I recommend buying it? If you have the gift of foresight and are reading this in 2017 totally go for it. But right now it's no longer worth it. As a personal note I'm kind of heart broken as I write this. I've had very good times with PUBG but I can't help to wonder what it could have become had it had a good development team and a competent company behind it. PUBG will always be remembered as both the most unlikely hit and worst wasted opportunity in gaming history. A pity.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Great game.2nd UPDATE Almost one year after purchase its still fun. It is a work in progress but its far better than the early version I started with. Even with its many competitors battling it out for the lead PUBG still holds a grasp on something special.3rd and last probably (423 hrs of PUBG later) Well after much work the game seems very stable and plays far better than it ever has in the past. I would say its great. Due to competition its population and popularity has dropped but is still a powerhouse in the category. Be patient while playing this game. If your new to the game you will die. Again again and again. Don't hot drop yet. Get used to loooting and demands of the game. In a way thats part of the fun of it. How far can you get? Probably the hardest game on Steam. Have fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-15,0,0,432,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Please don't buy this game! It's unfinshed and buggy af plus the glitches make the gameplay unsatisfying. I recently hopped on the game like a week ago and i came across myself being in debt like how does a person end up with 20 000 BP! Also do you know how long it takes just to earn like 500 BP!? LIKE 2 FREAKING GAMES!! THATS A ANOTHER THING WITH THIS T GAME THE GAME DOESN'T REWARD YOU PROPERLY IT TAKES MAD LONG JUST TO BE ABLE TO BUY A FREAKING CRATE AND THEN YOU FIND OUT THAT MORE THAN HALF THE CRATES CAN ONLY BE OPENED USING KEYS WHICH BY THE WAY COST REAL MONEY! $2.50 DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ALOT BUT IT ING ADDS UP. THIS GAME IS CACA POO POO COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER BATTLE ROYALE GAMES GO PLAY FORTNITE OR BETTER YET MINECRAFT HUNGERS!! I REGRET PUMPING HUNDREDS OF HOURS INTO THIS STUPID PIECE OF GAME. Y'ALL BETTER GET YA TOGETHER GAME DEVELOPERS CAUSE IK YALL GOT THE MONEY TO FIX THIS DARN GAME!! Anyway if you plan on buying this game do yourself a favor and go spend your money elsewhere go treat yourself at a restaurant or go to Wendys and save some cash by getting the four for four mad good btw anyway DON'T BUY THIS GAME OR ELSE JOHNNY SINS WILL YOU IN YOUR TIGHT !,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. beep A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound your test is over. The test will begin on the word start.

In my opinion the pros weigh out the cons overall 8 10Also Please dont get disinterested from the other reviews I wouldent call this game perfect honestly far from it but the free content and fixes the developers are dishing out are helping the game so dispite a few bumps I still reconmend this game due to the adrenaline pumping laggy mess this game is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-17,0,0,53,False,Not Recommended,I've changed my opinion drastically since my previous review what started off as a solid early access game with a few minor bugs and room for improvement has now become a game of glitchy ness galore. Not only is the whole game buggy and jittery but it's impossible to find a decent server half the time. The odd time that you do actually manage to find a server results in 15 minutes of looting and then an immediate death due to not landing in the right area. The weapons spread in general also seems slightly messed up although that may just be from my experience. Great if you want to be part of the realistic Battle Royale movement otherwise you're just better off playing Fortnite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-12,0,0,689,False,Recommended,IN MY OPINION..this game was one of the greatest multiplayer game ever let alone as best Battle Royale game. it wasn't boring since everytime you landed on the map it's different possibilities(mostly dead). The mechanics and logic are on point I love this kind of game rather than a game where you start on small map and finish the round a same repetetive and small possibilities.Like I said it was a great multiplayer means it was the best if you played with your friends. Random matching kinda lame to me. Also playing solo is boring af IMO. This game can make a new player feels the chills runs down their spine for a long time my hands are shaking right after my first few game. It was so intense and fun that I could wet my pants.(I'm stlll shaking)I do realize that people are being mad on the devs coz of the hacker issue well I never met one but that doesn't mean they dont exist here. I do hope the devs works on this issue since it was a big waste if this game dead coz of hackers it has so many potential to be the best game ever.IT'S AN ADDICTIVE GAME FIT TO BE CROWNED STEAM AWARD,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-08,0,0,644,False,Not Recommended,"To those who are interested in purchasing be forewarned that this game is CPU intensive and your daddy's old Compaq in the basement isn't gonna cut it. I previously ran the game with an FX 8120 and R9 280x and was averaging 40 45 fps on low/med settings. Now that I have a 1080TI and 7700k I get 90 100 fps average with everything on ultra. That being said this is one of the best EA games I've ever played weekly/monthly updates that fix issues and add gameplay elements and a solid playerbase keep us coming back for more. Gameplay is like an arcadey ARMA which I personally love lots of tense moments and frantic looting. I highly recommend this game if you can run it ofc with Steam's refund system you can try it out yourself. I have faith in PlayerUnknown to publish a completed game in just a few more months.Update 11/25/17 Still runs rough compared to other games but 1.0 Test Servers show some hope. We'll see full release in a month or so and I'll update then with a full review. Still play almost every day.Updaye 11/21/2018 Runs ""okay"" but they put WAYYY to much effort into a battlepass and overpriced cosmetics. Still server issues.

It's a very successful battle royale game and it's a gamemode I've been waiting a long time to really see be developed. However even after waiting for the game to get better since I bought it (about a year ago) the issues really haven't gotten better. I have a pretty good graphics card the game stored on an SSD and a half decent CPU. Even with all of this I can't load into matches half of the time. The game could feel smoother with movements too. I sincerely hope that the ""Fix PUBG"" campaign is real thing and not just some gag from the developers. I want to see this game get better. It can be a great game still. I just can't enjoy it until it's issues are fixed. If the only way to play the game successfully is to dive deep within the game's files and change numerous settings on your computer + graphics card then the game developers PROBABLY aren't doing something right.

2018-06-07,0,0,146,False,Recommended,The game is buggy there are hackers all around that will kill you so easily that you are going to ask yourself if you should leave the keyboard and mouse stll only 3 maps and there are only chinese people in all the server with thier voice chats on speaking in chinese all the time. The game is overtaken by the Chinese and hackers......but still there is a competitive feeling that you get while playing it. It is fun and all but wouldn I recomend it right now....actually delends upon you....as it is a great game. so if you can live with turning off the in game voice chat and some encounters with hackers you should buy this game... otherwise let it go.UPDATE Well...from the last few months devs are working hard to solve the issues with this game. And now it has improved a lot. The hacker problem is also almost gone.....the game runs smooth and most of the bugs are fixed. One should try this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You wait in the lobby for two minutes drop loot for 20 minutes or so then die for the first few hours until you get the hang of it. I have yet to get a win and I have 27 hours and maybe I'm just bad but it doesn't provide a very enjoyable experience when everybody is camping on the third floor of a building sniping you every game. I prefer a much more action packed game such as fortnite where you loot for a few seconds then fight. The play style also is very fun in fortnite you rush your opponent rather than literally camping in a room for 30 minutes which I'm conviced is the requirement to win.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-06,0,0,596,False,Recommended,UPDATE 1.12.2018Updated review to positive.Havent run into bugs in months. The client is very stable. Havent seen a hacker in months.The hitreg is still somewhat of a problem if youre used to cs/quake. The game engine is more suited to military sim type gameplay rather than quake/cs style twitch shooting and performes well as such.Performance is decent. A cpu bottleneck can create annoying stutters during gunfights.Overall definitely recommended!UPDATE 5.4.18Was about to update my review to a positive but in the last few weeks the hacking has become rampant again. Granted there are less raging aimbotters since the replay update but blatent wallhacking and more subtle aim assists are once again frequent making the game unplayable.The hit reg is also still abysmal. Shooting moving targets is largely guesswork. The playermodel seems to have nothing to do with where the hitboxes are.Great game. Especially with a group of friends. Server issues have finally started to subside but...In the last few weeks cheating has become unbearable. Last 10 games 7 had blatent rampant cheating. A car driving through buildings full auto no recoil ars from 300 meters and blatent aimbotters not event bothering to ads but rather hip fire from hundreds of meters away... Until PU does something about this the game is completely unplayable. Do not buy!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My review was positive this game back in the days was awesome it was a masterpiece of battle royale now it's junk but lets move to the review. The optimization of PUBG after this whole time is still wack it's even much worse there's still lots of bugs netcode is terrible they added a new (large) map after ONE YEAR they added two maps in total in one whole year.

What I do know is that the devs are working to fix these bugs which takes time of course it doesn't happen as fast as we'd like but it still happens eventually even if it takes an entire campaign to ""Fix PUBG"". I would recommend you buy this just keep in mind it might be frustrating hell it WILL be frustrating but keep in mind that if you die to a hacker or a bug stops you from getting that sweet Chicken Dinner they may not get banned straight away and the bug may not get fixed straight away.

2017-11-16,0,0,796,False,Not Recommended,After a year of playing lots of hours the game was fun and frustrating. Lots of bugs some fixed some are new.

Now i owe about 12.5k BP ingame great! As for performance the game got better but not like other games. It still has many performance issues including endless loadings and crashes. I wont even talk about bad fps in some cases its awful.In matters of content not many things has changed either. We have few things from time to time. Only paid skins nothing more.Many things could be changed for the better. Small things but great for the user experience. For example the waiting lobby is really annoying and tiring. Some times the timer wont start for sometime or has 30 plus seconds remaing even if the lobby is comlete. People like me who like to hot drop and die most of the time in 30 seconds have to wait more than a minute to play next game.Tl dr lots of bugs bad performance few new content lots of paid skins developers don't listen to the community.

2018-11-25,0,0,1624,False,Recommended,I've been playing PUBG since it was first released it was my first battle royale game. It's a great game and can be alot of fun especially if you play with friends. Gameplay is mostly smooth with a few hiccups here and there. I'm not sure why or how but I experience more hitching and server issues now than I ever did before. I wish the circle algorithm was more random and finished in weirder places I seem to get the same circles often. Sometimes there's a lot of wait time early to mid game where nothing happens depending on where you land of course and mostly on the 2 larger maps Because of this I wish they would incorporate mini objectives throughout the map that maybe give you gold or rewards for completing. That way you feel like you're still doing something and the game doesn't drag on in areas with no action.Another thing is the reward system I have almost 1500 hours in this game and still haven't received any of the rarer items. I've opened numerous crates that includes the free ones and the locked ones you have to purchase a key for $2.50. It's not the worst thing I still play and have fun but it would feel nice to be rewarded for the many hours i've sunk into this game.All in all it's a fun game even when new games come out this one keeps pulling me back. Thumbs up to the devs and creators and I hope they keep working on it and releasing good content. Cheers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-09,0,0,131,False,Not Recommended,It has a lot of potential and a promising ammount of updates. The base game as of currently is really fun but needs improvements.EDIT This game is still fun and had lots of potential for improvements but after the recent updates I have come to the conlcusion that pubg does not care about their game or community. They only care about the money adding new items in the game that you can pay for and so on... Still no optimizations or bug fixes. Hackers are pretty common unfortunately and can get really annoying.On top of that if you have a controller plugged in the game automatically thinks that you are going to be using that said controller. The only way to fix this is to restart pubg and unplug your controller before starting pubg back up. You used to be able to disable controller support through steams controller configuration settings but for some unkown reason bluehole thought they needed to remove that option as well.You have to be a special kind of stupid to be beaten by a game like fortnite(not that fortnite is a bad game).Another thing is that crossplay was something that pubg was potentially working on but the last news we heard from them was about 5 months ago (since I last updated this review). I understand it's probably extremely hard to make this work but they keep adding new things to the game which is time that can be spent figuring out how to set up crossplay for pubg or even bug and optimization fixes.The only reason I want crossplay is so that I can play with my sibling who own a xbox.Here's some gameplay of me and my friends screwing around when the game was good.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v oXlufjlM8Q8EDIT 1/5/19This game has not improved a lot on overall quality and just seems to me the devs are trying to milk out as much money as they can get. The movement in this game still feels sluggish the aiming feels off and the bullet drop is just ridiculous. That's just a FEW of the issues with this game. If you want to play a good variation of pubg just go to Ring of Elysium it's free not a horrendous disk space w**re and just downright runs better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Since I wrote my review I stayed away from the game however coming back now I can say many issues have been fixed and the game is in a good playable state. Optimization and performance is still not great however has been improved. In general all aspects of the game have been improved. Not great but good enough. In general the game is a finished experience still a little rough around the edges however renewed developer support gives the title a great outlook of improvement. TLDR The poor developer support has been fixed and the game is back on the right path.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is far from a full release and the port that they are doing to xbox isn't gonna be any good. This game has poor potential and will be dead in less than a year at this rate. I mean honestly if I drop at a 2 story building I find a pistol and the person who dropped at a small shack that's 2 feet wide gets an ak?

2018-11-25,0,0,390,False,Recommended,Great Game has a few kinks but has come so far in the past year for me it is the best realistic battle royale game (100 people on a map last one standing wins) there is at the moment. Absolutely worth buying the devs are active and are constantly updating the game and tuning the parameters sometimes it can take them a while to get something right but they do eventually if they had released the game as it is now it would have taken off way more than it did. They have managed to create a balanced game where if you think ahead you wont leave it to luck winning can come from luck as it can come from skill and if you have the skill you can make the best out of a sticky situation and reverse everything with a simple smoke grenade that draws their attention somewhere else ! The closing circle adds just enough of a randomised element to make it interesting and to change up almost every game you drop into. The only complaint i have is related to something that has no effect on gameplay Battle points the ingame currency are pretty much useless it is frustrating to let us buy crates but then require real money to buy keys that then open the crates. Other than that its an all around good game and i have yet to get bored of it after 300 hours of playtime! As a warning it is a fairly difficult game it can take months to get a win as you're facing against 99 other people! but when you win for the first time alone or with teammates it makes every other loss absolutely worth it.PS Play with Friends or search for teammates on a group finder it becomes a completely different ballgame !,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Holding down W + SHIFT so much they might as well rename this game to running simulator the devs even thought of that and included a auto run function. THANK GOD3. Toasting laptop up to a point where even the keyboard is pain to touch4. Oh wait you got a desktop? A friendly benchmark 300 Fps in CSGO &lt 60 fps in PUBG5. Turning your sound to max to hear those tasty footsteps then getting jump scared by a camper with a shotgun6. Highly addictive game no gf/bf7. Cheaters/glitch exploiters as this game is in development8. Winning that chicken dinner is literally as satisfying as eating one9. CHINA NUMBER 1!10. 中国人在中点跳!11. Squinting your eyes to see the small pixel of enemy miles away12. Sound is messed up. Gunfire from the front sounds like from the back. LOGIC? MY EARS ARE AT MY BUTT13. Most of the time you won't be able to see who's firing at you until you dieded14. You have 2 choices. First deploy in a highly populated areas like huge villages with lots of weapons drops but get killed as soon as the firefight starts. Alternatively deploy in a secluded area and get loot to be taken out later by other players with better drops. Both are equally fun15. If you have friends better co ordinate your deaths because either one of you died too early and get to watch for the next hour while your friend TRIES desperately to get 1st but never does.16. Oh i found AKM with no ammo...17. FINALLY ammo *tries shooting at some random guy a mile away and miss every shot because you have no sights*18. Pray your weapon drop is not a crossbow. 19. Tries to be a camper and listen for footsteps like a horror show ready to jump scare you at every moment20. Still remember H1Z1? Nah no one does21. Got in a room? Get teleported out of the room because lag says so22.

I've been playing pubg for over a year. And last month I finally decided to uninstall the game after months of not playing it. There is too much broken in the game for me to enjoy it now and not only that its lost its appeal. I spent a long time hoping things would get better and they didnt. The most fun I had from this game with playing with friends aside from that i found i almost never touched the thing. I had no interest in it if I wasn't playing with other people. My true love for this game is not from the game itself but from how it brought my friends and I together how we would laugh and rage at the broken vehicle physics the phrase ""we are proud of our vehicle physics"" which was said by one of the top dogs of Bluehole became a meme within my friends because the vehicle phsyics is absolute It feels like playing with a hotwheels car theres no weight to it. We would spend entire games looting have amazing equipment just to lose it all from a headshot from a guy with a Kar98 across the map. While that risking it all is a part of what makes the game fun its not fun when you get killed by t reasons. Such as the fact that people recieve data differently than you do i could be getting shot move behind cover and still get killed because on the enemies screen I was still visible. Thats not due to me lagging its not due to him lagging its due to us recieving and sending information at different times which is entirely pubgs fault. Why is that a thing in a competitive game with Esports? Why did it take months for vaulting to be released Pubg? Why is there server wide lag where everone on the map freezes? Why is there so much broken in a game I payed $36 dollars for a year after I bought it? And dont get me wrong they do fix stuff frequently small stuff but the most important things to fix take or took way to long.

2017-11-23,0,0,721,False,Not Recommended,This is the third time I'm writing a review for this game. The first two times were positive I praised the game for it's mechanics but criticized it for the optimisation.My last review was after 1.0Now the game is pure trash. Hit detection is off almost every time. Optimisation only becomes worse after every patch. Devs work more on cosmetics than on the game (the cosmetics still look like trash. Minimal art that can be done by a child). Now there's a battle pass esque event pass which is clearly ripped off fortnite. Funny thing is bluehole is still sueing epic games (LOL).I don't know how they managed to make the world's most played game and managed to bring it to such a pathetic state. Says a lot about the devs. They were actually considering releasing paid DLC? What a joke! I really like this game. A lot of us do. So please fix it and give the players what we want.

2018-12-04,0,0,653,False,Recommended,I have a mixed relationship with this game. When PUBG was launched it was one of my favouite games and I accumulated hundreds of hours on it. However this game has turned for the worst. Let me elaborate. Servers This is by far the biggest problem with PUBG right now at least for me (keep in mind I play on OCE). If you are connecting from anywhere in OCE region lock will not work at most times of the day. I will be placed in an asian or american server every game unless for some reason I am playing TPP squads at around 5 30pm. Any other gamemode or perspective will route you to an asia or american server resulting with high ping. Fixing this issue will make this game MUCH more enjoyable for players from this region. Bugs This game is riddled with bugs. One of the more annoying bugs occurs when the player jumps out of the left side of the plane causing the player's perspective to jolt foward which is severely annoying. Gameplay Gameplay is what redeems PUBG for me. It is incredibly addictive for competitive players. Ignoring the bugs high ping and other problems gameplay is definitely the strongest assest to PUBG. Weapons and attachments are farily balanced and the situation with the bugginess of cars has improved.Hackers Being from OCE I rarely come across blatant hackers even when playing on asian and american servers. However when I do and I report them they are usually banned within a few days. What is more questioning is the severity of the ban. I was once killed by a player who was blatantly wall hacking and aimbotting and I reported them. They were banned but for only a day. Questioning slightly I let it slide as it may be the first time he was banned. However a few days later I was killed by the same cheater and reported him a second time. He was banned yet for only a day again. PUBG needs to add long bans if they want the cheating situation to improve.Overall I would recommend this game if the problems with it were rectified and you don't play on OCE until the servers are fixed. While the problems with it are infuriating the gameplay it offers in my opinion the competitive intense gameplay make up for it. If Bluehole actually fixed these issues the game would be back on track.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-26,0,0,193,False,Not Recommended,i like how they recently worked on the game to help keep their player base. I like the winter map. I like the graphics actually even. Driving is ehh. Gun sounds are great. Biggest issue is making the game smoothe. The game itself is simply not smooth in regards to Transitions Running to shooting Jumping larger jumps windown climps and some shooting. It is simply delayed. When I see someone I want to shoot immediately but the game has to change animations and there is a delay in that. It is the iest part of the game in whole. Again I am impressed in their effort to revamp the game but it still has the core buggy issues. People will end up getting fustrated. And as for the fortnite copy of a battle pass that is ok but we paid for pubG. We didnt pay for fortnite. I do like how the revamped landing after parachuting. That is smoother for sure. I want this game to work. BUT THE CLOGGY SLOWNESS is messing that up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-08,0,0,701,False,Recommended,"Possibly the most addictive experience in my 30+ years as a gamer (started on the Atari 2600 time flies! sigh ). This game WILL make your pulse race. It WILL create memories both fond and cringeworthy that will haunt you every time you revisit where they occurred. Victory in PUBG 'tastes' better (pun intended) than any other game for two reasons 1) Death is only an unnoticed/unheard/unanticipated action away and 2) The odds are just plain long 90 100 to 1 depending on how full the server is. Besting 90 other tenacious humans in ANY endeavor is a feat let alone in a kill or be killed unforgiving environment such as PUBG. Whether you go out in flames in the first 45 seconds or hide in a bathroom for 30 minutes you want to come back for more. You come back for the variety the novetly the comaraderie and the peril.Sadly all of this vibrancy and potential enjoyment are completely and utterly RUINED by the sheer number of hackers that have invaded this game. It happened once before and subsided but this last week has shown that they're back and they're worse than ever. It used to be an aimbot needed line of sight. Not anymore! Walls floors even mountains are no longer capable of offering protection.I love the Replay functionality of this game. It's smooth easy to use and downright cinematic. But using the Replay round after round to relive hackers skillessly rubbing you out when you hit that all important Top 10 is equal parts vindication and rage inducing keyboard bashing frustration.I almost never write reviews and to all those developers whose incredible work deserved my praise over the years I apologize. To Bluehole you jolted me out of my apathy to write this not by what you've done but by what you haven't FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS HACKING UNDER CONTROL. There is no excuse for a game that is out of early access and that has this much funding to be going backwards. And while you're at it keep working on the netcode. You freely admit in your promo video that you have ""2 billion"" hours of gameplay data. Please use it. Don't have the in house capability to do that? Go buy the capability with a small fraction of the 500 million dollars in revenue you've taken in.I love this game and want to continue to play it but right now it's just not worth it. You really need to go back into early access. For those considering dropping your cash...be sure you know what you're buying.I will gladly amend this review if Bluehole steps up and addresses the hacking in an effective and lasting way.UPDATE One year later and I can now endorse this game. The new map Vikendi is varied in its architecture and locations enough to finally feel like someone put some love into the map rather than randomly assigning the same 16 barebones buildings to loosely inhabitable clusters. The cheating is still present but it has become more and more rare over the last 12 months. And as an added bonus you now learn the fate of those you report (four bans and counting baby! Yeah!). The game seems less buggy though crashes do still happen more frequently than in other games. Especially during that critical time between load in and the plane ride. Of course a good sense of humor from your squad and these crashes can add an element of dynamism to the beginning of a round forcing you off course and often to ride to the ""end of the line"" to ensure the relogging player is ""back."" Either way PUBG is still alive. It's still exhilarating and no doubt will continue to soak up free time around the world...",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-19,0,0,2032,False,Not Recommended,This game was great especially in recent times before the Vikendi map update. Cheaters had been mostly dealt with finally and things were good finally the optimisations were actually beginning to be noticeable even one maybe two!! of the players suggestions had been implemented. HoweverRecent update with the new map has I dont understand how but a big drop is game performance client and server side it appears. 3rd person point of view has altered and kinda seems to look from a closer but higher perspective making peeking easier especially prone. The stupid sounds when in your backpack are new and bad ( click click click ) the wind sounds when parachuting are buggy the general wind is again buggy comes and goes sometimes all sound drops out for a few seconds. textures are softer and weird moving side to side or looking side to side is delayed and just weird 6X scope is even slower than before look the changes are small but NUMEROUS and achieved nothing but detracting from a state the game only recently got to which was FINALLY alright. If you have never played the game you could give it a try as you would not know what was and the downgrade now its still a okay game but like many developers they seem to be on their own path which is not close to the majority of the customers/clients.Overall I have to not recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-05,0,0,105,False,Not Recommended,This game has literally become more rehash than it has before still the same errors and leaks. More rinse repeat than other battle royales with the updates. This game itself is great a lot of replayability Even if you play without a mic.Many times however you will run into those people that simply have their own agenda and do their own thing however more often than not you do have players working together (I mainly que for squadron). The only true problem of this game is it's horrible horrible optimization and memory leaks. Running a GTX 980 8GB Ram an I7 2600K CPU 3.40GHzand this game STILL LAGS. Playing at the lowest setting 'Network Lag' is still a thing even though my machine and internet are well over the capability of playing this game (Not to mention I use an Ethernet cord).One of the biggest problems with this is the 'Network Lag' problem due to poor optimization (Though its probably optimized that way due to how the games mechanics work) and the fact that buildings DO NOT LOAD most every time for 1 2 minutes or more. This has only gotten me killed twice but the problem still stands that you will get a late start and maybe even die since you cannot enter the buildings until they've loaded.Overall the game is highly replayable fun and challenging though the only true downside is the ability to switch from third person to first person it would be far more challenging in first person.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Then it was the influx of hackers (id say its 10% of what it was and that much has improved)Nmow its the inability to get FPP games because of the horde...and I mean HORDE of asian based players playing TPP because Bluehole hasnt got enough servers based in asia to let them play there.TPP is thrid person perspective... which basically means you have 0 skill and rely on being able to look through walls and around corners .The developers are destroying the game that showed so much promise because their biggest market (China) prefers certain modes and they lack any general care when making development changes to the game.All in all..Conceptually 9/10 but execution lets it downReality 4/10 at best.Sound 6/10Graphics 6/10 (but since every player plays with graphics set to low with high textures to combat server lag)Community (have to include this as I think this is where all the LoL players have found a home since getting out of primary school)Other issues like OCeanic server lag bullet drops hit box shambles pretty much only 1 gun combo that wins hackers that they seem unable to get rid of aboility to team up with other people in game very poor reporting system and completely unwise changes to the blue wall system which will only get worse as they try and keep players from flooding to the free fortnight version (which is also jsut as bad if not worse).IMO get outside and do something else.Will I continue to play it?

Good stuff not particularly a noob friendly game anymore. Needs more Optimizations. Doors gets bugged sometimes. Most of it is server side issue i guess.

2018-01-26,0,0,1130,False,Not Recommended,"Just the worst shooting game ive ever played... the only reason i play it is to make bp and get crates. But even that is hard and stressful casue of the poorly optimized game play... and dont get me started on hackers i mean you have a better chance of winning the lottery than NOT running into one... 3/18/2018 i just got my first ""rare"" item from a crate and i've been playing the game since last July so 7/01/2017... yea... i've been opening crates every week since then and i just got my first rare item (teal color which is 1 more rarity than common or grey color) yea dont know what to think other than its rigged i mean am i suppose to believe that i have just the worst luck in the world opening these crates and everyone else that i see in spawn running around with $100 masks or $50 coats have better luck or that everyone one who has those items actually bought them for $100? That is just for one piece not to mention everything else they are wearing $10 glasses $5 shoes $20 hat i mean you would think that i should get a rare item with more than 100+ openings or am i wrong? I dont like bashing games but im just saying the experiences i have and my thoughts about them...The game has gone under some changes and updates from my first review but still is the worst gun game ive ever played... i dont know what to say i wanna like it but every game that i play on it it just sucks for example i just played a match before writing this review and i head shot a guy with a lvl 2 helmet with a kar i had an 8x scope and he was standing still trying to snipe another guy... i dont know how i can miss but i dont some how???...8x from 50 meeters his whole body is in the scope... he runs off cause he knows im trying to snipe him now a little later he come back and im ready for him and we both shot each other in the head same time but you can guess that that is not what happend. It should have been a trade but nope...i die and he is untouched. I look back in the ""replay"" and see that the first time i shot him in the head i really shot him in the arm funny i didn't even hit him in the real game my shot just went right by his head and didn't see any blood. The 2nd time i shot him we both shot at the same time in the replay you couldn't tell which one shot first we both did but in the end i die and he is untouched...i dont know what to say. Another example I have a really mind blowing clip saved i doesn't make any sense. This guys 3 shot kills me with a micro uzi no head shots! 1 shot in the leg and 2 in the chest from the ""replay"". What!? Like i said this game is just to worst nothing has changed im a very competative person i have been #44 in the US in the leaderboards ""could be higher if the game improves like a lot..."" so i am NO noob to the game i have played a lot of other gun games out there and by far this is the worst i would even go and say that it isn't a gun game... its a ""wanna be"" first person or third person shooting game... its a luck game to be honest the game has control over everything not you no matter how skilled you are...4/16/28 Just played pubg on the moblie phone and i've got to say it is what the pc version should of been. Why pubg why... why it the moblie version better in like... everything than the pc. Its better optimized game play and gun play unfortunately is better i mean like when i shoot people scoped in on the moblie version it hits and does damage bullets go where i aim what can i say...The moblie version also has login rewards free bp and items just for logging in! and while on the subject of ""free"" i believe the moblie version is free to play. All i can say to this is ""how can this be pubg?""1/11/2019Still is the worst game ever invented the idea of ""Battle Royal"" or ""King of the hill"" now adays is found everywhere. Eer game has their own little version of it. And sad to say their versions are better than this games poor potrail. Nothing has been improved its been a couple of years now and it is still the same crapy game that it is ever since early access. Nothing has been done with the game mechanics optimization d sync even the crate drops they are still rigged for me... big sigh...",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-21,0,0,117,False,Not Recommended,"This game is polished (for the most part) and if you're merely looking for a ""battle royale"" this a great game for you. I've had conflicting oppinions of this game the gameplay itself is fun but not satisfying enough. Personally I'm not too much of a fan of battle royale and the devs are not exactly what I call great. They kind of killed the mood for me over development. For instance when their servers were over loaded with people hacking and exploting the game. The initial response from the devs was that the issue was already taken care of when it wasn't and they proceeded to tell their customers that they were wrong instead of listening and take care of the issue professionally. Now that's just a bit of a nit pick. The real issue from the devs and the company itself was how they were viewing the exclusivity of ""their"" genre. They proceeded to push law suits against epic games for copying their game which is entirely t but they did it anyways. The irony is that a couple months later they integrate the same type of battle pass fortnite has now if that's not hypocrisy I don't know what is.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It would be nice to play against bots offline and practice with a training mode so we can get used to firing the guns instead of just diying all the time. I personnel never get the oppertunity to kill that much people as the guns fly all over the place and I never get the chance to learn. Could we also get a mode where everyone has to join forces to kill a super enemy? Like a giant military robot who is controlled by one person?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-19,0,0,556,False,Recommended,"Overall great game. Great audio mechanics and gun mechanics (Recoil Sound Bullet drop etc...) But there is some major and minor probloms that should be fixed or balenced. Such as some gun mechanics in SOME weapons. Such as the Kriss Vector and the UMP9 the Kriss Vector has an insane fire rate but does not have a good Fire Rate/Damage Ratio. You can beam someone from around 50 meters with it and still eliminate them with full level three or two armor. The UMP9 has a slower fire rate but much higher damage output which can put you at a disadvantage. But can also help you in the more close encounter maps such as Sanhok or Vekendi Im pretty sure the devs implimented this in the last Patch #24 because when i drop ANY area in Vekendi i always only find ethier a Tommy gun Micro Uzi or a Kriss Vector. which is good for that map but not so much for Erangel or Miramar. But every thing else is very well managed and is very balanced such as snipers and assault rifles. Thank you PUBG devs for creating an amazing game and i have always be on your side since the begining. Love ""WinkKiwi""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-03,0,0,728,False,Recommended,"I said it before that if the game changes then I'll change my opinion. The game did change and if you are into BR games it's somewhat safe to buy it there is enought content to keep you intrested for a decent amount of time but damn was it a bumpy ride to get to this point. Just stay away from loot boxes and you'll be fine better way to get items is to get a leveling season pass it's not the best but a better way that to rely on random loot boxes with ridiculus random chance to get anything good. TL DR At this point it's just a cash grab DO NOT BUY. TL DR Looks like i jumped on 1.0 too much I would still not recomend this. They focus more on money then on getting the game to 100% lag is still a major issue and i have this feeling that after two or three optimalization patches they just stopped working. TL DR After the 1.0 lunch i can finally recomend the game there has been a lot of optimalization done so it's actally playable there are some ""rubberbanding"" lag issues but nothing too serious. TL DR Game runs like and it's quite buggy wait till they adress this preoblem before buy but If your PC can handle it then it can be fun.After 130 hours and after watching and waiting for some siginificant optimalization or bug fixing update i must say don't buy wait and see if they will ""finish"" this game. I'm not talking about more maps or guns i mean the actuall FINISHED GAME something that more guns and maps won't fix. The biggest offender here is optimalization and performance i can't stretch that enough to describe how bad this game runs. From random frame drops at any time to 1FPS(i'm not kidding) while landing there are dozens of games on Unreal engine that look way better than this and they run like the smothest butter you can imagine but it's not one of those. I know i'm on the low end of PC specs but i've played better looking and bigger games with less issues.But if you have a machine that can handle this pice rought bulder then i can say iit's rally fun.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-02,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,Honestly I have mixed feelings about this game .. so far. As a new and noob player which only played the game for 3 hours and only solo matchmaking .. it's .. eh. It's a 100% disadvantage when you your own is new to the game. Sure you watched streams and video's about PUBG but well it's different when you play it yourself. At first thought you might find the game fun untill you die over and over again because well you suck at the game. You don't know how it works. You only can play with people who played the game months before you.First issue I had when getting into multiplayer for the first time wtf are these controls. The controls are set default to QWERTY but too bad i have an AZERTY keyboard lmao.I had to play 3 solo sessions before i got my controls right so yeah at start just landing somewhere moving around editing the settings in general and the controls untill u get killed cuz you're not ready to play yet. Well ok there's no option to play offline or so so you just queue up for another solo session and in you go. And repeat the process. Good now the controls are good you go matchmaking again. Yay you got your first kill with some loot you randomly picked up cuz you panicked as you heard shots and footsteps around you. Then you think what weapon is this what the is this recoil boom i get killed cuz the other player. Right okay weapons in this game have recoil like in CSGO but what kind .. how to practice each weapon and see their recoil and how they shoot? Eh you guessed it right matchmaking only and dieing over and over. Ok you got the hang of it about the loot and weapons. haHA there's much loot what fits on my weapon and what does not? Hello? Anyway when you first land you need to get a weapon asap or you wont have a chance there's much chance this will happen cuz someone else landed faster than yo oh wait no I edited those controls so that's fine .. they still land faster somehow. Boom ded to the lobby you go try again. Then the first glitch I encountered is the loading screen I've had the situation where you see the loading screen but you hear you're in the world already you hear the planing flying and after a while you hear you get ejected. BUT THE DAMN LOADING SCREEN IS STILL THERE. HEY GAME I HEAR ITS LOADED JUST LET ME SEE IT. Anyway I don't think this is crucial unless you count that you're in the middle of nowhere when the loading screen FINALLY dissapears. The maps are .. okay ish? It's open world god damn it you need to check EVERY BUILDING AND CORNER or you get killed from behind cuz you are stepping around like an elephant. Also did i told you i got killed by the second guy because i was looting the first? haha you gotta count on that too. There's a lot you need to think about when play the game and as a new player this isn't so easy. So what did we learn? Don't play solo Play with friends in a squad Learn how to play the damn game because it's easy to learn but hard to master just like CSGO i guessI can't even tell if this is a review I just recommend the game cuz at one point u accept your faith. And well there are moments when you don't die immeidately and you actually can kill some people! WOO. Best i had was top 5. Then it really gets fun,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-05,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,"Fun in theory but it has so many problems that make it a garbage game for newer players. The tremendous wait times in between games (usually around 2 minutes) makes it very annoying to get back into the action especially if you're dropping popular places to try to gain experience. It is incredibly obnoxious waiting 2 minutes for the next game after dying in the first 30 seconds. The next thing is desynchs. I'm constantly getting cheesed out by players shooting and killing me before they're even into view (FPP) and it really adds salt to the wound when I'm waiting 2 minutes in between games. It's like playing Call of Duty except with 2 minute respawn times. Another thing I have a problem with is the sound. While anyone can get used to it after enough exposure I feel like it's not natural in a way that makes sense to newer players. I find it difficult determining where the sounds are coming from (either gunshots or footsteps) and the HRTF sound setting doesn't make a difference (at least for my headphones). All in all the greatest disappointment for me is the wait times. I can deal with all the other issues if I can actually get into games fairly quickly. The sounds might be weird and the desynch might get me killed every once in a while but I would much rather be able to get back into a game after 30 seconds. I know that many people reading this review may think to themselves ""You're just bad play and get good "" and you're right but the problems I mentioned may be a big uninstall for a lot of newer players. Otherwise the game is alright even though it has a niche playstyle and gunplay. My suggestion would be to reduce the match start countdown from 1 minute to 10 20 seconds.

2018-04-26,0,0,610,False,Not Recommended,PUBG has probably been one of the most successful battle royale games of all time. Sure fortnite is more popular but that's only because it's free. This game sure has quite a few glitches and it can be frustrating at times to die to somehing you have no control over i.e A motorcycle randomly flips when you're driving throwing you off and killing you... But however glitchy it is I still recommend it over fortnite. They actively try to fix all bugs in the game as well as improving gameplay for everyone! One issue I have is server stablity. There is nothing more frustrating than watching your death cam to reveal that you were behind a wall and the shots still landed and killed you. Especially early game when you hot drop to school military pecado or hacienda the lag is unbearable and needs to be addressed ASAP.And for a full release game it's quite a joke. The hackers and bugs are ridiculous and I seriously think this game has gone down the drain. They need to fix everything instead of suing people for similar ideas. Who cares if another battle royale is more popular than yours? Maybe fix your and that won't happen.3/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The controls are sublime and the mapping of keys and tweaks to controls shows that ing triple A games need to step their act up. The only problem is that it is coming up against games like Fortnite which is free. I don t like Fortnite but a can see the skill and attraction that game has. If your looking for a realistic battle royal get this it s sublime but if your just into battle royals just download Fortnite. Up to you but I think it s worth it. the game is ing slugish. it takes u a second to pick up something. the map is to ing big it just is. i wondered round for 22.30 ing minutes before i found somebody he beat me fare and square but i have just waited 22.30 minutes just to start again. its ed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-15,0,0,769,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Edited this review based on that you can no longer change your name with BP. I really WANT this game to be great but they keep doing scummy stuff. Make it so you can buy stuff with BP. You can't do anything with the stupid in game currency so why not just get rid of it and make everything in the store payed for with $$$$$$$$$$. I love the feel of the movement and gunplay in this game It really is a great shooter and really fun to play. You need a pretty beefy computer to get decent performance. Feels a lot better at 100+ FPS. However the business model the company is going for is horrible. You can't get anything for free besides the crappy cosmetics that you can get out of the only 3 or whatever crates that don't have locks on them. (you can't choose which crates you get either!) Loot keys should be 25 75 cents not $2.50. Especially when you have like a 1/150 chance of getting anything that doesn't look horrible. Absolutely outrageous. Only buy a season pass if you play a lot of hours. Only recommended if you don't care about cosmetics at all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But my friend isnt half bad anyway he pretty much carries me every match but recently theirs been atleast 10 hackers per game plus about 30 asians 3 games in a row we had Asian team mates. Also Miramar is a decently laggy map more so then the other one. Over all i give this game like a 8/10. Mostly because of how tense this game gets when you are in the top 10 dont ever count on me to not miss a shot at about 1 foot away i will miss every shot,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-30,0,0,1151,False,Not Recommended,This game has had its fun moments. I've played a lot. This game is not as glitchy as people say it is. The problem with this game is the cheaters. 80% of the games I play I get killed by some loser who is either wall hacking or has no recoil(which is a big deal). 80% might even be me being nice. It is easy to spot since you have the death cam and the replays. People follow you through walls. This game used to be fun but its only getting worse. I'm sad to say since I used to like this game but don't get it. Not until they figure out how to control this. They ban people sure but with so many peolple that play there will never be a shortage of people. Not all of them are Chinese as people seem to say either. I'm sure there are a bunch of Westerners who are losers and suck at gaming so they cheat. Look elsewhere. Sadly this game is lost.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Unfortunately as an official there is no effective scheme to prevent cheating which makes the players very puzzled. For such a large company the development group is at a loss to cheaters or cheating software which undoubtedly chills the majority of normal players and then loses confidence in the game.Suggestions for games 1. Strengthen the crackdown on cheating implement the measures of compulsory scanning of computer running software optimize the game environment and take measures to ensure the fairness of the game after the software is suggested to be shut down. 2. Implement a one month ban on hardware and a one month ban on the game once cheating is detected. 3. Develop game playability design many game checkpoints set the intelligent level of robots in the checkpoints and implement single or multi player key problem solving experience for players at different levels. The experience may include street warfare sniper fighting blasting and anti blasting search and elimination etc. In order to encourage more players to find fun in the game freedom to control at their heart and choose according to their abilities.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After sometime I started to check out my death cams to realise that I was being killed by cheaters using aimbots and maphack. Also the desync was a big issue. honestly out of 3 in 5 games I get killed by a cheater while you devs dont do anything about it. Matchmaking is worst as you throw us newbies with pros.

First there's the horrible optimization that still is pretty bad depending on what your system is packing and how much graphic fidelity your willing to give up. Second comes the bugs that pop up after every update when one is fixed there's sure to be another. And Third and final point. Hackers theres been many a match where ill watch my kill cam and see ridiculous things like the persons driving right by me and his cursor isn't anywhere near me but his bullets somehow hit every shot that's fired. Or a person who can even see me cause of how far away he is from me and still manages a head shot when i can't even see myself on their screen. Theres to many different ones to list but until BlueHole gets their head out of their hole and finds a way to stop the madness then ill give this a recommendation but until then ill hold my breath and wait till I can enjoy this game again. 6 out of 10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

By no means is it perfect it's not the best in terms of optimization however for a game that had to release in early access because they didn't have enough funding the game is fantastic. Coming back to the game after about a 5 month break has been super great no hackers and very few details sync issues. The game seems like it's finally in a finished state and just needs tuning on loot to get it to perfection I love the new weapons and can't wait for the new map.Overall rating 8.5/10 (It's like a 9.5 now but it took a fat minute to get there),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-12,0,0,669,False,Recommended,Good Game but still many hacks and bugs,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2019-01-11,0,0,5,False,Recommended,So I heard a lot of bad things about this game like hacking glitching poor performace etc. Well how some of these are present like basically every single online game out there it isn't as bad as it seems. So basically I never found any hackers on pubg (yet) but i've haven't had this game for a month so idrk if it will ever happen. For glitching it only happened for me once in a vehicle (which I assume is the most glitchy thing in the game) but I got insta killed so it was kinda annoying. This game does have some lag spikes every know and then but thats probably me trying to run the game at some of the highest graphics with about 16 gigs and a AMD FX processor And for the graphics this game has phenomenon graphics I was excepting worse. The game consist of 2 game modes which is 3rd person and 1st person. With 4 maps (even thought some maps might be empty) This game has a lot of content to experince with all the different guns (even though people just pick the sks every time) So yeah this game is pretty good especially if you have some friends to play with you. I would recommend only if you're somewhat patient when it comes to this stuff cause you will die lots of time. So yeah 7/10 from me could use some improvements. (sorry if I repeat stuff.),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-04,0,0,520,False,Recommended,For those of you looking to play the game and not just review hopping I will say one thing this game is not for the faint of heart. If you're an emotional nutcase then this game is not for you. If you don't want to see microtransactions then this game is not for you. If you don't want to be killed by an incredibly random way after sneaking around for 20 mins this game is not for you. If you complain about every little thing about every game this game is not for you. If you don't find this genre of game to be enjoyable then this game is not for you. If you rage quit at the drop of a dime constantly this game is not for you. More often than not if you play and love Fortnite this game is not for you (this statement isn't true all the time). If you have no sense of tactic or strategy if you mindlessly run and gun if you can't think critically if you aren't patient then this game IS NOT for you. There are a lot of reasons that this game is not for everyone just like every other game out there. I'm not gonna go play Barbie and write a crap review on it because I don't like it and whine like the 12 year old girl who actually plays it does I'm going to put it aside or better yet not buy the damn game in the first place. Many people on here do not like the game because of many of the reasons I've listed. Although the game does have bugs it does suffer from cheaters and it doesn't run optimally on a crap computer and from time to time does have issues especially with the constant content updates. What game doesn't? i'll tell you that I've ran into very minimal bugs in my 500+ hours. I've encountered a lot of potential hackers but the game has gotten better on that front. Case and point this game is difficult there is a huge learning curve when it comes to PUBG tactics and strategy and to say all that sometimes it doesn't even matter what you do or who you are because some person with 3 hours ingame who has never gotten a kill before and is camping one spot shivering in there boots might pop out of a door when you least expect it and end that 10 kill streak you've never been on. I'm tired of seeing people with 100+ hours giving crap reviews about how it's unplayable or how it's not improved and doesn't progress or it's dead. Those claims are false not to mention almost complelty illogical to say. The fact that you've played makes it playable it's clearly improved because otherwise a million people at a time wouldn't play it and theres been so many content updates and new maps that prove progression and like i said before evening times theres over 1 million people who play almost every night. So there are rebutles to all the over exaggerated claims. I'm not saying the game is perfect cause no game is. You'll die when you think you shouldn't of you'll get kills you thought you shouldn't have gotten you'll die in ways you never thought possible you'll dump a stupid amount of time into just looting and then die and give it to someone else. You'll think every person killing you is a hacker because you're soooooo good at games. You'll report more people in this game then any other game just because you hate that person more than you're ex girlfriend you'll watch every deathcam like you've developed a new religion and because deathcam is actually horrible you'll think the game is full of cheaters. There is always something to complain about when you look for it. There is nothing more satifying then getting a kill likewise there is nothing more annoying then providing someone with there first kill or dying as soon as you drop in lol. but it happens. Put your big boy or big girl shorts on and strap yourself in for a roller coaster of a ride because that's what this is. You can't buy wins here you can't instakill everything or plow through the game mindlessly like every other game and you won't be as good as your favorite youtuber. The game is fun and enjoyable. Sometimes it makes me wanna pull my hair out but I like the challenge and everytime the challenge is different and the situations always change. If you're up for a challenge and want to improve your pvp skills then i'd say take the dive into PUBG in my opinion the buy is worth it. Thank for reading and I hope this was helpful.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-01,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,First of all this game is really fun once you put a couple of hours in. Gunplay and overall gameplay is fun and balanced for the most part. Aside from this being a really fun BR/Shooter there are a lot of issues with the game that ruin it. Desync and laggy servers. (Usually maintenance once or twice a week) Lots of bugs The game is badly optimized My pc specs meet the minimum requirements and it runs at about 60 frames at low/medium mix (2gb rx560 amd fx 6300). But there are people with 1080tis/other high end hardware that have low frames at all settings. My game still gets low fps in some areas where i can play other games (Hitman 2 Fallout 4 Just Cause 3 Rainbow Six Siege) at low/medium and sometimes even high and it never dips below 60fps. Probably the worst issue of all the audio mixing. Some sounds like glass breaking are ridiculously loud and will actually cause hearing problems. It puts you at a disadvantage too you either play at a quiet level while not being able to hear noises like cars driving by footsteps etc. Or you can play at an uncomfortable level where you can hear important sounds but every once in a while you'll hear the red zone or glass windows shattering and it will blast your ears. Microtransactions. There are 20$ outfits to buy in the store lots of loot boxes with insane drop rates (usually around less than 1% to get one of the rarest items) and 10$ royale passes. Fortnite can get away with this type of stuff because it's a free game. This game costs 30$ and usually around 20$ on sale it's dumb that they are putting this many microtransactions in a game thats almost full price. Most of the time the devs care more about getting money than fixing bugs/serious issues about the game.Overall i would not recommend this game until these problems get fixed. If you do buy the game and can manage to get around these problems you'll be fine and have an awesome experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-31,0,0,210,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is great. Or the concept of it anyway. I've never been a fan of fortnite but holy at least Epic Games is not like Bluehole. They cannot help but to up PUBG. They refuse to region lock China despite the fact that 9/10 s are hacking. It takes them 10 ing gigabites to add a single goddamn pixel to the game. They update it every five ing minutes and they always do it during prime time (6pm 11pm). Their servers are complete But despite all of that dumb assery I still loved playing PUBG. It was the best game to play with friends for me. But the final straw was this last ing update. They took away the ability to attach the 8x scope to AR's. As soon as I saw this I uninstalled it. I would return the game to the steam market if I could. I'm ing done with Bluehole. YOU BLUEHOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-18,0,0,161,False,Not Recommended,I don't get to play this game as much as I would like to but thankfully I have a fairly dedicated squad that's a blast to loot &amp shoot with. The game is excellent for it's shooting mechanics variety and effects. Now the downside optimization is moderate at best although this has improved tremendously in recent patches! There is absolutely 0 progression system implemented as yet only cosmetics from incredibly expensive loot crates. It would be fantastic to see this game implement some form of progression or at least achievements with associated rewards. All this said I'd rate Playerunkown battlegrounds a solid 7/10 simply based on its pace shooting mechanics play feel and variety of current cosmetics. A solid buy that won't dissapoint.Edit I've switched my review of PUBG to reflect a current massive influx of chinese hackers aimbots wallhacks see through wall no recoil speed hacking. The past week has been brutal leading to Third Person Perspective being all but unplayable. Until this is addressed I need to unrecommend this game. 4/10Edit 2 Game has been massively improved in recent months there are however still massive glitches and broken mechanics of all assortments. Purchase for a great amount of fun so long as you do not expect the game to always treat you fairly. 6/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-28,0,0,245,False,Not Recommended,Hello guys!After half a year of non playing PUBG I decided to hop back to the game. Firstly the lobby was laggy. I needed to wait about 5 seconds before my item was equiped. Than i joined the game and had loading screen the whole plane flight and than auto jumped from it. Secondly when i was in the game at least for me it still felt the same as when it was in early acces. Non responsive gameplay with delay and still frame drops (gtx 1060 low and medium quality). Lastly I want to say that I dont need battle pass and that Fortnite has... Just make the game smoother and responsive and maybe I will come back to PUBG.That is all I have to say.Happy holidays everybody!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

All of the new maps and ui improvements are great but the core gameplay the moving and shooting are just unbelievably bad and the improvements over nearly 2 years are negilble. Now that there are competitors doing this type of game but with a modicum of polish it's impossible to recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-25,0,0,231,False,Not Recommended,This will be the second time I've reviewed PUBG. The first time I reccommended it. It was a fun game slightly odd and buggy but a great game to play with friends. I've recently gone back and I can't say I reccommend it anymore. I am a very competitive player which means I believe that if I spend the time it takes to ensure I have every advantage going into a fight I should win it. However with PUBG there are always too many variables I can't control. Not being able to control the flow of a fight is frustrating. There's always an angle I didn't foresee something beyond my control. It's difficult to tell how many fights I've won because I had level three armor and the other guy didn't and vice versa. A competitive game a true esport should give the tools to the player and crown the one that uses them best the winner. It should not do what PUBG does by throwing everyone into a pit full of Legos and saying whoever can build the best stick to bludgeon the others with wins.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,1044,False,Recommended,"The game has had a lot of work done it is by no means perfect and there are still a lot of cheats in the game (mainly radar and wall hacks) that need to be addressed and things like the spawn rate of items on some maps needs a little tweaking but overall the game has been improved greatly.I still cannot believe that they do not know how to make a decent UI or a queueing system. It is either one map or all of them. Why I have very little interest in joining Sanhok if we are in a quick join queue we just leave that map so what is the point in your system give us an option to select the which maps we want to queue for any number not just a single one or all of them.A lot of my old review still stands so I will leave it attached. Past review (Negative) Deleted my old review most of the problems listed in it are still valid but as of the 23/06/2018 with the new SANHOK patch the game has taken a nose dive even worse than it was before but the main issue AGAIN is cheating.Over the past two weeks I have noticed a huge increase in the number of both aimbot/wall hack players and also bots playing hte game recent examples 1. In a game of duo's there was six bots working together in a town running around looting in pairs trios when one detected an enemy they moved towards that area. 2. Final circle with 4 people in game guy smokes himself and then ADS kills everyone else on the map from the smoke.3. Guy shooting with red dot from School to Appartments at people who are behind walls. When they move he shoots the walls and windows as they move. I believe this is a bot as when he moves forward and reaches the wall he keeps firing into the wall in front of him.Reporting does nothing as PUBG ignores everything.PUBG Corp are only intrested in hiring new artists to make new cosmetics to put in loot boxes that you have to pay to open. They roll out the excuse ""the artists do not program"" good for them you can make them play test the maps to find problems where there are stupid crash points for vehicles or find other bugs. Or make them redundant and hire a team to fix the damn game.It has been stated and even confirmed in interviews (or alluded to) by PUBG reps that a majority of the cheating is being carried out by Asians why not geo lock the game. Have it that if people wish to play with a friend in a different region they have to be in a group with that buddy. Even if this was only applied to regions with high cheating numbers it would be a good move forward.Cheating is rife and PUBG is slow to fix or add anything. Once there is a decent game out there similar to this I'm outta here.TL DR Tell us what new steps are coming and when to stop cheating. (We already know about the ineffectual BattleEye) What steps and when are fixes coming to stop high latency gamers especially those who use tools to introduce latency. Circle speed and damage a new solution is required. Fix spawn rate of vehicles. Fix spawn rate of weapons and attachments. End of Old Review(Negative)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However it's become clear that Bluehole or PUBG Corp whoever is running this show cares way more about milking the game till it dies than creating a sustainable long term game that makes them money for years to come while providing a good experience. The game breaks in new and terrible ways each update while they add more and more half overpriced skins.

I knew i was bad but PUBG takes that and stomps me under their boot.Now i know that doens't say anything about the game so here's what i have to say on it. The combat system/whatever you wanna call it is great. I really like how the guns feel and with the new parachute rework it has become even better. There's still some things here and there that needs polishing mainly looking at the movement system and placement of some props in the game world where you think you can walk/vault but can't.As a result i keep getting incredibly frustrated at even the slightest most insignificant mistake that i make and when i eventually die i want to throw a very violent tantrum.

2018-12-24,0,0,619,False,Recommended,Its a love hate relationship between PUBG and myself. When first playing the game it was like nothing I had played before instantly hooking me into the battle royal genre. The early stages of this game (third person only) were truly its best the game was smoother with less fancy fluff one map and a core gameplay style. I have met friends through this game that I still play with to this day. The devs started to become slack on updates and as the game got more popular its flaws started to show. FPP is still not 100% great and feels worse that TPP performance wise. Not to mention the lack of support for the OCE region. At one point it was unplayable because of a server PUBG form which we heard nothing from the devs. I took about a six month break from this game only coming back for the Sanhok and Vikendi maps both which were great additions. I still play now and again with mates as its great to squad up and relive those great memories. Would reccomend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,218,True,Recommended,Unfortunately slightly unplayable for me.I play left handed on the mouse so I use arrow keys. Hold breath and zoom are permanently bound to left shift with no way to rebind them. So I basically can't zoom in or hold my breath.... A big part of the shooting mechanic broken by one simple setting. Also the performance is slightly crap feel some mouse lagg like I have smoothing on or something. It's basically as laggy as a highly popular Arma 3 server that hasn't reset in a week.Will change my review when/if they fix this. But being released in early access means they have no insentive to make this a good game they already got money for it.Edit They did end up fixing this issue.

2018-02-03,0,0,441,False,Recommended,The concept of this game is excellent and after a fairly glitchy early release it's finally at a decent level of playability now in 2018. However the amount of cheats/hackers/scum bags using impossible aim mods and getting ridiculously impossible kills is appauling. Its a massive kick in the guts when you gear up and move from cover to cover surviving and looting only to be head shot at 200 meters with an uzi by some player with a Chinese sounding name who was firing from the hip. Or tons of other obvious hack related kills whether the player doesn't have line of site but cleans up your whole team with one magazine or their aiming reticle snaps on to you with t precision. Not to mention when you see a squad run past you so fast you cannot aim or change position fast enough to have a competetive chance at defending their attack. As soon as the dev team sort out the cheaters/hackers i'll change my rating to recommended. Until then save your $30 and a lot of frustration.**edit Nov 2018. The game is running really well now. A few minor hiccups here and there but nothing that really detracts from you experience. The Hackers are still present albeit not as common. The map hack where the cheats can see all people on the map seems to be the one I encounter the most. I'm enjoying this game again and would recommend it just keep reporting the hackers when you find them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-06,0,0,702,False,Recommended,"So after 11 hours on record I think it's time to share my first opnion of the game.First of all DON'T trust the official system requirements at the current state of the game. I've got a 780Ti and an i5 3570k and have to play it on low settings to have a more or less fluid experience. I don't wanna know how it runs on systems lower than mine.GameplayThe gunplay is extremely fun. It doesn't feel like you are shooting with an Airsoft or Super Soaker. You actually have to control your shots and can't spray down everything that moves over a range of 500 meters. The feeling when you've placed a good shot is extremely satisfying. I love the fact that they are going for blood effects instead of hit markers of which I am not a big fan of.The movement is OK but not exactly what I would call direct. If you're running and wanna strave left to right it can feel a little bit spongy. So it's not that easy to avoid shots like in Arma.The vehicles are fun to drive except of the alternative physics which may take control over you from time to time (happens not that often).Performance/GraphicsAs I said the performance is not the best at the current state but absolutely playable (with my rig). I get about 40 70 FPS depnding on the location and how much action is going on.If your system fits with the minimum system requirements I would wait until they've optmized the game.The graphics are good on high and disgusting on low. Don't have a lot to say about that.SoundThe gun sounds are accurate and they make you feel like you've got something powerful in your hands. It's easy to locate where a shot was coming from as easy it is to locate where steps are coming from. Overall the atmosphere in this game is pretty immersive and you'll your pants when a shot miss you by a few centimeters.ConclusionIf you have decent PC and you've liked DayZ Arma or something smilar to that I can totally recommend you this game.Alone it's fun with a friend or in a squad it's amazing.EDITAfter 500+ Hours on record I am still enjoying this game and I really want to recommend it but there are things I just can't get over. To make it short Blue Hole sues Epic Games for ""stealing"" their idea of Battle Royale Releasing an unplayable version for XBOX to grab some sweet extra cash Game still suffers from massive FPS and netcode problems even 6 months after the 1.0 release removing weather for performance reasons and don't patch it back in on the main maps for several months now Not implementing a reasonable map selection. You are forced to queue up for Miramar AND Erangel even though the vast majority doesn't like Miramar. The loot is laughable at times. It's a tactical shooter not a survival game in my opinion.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's so slow and unforgiving you just can not move around. Personally I'd give the game a 6/10 overall. It's alright but needs a lot more to actually be playable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you happen to land far away from the circle plan on walking and dying from being outside the circle. Why? Not nearly enough vehicles spawn in the game. Now if you do happen to get a vehicle it is somehow the loudest thing in the entire game so everyone on the map will see you and snipe you with a pistol because the netcode for this game is absolutely horrendous. (Look up PUBG 60Hz Tickrate Update 14 Netcode Analysis on youtube). Not only is the game netcode insanely unstable and inconsistent but good luck at running this game at a stable frame rate. Even on my system with 64GB of ram i7 6800k and a 1080 video card I get the frame drops.The graphics are a completely different story. PUBG's developers bought everything from the Unreal Asset store. I'm not ragging against this at all because it's a great place to start. Now ""bluecraphole"" is worth millions but they still use assets from the store. Really? The trees look like pure crap bushes do not properly render off in the distance so they look like players. Overall this game can be very fun at times but most of the time it is boring. It's the same grind every round listen to people yell stupid crap while on the plane hope you land fast enough maybe find a gun shoot someone in the face but die because the person is playing with 1500 ping. Let's not even get started on how bad first person mode is. I can't recommend this game. I play it when extremely bored but overall this game deserves a 0/10. It has possible potential but the developers are more interested in suing Epic over Fortnite than fixing their own game. For unreal engine it is not only the ugliest game but the most poorly optimized.I recommend staying away and letting BlueCrapHole fall apart. The devs have no clue what they are doing.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-28,0,0,56,False,Recommended,"I have mixed feelings about this game. I started playing on my friend's account (all hail Steam Share) mostly because of my friends already playing decided to give it a try when it was in the Early Access. Then eventually I bought my own copy on sale.After all that time this is what I have to say (don't worry I'll try to keep it TL DR) Pros no covers/forts coming out of nowhere you either run away or look for cover (I don't blame people who like this mechanic I personally don't) realistic ish feeling when shooting (though it does take some time to get used to how ballistics work in this game) really big maps (well planned too) constant feeling of danger lots of weapons and attachments (and the list is still getting longer)Cons OPTIMIZATION (I mean I know my graphic card is below minimum even though barely but the game's performance has been varying from ""average"" to ""terrible"" and to ""average"" again for quite some time also EVERYTHING else is top class in my PC so where does it even come from? not mentioning the fact that I saw some powerful rigs being slowed down) cheaters (while I'm not 100% sure I met one of them I did witness some questionable plays) money grab (premium pass loot boxes etc. really Bluehole? really?) bugs bugs bugs (just on my first day I encountered 6 bugs ranging from minor to major up until today I encountered 2 more and I expect the list to be even longer) rushed releases with new content (Vikendi for example while the map looks good it's literally the most unplayable one due to its terribly poor optimization)Would I recommend this game? Yes but only if you don't like cartoon ish style of Fortnite and similar games you don't mind somewhat realistic ish gameplay you have a computer capable of running this game on stable 60 fps (or at least 30 whatever settings you choose) you don't mind dying with no kills (i.e. sniper kill or some bad luck) you don't mind mild boredom (matches with little to no fights)Even then only consider buying the game on some sale. This is what I did and I'm still not sure whether it was the right thing. Don't even look at it if it's not on sale as paying full price for the game in its current state is definitely not worth it.FINAL VERDICT 7/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-08,0,0,786,False,Recommended,"I've had a love/hate relationship with PUBG for the longest time but I think I can finally safely say that this is the best shooter ever made. Sure it's still quite buggy and sure it has rough patches in both look and feel that aren't present in similar AAA games but the core gameplay is amazing and just better than what you get in other games. And the developers have made great strides towards polishing this game up throughout the last year not to mention how much content they've added.Even after playing shooters for over 2 decades this game made me relearn how to play them I bought bigger mouse pads I lowered my sensitivity I changed how I held the mouse I bought a 144hz monitor I bought my first ever state of the art setup rather than buy whatever was the current ""best bang for your buck"" all because I wanted to improve in PUBG because it's so challenging and because it really feels amazing to see that you're improving at the game.My biggest wish for the game now is that they expand upon and improve upon the custom game mode maybe even introduce the mod support they teased before launch. Like I said the game's core gameplay is second to none so if we were able to create new game modes around it and do more with it then I feel this game will rival the greats like Half Life and Warcraft 3 in terms of long term impact.Edit Also wanted to that that in my nearly 1000 hours in this game I've encountered cheaters less than 10 times. This is playing EU FPP. I'm saying this because there are so many complaints about cheating in this game and I don't share that opinion at all.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-23,0,0,259,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I dont understand.I saw one of JackFrags' new videos and in that video he was playing PUBG on the new map. It was running great and I know he has some duel rtx 2080ti intel core i9 extreme setup or some crap but HEY IT LOOKS FUN so why not give it a shot?It ran really bad. At the menu screen I would get an avg 120 fps which is nice an all but what really matters is how much fps I get while playing the game. It was so weird In the plane I would get a good 70 100 fps but the closer I got to the ground my frames would just fall. (10 58)Even on the lowest settings I cant get anything higher than 60 fps and no VSYNC is not on. Then after all this bull crap I thought to myself this just isn't a fair game. Its not a fair game because people that have a decked setup like JackFrags get no lag or delay or fps drops and can kill you so easily! they don't know how good they have it. But then what they don't realize is that half the people they're killing have medium to low spec setups which makes it nearly impossible to react fast enough to fight back. Now i'm no PUBG master but I feel as though I would perform A TON BETTER if I didn't get bad fps studder etc. I'm officially uninstalling now Frankly I don't care what new map they add or new sanhok vindeki pass they add OR what new useless attachment they add to the guns.

But that doesn't change the fact that the core gameplay and the weapon mechanics are so much better than any other multiplayer shooting game around. Forcing the player to learn how to manage spray control on a weapon is hard at first but its so god damn pleasing when you get a handle of it.

As far as i'm concerned the major issues have been solved besides the fact that the game likes to crash on the new map but that issue is likely going to be patched in the next few days. For the players that had fun with the beta I think the game is going in the right direction (again). Just give it a try!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-12,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,Hi the game is as you certainly already heard a complete record breaking one. I am not surprised at this as it has a unique feel to it and really involves the player. Although there is not much to win in games apart from cosmetics you can also pick during a game it never gets boring. Surpringsly this game doesnt really need a reward system apart from leaderboards to be interesting I could play this game for hours and then come back on the next day to play again. It is especially fuun with friends as you struggle to stealthily move towards the center of the map to find good fighting/camping positions. I would strongly suggest buying this game if you are looking for an enjoyable shooter/survival experience that keeps you interestet.the price is totally okay normally I dont like to spend more than 20 bucks on a game i dont know but I took a risk this time and it was worth it.some cons exist and I would like to list them to keep the review from beeing one sided. Performance as most people point out the game is very hard to run on decent graphics. I have a gtx 970 that can run most games from 2017 at almost peak perfomance (Titanfall 2 battlefield 1 etc.) this is of course partially because this isnt a triple A titel and in early acces but the game is incredibly unstable and crashes 2 out of 10 games sometimes more but luckily only at the start of rounds. The performance issues go so far that I cannot even run my firefox to listen to some music. So maybe you should wait with buying if you have a weak pc or buy and test it and order a refund if it doesnt work. Dev might be unreliable althou really active the dev promised no paid content before release and he published a limited time offer crate with real money cost on keys. This mightbe a sign of unreliability and many people got upset about it. I can only hope that the game stays away from paid content but no one can garantie so be careful about this.thx.Muhbautzedit the developers are the most undeserving s of all time. They don't even complete their game and bring out in game purchases. As if that weren't enough they now release a 10 dollar dlc. Instead of working on their buggy game they just want more money. I say destroy their buiseness and absoluteley dont buy the game. edit2 This year has only reinforced my postition on this game. I would refund this game a hundred times. They tried to copy fortnite this time. There are now premium season passes. They seem to forget that fortnite is actually free in the first place. Now this is a 30 euro game that has microtransactions and in which you need to pay to even get the least of rewards out of a game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-14,0,0,412,False,Not Recommended,Update 2 After 374 hous of gameplay. They took away the option to choose the map. The animation while pulling the parachute is more fluent while the whole other game is more laggy. The performance got worse.I do not recommend this game.Update 1 After 351 hours of playing this game. They gave us back the free choice of which map we want to play. It still has its flaws. For me personally it is more fun than it is frustrating.I recommend this game.Original review TL DR My review is a warning shot towards PUBG just like all the other negative reviews lately. I enjoyed this but think twice before you get this game. You may have fun a long time with this you may have not. I liked this game very much.First of all I've been enjoying this game very much and I won't stop playing this for now.My problem are the little disappointments that came over and over again eventhough I haven't played the early access. I purchased this game five months ago and I've been playing 250 hours so far. Considering that I also play other games PUBG took a lot of my gaming free time. Because I like this game very much generally speaking. But still there are little things which were annoying. At the time I got this game is was out of early access. Back then we didn't have a map choosing option. It was okay for me because both maps were new. Then they gave us that option and lately they took it away from us. At least halfways. I mean we can choose between the large and the small maps but if we want to play the large maps we can't choose which one of them we want to play and it is totally random. Then they give us an option to buy an event pass so we have the chance to complete missions. Nice idea but it doesn't make the game better. As far as I understood we are not even allowed to keep all of the skins we can get with this event pass. Some are some super expensive things which are gone after a certain amount of days. Please correct me if I am wrong.There are more little things I didn't like. But yeah... Like I said I liked this game so far. It was fun and I will continue playing. I hope all the negative reviews will make the developer or the publisher (or whoever is in charge of that) think. The downside of this is... If the negative reviews kill the community because nobody is purchasing the game anymore the game will die. Nobody wants this to happen. So I hope for the best.I do not recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-26,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,So i just want to say yes i had fun with that game but the performence is t. i just get in the round when the game is already running and objekts are surprisingly spawning (loading) a few minutes after everybody landed.What that means is i can search for weapons ca 2 3 minutes after my enemys ( if somebody landed next to me i can hope and run) i regulary got stuck in spawning objects and have to leave the round (3of 5 rounds)That is the state of the game months after final release and concentrating on lootboxes and skins ( with 2.50$ keys of course)Third thing is that it uses Season Pass Free to Play and Lootbox finance model (in an game you HAVE TO PAY 20$ for),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
