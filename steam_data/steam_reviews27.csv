2017-08-18,0,0,97,True,Recommended,i belive this is one of the best fps battle royale games out there for everyone to enjoy i also recommend looking into reshade when playing this because it makes the game more vibrante and colourful there are lots of youtube videos out there to help you with installing it. Reshaed is not needed in order to have fun or to pull of a win so dont think its a game changer its just a retexture of the game. You feel like you have acheive something when you pull of a win on solo or with a friend and when its you and like 3 others its the most blood pumping experience ever i rate this game 10/10 thats my opinion i really like this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is lack luster and leaves a lot of room for improvement that I feel other games like fortnite are crushing them on. I have the game installed and I can't bring myself to open the anymore.

2018-06-25,0,0,6,False,Recommended,As you can see by my playtime I got this recently. I risked buying through steam sales and I actually really enjoy. But before I go into the review I want to talk about the problems people complain about. #1Hackers. This is something that could make a game not worth it but I haven't encountered anything yet. I know I have short playtime but everyone made it seem like something that happened every other game. Are you sure you don't just suck?#2Bugs. This game is buggy but bothing game breaking. Yes cars flipping out stuff like that but I haven't had any crashes.#3You just die at the beginning or get shot randomly. Think of it like this. Someone shot you. Someone had a better time then you. Someone is better. Why is this a complaint?#4Micro transactions. This is actually very dumb in a thirty dollar game. But it is just cosmetics. Meaning you can ignore it. Sure maybe camoflauge but nothing like Battlefront 2. Anyways onto the review. The game is solid and not balenced but that is the point in a battle royale. Some people get lucky some don't. I have a medim computer but I can run it. Sure it won't work on a mac but it isn't as bad as people say it is. There is a very steep learning curve one I haven't fully climbed but I know that I can. To me it is the second best battle royale game (Best is TABG). Don't be scared by the negative reviews. Game still has a healthy playerbase. Just buy it on sale.7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-30,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,Where do I start with this game from the inbalance of weapons to the lack of protection to the boring maps etc. etc. just about everything about pubg is very obnoxious and boring. I'll start with the balancing I guess while the game offers a wide variety of weapons and armor there are many and I mean many fatal flaws in how they did it. For one there is the armor durability system and while that may seem realistic at first and seem like it should be in the game it really should'nt what the armor durability truly means for the game is that ones success in each round is even more fully dependent on the original luck of finding armor as even getting shot once or twice a level three vest may drop below the effectiveness of a level one which means you can never take armor from others. You may ask why cant you just find more armor or whatever or what does armor have to do with anything if you dont get shot but I will get to that now. for one armor is relatively rare especially at the very end where it can really only be found on others as the zone is too small for you to loot. The problem however with just never getting hit has nothing to do with skill however but instead is fully dependent on the prevalence of overpowered assault rifles and snipers in the game. Now I understand that assault rifles and whatnot have a higher caliber than a random submachine gun but the fact is the damage difference as well as the range of snipers in the game give the advantage to those who have no skill and instead choose to hide in bushes the entire round waiting to shoot at someone running from the zone. While these accusations may seem unfair I have seen better use of weapon balancing in surviv.io (a free .io game similar to pubg) in that game all weapons have fair balance to the point where you never truly have a huge advantage over another just because of your weapon. Instead relying on your ability to use effective cover and concentrate your shots. Any who have played surviv.io enough will agree with me that it is a ton more balanced not just because of the use of all sorts of different weapons for different strategies but because snipers aren't as incredibly overpowered as they are in pubg. When I talk about the lack of protection I am both talking about the vests as I mentioned before as well as the lack of actual buildings and natural cover in the landscape on all maps. In every map the most likely way to die is just walking through a random field because there is no other way to get into the zone. Overall a problem with Pubg is the lack of structures and obstructions that would both provide some sort of color and add intrigue to the map not just the small confined cities on the maps covering less than half of the overall area. All in all this game is definately not worth it and you would have better luck with most other games as the balancing is truly bad.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-05,0,0,1416,False,Not Recommended,I have just over 1000 hours into this game and most of those hours have been extremely unpleasant. There's this thing called desync where the client isn't in sync with the servers. If you are behind cover you are not behind cover to another player. If you shoot another player that player isn't actually in the spot that you see him in. What you see isn't what you get. This game turns good players into bad players making it extremely frustrating for the game owner. There is also a huge problem connecting to games in the wee hours of the night. You will wait 10 minutes to connect to a game or restart your lobby after that amount of time and wait 10 more minutes. This game isn't worth playing. It's too bad there isn't anything on the market comparable to what it could be if the developers would address these issues. The developer Bluehole would rather release petty annoying skins and stupid events than fix this game. I'm about to reinstall after 1000+ hours.

2019-01-19,0,0,1165,False,Not Recommended,With 1150 hours on record I can say this game is not really worth your time/money. The reason I played it so much however is because with friends this game can be fun to play. But unfortunately the developers have no idea what they are doing. It is a great idea/concept in the wrong hands. And with the changes and updates they are doing it seems this game will only get worse. They put terrible loot on the latest map Vikendi on purpose they actually choose to make a game less interesting on purpose.. There is still a stupid red zone in the game for some reason and their vehicles don't care about physics.. The game runs sometimes fine then terrible it's inconsistent af. And then there is the terrible inaccurate confusing sound.. Worst and I mean by far the worst sound ever. Footsteps just randomly stop sometimes sound just disappears leaving you disorientated (while a person keeps moving as shown in the death cam or when checking replay after the game) it is often impossible to pinpoint if footstep sounds are coming from above or the side in buildings it's just terrible in many ways. Never had such a bad audio experience as with this game just horrible. And for me that's taking a lot of fun/pleasure away since I'm really focusing on sound and play on sound a lot cause that's what I learned to do in all FPS shooters I've been playing over the years. I used to play this game every day when it was still new but now I'm just bored and not even surprised anymore to see the developers keep making incredible stupid choices pushing gamers like me away from their game. I just wish they aimed for quality instead of quantity. This game has/had so much potential but it got/is getting ruined by the developers into disappointment rather than excitement.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've reported at least a few dozen but the truth is the owners of PUBG is just not capable or offering a hack free game. So after about a 1000 hours it is good bye.It's Saturday afternoon and playing PUBG with some friends seems like a good idea. WRONG!! Two PC's got hard crashed by the game two games with blatant hackers and 4 bad module this or bla bla bla that crashes the game. How is it possible to be making this kind of money and still showel this to the puplic. I sincerely hope somebody clone this game without the bugs and kill the player base. PUBG does not deserve support any longer. They should be ashamed.The main difference between the Beta and full release is the amount of crashing. Now it is more often an no longer alright!!!! Please pay somebody to fix the pathetic state of this game. The current team is useless.Crash report simulator. This first line was my first review. The following few lines will describe a PUBG players full experience. After more than 300 hours of game play I can truly state that the game is addictive however the lack of a server for Africa is unacceptable for a game selling more than 20 million copies. The money the developer is making must be staggering. The game breaking bugs unfortunately are also. The developers don't have the will to fix the lagging crashing bsod freezing or any other error!!! And no it's not my PC! Pay an expert for his time and fix your game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! jumping over walls is not the solution for program bugs!!

2017-06-05,0,0,384,True,Recommended,As of June 5th 2017. This game delievers better than games like but not limited to DayZ H1Z1 and Arma III. Players Unkown Battlegrounds or PUBG is extremely addicting and fun to play with friends. I have had the game for about a month now and almost have 100 hours invested into the game. The game is based off the Arma III Battleroyal mod (I believe it's the same dev team). And they seem to be making more progress with this game that DayZ has in the past 3 years!Pros Easy to find loot and get kills and if you die... Go again! Simple controls. Can play solo duos and squad (Up to 4 currently). There is actually a goal in this unlike DayZ. A decent variety of weapons for being in alpha.Cons Occational server lag (Dev team has acknowledged this and is currently working on a solution). Buggy you can get stuck in walls doorways even cars trees and rocks. No real Anti Cheat haven't ran into many hackers but when I have it's irritating as hell. $30 it's a bit pricy... The game is definitally worth $20 to $25. $30 is a stretch but worth it if you have the money.Honestly if you loved DayZ or H1Z1 but got sick of the same old t the devs did with the games and you actually want a game where the devs care about their players.

2017-08-04,0,0,202,True,Recommended,Essentially you get the addicting looting and high stakes intense combat that a game such as Dayz and other survival games offer. But you get to do all that in a much more fast paced setting without the running around looking for people/loot for hours on end. PUBG also makes this all very easy to drop right in to. If you die you can just jump right back into another game and get right into the action. The combat can be nerve racking especially when you get down to the last few survivors and is extremely satisfying when you come out on top of an engagement. The loot system is also fast paced and seems to be so far streamlined very well. Rarely have I had a problem finding decent equipment in order to be competitive in this game.

From the very begining china was just cheap labour for all the rest of humanity but something went wrong and these monkeys were allowed to use computer. Especially to play games. But as you may already know chinese garbage is brainless and thus unable to play competetive and fair. So they use cheats to show that they worth at least something. But it isn't so. And it came to this moment to PUBG to game that was made by another asian junk. So while people form Europe/America try to get some rest to play few games with their mates they always run into stupid asian trash that uses cheats just because he or she is too silly to not use.I wish one fаggоt named brandon green one day enabled region lock in PUBG so good people would be able to play without asian monkeys but this isn't the case for him right know since he cares about money only. Until then I'm going to play this so called game a little bit more and will be updating this review with the list of stupid garbage that uses cheats.UPDATE ONE YEAR LATERThe game is still complete Cheaters every second game.

2017-04-16,1,1,66,True,Recommended,Me and my buddy are play duos mode so its 50 teams of two. The match starts with 100 of us in a cargo plane flying over a giant island. We decide to bail over a set of 3 military hangars and a bunch of cargo containers. As we deploy out parachutes we spot one player about to land seconds before my buddy. They both land and take off towards the hangar my buddy behind him and me making chase. The other guy makes it into the hanger first as we scramble around looking for weapons while simultaneously yelling Let s this guy up which quickly change to Oh when we see him pick up a UMP and load it. We charge in regardless and I find a frying pan on the ground.My buddy is now attempting to punch this guy to death as he loads the first mag in. The guy fires off one round likely no realizing his UMP is set to single fire and starts running as my buddy lands a fist and downs him. I around the corner and smash the downed guy with a frying pan with the most satisfying thud ever. We loot his UMP full of ammo. Grab rifles from the nearby hangars and murder his teammate. Then we set off into the wild green forests only later to be shot by sniper fire in an open field.10/10 Love this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you develop a game that uses so much computer hardware just to play it on a basic level what do you think is going to happen to the majority of the market people would way rather buy a game like cs go which is no.1 cheap no.2 doesnt need tonnes of resources to work and no.3 just works and has minimal issues. Yes i understand a large battle royale game is difficult to produce and micro manage. I am not a game developer so i have no valid arguement when it comes to the technical aspects of the game but honestly from the perspective of the average gamer this game needs serious help as it is dying a slow and painful death,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Thoroughly enjoying it so far and managed to bag 1st place on both solo and duo modes once each so far and got a fair few other high ranking matches. They have all been Intense matches and very fun. Sometimes you do die within minutes of starting though but that's mainly through my own stupidity. I prefer this over Arma's King of the Hill or Wasteland Survival servers. It all seems much more well rounded. People seem to moan about optimisation but the game runs fine for me and my PC isn't 'godly' by any means. There are plenty of optimisation guides out there that really work. This game runs better for me than Arma 3 ever did in multiplayer. I hear people moaning about cheaters too. Well 25 hours in and I haven't noticed any of the things people are on about such as people being able to shoot through cover etc. Maybe they're just sore losers after all in reality bullets could potentially travel through pretty much anything you'd see in the game. Maybe it's just that? Winner winner chicken dinner yes... but loser loser blame the user. Either way to summarise I've spent more money on games I hate I've spent less money on games I love and I've spent just the right amount of money on just the right game. This is one of those games.

2018-09-19,0,0,430,False,Not Recommended,TLDR Great game destroyed by greed and laziness*Sigh*This game man...I don't even know where to beginIn April 2017 my friends and I discovered this game shortly before the huge wave of sucess that would ensue throughout the latter half of 2017. It was an immesely fun challenging and captivating experience that I will never forget. Since then I've put nearly 500 hours into this game with hundreds of Chicken Dinners and hundreds (maybe even thousands) of kills and deaths. In less than a year PUBG had become a global phenomenon unlike anything gaming had seen since the days of MW2... Within those 500 hours controveries started to develop... Loot boxes issues with gaming and visual optimizations the list goes on (Thankfully I have a pretty badass PC so I never really felt the repurcussions of these optimization inconsistencies)... But I defended it... Admist all of the dissention I remained hopeful the game would truly become the masterpiece that it initially seemed like it would become the prized child of Brendan Greene that HE wanted it to so badly become. My friends stopped playing it and even I stopped playing for a time checking back every so often to see if it was still the same incredible experience I remember it for......But it seemed that my hope was misplaced...With games like Fortnite and even Call of Duty's own Blackout I simply cannot recommend this game anymore. Rather than remaining competitive PUBG which was once a shining star in a world of overy commercialized gaming has since devolved into a complacent title with little to no concern for it's reamining loyal playerbase. And it's truly sad. All too often do you hear about media that was so absorbed in it's quest for money (*cough cough EA*) that it lost sight of what was truly important...I'm not saying this game deserves to die. I think Bluehole still has a chance to make things right. But they can't succeed by continuing to ignore the writing on the wall. With games like fortnite that continue to dominate and games like Call of Duty and Battlefield now entering the BR fray PUBG is now more vulnerable than it has ever been and it very well might suffer the fate of H1Z1 if they are not careful...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've been playing with a few squads and managed to spend a whole Sunday with the same Squad (after invite on steam) and we got on TS and had a ball.Having the ability to communicate to your team is a must and adds a level to the game being able to say ""Enemy at the North over..."" Its hard to play without a mic ! especially in Squad or Duo.I think the next updates with the FOV Slider will make it that much better as atm im on Triple screens and without the FOV slider you can play properly so its back to 1 at 1920x1080 which is ok but im a triple monitor player.Once the FOV slider comes in... I'd give it 5 Stars..EDIT Bit more time in the game The latest update to allow Microtransactions seemed to stuff it up yes they fixed it by servers were and astill are a bit over the place.20/2/2018.So a fair bit of time in game now both on Solo and Group as well as TPP and FPP.Unfortunatetly the Chinese/Asian Hackers are just rampant. Anticheat from what ive seen has done little. Brendan Greene said a ""Ping Lock"" was on the horizon but stuff knows where and when. Region lock i feel is the only was everyone else can have a good time playing this.ALSO dont blow the car horn near a Twitch Streamer or Stonemountain64 or you will get banned.... Like without Player tags how are we supposed to know. Like these Streamers and "" Well known "" players do some dodgy stuff and get away with it yet everyone else nup ban....People etting banned for blowing the car horn near other players when you cant see them or know who it is... Pretty sadRecommendation Its a a good game with a simple idea.Whats needed to improve it. Ping lock or region lock.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Such high potential and excellent gunplay for a game that is made so poorly. The fact that you can't even tell if someones hacking or not because of the ridiculous server lag and latency issues is poor for a game thats made as much money as this one. The addition of the extra cosmetic cases was the last straw. This game is poorly optimized even with a 1070 8gig the frame rate drop at times is ridiculous.

2017-10-26,0,0,412,True,Recommended,Have you ever had something in your life that caused you great pain but no matter what you couldn't bring yourself to get rid of it? Like an old car that keeps dying in the driveway or a cat that itself and can never seem to do it on the linoleum? Sure when you have it and its the main source of anxiety in your life you hate it but if that car got wrecked or the cat passed away you know you would be sitting with your buddies shooting the breeze and remembering the good times? PUBG is the video game representation of that.On the one hand it has almost no optimization the servers are potatoes the game is rife with hackers and it has a toxic community. I'm writing this review right now because their servers are telling me that I need to un patch my game (version2.6.41 &gt 2.6.39). If you buy this game and manage to drop without a bunch of AFKs farming crates or a hacker shooting you through walls and impossible distances consider yourself lucky.That being said there is nothing I want to do more right now than play this game. It's gone and I need that heart pounding action the cold sweat suspense and the savory gravy of a digital chicken dinner. This game doesn't give anything to you on a silver platter you have to earn every bullet every gun and every kill. You are hunting the most dangerous prey while at the same time being preyed upon. You can play perfectly and still not even make it to the top 10 because the other thing you need is luck. As soon as you get on that plane you need to start praying to RN Gsus that you get the equipent you need and the positioning to make it to the top your skills will tilt the odds in your favor but they do not gurantee victory on their own.Speaking of skills get ready to hit a real steep learning curve. Every control in this game is essential and being able to quickly and confidently switch from running to crawling to peeking to looting shooting punching kicking and screaming is key to victory. Remember that the other players most likely have the controls down and an understanding of the ballistics and weapon qualities in this game. If you're a total pleb like me you're going to spend about 2 hours learning the non combat stuff while 99 other players try to kill you.Ultimately I would recommend playing this game. The technical direction is ambitious. 100 players free for all on a HUGE (really huge) map with thousands of randomly spawned items and active combat going on at all times is quite the experience. You can play this game any way you want find out what works for you and go nuts you don't have to have the biggest best guns and armor to win you can even win with 0 kills. If you are looking for a triple A title that is polished smooth and fully developed I would say wait a few months but if you can deal with early access bugs and a few jackasses put your money down on this game and play. I'd love to hit you over the head with a frying pan some day promise that you'll try to do the same.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-02,0,0,239,True,Recommended,This game has a great dynamic and it's one of a kind. Only issue I have with this game is a few glitches. Most noticable is sometimes being prone behind a tree and not being able to strafe anywhere even though my prone is not blocked. I also find it very strange as to why PUBG does not have an african server although every continent including South America has one. I find it distasteful at how South Africa has a very broad spectrum of online gamers and the number increasingly grows and we have to share European servers with 0 2 second delay (makes huge difference). One last thing maybe add a feature where a person can wield their pistol (if they have one) while they are bleeding out. Otherwise a good concept. 7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-03,0,0,226,False,Recommended,PART 1 PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS one of the best games in battle royale genre that you can paly in solo or dou or even a four man teams or if you feel adventurous you can play solo against other for man teams. the game itself is great due to it's exciting simple and amazing gameplay which is really addictive and amusing that can keep you busy for hours . if you are not a fan of complex story lines and other stuff like that and you just want to drop in and start shooting people.... well this is your game. the goal of the game is very simple drop in &gt loot &gt kill or be killed &gt if you got killed start again but if you killed be the last man standing to win.the game presents four beautiful and of course huge maps with diffrent landscape and weather and conditions which you will spend hours trying to learn and explore each one . PUBG have over 30 guns with diffrent statistics ( diffrent recoil diffrent damage diffrent range etc ) which are so realistic you will feel like firing a real gun!!! and by that really need to work on your shooting before playing this game because due to this realisticness in guns shooting system is pretty diffrent than other shooting games. the game core gameplay is really simple but there are tons of various strategy's to win the game maybe you are a cautious player want to avoid other players while moving toward the safe zone or the opposite you're a spary and pray kind of guy . either way you are free to play in the way you want.there are however some downsides to this game and one of them is the annoying bugs and glitches that WILL ruin your experience and the other thing is the game's poor optimization on weak computers... i mean if you want to have a 1080 p 60fps smooth gameplay you must at least have a GTX 1070 graphic card other wise you must tweak the graphic options alot to achieve that smooth gameplay.but the game IS a must play because it is really good (even with those problems that has).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-02,0,0,767,False,Recommended,Honestly most of what people complain about on this game are just things that are either a part of gameplay or just a lack of understanding on their end Though I agree that they had a really rough start and did some wack suing the people that created the engine they're running on Still ridiculous by the way they've been updating and optimizing the game well enough that it runs at a smooth 150 90 fps on my end with a AMD 6300 and a GTX 1050 ti before that it used to run at 45 frames and drop to 27 frames at worst on the lowest settings and though this will sound awful but I'm working with facts here with the ban of PUBG from China and India there's been a lower percentage of hackers and I've been paired up with players who I can communicate with easier. At this point all the complaints about players knowing where you are and always getting shot out of the blue is all on you the gameplay requires you to have spatial awareness. Hearing footsteps and any type of noise and being able to determine the direction of the sound accurately is something that you need to be able to do in order to thrive in a harsh environment where anyone could be anywhere. Also to note when out in the open there's a large amount of players and running anywhere is a chance you have to take so if you're not prepared for that I can reccomend Fortnite or any other battle royale genre but as it stands this game is just starting to live up to it's pricepoint now it's being worked on and fixed up and it's not as bad as your friends would tell you if you liked realistic slow and tactical shooters. All I can reccomend for the develoment team is to work on the cheat engine a bit more it works a good portion of the time but it's not as effeicient as how Rainbow Six Siege has theirs set up.Have some faith.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-11,0,0,1055,False,Not Recommended,I played this game when it was released. Enjoyed it as much as my friends did. It was one of the best games of it's genre. It even topped on Twitch consistently for months on months. It's popularity skyrocketed like I've never seen before. With all the support they received both fan based support based and monetary based the developers could not provide anything that the players asked for. I remember at the start they promised to not release loot boxes in which you'd have to buy keys to unlock. Now all they have are those. Apparel skins and gun skins are now available for purchase. It's another CSGO market for skins except the game is dying. Well deserved. Thd developers almost did exactly what the community DIDN'T want.The gameplay on release was super unoptimised. Expected for an early access game at the time. Since then they have done very few improvements and the game still runs poorly. The gameplay is super clunky. Again was expected for early access and now to this day it is still that way. Nothing in the game actually feels SMOOTH. It doesn't actually feel like you're in control of your character. I'm not a genius of any sort on programming video games but picking an item up should not take 2 seconds. Especially when you land in a heavily populated area and you need to be fast. The hit registration still does not function properly and the glitches in the game are still there. Getting launched in the air after hitting a pebble or having a vehicle explode because it clipped a centimeter into the ground is not a functioning game.This game was going places not anymore. I don't wish bad on this game or the developers but they need to fix the game. It could be a great game. The team just needs to actually listen to their fanbase. A fanbase that is dying so they better do it quick.I uninstalled this game in January 2018 after Alpha to give it one more shot. Couldn't handle it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-01,0,0,497,False,Not Recommended,Honestly this game just keeps getting worst and worst after every new update. Still no ping lock servers so expect to get killed by someone with super high ping playing on the wrong servers. Expect to run into cheaters nonstop as well. Honestly I loved the game when I first started playing it. But like I said after every new update they don't fix any of the real problems. This game wasn't ready to be full release either they just rushed it to try and get awards which who CARES about awards. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game unless it's on sale. Pros When the game works right it's so much fun getting to the top 10 and fighting it out against everyone who remains is a rush of adrenaline where the game truly shines. Shooting mechanics are some of the best in games. No silly bloom where you aim and fire the bullet will go as long as you adjust for range. Armor system overall is good. Plenty of comestic items to dress your character however you like. Cons Hackers cheaters ect still a good bit you'll run across just not as many as there once was. Glitches galore loot system not properly working. Wonky vehicle mechanics People with high pings in wrong servers. Bad map design for the newest desert map just laid out all wrong/barren with not much on it in a lot of spots. Overall you'll have plenty of fun with the game but you can clearly see all the flaws with the game when playing it.

2017-12-23,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,"Hello I do not mean to be redundant like a lot of the reviews but uhm I kinda' like the game casually. I was playing well taking turns with a friend I had over on Solo since he was kinda' interested in the game so I invited him over 'n well we were swapping each game we played. So anyways I'm up 'n I get to the top five 'n things are getting pretty hairy. I was having fun with it and all and I get wasted of course. I don't mind that much since I don't tend to get too upset over games and I shrugged it off as better luck next time but I decided to click that kill cam thing they added 'cause we were both baffled as to where the heck this bugger was hiding since the circle had shrunk down to just this tiny patch of land with like two trees. When we watched it this son of a cussing cuss word happened to be hiding behind a tree and I don't understand the way it worked out but they went into 1st person then turned over to the ground and started shooting me somehow through the floor while they were behind the tree. After seeing that it didn't upset me or anything but it really did bum me out. Also it left a bad taste in my friend's mouth and he isn't going to buy it because of that. Anyways the game is pretty fun but I have trouble convincing myself to play it now since I think ""oh that sounds fun!... Wait... Egh that might happen again I'll just play something else."" So I guess if you can put up with it that's good but it just sorta' takes the fun out of it since instead of feeling any excitement at the thought of playing it these issues with stuff like that make me feel kinda' pushed off with the game. I know most games have cheaters and I hear there's a lot on this one but something about this huge tense 100 person situation 'n being snuffed out like that just really takes the edge out of the game since it feels more like I don't have an incentive to try and do as good as I can to win since that bad taste just won't leave my mouth. I'm not sure how hard the people making this game are working and all but at that moment my potential interest to enjoy the game further as well as my friend's just sorta' crumbled.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is a realistic battle royale game that is very similar to Rules of Survival. This game has better character movements and better graphics then ROS but not by far. The descent is rough and innaccurate. Also the weapons and gear are hard to find because they are randomly scattered. I prefer Fortntie because the graphics are better and the character movements are way smoother. I do not recommend buying PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I once loved this game it had decent gun play and the whole battle royale idea was fun. But for the past month its went completely downhill. Bluehole cannot use the ""Its an EA game have patience"" line that they used to always use.Things need to change drastically. This game is popular because of the genre that it is in. The gun play is subpar at best and the movement is so unathletic its disgusting. I have a beast of a computer that runs the game at 240 fps but whenever i get into gunfights the game freezes. Teammates constantly lag out and sometimes i see enemies ""skip"" across the battlefield. Theres no region lock so therefore you que up with people who don't even speak your language... which results in many many losses.

Now i know its not fornite by not being free but this is a game that costs less than a game like fifa or Call of Duty which does also release yearly so spending 27 isn't an unreasonable cost if you compare it to other games. PUBG is very unique for instance the weapon veriety amazing so many weapons and attachments that do so many different things such as the grips one reduces recoil one reduces the time of ads. The maps as well HUGE and stunning to look at. Also with the maps they are well balanced instead of a game like fortnite where there is really only one primary location Tilted Towers PUBG on the otherhand has many take Erangel for an example you have School Hospital Shelter Milta the bridges and obviously the Military Base. Although PUBG has only one game mode Battle Royal it brings it to a whole new level team up with 3 other friends in squads or go alone in solo. Weather you like FPS or TPS PUBG has both to offer. Although when playing you can encounter the odd hacker its very rare. Overall i love this game and i highly recommend to anyone who is interested in purchising this game. ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-13,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,This is the first time I've written a review in years for a game. This game is a complete piece of junk and will not even boot most of the time that it is run. I am computer savvy and have attempted every possible (and shouldn't have been necessary) workaround that I could find thus far and to no avail. I was able to get the game to run for an hour or two but generally I get a random crash to desktop on booting the game. I would love a refund and to avoid this company at all times again in the future but due to the nature of keys I doubt that will be possible. In the meantime I just want to warn people that this game for some will be completely unplayable in its current state and obviously the developers don't care at all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-17,0,0,36,True,Recommended,PUBG is a fast paced arcade like Battle Royale game. It's a extremely appealing game with all ages playing and a fast growing community to back it up.CORE GAMEPLAYThe game is a 100 player ffa but with a max of 4 people in a squad the game consists mainly of looting and is 50% looting and 50% fighting. The game begins with a plane flying over a island there are many spots to jump out into and once landed its a ffa. Whilst playing a blue barrier will in circle the island and kill anything outside of it and it will result in players coming together.COMMUNITY AND APPEALThis games community is not an easy one to settle into it is 'toxic' and 'salty' and you will mainly be flamed. This game is extremely competitve (resulting in salt) and is great for anyone that is in to a competitive shooter like CSGO which is where I came from.PERSONAL STORY AND REVIEWI believe this is a very great game especially to play with friends and is a great game for only 30 AUD. With a strong backing and growing player base PlayerUnknows Battlegrounds is a fantastic game and its position at #1 of the most players playing on steam is well deserved though the only problem I found is the computer system requirements which have since upgraded with frame drops though minor it is something to noteEND REVIEW8.5/10 Winner Winner Chicken Dinner,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They just adding some things every update some of them are really good (maps for example) some of them just useless unless they fix bugs and cheating. Also they removed trade. It's okay to me but previously they removed rain and fog for some reason. For what ing reason? Who can tell me? It is a rhetorical questions guys relax. They can just add option to select type of weather! But they are simply deleted it... Thanks god FPS are stable (at least I have &gt 65 most of the time) but it's not enough because I'm playing almost at the minimum settings. But other games my computer can carry on high or ultra settings (DOTA 2 GTA V (not on this account in steam) ME Andromeda and others).So if you really like the idea (or game without technical part) go and play.

2017-10-25,0,0,988,True,Not Recommended,The gameplay is great its innovative its groudbreaking whatever you want to call it it really is a lot of fun to play. Now lets get to the actual game itself IF you can call it that. It runs poorly on every and all systems. A top of the line system like mine can barely run this game at 60FPS on almost all VERY LOW settings. The server lag is cringe worthy the lag compensation and shot desync is the worst in any game ever released to date and I can say that with almost certainty. They want to push the game out of early access in less than two months yet you cant even play this game without massive performance issues still. Keep this in early access and fix the massive problem this game has. This game is the highest selling game of 2017 Bluehole has the money and resources to fix these issues yet are instead trying to implement a vault/climb system into the game along with a new map. How can a new map even come out when the first one is still not optimized. This game has TOO MANY issues right now to recommend outside the fun gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Most of these complaints don't seem to be related to gameplay! I understand server issues can be annoying and I know that there is a ton of money floating around for the developer to use but come on! The game is great and even better with friends. To be honest I haven't had many issues connecting for the last couple months so they must have improved something.

After 300+ hours in this game i have to stop playing. It could have been fun if bugs were fixed and the game was optimised but after being time and time again killed due to lag spikes and stupid glitches the game is just infuriating. The devs are a complete joke and are greedy beyond all reason trying to sue Fortnite is just one thing they've done. If you enjoy walking around for 20 minutes before freezing and being killed to some behind cover then this is the game for you. Just avoid this game if you enjoy having fun in your videogames.

2017-10-17,0,0,245,True,Recommended,So there has been a flood of Negative reviews flooding the steam store recently around this game and they are perfectly justified.The game seems to be taking a strange direction a market is forming around in game items apparently ads are starting to be rolled out and last but not least people are starting to complain about the games' mainframe. Every aspect of the game the hit registry the server response time It's all being pointed out as being utter crap apparently. Now the public should always make their voices heard Bluehole will listen if the numbers drop. And I say again all the outcry is justified. Especially if you fall a victim to the ban hammer and its what you'd call 'unjustified'.However as an avid player of this game I can say I for one haven't experienced any of these issues the game runs relatively well for a game hosting 100 players on a large sized map with hundreds possibly thousands of items being simulated in real time. But people focus on this and the servers too much.The game gives you thrill like you can never imagine proper full spectrum stress right into your bones chills as the bullets fly shock as the artillery explodes. This game is unique as it hits all the rights notes of making you feel danger makes you fear for losing your oh so fragile life. I may not have hundreds of hours but the gameplays fun every loss makes you want to fight on every kill makes the adrenalin pump harder and faster.This game is worth the buy it has cracks in its walls it has holes in its flaws but it does something incredible even though it looks like a bombs hit it.Its early access for a reason and when its out of it then we all will start the rioting but as an avid fan and one ready to wait and watch... Keep on marching Bluehole !,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,This game is very boring. There's not much to write about otherwise because there's not much to this game in terms of features.I suppose first person mode &gt third person mode but it's still a boring walking simulator with shooting mechanics that are definitely not for everyone.I can confirm the reviews that mention optimization issues. On top of that the movement in the game feels clunky. Bullet drop or bullet drag isn't by definition a bad thing but unlike BF1 it's very difficult to get used to shot behavior in pubg not in the least due to the lack of action in which to practice your shot.June 2018 update The game seems to be improved in terms of framerate. That said there are still crashes and the worst part is that pressing the interact keybind on items isn't responsive. Looking at an item for 2 seconds and spamming the interact keybind until it works is a big part of the PUBG gameplay. You might wonder why is there a disparity between reviews and player numbers what's the deal? Well... I have no idea why people play it. Most of your deaths in this game will be guys camping a corner of a room for 10 minutes in hope of someone coming in. It's random super campy not very rewarding frustrating.

I have played fortnite ( A FREE GAME BTW) and never once had this issue. The DEVS in this game wont fix anything but will continue to put out crate you have to spend money on even though you payed for the game. You want a season pass? haha ALSO SOMETHING YOU PAY FOR IN A PAID GAME! This is Destiny all over again but sh*ttier. If this game wants to succeed they need to create incentives for people to want to play. Either make the game free and pay for crates or pay for the game and get everything. The network sh*t NEEDS to be fixed for a company that has an average of 500k players on at once at any given time that paid for the networks to be up should be able to play....how can this not happen....?

2018-08-15,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,I mean I enjoyed the game when it was first out. I've put a fair amount of hours into this game but I am completely burned out. The battle royale genre is boring with many matches feeling the same as the last. In terms of the game itself the quality is very questionable. It feels clunky and very janky. The matches last too long in my opinion making solo games utterly lacking in action. Playing with friends was good fun but with most friends leaving this genre it is hard to find anyone who wants to play who are not competitive and just want to have fun.Most of the time I play this game now I find myself to be frustrated winning is no longer satisfying getting killed by someone even so they were not even aiming at you destroyed my tolerance to this game. The devs have done a good job at bringing in more and more content into this game at which I can applaud them for. But with much of the content being held within a loot box is just dragging me down. It takes a lot of games (most taking about half an hour to complete) just to get one loot box with the ingame price to open one up increasing after being one. I am not motivated by this system to get the credits to open the boxes. It doesn't make sense to work to get a piece of clothing which looks awful. The main way to get something which actually looks decent you will need to spend actual money. I lost interest in this kind of system after playing csgo. I don't see a point in playing this game anymore.If you like the genre I would suggest you do more research on this game before deciding to buy it. I mainly stopped because I am tired of the gameplay but who knows the game could be good for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Overall I love this game and I like to spend my free time in it. My wish to PUBG creators block more and more cheaters and all possible ways to cheat and solve all old bugs that are still present in the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-12,0,0,602,False,Not Recommended,"I have over 500hrs into this and don't recommend it. The game seemed like an excellent start when it was in early access. Even though it was far from polished it had loads of potential. In early access I forgave the terrible performance lag desync terrain issues lack of region lock etc. This game is now a ""full release"" and is no better possibly even worse than it was just before the 1.0 release. I won't discuss cheaters. They do ruin the matches they're in just like most other PvP games and I hate them but they aren't the main reason I dislike this game. When the game is running 144fps it still feels like 30. This game takes a very good PC to push a 144hz monitor to it's potential but even when your PC shows it's up to the task the game still runs terribly. This is not just my experience but also that of people I play with. This is possibly the least smooth game I've ever played. The servers are no better then they were in early access and with the amount of players now actually feel worse then they used to. I'm not 100% sure what causes the poor hit detection but it's abysmal. I remember complain of hit detection in CS hahahahahahaha CS hit detection is 1000% better than this game. Could be because it's not region locked and you're playing against people all over the world could be the poor game performance desync generally bad servers... Not sure exactly but I know it's broken. There are still terrain issues both on foot and driving. You can be standing on solid ground and can't ADS because it acts like you're falling... You can be driving on perfectly flat ground even middle of paved roads and it can act like you hit a wall or catapult you into the air... These only got worse with the addition of the map.They have fixed none of these major issues that have been present the whole time but they've added loot boxes and more useless content pretty much just to make them more money. At this point it's pretty clear they don't care about the quality of the game and only care about the money.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-17,0,0,971,False,Recommended,I'll start off by saying this game has it's flaws. Every game does the dev team could definetely put more work into the game to make it run smoother and make it a better experience for everyone. There are hackers running rampant and there are people playing out of their regoin because either they dont care or they want to take advantage of the lag compensation.Why am I giving it a positive review though? Even though it can be frustrating with all the chinese and getting flattened by hackers the times that it isnt happening are some of my best experiences playing any game. The joy of getting your first chicken dinner running over a full squad with a vehicle or just messing around chucking grenades at your friends is just amazing. As long as you don't break the rules you can do whatever you want to entertain yourself it's got near unlimited potential to do whatever your heart desires.Focusing on the bad side of the game a bit more I understand and admit the game has major bugs and downfalls but that is near unavoidable in a game of this scale. The coding to allow up to 100 people shooting at each other in a enormous map with vehicles is a phenominal feat to complete. As I have mentioned above the developers could put in more work to make this game better but it will take time and a lot of testing to make sure this game moves towards a polished state. I imagine that the game will go through very rough times to get there but all we can do is to keep enjoying the game as it moves forward to possibly go down as one of the legendary games to exist.This game is a great investment and will bring you hours of fun and it will only get better as more content is released and the creases are ironed out.

2018-07-12,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,"Game keeps getting worse with every update. Instead of fixing it Bluehole releases a 10 Event Pass that actually gives you fancy skins and BP bonus for a limited time. Yes we know everyone here needs a BP bonus 'cause the BP you earn after each round is absolutely trash. If you end up first you get nearly 1k depending on your kills (not on Sanhok though which gives less BP than any other map). Crates cost 700 1400 2800 4200 5600 7000 BP. Do you realize that you have to win 20 times in a week to get the max number of crates? Sure you're not forced to get all the crates but playing hours and hours to get 2800 or 4200 BP and then receive a locked crate that you can sell for 0 01 cents at the marketplace and which you can't open without buying a key for 2 00 that's a insane waste of time. Another problem is the fact that most players take this game as a job like selling crates through third party websites gonna make them rich irl. This has been partially fixed but it's still a issue and I started to get tired of those ing chinese bots that advertise VPN and hacks. Last but not least hitboxes are terrible you get headshots randomly even with a Level 3 Helmet you get shot behind a wall you get killed by a random cheater laggy servers animations suck physic sucks driving vehicles suck optimization could be better only 3 maps in more than a year (and the last one is pretty small) event modes are useless and boring.

2017-04-02,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,PUBG is a game with tons of potential. I badly want to like the game but find it hard to look past the stability and performance issues.In some regards PUBG is far more polished than other batter royale games. It's easy to launch the game and jump into matchmaking with a few clicks. However it's currently impacted by graphical severe performance and network stability issues.The game client is horribly optimized and struggles to stay in the 30 60 FPS range on lowest settings on my dual Nvidia GTX 970 SLI. I've had to give up the 144 Hz I normally expect with other shooters. Moving around and fighting is jerky and stuttery. The network code is unstable and it's common for players to continue being shot even after ducking behind cover receiving hits and blood spatter in their previous position 1 2 . Servers have no ping limits and players with high ping sometimes get a significant advantage 3 . Although I've been able to parachute in and complete a number of matches some players are reporting that the game exhibits insane lag and rubber banding 4 .The network stability issues seen by other players have not affected me although it's sometimes hard to tell why I died. A shot rings out from the distance and I'm dead before I see my attacker. Or I duck behind cover successfully but seemingly die anyway 2 . The game sorely needs an instant replay feature after death. It's frustrating being unsure whether my death was fair or due to lag (like in 2 ).However the bigger problem for me is that the game performs horribly compared to others. I can't play a competitive shooter effectively at 30 FPS. Even at the lowest gfx settings PUBG struggles to get into the 30 60 FPS range.At the moment I recommend passing on PUBG. It is still in early access mode and weaknesses are to be expected. Unfortunately I find PUBG less playable and ultimately less fun than other early access games I've enjoyed. The PUBG team has a development roadmap focused heavily on optimization which may resolve these performance and network stability issues 5 but as of today they badly affect the game. I'm still debating with myself whether to return the game and check it out again after release. If hese issues concern you then I'd recommend holding off for a few months or until release. 1 https //gfycat.com/LimpExhaustedCleanerwrasse 2 https //www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/62z98y/high_quality_servers/ 3 https //www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/62ygkk/lag_compensation_in_this_game_is_broken/ 4 https //www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/6300rz/servers_unplayable/ 5 https //www.playbattlegrounds.com/news.pu?type_cd 3#news_list_area,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,330,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDSOkay so im gonna take some time to review this amazing game. I have played PUBG for about 200 hours right now and i havent tired yet. Its a online first person or third person action game. Its very good that you can choose to play third or first person in my opinion. Its a fun game to play with your friends since you can play duo or squad but you can also play as solo. You are supposed to find loot around on a deserted island. Its like the hunger games movies. There is 100 persons from the begining and you are supposed to be the last one standing. Its a circle that make damage on you if you are outside it and its getting smaller and smaller. In the end the last standing guys meet each other in the small circle then its only one guy that survives. Well to talk about the game it self i would describe it as a very good and fun game but since its a early acess game there is a lot of bugs. But what i think is that the creators of the game could lay some more time on it i mean new weapons and new maps since theres only one map right now. But il guess there is coming new stuff to the game pretty soon. I would say pubg is the best battle royale game out there better than h1z1 king of the kill. If you rattle over if its worth to buy it i would say YES in my opinion its definitely worth 30 . I give this amazing game a 9/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-27,0,0,223,True,Not Recommended,"Played this game and observed it's progress and community on Reddit for 6 months or so. I watched it develop and played it for over 50 hours so I'm in a reasonable position to inform you here.I want you to understand that in PUBG you have to spend a lot of time trying to stay hidden from enemies. Your clothes are a huge factor. Now I want to tell you that despite reassurance from the developer ""Player Unknown"" clothing is being placed behind a paywall with the introduction of microtransactions. ""BP"" is an in game currency earned through playing that was used to purchase item boxes that contain appearance items (shirts pants shoes etc). Now you must purchase those item boxes for $2.50 combined with an in game BP price. Also you can also find duplicates in these boxes. The conclusion of this on gameplay is that those prepared to spend vast sums of money are able to choose from a wardrobe of clothes in various colours such as green brown or black to blend in with the environment (dirt grass concrete etc) while the rest are in a grey shirt and jeans which stands out more often than not.I refuse to recommend this game to anyone because the competitive nature is utterly compromised by the greed of those in charge. ""Player Unknown's Battlegrounds"" has sold 6 million copies earning close to $180 000 000. It only ever sold that well because of the communities willingness to purchase it in early access (It is by ZERO means anywhere near the finished product) the coverage it received on social media and the good will and support of the community. Bluehole and Player Unknown have stabbed everyone in the back for the sake of money. While Bluehole and Player Unknown may have already lined their pockets the community will remember this for a long time. When your 15 minutes of fame are over and the games time is up your betrayal at the expense of the people who made you will be remembered.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-09,0,0,551,False,Not Recommended,I really want to give this game a good review. But I can't. It's fun if it works and if the community wasn't a steaming heap of dog doodie it might feel like a well balanced shooter. The exploits that have been abused up to this point are dumbfounding and can only be blamed on Bluehole (shooting through walls if you delete your files being able to see people on the ground in fields if you delete your grass files etc.) The game rewards camping to an insane degree. Are the odds against you? Camp because you will win. The amount of client side content is overwhelming. If you throw a smoke grenade and think you're covered think again the smoke that your enemy sees could be blowing in a completely different direction The community is trash people will team up in solo free for all matches The game disconnects for unknown reasons and you cannot rejoin enjoy your rating drop! ) The development team seems more focused on new content and adding micro transactions ASAP rather than fixing current content. It's another one of those Early Access dev teams... exactly what I was excitedly hoping they would not be. The connection to the server is buggy at best expect to open doors multiple times to get through them and not shut when you swear you hit it 4 times only to turn around and have it open because it was bugged and was closed but wasn't registering Then there are the hacks that have been PUBLISHED &amp ADVERTISED in videos on youtube (seriously go look them up) I am playing on a 4790k/980ti/16gb with ssd machine and still have trouble with game performanceIf you have ever played Call of Duty and thought that community was bad this game turns those issues up to 11. Great idea TERRIBLE execution.EDIT The most recent update to the ballistics calculations (or w/e) has dramatically improved the game. There are still client side issues to be adressed that may never come to pass such as throwables registering different for each person etc... This is progress but the developer has quite a bit of work to do before launching this game fully. Not recommended stays for now.EDIT2 Glaring bugs still remain at 1.0 launch. Vaulting is cool Miramar is cool but this game still feels like it's broken. Sound bugs when a grenade is equipped as the primary weapon and you are killed it makes NO sound when it hits the ground great for trolling. De sync is NUTS you can lose gunfights just because someone's connection to the server is worse than yours and you shoot at them and miss 100% of shots. Maybe I'm alone here but if you have a bad connection to the server that shouldn't magically give you an advantage you should be the only one with a change in advantage. Get a better connection. Overall it still feels like I'm playing more against the bugs the hackers and random physics events (bikes flipping upside down when hitting what appears to be just another small mound that should be driveable) than against players or even game mechanics. Am I going to agrue that this game isn't going to change the shooter genre or even games as a whole? No. But all of the things Bluehole (PUBG Corp) is doing could be done much better if changes were made from the beginning. If you want to build the best massive PvP shooter at least make it fair and iron out your bugs. Til this happens I'm eagerly awaiting the Counter Strike Battleground style shooter.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-14,0,0,81,True,Not Recommended,DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! Unless you want to waste $30....... 7 months with a glitch that keeps you stuck in the menu. Only fix from devs does not work. Other fixes are random people grasping at things that happen to work for them. Some of which end up experiencing the same issue even after fix weeks down the line.For the time it did work there's no practice mode except just fighting so I guess you can run around aimlessly or die within the 1st 30 seconds. Maybe if you get lucky and live if you happen to be skilled you can deal with the horrendous bouts of lag. Don't even bother about matchmaking unless you speak multiple languages. Nothing against foreginers but I would like to be able to communicate with my team. That's kind of why I chose my own country's servers not the one in Asia.If you can somehow have fun with your friends past all of these issues there are some updates they plan to release but personally the waiting time to que up combined with how quickly you die the inability to communicate with matchmade allies and the bugs with being shot behind solid objects that still persist make me give this a solid 1/10. Maybe 4 if I'm being realistic since it's in beta. No response from devs. No proper fixes. 7 months since I spent $30........ don't make the same mistake I did. If you do?

2017-12-03,0,0,316,True,Not Recommended,I really love PubG BUT I also hate pubg! Its one the most frustrating games due to the player base. The devs have gotten SO greedy they no longer care about how the players play this game and sadly its not even in full release yet.... As i write this if you do a US server and que you will 95% not have other americans or people speaking english on your match It basically makes a 4 person team unplayable! This game REQUIRES teamwork and communication BUT the devs have fudged it up so badly that there is no way of communicating with most of the people due to them being able to pick the wrong server.These people also are the majority of cheaters in pubg as well as the people who farm the creates people sell for hundreds of dollars for the items inside... Basically the game is increadable! if you have a premade group of 4 friends its great fun BUT if you wanna casually play and just join a match once n a while to go shoot up some people its next to unplayable as is and this is due to the devs not forcing regions onto thier own servers... The pay for the creates has made SO many of the chinese players cheat it also makes the game rather not enjoyable. But sadly since a HUGE base comes from china they wont do anything about it. Most of those people cheat get boxes make cash then when they get banned they have made so much from the cheat acct they purchase more accts. So go figure the devs dont do anything right? its all most cash in thier pockets if they allow cheaters and people who shouldnt be playing on US servers to play.... Great game but in this state it is in atm DO NOT BUY!!!!

Even though Its still an alpha I can't get the most out of it running low and very low on 1920 x 1080 resolution with my GTX 960 and quite often getting drops under 60 fps. There is a glitch where the buildings won't load as soon as I land but I believe its just a RAM problem &lt currently at 8GB&gt Gameplay wise I think its the best game in its category and definitely better than its competition made by great devs listening to the community and taking care of the game. I'd say this game is a must if you like survival/fps games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-01,1,1,426,False,Not Recommended,The idea of this game is great and I have had my fun with it but recently my experience with this game has been quite For starters the game has so many bugs that even opening doors or picking up guns is a hassle. One game I played I was being chased by a guy with a shotgun so I went into a crate and picked up a gun to kill him. The problem was that the gun was in my inventory but it didn't show up in my hotbar until about one minute after I picked it up and well by then it was too late. When guns and looting are a major part of your game you would think you might not want those things to be buggy but maybe that's just me. When it comes to hackers I have played with only 3 or 4 but I know other people that see them all the time. It's honestly the worst feeling knowing that there are only 5 players left but you can't win because a hacker will just quick scope you with a pistol. The devs of this game are slow scummy and honestly pretty bad. For example they (usually) only update the game every month which is fine but then you look at other games like Rust that have small teams that update their game every Thursday. The devs are also REALLY money hungry I mean they make 100 million dollars off the game and yet they have the audacity to add in microtransactions to an already expensive bug filled alpha game. All in all yes this game is a good idea and if the devs put in more work I feel this game could be great but for now I do not recommend purchasing this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-29,0,0,923,True,Recommended,Make sure you can run it but It's worth the money and I'd buy it over again. Believable bullet physics and gunplay Decent momentum system on foot (so people don't spazzily zig zag) Variety of weapons and optics Enough variety in the map to have many different firefight scenariosAnd most importantly Hard working devs that release frequent updates content and newsPeople complain too much about PUBs even when it is this far ahead of the competition. This has a great balance between hardcore realism and quick/casual playability. It's also easy to apply real life logic to in game strategy and get a good result which is convenient when having a tense firefight. The best part for me by far is finding an effective workaround to the tense situations that the RNG puts me in. Getting caught between the zone and another squad sucks but thinking quick and getting yourself out of it is one hell of a good feeling. Its fun in it's current state but it still has a long way to go. Regardless PUBs is a good game for the price and it is replayable as hell.Keep up the good work guys.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-25,0,0,358,True,Recommended,Great game that has alot to offer but im worried it will turn into a game like CS GO where the devs dont care about the game but the money that it brings. There are some small changes that need to be made like getting rid of window bars for example that will just make the game that bit more enjoyable as you wont be raging over how annoying they are. No big changes are needed just small adjustments. I also think they need to make loot spawns more predictable as sometimes its stupid that you could loot a city and find nothing but someone could loot a shack and find an AR they dont need to make the loot spawns fixed but for example if you loot po i you can find 7 ARs They dont need to make these figures public but have them there so loot is more predictable. Overall its a great game but it needs small changes to help make it just that bit more enjoyable for the community.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-19,0,0,194,True,Not Recommended,You know what? This game is fun. The core concept of the gametype is fun but with the server issues I just really can't reccomend it to anyone. Due to server lag textures in the game don't pop in on the bulding right away and you can't access loot in the beginning of the game. This effect is unintended and so basically its random whether or not you re going to get screwed. You queue into a game you sit for a minute in the games toxic lobby chat with the sound of loud gunshots and your eyes hurting from the frame stutters while people just overload the out of the engine bcause for some reason it packs 100 people onto a small island with every explosive in the game then you get on the plane wait for another few minutes drop down to the ground see that you can't access the buildings get immediately killed and then repeat the process. This was a minor 1 in 25 games issue but after recent patches this is the typical PUBG experience. I play far more graphically intensive and download speed intensive games than this by more proffessional studios with no issue. While Bluehole is busy pumping paid DLC into the game their game is dying from amateur optimization. DO NOT purchase this until this studio gets its act together and fixes it's crap.

Get rid of the hackers as much as possible add a shooting rage mode or practice mode and improve the game on the graphics parts because mine is GTX 1080 Ti and sometimes it is laggy that it shouldnt be. Other than that It's a good game. I don't care about how you guys change the weapons. I do care about how u guys do about the hackers. (p.s. The top 10 is a good target. U guys believe a guy play 14 games this season and have won 11 of them? Even if u are the developer I dont think that is possible. And Names like PandaTV 82389128 these are some Chinese broadcasters and they usually run some hacks that the games cant detect.

Great fun with friends when you get a squad together.Weapon mechanics are really satisfying and I like the level design. It's nice there are now three map choices as they all play quite differently. Graphically it's a nice looking game.The game seems to get a lot of flak over the way it runs. I personally have no problems running 80+ FPS 1440p (I7 4790k + GTX 1070). I think a lot of this can be sourced back to the launch. They have optmised it a LOT since then and are continuing to do so. Yes it has it's flaws particularly the way some of the vehicles drive... but it doesn't detract from how entertaining and tense it can get!100% recommended.

I would never recomend such a terrerible game. if you buying this you where either forced by the creator to make profit an idot who was tricked by their Michael Bay Trailer or a for some other inconceivable reason. on normal computers this game would run at lease 40 frames for second.(im not joking) As a person who was played since the early access and a sunk a total of 422+ hours into this horrific game I can say three things. the Creators and buissness funding this game do not care about anything that would cost them money unless they make more money from it. Two their team of creators are Lazy wastes of oxygen that in the new map Mirmar there are buildings that are clipping together and building with no some stairs. Also they're sooooooooooooooo lazy that their huge building that look cool to explore but they don't want to load because their terrible system can figure out if it wants to be stupid or . they blocked it with trash and debris. and lastly they know jack squat about how to could of do anything to make the game fun. final opinion stick to watching the funny moments or whatch out sucky the game really is at ( www.Twitch.tv/Techno_mage_21 ) more will probably be added.

2019-01-28,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,"I have 174 total hours on this game mainly because the gameplay was fun. However your game should stay on that level of fun identical to your first impression. PUBG does not do this at all. Much like all battle royales all you do is battle against 100 players which is probably one of the coolest concepts I've heard in a long time. However PLAYERUNKNOWN thought it would be a great idea to make the first two maps released not even that fun and instead put 90% of the map a vaste wasteland of either green or yellow. The only map I like is their new Vikendi map which balances out size and gameplay.This game gets a big update every month or two which is fine if that update wasn't a singular gun and some bug fixes. You know occasionally they add a map that's enjoyable for a while. Guns in this game almost seem unbalanced. If an M4A1 is better than a shotgun at close range because I have a better chance at killing them I'm gonna use the M4A1 because I'm not gonna gamble my shot like I'm playing Mr. Game&amp Watch on the new Smash.If you play this game by yourself it gets boring so naturally you go into matchmaking. I've never hated a community more than the COD community but this community really sucks. It's not that big of a deal but it pisses me off when I have to play with an AFK guy and two other people who suffer from depression and anxiety. Playing with friends is the best option when playing this game period. The variety in this game is so bland. I'm not gonna talk about the skins because they're only cosmetics. My concern is ""Can I kill a player that isn't a gun melee or grenade?"" I know there are cars but besides that what else? Put some environmental activity like Battlefield 4 with its levolutions. Put a banana in the game I literally do not care just add something fun.PUBG is boring. It lacks a consistency of fun the community sucks the combat is boring and repetitive on top of that it's not even balanced. I'm not saying this game is the worst battle royale out there in fact it does feel great after coming back after several months of not playing. I really like the new map and weapons they added overtime. All they really need to do is make all weapons feel ""more"" useful in their proper situation and keep adding updates and maybe just then it would be a fun game to play with friends every now and then. 2/5",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There needs to be enough of the necessities around for everyone to play or something must be done about all the hacking. I had to quit for today after my experience. Grabbing the meager loot I could find after dropping in 1p first person making my way to the warm embrace of the first ring I hadn't fired a shot and was careful to keep cover as I moved stealthily away from all the other shooting. As I approached a barn to quickly rifle through in search of a rifle of course I heard the familiar hum of a bus approaching. I knew I certainly hadn't given away my position to anyone well over the hill where I was hearing the noise. I cautiously proned out in the tall grass waiting for the vehicle to pass by none the wiser to my presence but no yet another hacking POS. This brazen SOB drove his bus in a beeline to my twenty parked it safely behind the hill jumped out walked over the ridge did a stupid short left right ""scan of the landscape"" like 25 degrees each direction then boom spins his happy a good 90 degrees plus to the right an blows my brains out before I can even see where hes coming over.TL/DR DO NOT BUY THIS GAME it is infested with hackers and the only thing that the developers have done in response is nerf the lootspawns to the point where legit players have even less hope of being competitive.

But the developers just slowly ruined the game taking away different features and aspects prioritizing things that didn't need attention and the game went from being awesome to being terrible now nobody plays it and it'd be impossible to find a game even if you wanted to.

Not entirely proud of how much time it's taken over my life but felt the need to write a review regardless...So first things first Battle royale of 100 players. Concept and some of the features that have been implemented since i started playing this game have been quite good. How they've been impleted however is a whole other kettle of fish. This game is so badly optimised and made it's an absolute joke they've got away with it and all the money that people have flooded into the game (I had paid around 27 when I bought the game). Bluehole opening areas for microtransactions in the form of a premium pass is bloody ridiculous instead of implementing bug fixes and optimizing the game for a consistent and solid framrate/frametimes. If this game wasn't PUBG and had any other name it'd of been boycotted and the playerbase would of just bailed on the microtransactions alone let alone the fact they have done absolutely nothing to fix this game. Now they have launched the #fixpubg campaign over the last while and are saying they are ""commited to fixing the game nomatter how long etc."" To me this feels like a direct response to the constantly dwindling player base on the game. Granted when they do release new content and usually new maps there is an upsurgence of players at that time and this is a good thing for the game and the publishers. I honestly just wish they would fix the game both with the tick rate of the servers that are used and the optimization of the game. This is not an engine problem but a problem with the way the game is actually constructed. I'm sure with all the billions that PUBG has made they'd be able to afford salaries for a developers to fix the game. I could sound like a hypocrite saying that I am down voting this game because I've played 700+ hours but I feel it is needed for any of the new players that are maybe considering picking this up circa 2018 holidays or steam sales.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-23,3,1,272,False,Recommended,So far this is the best Battle Royale game that I have ever played.PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is most likely going to make you frustrated. All the bloodthirsty virgins out there wants to see you dead. They want to prove that they are the alpha of the virtual map. This is not acceptable so I decided to be the alpha. I used all kinds of methods in order to become the alpha and then I figured it out I have to use psychological warfare. I started yelling into my microphone as I saw some random virgins nearby I ran closer and closer to them I could sense their fear and as they saw me they shot me down.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-12,0,0,646,False,Recommended,After all the bugs crashes and cheaters The game has been optimized to a pretty decent level and those cheaters are rarely encounterd recently not to mention there are a lot of contents including new maps coming up in the future. I'm still enjoying this game but I've noticed that it takes about 30+ seconds to find a match in Solo/TPP in NA server which makes me think that many people have left the game and there remains only skilled players. Due to the nature of Battle Royal game it has been getting harder to win a game.To spend the hard earned BP you can buy a crate or change the appearance of your character. However for 4 out 5 times you will get pay to open crates. I'd be fine if there's only a couple of premium crates that requires keys but let alone that you wouldn't get free to open crates most of the time the key itself is too expensive. I have 50+ crates that I can't open without keys in my inventory and if I buy all the keys to open them up it will cost me 125+ dollars.If you are tired of trolls in Overwatch League of Legends or any other games and care to try something new it is worth giving it a try but it will be much harder to enjoy it as a competitive player given the nature of the game. In spite of all these issues I still enjoy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-05,0,0,105,True,Recommended,Amazing game! only contested by games such as Fortnite but Fortnite is more casual and PUBG is for serious players. You need a fairly up to date system to run this game and alas my laptop has a hard time running at more than 20 frames but it is still fun nonetheless. I don't really have room to complain either because of receiving in game skins and crates that are sellable on the market the game paid for itself with just under 100 hours of play. 10/10 game.

2017-12-21,1,1,95,False,Not Recommended,Requires high level of skill and experience in order to do well and is very unforgiving for new players. It always feels like the biggest waste of time to finally get a game going and then have it end so suddenly and abruptly only to start the process over and over again! It's fun at first but becomes a boring chore and you never really get a sense of progression or improvement. Prepare to be dissappointed in this pile because it will deliver truly cheap frustration packed gameplay. The default third person mode encourages abuse of the camera angles which is weird. Why is aiming so difficult? You need to have heightened reflexes and extremely precise mouse/keyboard control to get by in this game. When you are under fire it's so tough to figure out where it's even coming from before you are dead. PUBG is heavily flawed and probably doesn't deserve the time that you'll put into it. Overall it is a negative experience that will surely you off in some way.

EX If I kill a teammate who teamkilled first I'm at fault and can get banned.X Reports from other reviews show that disc. users have been banned for bringing the former issue up on the chat.

2017-08-24,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,Liked the game very much initially . The moment to moment gameplay is fun gives unpredictable feeling at the start . I felt it to be more of survival game than a shooter . So after like 30 matches game got repetitive each match it was like roam around and get the good loot keep hiding then win / die when circle gets smaller . This pattern almost in every match so got bored predictable after that . I agree game is fun with friends but I feel it's fun and excitement wears out after sometime .Btw game is not fully optimized but it's still early access and they don't charge full price . For me it's fine to be playing in medium settings since I don care about graphics much in these kind of mp games . So I don't recommend it based on my experience .

2018-06-04,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,I'm owning PUBG since the beginning or better to say it was just about to hype. And I played it for a while and also had some fun. But at the end the game now can be summed it for me by saying Fun for some rounds quite random chances as the round is often decided by finding a good weapon at the start or how many enemies are dropping besides you. It surely also has a big part around how you play your tactic but the very base somehow remains on having luck or not. After the start after the first loot phase the game becomes quite boring very often as you only have to run through the map without much time to do further looting. So it's a bit of running hiding attacking waiting. Other games have some more things to do during this phase. As last point a very important one. You are confronted by cheaters very often. Some are invisible and able to aim through anything some have an aimbot ... And also by just viewing the replay you literally see how the other player is cheating. And it is very obvious. Other games have cheats as well but there seem to be more cheaters in PUBG than anywhere else. But this also might be driven by the possibility to just see it on the screen that obvious. Other cheats in other games might be more versatile as you have often no option to really see the other person cheating I would not buy it again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In 2017 there are still your typical rego and rng issues.Any skill to be had or found is usually trumped by the games terrible mechanics and laggy servers.The hacking community behind this game is the biggest I have seen since counter strike....Have a look over at ""unkowncheats.me"" for examples.FPS has improved dramatically...The game can be a lot of fun...mostly it is infuriating for serious gamers.A lot of the issues are within the core engine itself as stated numerous times by the development team.(This means they cant do anything about it.... other than change the engine its running on.... remember dayZ????)This is still the best way to experience battle royale but is going nowhere with nothing new to be seen.My prediction In 2 years time they will still be releasing items and the game will be much the same with much of the same issues.I did not pre order but I purchased this game the minute it was released.... I have had over 40 of my friends purchase the game. I want to create content.... I want to support it... I wish I could support it...

The game has not done well in my opinion since I purchased it in early access. There are cheaters everywhere and it feels almost like the game gets more issues after each patch and thats not an exaggeration. I hoped the full 1.0 version of the game would take care of players woes but that does NOT seem to have happened.The game is still fun if you dont take it to seriously or if you dont mind frustration from bugs glitches and hackers running rampant. I hope sometime in the near future the developers figure things out. Original recommendation follows below.

They wont do any sort of ping lock so the people with total ss lag can see you before you see them and since its client side they kill you.

Then at some point someone you can't see will shoot you while you are running and when you check the kill cam you will see what they were aiming behind you while you were sprinting accross their field of vision instead of leading you or at least aiming at you. If you are lucky enough to start of near the ""safe zone"" (which is in a different location every game) then you might get to have some fun but you'll still probably die from someone you never see or if you do see someone you'll shoot them a bunch but somehow they will kill you with just a few shots.This is based on 3+ hours of play both in groups and solo.

Servers are laggy as f period like you can tell someone is close to you since when I'm alone there are almost no lag but once some ppl are in your zone the fps drops like mad. Solo FPP lag is even worse than Solo. Hackers... and random death from vehicles. 3rd person view in Solo is pretty cheesy when you can camp like behind a wall or on a rooftop where enemy cant see you then shoot em in the back etc. Shot regs are slow as f and the feel of the game when your in a zone with lotsa action is sadly not the same as you get from other games like Battlefield where its silky smooth. The game audio is one of the worst I've seen in 20years for a shooter game period yes this feels on par with Quake 1 audio or even worse.Sadly I cant recommend this game allthough it is kinda fun but way too many problems atm.Anyone remmember CS 1.6? pubg is something like that it feels polished when you play it but there are some small bugs here and there plus alot of hackers.5th Dec update the lag and bullet reg in this game is... is never going to be improved it seems.10th Dec update new desert map still have same audio issues as previous map plus weapon jam is still a thing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The idea of this game is fun but the lack of performance the consistent bugs and frustrations of the game will make you question why you even play it. im 130 hours in so obviously i like the game or want to but to be frank until they can optimize the game i literally cannot stand to play it any more. Wether its taking fall damage for no reason from a parachute or the stupid ""damage"" glitch that makes it sound like you were shot and took damage but you didnt it literally makes me cringe now. The number of times it takes to officially kill someone after youve downed them is outradgeous. Driving any vehicle will prove to be difficult and the terrain will for sure make your car flip at some point in the match regardless of how small the bump is. Sound sucks because when bullets are shot you cant tell where they come from. hit markers dont exist and by that i mean when you get shot it doesnt give you a directional marker or arrow on screen. just a blood splatter that if youre lucky you can see what direction it came from. people under water cannot take damage period so when that safe zone ends up at a bridge all you need to do is get under water under the bridge and wait. make sure when your aiming at someone behind a rock/building that youre far enough away because although your scope is dead on target when you fire youll probably shoot to rock or edge of the building. the icing on the cake and the real reason i decided to leave a review is that after 130 hours of gameplay and earning the multiple skins via crates earned from in game currency i log on to see my character naked all points spent with a balance remaining of 0 credits and my crates reset mid weed. After mutiple relogs and even a full restart of the pc i log back on to the same thing. So my character has no clothes has no capacity to carry anything and i have no credits remaining to purchase a new crate. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I like a challenge but its hard to keep playing this I have admiration for the guys who are pro at this game. I enjoy the jumping out of the plane bit at least I don't get shot for a few minutes. I tried to play today 16.08.18 but now I can only hear audio and the screen shot will not go away games freezes so I cant see anything then it crashes.

They'll get banned from the game by the greedy devs. Or how about when you hear someone honk their horn one too many times? They're probably stream sniping and they are distracting me from my playing I guess I'll have to report them. Even in the damn leaderboards the top 10 players are all streamers.Another issue with this game (as I mentioned in the first sentence) is that the game lags like HELL.

2017-08-22,0,0,394,True,Recommended,I haven't put many hours into this game as I would have liked to by now due to having a newborn but i really do enjoy playing and highly recommend to anyone. Even though I do not have a super high tech system that most claim you need to have to play I still really enjoy the game. I realize with a better system the better i can have the settings and sharper game play but it is still very enjoyable.EDIT After putting in over 100hrs of play time there are a few things that are bothering me with this game. My first thing to address is the amount of AFK players still even after the update and the devs claiming they will monitor it better. If they truly wish to monitor the problem then add a button where you can submit a player that is AFKing. I jump into duo games and I constantly have AFK players for teammates. If I wished to play solo I would play solo matches. Next issue I have is the fact that I am paired with people who can not speak my language. I do not mind them playing on the NA server but they should implement a system in the matchmaking that takes into consideration the Primary LANGUAGE you speak. I hate being paired with a player and neither one can understand the other. It makes playing as a team very difficult. I do still enjoy this game and will continue to play but I do hope these issues can be solved. Also after the update when aiming through a scope I have a black square that will sometimes appear and glitch in and out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There has been technical issues with this game but over time they have improved almost all of the naggin issues. And seem to be 100% committed to ironing out any remaining ones. The cheating seems to only happen on TPP servers which I never use so i've not been affected. New maps new guns and new vehicles come online for free with a decent frequency.

2017-08-21,0,0,321,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. The hit registration in this game is bad. You can shoot people in the head and see blood and they will not die. I also find it confusing how the game will sometimes teleport me out of cover. The player controller is bad because your character turns widely so you cannot serpentine as an evasive manoeveur. There is a leaderboard but there is no ranking system so when a new person loads up a match they are potentially playing with people who have over 1000 hours experience and have been playing since closed beta. Maybe 50 hours isn't long enough to form a valid opinion maybe I'm a scrub but I fail to see the mass appeal to this game especially when it is basically another Dayz clone albeit Battle Royale. Overall I would not recommend this game at least until it gets further along in development.Edit This game is getting better but many aspects are still dog Literally you can be parachuting and get caught on NOTHING. So you're floating there and after a while you get the option to press F and cut away from your parachute but then by that point everyone has guns. So you land finally and then die to geared people.

I have a $1200 PC and this game decides that for the first 2 minutes of the game 7 fps is a great idea. $168 000 000 made and instead of actually developing and fixing your early access game which barely runs to begin with you decide adding in some crates for even more money is the plan.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-20,0,0,477,True,Not Recommended,"PUBG is a pretty great game and it's very addicting for those new to this kind of genre of games a fight to the death where it's just you and everyone else.However I can honestly say that there isn't really anything special about the game. It does incorporate very accurate sounds such as bullets hitting a surface and then the sound of the shot ringing out while using a supressor. Very small but very nice feature. Lots of games that are trying to be realistic should do this and I'm sure this game will set an example for the rest.Sadly that's all I can really say that's good about the game currently. There are way more cons that outweight the pros by far. For instance I know it's early access but the optimization is complete garbage. Like absolutely garbage. I know people that are running expensive setups that have to run the game on the lowest settings and still get dips in performance. I myself have multiple issues such as this. For instance the longer the game runs the laggier it gets. It definitely puts a strain on my new 1060 on all low settings and causes it to heat up to ridiculous temperatures.There's plenty of bugs that there's many a forum posts on but still have yet to be fixed. For instance I suffer from building textures not loading and the only way that I can currently and some what consistently get them to load is by parachuting down and getting close to the buildings then hit tab to open up my inventory. This causes the game to render the buildings for some reason which in turn freezes my PC for a good solid 30 seconds 1 minute. In that time you can guarantee you'll die unless you landed in a very isolated spot on the map. This is by far the most infuriating bug I'm experiencing and it happens on about 98% of my games. Sometimes opening up the inventory to force buildings to render will crash my game.Speaking of crashes this game crashes as often as an Asian crashes on the road...Which makes sense because a bunch of Koreans are working on this game. The amount of crashing that happens is just extraordinary. It doesn't even make me upset I'm amused at how often this game crashes. Then when the crash reporter pops up it can't even connect to the server to send the crash info so the chances of it getting fixed are slim in the first place.Meanwhile as for the guns I was really excited to start using the guns in this game until I realized they're literally all inconsistent as Hell and or just flat out broken. For example if you can get your hands on the AWM from the care package? You're basically set. It annihilates players with Tier 3 equipment. If you're a competent person there is no way you should ever die while holding the AWM. The thing is a powerhouse and will land you to winning the game if you play smart.There's also gotta be a minimum reference to all the people that are cheating already using reshade or configuring their files so that you look hot pink or green or red so you stand out like a sorethumb and you get shot from somewhere you can't even see them shooting you from because they removed all the geography on the map. Until the game makes stuff like this server side people will start figuring out that you can just mod all the buildings and grass and all that trash away so you can see other players clear as day. Not to mention actual cheats are already being made and I've definitely encountered my fair share already in solo play.And here's a TL DR PRO/CON List PROS Accurate sound effects. True to life gun counterparts. Will probably have decent graphics due to Unreal Engine 4. Map is pretty nice and laid out well lots of cool design choices. Healing mechanics are decent. Character customization is pretty cool. Lol Po i master race.CONS Absolute horrible optimization currently. All guns but sniper rifles are ridiculously inconsistent. Pistols have no use in this game at all. Melee literally doesn't work. Full auto is unusable because of said inconsistency as well as it being horrible in general. Game blatantly promotes camping and slow grueling and tactless play. Railings and small tiny poles and such like that will completely block your shots. Cannot quickly vault or jump/climb over tiny walls leading to clunky jumping that won't work. Game crashes way too often. Many glitches that keep the game from being even somewhat playable. Cheaters can modify textures to make you stand out or completely remove geometry. Client side connections offer massive advantages and poor connections to most people. Game can be too RNG based sometimes especially if considered a ""competitive"" game. Character movement is painfully awkward and clunky especially jumping. 3rd person shoulder peeking in this game should be removed in my opinion it's broken/cheap. Everyone in the lobbies is generally a racist moron that just screams the n word over and over. Team killing has no penalty and you cannot report it (unless you recorded the clip it happening). A ton more that I'm too lazy to write down.I want to enjoy this game but I feel like it puts too much of a painful handicap on those that can really excel due to it's bugs/glitches and general layout. I definitely feel like I could be way better at this game if it ran smoothly and actually let me play more than it forces me to watch loading screens only for the game to crash.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-31,0,0,33,True,Recommended,Decided to give the game a try after weighing peoples complaints and praises. After a few games solo and squad I find the game addictive and exciting. It is definetly a game that is made better if you have a group of friends to play with. Some of the complaints are valid such as the crashing and the lagging at the start of the round. As far as hackers I haven't ran into any but that doesn't mean they are not there. It does suck that you have to lower foilage level to low unless you want to gimp yourself. All in all a very solid and fun for an early access game. Lets all hope the full game will be even better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-01,0,0,350,True,Recommended,While I understand many of these negative reviews I'm not going to say it's a flat out horrible game because it isn't. Allow me to elaborate. Personally I had a lot of fun with the game and am finding it surprisingly addictive. It's not even that huge on content to be honest. But it's balanced well enough and the guns feel good enough for it to constantly suck you right back in. The new map coming out sounds exciting and I'm looking forwards to it immensely. I will be actively supporting development of this game and will probably still be supporting it/playing it a few years down the line. I've already got my moneys worth from the game.HOWEVER.I should mention that the optimization for this game is still god awful. Yes they are fixing it albeit slower than I'd hope. I'm running on an i7 7700 gtx 1070 so that might have largely changed my opinion. If you have a newer high end PC as long as you enjoy shooters I'd recommend buying it right here right now. But if you're using an aging PC I'd say anything below GTX 660 about don't waste your money on this game. You can't run it and you probably won't be able to so get it on Xbox or save up for a new PC if you want.I'd give this game a score like I usually do in my reviews but this isn't the sort of game that needs a set in stone rating. So I'm just gonna say I had fun with it if you have a good PC you'll probably have a blast with it and get your moneys worth if it's not powerful or at least semi modern stay away from it.P.S. I'd STRONGLY advise playing with friends if you get this the more the merrier. Sorry for the long winded review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It had the usual server lag but you can get used to it. Atleast it didn't freeze in fights like it is after the ""optimization update""(The most recent update till 7th June). The last update was supposed to be actually an improvement over the overall performance so we can get better frame rate and less server lag faster item spawns etc. All good stuff and it sounded really promising. Unfortunately I played for few days now with the ""optimizations"" and I get both server lag and really annoying freezes like never before in fights which ends bad for me and my experience.

2019-01-07,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,"I wish I'd listened to all the negative reviews. I ignored them because just like DayZ they come from players with hundreds of hours of playtime and I love DayZ so I assumed it was just people with an axe to grind about changes to the game. No after 3 hours I had so many crashes to desktop that I tried to return it. Steam rejected my refund application so I put in a few more hours since I couldn't get my money back and had the same issues. On the plus I have an older machine but the frame rate is decent so that's a positive. The maps are very nicely designed and I really enjoy the look and feel of the environments. However the lag is terrible and the game design only magnifies its problems. In DayZ you could do serious damage to someone with only one hit. This was frustrating if you got hit but it often meant the more tactical player usually won. However so many times I've had the tactical edge over another player unloading an entire clip into them and they still don't die. Yet they turn around and one shot and I'm dead. Looking at the Deathcam often raises more questions than answers because on multiple occassoins their ""kill shot"" hit thin air. Lag bugs who knows. Also I've been shot so many times while driving vehicles and not died it begs the question why? I feel bad for the players who really should have killed me. If you got shot at while driving a car in DayZ either you or the car were done for. It's so cartoonish that sometimes I just drive around as there's less chance of dying in a random encounter. It's bloody frustrating and there's not much else to do in the game so over all it's a pretty bad execution of a nice idea.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-25,0,0,954,False,Not Recommended,"OK. It's finally time for me to review this game. The game was fun. The game was a LOT of fun. The ""Fix Pubg"" campaign is merely public relations and nothing more. This game has consistently gotten worse since it was released. It's almost impossible to do that but somehow this crew of developers has managed to pull off this feat seemingly without even trying..or maybe that is the problem? They aren't even trying. Cheating is RAMPANT. Worse that CounterStrike before Valve Anticheat. It's seriously F cking ridiculous. I'm a little bummed knowing that there's not really anything else I would get into as much but I simply can't stand to play this game anymore.As an example on my very last game. I was on Sanhok I was right on the edge of the safe zone when I hear a motorcycle come zooming towards me from towards the middle of the circle (phase 1) uphill and with no line of sight on me. He (or she) stop their motorcycle probably 50 yds away and start making a beeline for my direction (I was behind a rock on the opposite side of a hill. While running toward me they stop for a brief second and kill me with one shot while running.I would love to be able to share some of the deathcams I've watched but it's also like ""whats the point""? Just want to say that I'm sincerely off. Why bother coming up with a whole ""fixpubg"" campaign if you really aren't going to fix the issues?Whats the point of adding new weapons with so much rampant cheating? Pubg is little more than a digital fashion show (people buying all kinds of worthless gear) combined with a cheaters paradise equalling one sad lonely corner of the internet for losers to check out each others skins and hack.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-10-03,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,Not even sure where to really start with this one. Some things that stood out to me were the lack of real updates. I started playing while it was in game preview and now that it's out it feels and looks the same. Aiming seems non existant damge registry has been out of whack for as long as I've played and other members on my squad seem to be the main reason I die. I gave up on squads for that and a number of other reason and found myself running into even more problems after that. I shot another player point blank in the head several times and I'm guessing the ballcaps are bulletproof because it did nothing. Shot in the foot with a shotgun though? Dead. Also what's with the loot crates? I spent my BP to buy four loot crates and two of them had the same pair of loafers in the them. Nobody survives a battle royal wearing loafers. I also recieved one after being offline for a while and had to pay $2 to open it. It was a blue t shirt. I tried defending this game saying it was better than Fortnite but now I'm sticking with Fortnite because this game is only seeming to get worse as time goes by. 4/10 unless you love run to die simulators.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It was in Early Acess so we could forgive the faults of the Unreal Engine until then. PUBG was going places and everyone knew it. The game was going to come out early next year with the promise of a new bigger map. The devs kept pushing the bug fixing more and more on the backburner and the players became increasingly worried about the state of the game. When cars still experienced round ending glitches and players would crash at seemingly random points during the game it seemed like PUBG was going in the wrong direction for its playerbase.I still kept going at it in the hope that the bugs would magically fade into the background of my play experience. They did not. This was just not a finished game let alone an esports game. This game is a great concept made for a wide audience that could have been the next CS GO but the devs have done absolutely nothing to fix their game. Almost nine months after this game was announced as being finished it is still a broken mess. There just isn't anything fun about the clunky mechanics of this game.The devs even had the nerve to add an 'Event Pass' on top of a thirty dollar game just to rake in that last dollar. That move was it for me and I stopped playing entirely. Everything from the Chinese filled NA servers to the broken mechanics of driving have had little to no progress made in trying to fix them. 'Fix PUBG' is too late and the devs know it. Don't waste your money on this and play another battle royale with competent devs and more polish.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's a game of strategy more than just a shooter. Every move matters and the run n' gunners have just as much of a chance at getting a chicken dinner as the sneaky opportunists like me. People move with coordination more often than you'll ever see in most gun games. That's not to say you won't see plenty running around like this is Call of Duty. It's slower paced than most others out there but it gives you time to think and plan and wonder what others are planning too.

Second Cheaters. There's also some reports of people being silenced for reporting cheaters in the official game forums...I'm not aware of those who're being silenced by reporting the cheaters because I haven't researched it for myself and I'm too busy in life to research this. BUT I can confirm that cheaters do exists and they're aloof. Not plenty but still its the calm before the storm.Then again I imagine that at Early Access the developers are deliberatly allowing cheaters aloof to understand how they're hacking the game which isn't bad but if you want to buy it in Early Access go ahead but note that this problem does exist.Third Bad bad bad servers again remember this is early access so they're stress testing the servers for the time being.These are the main things that are forcing me to give this a thumbs down.

2017-08-24,0,0,249,True,Recommended,Alright for all of you that give this game a bad review. Shut up. I've looked through these reviews for a little bit now and they are all about the same thing. Stream sniping and streamer harrassment. Yes it is possible to do these things and yes you should be banned from CHEATING. Streamers make games become popular a majority of the time. If you don't want to get banned don't intentionally stream snipe or harrass the streamers. Secondly this game is amazing. It's in alpha so I know that there will be problems and issues but the devs are working hard to fix these issues and make this game complete. Even with random bugs and whatnot this game still managed to sell 8 MILLION copies. That alone tells you that this game is fantastic. The satifaction from kills feels so good and winning feels even better. I personally even if I don't win the round feel accomplished if I take out several people a game. Thirdly micro transactions are just a thing of games. Sure the devs said there wouldn't be any. Fair point there. BUT you don't have to buy anything other then the game to play. Also it's not like you need to spend money on the crates in order to do better or win more. It's only cosmetic rewards which have no influence on the game itself. I personally think that making microtransactions on a game this popular is a great move for the company Blue Hole. Of course they are going to want to make more money on a game. Can you really blame them?!Alright I've ranted a little bit about why people are giving this bad reviews and I hope you look at my review and understand that it is all avoidable. If you don't want to get banned don't stream snipe or be an to streamers (a stable in the coommunity). If you don't like micro transactions don't buy them. If you want to have fun play this game with a few friends and enjoy what Player Unknown has created and have a great time!See you all in the Battlegrounds!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-08,0,0,1386,False,Not Recommended,Like any game you play that's based on an over all fun and creative concept you will enjoy this game. You'll enjoy it for hundreds of hours. But this game will eventually like all long term and expected upon things disappoint you. You will find that the developer conspicuously and frequently undercuts your enjoyment. The Oceania server is broken you cannot play solo FPP on it i.e the competative mode there is no progression/ranking system (thank goodness it wouldnt be accurate with pubg server performance even if there were) and the game is riddled with minor performance bugs that constantly seek to tear you from any immersive experience you're having. This game is worth it's title price. It is worth $60 as far as entertainment is concerned. But dont expect any sense of fulfillment or unadulterated distraction from life as you engage with this game. It is simply too poorly optimized &amp cared for.

2017-06-29,0,0,29,True,Recommended,( ) Why Play?Link to my Video review for those who don't like to read https //youtu.be/UL8Lmof4w14 And now for the review So what is the game? Battlegrounds is an action game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royal a type of large scale deathmatch where players fight to be the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo or with a small team of two or four people. In either case the last person or team left alive wins the match.Each match starts with players parachuting onto an island approximately 8 by 8 kilometres (5.0 mi 5.0 mi) in size from a plane without any items outside of customizable clothing options that they select prior to a match. Once they land players can search buildings and other sites to find weapons vehicles armor clothing and other equipment. These items are distributed throughout the map at the start of a match with certain high risk zones having better equipment. Players then proceed to either stay hidden to avoid being killed or hunt down other players whilst continuing to search for more equipment. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well. At random a plane will fly over various parts of the playable map and drop a loot package containing items which are normally unobtainable during normal gameplay. The package also emits a highly visible red smoke drawing interested players near it. Players can opt to play either from the first person or third person perspective each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness.GAME IMPRESSION First 2 hours Little rocky but very fun.After 24 hours only played 4hrs as not my type of game but the replay is there. 1/ How do I feel overall about the money iv spent?I picked it up for 20 of a cheap site not of steam I don t think the 26 is worth it. But having said that the game is still fun the play.2/ How much time will you spend playing the game? You can unlock items and play up to four friends in a team so I would say there can be many hours put into mastering the game and having fun with friends.3/ Do you think you will have fun?The overall game is fun the way you don't know who is dropping out of the plane and landing with you add s to the thrill of the game.The Pro sBeautiful mapDetailed weaponsGood amount of lootVheicalsCustom player modelsThe Con sCannot change the player namewhen you die that it you can not watch who wins The QUALITY SCORE Check List.Graphic MenuxContentsxArts &amp Design Level Design Combat Music &amp Sound Animation Online Value Replay ValuexBug freexOverall 6 out of 10WORTH BUYING ( _ ) Yes normal price worth it!( ) Wait for sales( _ ) No the developer has no plan to improve( _ ) No not worth the time on itMy System Spec Windows 10 Gigabyte Technology Co.

I am not a big fan of the altitude of the developer team as well. When you sold a game for 30$ and make a fortune out of it isn't now the time to try to improve this game?

2018-03-25,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,1) Some of the weapon accuracies feel ridiculous a SCAR is not going to shoot perfectly straight at the reticle from like 500+ yards away especially if you're not prone.2) The game crashes like 25% of the time randomly3) Even though people shell $30 they still can't afford decent servers. 4)* UPDATE The performance got even WORSE. I'm running a gtx 1070 for f*ck's sake. Months ago I was playing this without random frame drops. Now it's like every 15 seconds.5) The controls are a bit clunky. Surely you can increase the pace of the game a Tiny bit in movement acceleration.All the negative reviews aren't for naught and it's no wonder people are moving to Fortnite over this game. Sure it has its own issue like very questionable bullet drops and overpowered weapons. But I'll take a game with worse graphics but MUCH better coding over any visual enhancement waste of money these guys decide to waste my hard drive space updating.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They've hired more devs to work on it but let's be real throwing money at devs doesn't automatically integrate them into your team instanteneously... it will take time for them to learn and grow and contribute to the product.

This game is nothing but a money making hype train and I've had more joy in playing a battleground/hunger games mod by 1000%. But by all means enjoy paying for an undeveloped game then paying for any undeveloped map crates or cosmetics. Because you aren't paying for this game to become better you're paying for more crates cosmetics and maps that you could probably make yourself in Unreal Engine in no time as far as i can see this game over the years has been nothing but side dated not updated since the first released build. When i buy an early access game i do it to support the development of the game and with the sheer number of purchases its a pretty poor effort to halt actual development of the fundamental parts of the game which tbh is a gimmick in its self just like the DayZ Standalone origin being a mod aswell although it looks like atleast they're going the way of the NMS devs and fixing their screw up. End of the day if you enjoy it dope but ill never dish money out for this again.

2018-03-26,0,0,387,False,Not Recommended,I love this game don't get me wrong from what I'm about to say.This game is full of bugs and glitches which impact performance for many players even those with higher end gaming rigs. This is a good game but I wish that instead of pushing the development of cosmetics and events they would spend more time trying to fix the problems that many people tend to complain about. I have over 200 hours in this game and it's only improved in stability a little bit over that time and several of my friends crash going into nearly every game despite being able to run other similar games at high resolutions.Not only that but today I was tuned in to a streamer for his customs night and the custom servers couldn't be dedicated. The streamer was unaware that they were going to take down custom matches in any way tonight and it's also the one night a week he does custom matches with his viewers. You would think that Bluehole cares more about the content creators that play their game and practically advertise it to a wide audience. Additionally this game is so full of hackers that sometimes it feels like Bluehole doesn't ban anyone despite their claims that they've banned 'over a million hackers'. I'm going to say that I wouldn't recommend you buy the game until they fix the problems of hackers and glitchiness and Bluehole actually starts to take an interest in what the community says rather than making more cash grabs. We didn't want locked crates and we didn't need gun skins. We'd rather have hackers banned and instability patched. 404,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-09,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,I mean the game itself is pretty good but horrible optimization. I mean i got this game (it is one of the most costy games i have bought) hoping that it would run at least a bit (for my friend it runs really good even though he has just a bit better pc than i do) but even with everything on low even putting down resolution it still runs at a crap 14 FPS. I like the game on mobile that is i have an ipad air which is pretty old and it runs just well so cant this optimisation be put on PC? i mean like i understand that there are people with good pcs and all but when it can run smoothly with bad graphics on mobile why not PC? It is just unplayable also having everything on low will make the resolution so bad that you wont even see people in the distance only as some pixels. So yea this is really a bit unfair of a review but they should give at least a low specs mode. This is also what i hate about unreal engine it really requires a beefy PC to run most games. I did everything to make it run as fast as possible but it just doesnt want to. If they would optimise it i would recommend them to look at the resolution because playing at a low 3D resolution makes up for a crap experience. Sometimes it runs good for like 25 FPS for like 5 minutes but then when i go to combat it just breaks and lags out for 4 seconds and the other guy kills me. I cant even get a refund because i have the game sitting for like 2 months in the library and played it for roughly 5 hours trying it to get to work.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-20,0,0,221,False,Recommended,Product received for free. 100 players drop onto a sprawling map and fight to the death using whatever weapons they can find within a shrinking force field. This simple bare bones take on the Battle Royale style deathmatch foregoes the fluff and high time investment of most hardcore survival sims in favor of fast accessible action. The result is a tight focused no frills experience that s as exciting as it is unpredictable and where no two games are ever alike.PUBG wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as you and up to 99 other players airdrop onto one of its two 8x8 km maps from the back of a large aircraft. Part of the genius of each match s arc is how heavily it weighs every move you make and it begins with the critical decision of where to land. Jumping early along the plane s randomized flight path lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition but risks placing you farther from the parts of the arena where the fighting will likely funnel as the boundaries contract. Jumping late might distance you from other players giving you some early breathing room and a chance to forage for loot in peace before entering the fray. Depending on the angle of the flight path jumping right into the center especially in large cities and other loot heavy spots could place you right in the middle of the action with some of the most trigger happy opponents.Game 11/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,661,True,Recommended,Having played H1Z1 and the Arma 2/3 BR mods I can safely say that this is the best game in its market currently. Even in early access. The graphics look nice and the optimization isn't too bad with a few tweaks. The game seems to have good dev support currently way out beating the developer response time with about five hours.Currently I would say I've played a good bit and I've only experienced a couple of bugs one of which has been acknowledged already by the devs and is being worked on.I whole heartedly recommend 9/10.EDIT For those people consistently jumping on a bandwagon and rating the game negatively because a small percentage of people were banned for going after streamers. (why i don't know) Why don't you think for yourself instead of sitting on reddit all day.

2019-01-23,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,"One of the trashest games ever my hours are only this high because of friends pressuring me to play. Every single hour I spent here I wished I could play something else because almost every single aspect of this game is super sucky.Map design not super super sucky but not memorable or nice to look at.Graphics below average especially for a 2017 game.Optimization literally what the heck? Actual trash here. GTX 1050ti 16GB RAM and I can barely maintain 60 FPS at literally lowest settings? Wouldn't be so bad if the lack of anti aliasing didn't make enemies invisible past 20 meters.Gunplay I get they're trying to make it realistic but they should've gone the Battlefield route instead of making every gun sound similar and every single shot sound plinky and pointless. Damaging enemies feels like a futile endeavour as you pour 20 Uzi bullets into someone only to see them walk away and having your semi auto marksman rifle with a foregrip and compensator shoot into orbit whenever you pull the trigger just makes the experience sucky.Audio It's never clear where shots or footsteps are coming from I'm using the Logitech G430 and it's nearly indiscernable whether sounds are coming from the front of the back.Monetization this 2 year old game with a dying population (takes around 40 minutes to get a match in Oceania depending on whether you're playing solo duo or squads) costs $42.95 (at time of writing) and has not only lootboxes but also a Fortnite style Battlepass system that's three layers of money grabbing right there. It makes the ""free DLC"" feel like content that should've been there from the start. Like come on only one map at launch and it took about a year for a second map? Not to mention the optimization issues haven't been fixed.Bugs literally just google ""PUBG bugs"" or ""PUBG bug compilation"" and that will speak for itself. It's pretty obvious this game is unfinished even after leaving Early Access bugs like unrendered buildings becoming intangible and getting you stuck cars flying into the Mesosphere after hitting... nothing... and invisible players just show that this game was rushed to unrelease and then actual release.Loot finding guns in schools not a single clinic on the map with increased medical supplies (for example) or really any spot that stands out as a source for finding specific loot. Everything is pretty much generic. Airdrops are a thing but don't feel very satisfactory since all loot you find in game is temporary and disapears when you die or at the end of the match.Progression what is the point of playing? The only thing you get from playing are these coin things which you can use to buyyyy... loot crates! Yay! No... very sucky. There's literally no reason to play unless you want some very generic clothes or some sucky camos for guns. You play each map a few times and you've experienced the whole game and there's no objective reason to keep playing.??? I don't know if there's any reason to buy the game after looking at those reasons... I mean even the ""Progression"" point would be enough to turn me away and it would've if I'd known before buying the game since progression is a big thing for me when it comes to games (as you'd see when looking at my profile).So all in all I'd rate this game a trash/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-01,0,0,95,False,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's battlegrounds is an amazing game with tons of pros and cons that can make the game extremly fun or just a waste of time. Here are some of the more major pros and cons for the game*Edits made since they released the game offically*Pros The game is a much more realistic and a stressfull battle royal game compared to H1Z1 or Fortnite. The game is much more about decision making than aim. It is good for building team working skills with random people. There are a large variety of guns and attachments which helps the gameplay stay fresh. Each match is completly different. It can be fun even if you don't win Combat is pretty balanced. It's pretty rare that most houses won't have one gun. You get to choose when you drop unlike H1Z1 so it's not as RNG.Cons Servers are not region locked so you get grouped with people who don't speak English a ton on NA servers. The map is a little too big and can be a running simmulator Has minor bugs but less than other popular battle royals It gets annoying when you die to someone who was camping across the map with a Kar98k or get 1 tapped in the face with a shootgun unexpectedly. Lots of random teamates may not have voice or will listen and random grouped play can be a pain.The pros heavily outweigh the cons in my opinion and the gunplay/realism is what sells me to this game. I think this game is amazing and I love how the devs are listening to players more and making it a far better game. When this came out in Early Access it had many issues that were not touched upon and I felt like It would fall into Beta hell just like H1. But it seems that it's doing amazing and pulling ahead. Some of the new content on the beta now looks exciting and the quarterly content seems to keep people playing. If I had to rate this game I would say around 8 Scars/ 10 M4s,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-26,0,0,568,False,Not Recommended,Please note the below is my opinion and it's probably super biased and wrong. The sad shell of what could have been an amazing game. I played many hours in the beginning and had a blast with the crazy buggy nonsense. Over time it became more apparant that the company (even though they've made over a billion dollars on this) just wants to squeeze every penny out of its (mostly Chinese) playerbase. So in lieu of bugfixing patches hotfixes anti cheat updates and general content improvements we are stuck with loot boxes half tournaments and a cringe worthy PR team. The developers had a chance to make a gem of a game and instead followed the cycle of games like H1Z1 and DAYZ into the development quagmire that is the current share holder appeasing state of the gaming industry. This is what you get when you let a graphic designer/part time modder be the creative director of a massive game studio. Sorry fanboys.I am all for international gaming and playing against people from all over the world just not on these servers. Anyone who has played this game for longer than a few weeks has seen the rampant overtake of the Chinese LAN cafe accounts and their questionable connections to the NA servers. Past that the apathetic approach to comprehensive anti cheat solutions has hindered their playerbase growth in everywhere but Asia steam stats are a good metric to see this. I am pretty sure there are bots running ads in Mandarin over the VOIP system as well iinteresting.SAD. I really love this game and I try to look past all the issues and play with my friends but it's really hard to enjoy it in its current state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Probably worth the money I spend on this game even I am poor.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-04,0,0,218,True,Recommended,"The game is great and has alot of good things going for it. It clearly draws inspiration from DayZ and H1Z1 and that's perfectly fine because they pull off the ideas behind the games with few bugs or glitches that are gamebreaking (Looking at you H1Z1 flashbang). But it really isn't flawless in any sense of the word.For starters lag is a huge issue in the game. The difference between client side and server side can at some points be absolutely massive and make the difference between getting a kill and dying in what should have been an easy skirmish. Second the load times for the game aren't stellar. Yes it's a huge map and yes there's alot of detail. But you'd think that after sitting in a lobby for a minute sometimes longer and then in a plane for at least another 20 seconds that there wouldn't be the issue of ""Ghost structures"" and unrendered textures. I'd be perfectly happy with potato textures and somewhat decent sounds for the first minute or so after I hit the ground if it meant I'd be able to see all the buildings from the start.Third Going back to the lag issue client to server communication is certainly an issue. One prime example of this is when I was trying to kill someone who was bathroom camping with an AKM while I had the semi auto shotgun. Despite unloading five rounds into the center of their chest and having time to be halfway reloaded only one of the shells actually registered as a hit resulting in my death.So yeah of course the game is ing fun. I never tilt off of a death which is something incredibly common for me to do in most games and the fact that the only thing holding you back from winning the game is skill (And unlucky frying pan bullet blocks) it's a stellar game especially for one in Early Access. Don't view this as a list of things I hate it's just a list of blemishes on an otherwise amazing game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the TPS/Survival/Battle royale genre.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-09,0,0,478,False,Not Recommended,Lets see... When this game came out I was really happy that it did the Arma 3 Mod PUBG was just awesome. But this game is just horrible. I think I can say that i know a thing or two about FPS. This game combines everything that sucks. In my opinion does the Hitbox suck worse than in Rainbow Six the Netcode is awful the overall movement of the people is unbelievably unrealistic like some rubber dolls having a stroke. I played this game a lot cause secretly this genre always fascinated me you wont believe me how much DayZ Mod I played. But this game is just bad. They make it worse and worse with every update. And dont even get me started with the server reliability just check out literally every review under this game.... I am just ing curious how can a Team with such ing much money not get done? I mean they literally earned MILLIONS and there is only 2 maps now (Give me 10 Mins in Stronghold World Creator and I make better than that) and weapon variety?

2017-08-23,0,0,663,False,Not Recommended,It is completely clear to me now these rogues are trying to squeeze all the juice out of your wallet without actually improving the game by riding it of the cheaters and improving fps and desync issues and for that matter getting better servers. BUT its more valuable to them to create lawsuits vs other game developers. With the recent announcement of a PAID pass this just rams the point home even further. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE. It is virtually as bad if not worse than cs go.I get it though if they ban people within the first couple of weeks of hacking they will get a bit sick of it and stop creating accounts and in turn making profits for the company so I can see why from a business perspective that they wont create a great anti cheat and that is because hackers create revenue.

2017-04-02,0,0,463,True,Not Recommended,EDIT Changed to not recommend after Dev broke no micro transactions during early access process promise and has shown himself to be as he is.It's good but not without problems.This is indeed inbetween h1z1 and arma but much more towards arma. I really would like to see a hardcore mode added with more realistic ballistic damage and first person only. I really think the third person option on these games is completely lame it devolves into camp and magically see around corners and with the lean function and nice weapon models this game has I think a first person only mode is definitely needed.Aside from that (and the bullet damage being too low) the biggest issue is the foliage performance and general graphics settings. People who have their foliage turned to very low have a ridicuolous advantage. Fields you are totally hidden in while playing the game on high will have you plain as day visible to someone running the game on lower settings. And it isn't just the foliage but the post processing and other options as well. You can essentially remove shadows and the like and have a far easier time seeing opponents than someone running the game on higher settings with a decent PC.I hope many of these options get locked in the near future when the games general performance is improved so more people can play at a higher stable framerate at higher settings.The next issue is server related. When you first drop the servers are excessively laggy and they can be throughout the game.I have no doubt most of the performance issues will likely be fixed but I really hope to see a hardcore mode as described and also having the graphics settings locked to be more restrictive.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-24,0,0,17,True,Not Recommended,"After attempting(and still attempting) to give this game a fair shake... I regret the purchase.Issue 1) The sound is AWFUL. the footsteps come from random directions or the whole damn building. The shots sound like theyre beside you when they're really pretty far away. Passing vehicles might as well be on all sides. They need to improve this because the hits and sounds don't logically help to discover where your target is. i have had someone fire a rifle at me from what sounded like point blank 9 or 10 times in pretty open terrain... i never did find them. it does see slight improvement with a headset however its still not the greatest.Issue 1.5) hit detection/damage. as touched upon above their isn't a natural way of telling where youve been hit from/where the shooter is. To add insult to injury your screen just gets red when your hit. no clues as to general direction of your attacker. damage is all over the board. ive shot somone 3 times with a shotty while he was unequipped(just landed) at about 10 15 feet. he survived then out ran me picked up a sickle and got a one shot kill on me. while funny id have to assume this is not ""working as intended"" lol. as a sidenote why do games still under value shotguns? PUBG is not the only guilty party but its on the bad side of them. seems like anything outside of 10 or 15 feet will require 3 5 hits with a shotgun depending on spread. and headshots at this range also a no go. buck shot is basically 9mm x 10 12. at 15 feet youre taking a nap.Issue 2) The game feels unnatural clunky and a tad outdated(looks this way as well. i initially thought my friend was playing a old shooter). Prone full auto fire seems glitched as everytime i hold down the mouse button shots fire one at a time and very slow but only if someone is close by. this has yet to happen while standing or crouched but happens 2 3 times a night. Certain changes or differences feel forced(like auto reload not existing which is pretty standard in these kinds of games). maybe it's an atempt to be 'different' or raise the skill cap?Issue 3) out of my 14 hours played i'd say i had about 30 minutes of combat. This was unexpected. The rest was loading waiting scavenging or running through bland landscapes that look as if they were designed back in 2005 a.k.a Jogging simulator 05. Issue 4) driving. be prepared to have pot holes send your car spiraling through the air at loooooow speeds lol. easily comparable to the worst driving in any game. again very clunky and unnatural. nothing about it other than the vehicle will remind you of actual driving pissue 5) rewards. Theyre crap to be honest. after opening 7 or 8 boxes i essentially have all the stuff i started with. Still nothing for hands head face etc. i get that its free and only cosmetic but why even bother. so far after close to 14 hours i have nothing. even if my next box gives me something new am i to expect an average of 15 hours minimum per useful or interesting item?I feel like with some different game modes this could be good until then however this game will really just fill a small niche. also the dev team seems to be horrribly inefficient as this has been what a 6 or 7 months in alpha?

2017-09-14,0,0,91,True,Recommended,"Ok. This game is crazy merciless unbearable at times and rewarding. The gameplay is pretty self explanatory you jump out of an airplane fly down parachute to the ground loot stuff try to get into the big white circle kill people if necessary and continue to stay in said circle as it shrinks over time forcing a condenced arena for gunfights and pan wars.This is PLAYERUNKNOWN'S Battlegrounds.When I first bought the game I said ""eh why not."" only 30 bucks. I'll try it out and if it doesn't work out I'll refund it. Here I am 30ish hours into it (and yes I know that's not much in comparison to others) and so far I have already payed off the game in my mind This has been an awesome experience! Since then I've purchased the game for 3 friends and we've all been enjoying playing together. It's a pretty awesome game and if you have a group of people to play with it makes it even more enjoyable. Solo in my opinion is rather cut and dry but coordinating with other people makes the game even better.Now there's some bugs as it's an early access game duh. But I have barely experienced said bugs only real issue I have with it is the lack of optimization at this point but I'm able to run the game pretty well on low settings and the game is still very much worth it.I also did say that the game was rewarding and the reason why I say that is because this game is very difficult. You will be flanked you will be taken off guard. This game isn't meant to be a walk in a park and some people go into the game thinking that DON'T. Don't go into the game with those false expectations. It will be hard you will die and you will get killed over and over again. But don't give up! You will get better you'll figure out where the places to hide are where the good loot is and you'll get better at handling guns!So hey why not give it a try? If it doesn't work out you can always refund it...but a game like this at least deserves one round from everybody.Also be sure to turn the foliage down to 'Very Low'. It won't look as good but most people play that because it eliminates bushes and tall grass in lots of areas. If you have it higher than that you may see yourself hiding in a bush but people may just see a man crouching in a field.Really hope my review encouraged others to join this game!

For example getting in and out of cars and even combat at times. It feels almost too fast at the end of the rounds when the blue zone keeps shrinking. Almost too fast for a game this clunky.

2017-05-17,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,The game is in very rough shape. And I mean VERY rough shape. This is early access after all so keep this in mind when you throw 30 dollars at something that may not turn out to deliver upon promises made. Performance is awful for most people with decent setups so you'll have to run at very low settings if you want to get any decent FPS. The game is shallow enough in terms of features that you'll get tired of it after about three games. It's pretty much the same routine over and over again anyway. Land find some hope you don't get shot in the back by some in the first 30 seconds hide until the circle is small enough die rinse repeat. You'll notice about one third of players die in the first 90 seconds of the game which is entirely normal since most people just fight over the same every round. Unless you're someone who is actually really into battle royale games and is also very interested in being a free labor bug tester then by all means throw your money at this game.

2017-03-29,0,0,668,True,Recommended,A breath of fresh air from the mess that is h1z1. This game not only has more features the gamplay in my opinion is much better. No more awful hit reg and Insane bullet drop. Also while vehicles are in this game they are not important to the end game like in h1z1. This game also has more weapons and Increased customization with attatchments that enhance gameplay. For a game that only released in alpha a few days ago I think it's leaps and bounds better than h1z1. Although it's not well optimized if the devs follow through on their goals then I see no reason why this game can't take over the top spot in the br genre,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game itself is good thats why i wasted so much time on it. But please wait till they found a way to increase the performance (sadly it wont be early because they just bought the unreal engine so they didnt progam the engine itself). Only the Unreal Engine developers could fix some of the problems because they have the knowledge. But you need to keep in mind that they wont change anything in the basic engine code before testing the effects of the changes for other Unreal based games.

I haven't heard from steam or the Devs on why I was banned I'm just guessing. Steam just said ""game ban"" when I asked no explaination. Devs have yet to write me back on why they ""game banned"" me. I don't recommend this game for anyone.....its probably not going to make it to a full game there is just to many hackers and the devs and steam are not doing anything but banning innocent players. To be honest I think most players banned are being banned to make them rebuy the game. I am not going to rebuy this game it's a hacker peice of crap!Side note its not the gameplay they made that better.....it's the ammount of hackers in this game. I see it as 7 out of 10 battles there is a hacker in game! How to spot them is easy......If the circle is huge and the player count is around 20 or 30 there is a hacker that cleared a city with headshots so he can loot otherwise he would die because he sucks. The other is they see you no matter how sneaky you think you are and they run right up to you and kill you because they are using the wall hack where you go change files and you dont see walls anymore and can shoot through them. There are several other hacks to this game I just shared a few I have seen personally.

At first the genre was interesting because it was kinda new but the entire genre as a whole is boring as hell once you play a bit. Run run run run run. Find a crap weapon oh wait here comes the circle run run run die. I mean there are games that it works and its fun but like 85% of the time you land with people and die before you get a weapon or spend the whole game running and finding mostly weapons which would be fine too if it didnt take so long to find weapons. I want to gear up and play not spend literally 10 15 min looting. I just left a game down to 30ish left and i had a freaking micro uzi after clearing a whole town. Come on man.Then lets move to the game itself on just a technical level. It is so laggy even on low ping lag with a solid PC. Everything is juttery the running is not smooth first person is so awkward its barely usable. I mean for real i rememebr playing SiN and Quake2 with 300+ ping back in the 90's and it was easier to play then this. I got it because of a friend i should have listen to Dr Disrespect. I know the guys worked hard on this i dont want to be mean but this game is utter And dont give me this beta crap either your playing the full release basiclly. With luck this game will die out before they get it running how it should.Ive uninstalled. Wish i could get my money and time back. I mean lets really think about what this is anyway this isnt a game this is a combat simulator brain washing people to think war is cool. Well its not. Everyone want to hold a gun till they get shot then they change their tune real quick.

The one problem I have with this game is its inability to let me win I was 7th place just a minute before I wrote this review. I was sitting on a mountain hidden in a bush my sights aimed on a guy running up the mountain and closing on my position. I decided he was getting to close and attempted to shoot... but the game had other plans. Despite the spamming of mouse 1 the gun (fully loaded) would not shoot (I SWEAR THE MOUSE BUTTON WORKED IT STILL DOES). So I did what anyone in my position would do just sat there trying to mow him down in burst fire mode and praying that I would not be found sadly I was and then I was quickly killed by the full auto mode on M416.

2017-10-21,0,0,461,False,Not Recommended,As much as I hate to say it for now I can not recommend this game. For many reasons too the first being optimization. I have at least a $1K pc and this game struggles to load beginning of the game which forces me to avoid and extremely popular areas becuase I either can't pick anything up I glitch through the roof and I can't enter buildings. Next Bluehole needs a new map. I am so utterly bored of the current map I essentially memorize how to loot places like quarry and primorsk. Finally they need to just make the game run smoother (Which I think is a server problem) because you can understand when the main menu won't load for FORTY FIVE MINUTES I am scratching my head asking why I spent 30 dollars on a game that barely runs half the time needs a restart every 3 games and is worsening the following problems with each update not improveing. Don't get me wrong I love the game when it works and I've had my heart racing moments but right now I can not recommend it.Edit THESE GD HACKERS MAKE WE WANT TO UNISTALL THIS GAME AND THROW MY PC OUT OF THE WINDOW REGION LOCK IS A MUST AT THIS POINT please for the love of all things holy bluehole we need region lock to get the chinese off other servers.

What I don't get is all the negative comments complaining about all the bugs. The whole point of Early Access is for the dev team to get money to fund the development and also to find all the bugs and to listen to the community on how improve it. If there weren't any bugs in an Early Access game then it should not be in Early Access.The core gameplay and balance is very good and the overall feel of the guns are very even but require skill.

2017-08-11,0,0,499,True,Not Recommended,"I'll begin with the positive this game is definitely very addictive with each match leaving you thinking/strategizing as to how you should approach the next and the ability to get a squad of friends together to play is definitely a huge plus. There are however several issues that summed together can't allow me to recommend this game. The first and perhaps most important reason driving me to actually write and post this review in the first place (along with many others) is the introduction of paid crates. This comes as quite the surprise following the dev's promise to not engage in such practices until after the game was out of early access and is just something I can't condone especially considering he has decided to employ the now all too common system of crates and keys which is simply a system employed to addict certain players and generally get more money out of everyone by leaving them at the mercy of a slot machine style drop system in which they pay a reasonably large sum of money (in many cases $2.50) to purchase a ""key"" that will allow them to open a ""crate"" which will spawn a random item that they may or may not have already making the process of getting an item they want often times incredibly expensive. This coupled with the fact that the dev added that the weekly crates earnable with the in game ""BP"" system will most likely be on their way out after early access as well. Now for the second issue that I wanted to add just to give people some insight into how things feel once you already own and have been playing this for a while. After having played quite a bit over the past few weeks both with and without friends in my squad I have begun to notice that one of the most glaring issues with the game itself (extra monetization aside) is that this game will leave you feeling like you've ""lost"" about 90% of the time. Of course this complaint sounds weird on it's face since of course there are around 99 people dropping in against you and of course that means your odds of actually winning the entire thing are less than amazing but what I have begun to notice is that especially if you're playing with somewhat frustratable friends this game may quickly become despised due to the amount of quick out of nowhere and even perfectly legitimate deaths. While it's not often that a death really gets under my skin it can certainly be an issue when your friend gets sniped out of nowhere after a good twenty minutes of getting stocked up. While in many other games dying isn't really much of an issue in this game the tragic unlucky or ""Where'd that come from?"" deaths are so rarely broken up by an actual win that morale of your friends (and yeah maybe even you!) can definitely take a hit over a few days or weeks of playing. I imagine this definitely sounds like a weird issue but it's something that over the last few days I definitely can't deny is having an impact on how often my friends (and sometimes even myself) play this game.Thanks for reading! Maybe I'll see you on the battlefield! (Or maybe you'll see me....please don't kill me if you do) o_o'",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-29,0,0,345,True,Recommended,With all the negative reviews out there that made me sceptical to purchase. I opted to try it anyway since I had a friend who's been playing this for a while. To be honest I think this game is pretty f'ing sweet. You never have to start the round in the same place twice you typically spend the first few minutes looting unless dropping into a populated area in which case it reminds you of the begining of the hunger games (everyone rushing for weapons and lots of death). You may never see a soul until the circle shrinks to a few meters. So you get to choose (for the most part) how you play. The gun drops can be frustrating. Sometimes a house may have nothing but ammo and mods sometimes just nades and clothes but it is very random. Don't expect to find an AR or SR each time you play. Sometimes you get stuck with 2 of the same shotty and a frying pan (which can actually deflect a bullet in the anoose).I will say that this graphics engine isn't the greatest. Takes typically 30 or so seconds for texture maps to load. So everything kinda looks like crap at the begining of the round. I haven't noticed 'bad' performance however. Keep in mind im using a stock 1070 i7 6800k (stock) 32gb of ddr4 and a samsung 840pro. FYI I am also using Nvida surround on 3x 1920 x 1200 HP LA2405wg monitors. First it auto detected surround and that makes me happy when I don't 'have' to go mess with video/graphics options. I will say that with surround enabled your main menu doesn't display right and the UI detection is off by about 1.5 inches. Also I would say the FOV doesnt adjust much and it makes everything feel slightly stubby (short and fat). When I first started playing this I felt slightly nauseous and I am an avid FPS player. So while some with cheaper gear may be struggling to run this game I would say those with quad core cpus a 'decent' gpu and an SSD should be fine on 1 monitor. Makes me wonder if people are trying this on turd boxes and laptops and expecting it to be fine. I hear a lot of folks talk about the servers being TBH I have not noticed this but Im in the midwest US so...The thing I noticed after about 2 hours of playing is that you don't 'Win' very often and you die a bunch. To a lot of people out there that may be very annoying and possibly be prone to 'coming up with reasons why the game is bad'?! IDK but if you cannot handle dying often then skip this. Sometimes you can be sniped running across a field. Sometimes you walk in a house and get murdered by dude hiding in a room. Sometimes you die by the circle that forces you to interact with enemies. I have yet to experience random deaths or dying while getting out of a car. (I mean this is a simulator so getting out of a car at speed could do it to you.) The real fun in this game is playing in squads imo. Personally I dont play this game solo often unless im feeling the itch. All in all I would consider buying this if you 1. have a decent rig2. play with friends3. don't have a meltdown everytime you die4. are going to have resonable expectations about an early access game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My friend bought this for me he was on the hype train like everyone else i decided to give it a try and hell this game is too fun!Graphics are really good but the game is still in early access we all know what this means bad optimizations there is alot of guides if people have issues with FPS.

2017-05-11,0,0,1,True,Recommended,"An interesting concept for a survival game that doesn't revolve around pointless survival meters or zombies. Instead the game pits you against 99 other players in a ""hunger games"" style brawl on a remote island. As the number of players dwindle so does the actual play area. I didn't understand this concept at first but now I know why they did it. After a certain number of player deaths the game tells you to go to a marked area on the map. Failing to do so will result in your slow and painful death. They did this so the few players that are left aren't sprawled over the enormous maps.The game is actually pretty balanced in terms of loot that you find. Depending on where you fly down to you can get entirely different equipment. In one match I jumped out of the plane and landed in a housing area that had a crap ton of high caliber weapons such as the M4 rifle and the Scar L (in the same house!). The game is also kind enough to give you ammo for the weapons that are lying around near it so you will have a chance to defend yourself.As of the current state of this game I do not reccomend it. The stability is really bad on my high end PC. Crashes are prevalent and there are a few game breaking bugs. One annoying bug caused me to die right in the beginning of the game. When I landed from the plane there was a bug that caused my controls to act funny. I couldn't move around as well and I died from it.tl dr A fun game made annoying with the amount of bugs and technical issues.

2017-08-10,0,0,14,True,Recommended,My freind recently convinced me to buy this game and as far as the duo and squad aspects of this game go I have loved it. Howerver the solo mode is unreliable. I have only been able to play about one game out of five without haivng my connection time out and kick me from the game. I know this is an early release version of this title but this still just pisses me off. However the rest of this game is absolutley amazing from the large map and areas to explore to the very nice gunplay and adrenaline pumping firefights. Overall if you have a buddie or two to play with I wouldn't hesitate on picking this game up in its current state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-20,0,0,346,True,Recommended,Amazing game Love it so much. Realistic which is good. Great fun to play with your friends and solo. However its got a ton of glitches. I keep getting stuck in walls and not being able to get out.Also theres inventory lag which means that sometimes I cant close my inventory for like 5 secs which is really annoying if I'm in a fight and healing or something. This only happens to some people and its not your computer or anything cuz i have a GTX 1050 Ti and i7 processor. But I can deal with that. Its the fact that sometimes it just refuses to let me in to a match or even in to the game. Complete BS. I would give the gameplay 5 stars but overall only 3 because of those bugss that make the game almost unplayable,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

GOD AWFUL optimization some of the worst I've ever seen for an Early Access plagues every waking moment of this game. Crahes are common framerate can be abysmal at points and don't even get me started on the 30 minute load times. I only recommend this game if you have a beast PC High speed connection and lots of patience.

Melee fight and fight with crowbar and such is really when kocked out it is not possible to finish off with eg. crowbar.2. Servers lag and tic rating is (Opening doors aim long distance shots)3. Jump mechanics are not functioning (Can't jump up/over walls and small fences)4. AntiCheat is not functioning (How to report cheating players ?)5. Start zone where all players wank around waiting for all 100 players to join with weapons and grenades come on Create a lobby like all other games in history instead of this 6. View distance on ultra and can't even see boats and cars unless you are under 50m away.7. If anyone can live with this I recommend this game.So instead of adding new motorcycle and twitch button they should really focus on fixing bugs instead but this is also early access so in total the game has a great potential.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The only problems I really have is when jumping out of the plane it's very laggy and the occasional fps drop every now and again. The core game is very fun and addictive and I can't wait for more content and optimisation for a smoother experience with even more going on! And also a practice style mode for aiming would be good where you go into like a death match style game and get to choose a load out and are restricted to a certain part of the map from the start,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-25,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,At present I can't recommend this game. Whilst it's still an early access game there are game breaking bugs and it's pot luck if you're affected.For me FPS drops dramatically in every game mostly typically when you engage in combat. The audio stutters typically from explosions or a vechile moving and there is nothing you can do but wait it out though usually I'm dead at this point.I've read the developers forums on this topic (there are no solutions it seems) and submitted their template for bug reporting but its been a couple of months and despite various updates still no fix.Once the game is runnable or if you're one of the lucky ones the game is fantastic.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However after a few hours it gets repeditive and if you don't start in an area with good loot then you might as well quit the match. On many occasions I've only come across pistol after pistol in houses that clearly no one has looted yet. I've also had many experiences where I've seen no other players even inside the circle until only about 30 players are left. I like the game but for anyone thinking of buying it I would definitely wait until more of the bugs are worked out and the loot drops are fixed.I don't care about the issue of purchasing keys to unlock crates so that didn't factor into my not recommending this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Well designed maps with a new map on the way. A small tightly nit community who struggle to stay away from each other. Dedicated first person mode servers. A lovely plain flight and sky diving. (Auto deploy included) Quick queue times. (1 10 seconds at most)Some of the minuses in Pubg include Having to wait for buildings to load on occasion. A slight chance of fps drops. Some seemingly enemy encounters can seem a bit BS and random.

2017-05-01,0,0,75,True,Not Recommended,This game has a lot of great potential but as of now is not worth purchasing for half as much as its selling for. Besides the horrible optimization and bugs that will probably be fixed in the future the gameplay is very slow. Reasons for this include Big map with a max of 100 people Huge starting safe area and lots of time before it shrinks Lots of different loot and leveled loot which encourages players to loot more than to fight Big map with lots of locations to loot with a lot of different loot and few players means barely any encounterments while looting Prevalent camping styles found in streamers encourages players to do the same Quick kill times reward camping because ambushes will almost alway result in instant death for the non camperIf the devs did something to speed up gameplay like make a smaller map make the safe zone shrink faster and/or make the best gear only available in exclusive locations to draw opponents together this game would be golden. Here are some pros as comparing it to other games in its genre (H1Z1) Better more realistic animations More detailed and aesthetic map Variety of weapons (although all guns within a class feel identical) Iron sights are actually worth a damn You cant jump out of speeding vehicles without taking health or dying!All in all its still a fun game to play and I wish the best for its future. H1 and this game feel different so they both will have their place and anyone talking about H1 being a bad game is definitely not played it recently and/or is garbage at it as the gun play takes more skill (besides the shotgun),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Kill some dudes. Wait. Look for dudes. Wait. Get to endgame and finally have fun again. Or get cucked some where in the loot/wait/fight/wait/bored/wait/bored cycle and have to start all over again.

2017-07-31,0,0,401,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive) after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60 70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! But alas...you make an idiotic mistake. You end as #2.....that moment will haunt you forever...This is what will happen every game you'll feel rage anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over....until you start the next one.

2017-10-15,0,0,142,True,Recommended,Never had so much fun with such a buggy game before. Definiately overhyped a bit by streamers but if that's the way to beat current player records and sell a lot of copies then good for the devs that they figured it out. I hope it doesn't stay in Early Access for years like most other games of its kind. And finally yes there will be microtransactions but I already accepted that to be the future. If you like Battle Arena then you should probably buy this game if you haven't done that already but if you don't you should wait for it to get cheaper/better in my opinion that might also get the devs to fix some issues as they are currently busy doing coke and banging hookers I imagine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The mechanics are solid the RNG keeps each match unique and the decisions you make each and every minute effect your chances at winning.

2017-09-07,0,0,229,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. I'm just gonna come out and say right away that I definitely recommend this game.......for the fact it's only $30. That's not to say that this game can't be fun cuz it can be very fun.That comes with a price though. Lack of modes is an issue for me. It's not that I don't like the ""be the last one alive thing"" it just gets really old looting for as much as 30 minutes only to get shot in the back by someone sitting in the gas killing you as you make your way to the safe zone. Happens once meh ok I will try again. Twice or more and you're not going to have a good time.Lets face facts here the game is busted. Yes it's in EA but that doesn't excuse it from the criticisms all other shooters should face if they were present.First off servers are complete garbage. I've heard they run at 20 tick which in 2017 is a huge step back. Overwatch runs at 60 on CONSOLE. CSGO runs at 64 tick. That's not a good look and it's noticeable. I haven't seen too many people skipping around but the latency affects pretty much everything and will result in very questionable gameplay most of the time. Shots not hitting when they should getting shot around and over walls etc. You will see all of stuff like this on a regular basis. Not the only thing that's busted either. Scopes are misaligned shot audio is confusing shotguns are either broken or don't work rifles have odd tendencies the list goes on and on.RnG is a HUGE factor here as well. The game isn't primarily based on being skilled at the game. People can win with only one kill which I don't like. I mean 100 people on a server and the winner only kills one person that's a problem. The game is a shooter but its not focused on taking engagements. Merely dropping and going to the right spots will keep you alive and well. Whether it's being in position to easily stay in the safe zone or dropping into a rifle and meds RnG is the primary factor of who takes the win.I could handle all the broken stuff in the game without a complaint but the servers are just too terrible to ignore. People's play style as well. The game is way too campy in its current state and needs to be more focused on encouraging engagements rather than avoiding them. Just be ready for frustration it will eventually happen. Once they get their servers up to competent levels I'm sure it will get better but right now they are potatoes. CoD runs better tbh.If the game was $60 I would easily tell you to avoid this game but it's only $30 so if you are interested go ahead and try it out. Make sure your PC is good enough though this game uses a LOT of memory. TL DR Game is busted but the price is good.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-04,0,0,440,True,Not Recommended,The game is fun and has a huge following tons of people are playing. Which leads me to my next point. With all the money this game has made the devs are either greedy or amateur coders. Sorry but that is the truth. This is litteraly the perfect example of the early access plague going around right now. By no means should this be early access it should still be beta. The game crashes it has a memory leak vehichle physics are complete bs the servers are extremely unstabble. The list goes on and on. Field of view bugs out when you try to stretch your chute you can get stuck on many many places of the map vehicles sometimes dissapear you can take fatal damage from falling sometimes even though you didnt fall 2 feet. On top of all this the game is so poorly optimized that with nothing else running my i7 at 4.4 ghz sometimes reaches 100%. lucly enough I have duel monitors so I leave task manager open on the other window to shut this game down when it trys to destroy my pc.Is that enough reasons to not buy the game or do you need more? The game gets monthly updates and Junes update is supposed to deal with the optimization issue but I have little faith. If the game wasn't so poorly optimized and the servers were stable I would recomend becasue the other bugs are acceptable while the game still gets updates duing early access phase but by no means right now should it be early access. It's a beta game sold at early access price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is well worth the 30 dollars and would reccomend all my friends to buy it. After watching a few streams and playing for about 2 days you start to get the hang of the game. I do reccomend that you have a few other friends that play the game because if you only play solo constantly it will get boring. The shooting is done in first person (or third if you choose to). The scopes and other things such as flash hiders are very easy to understand. Even if your initial reaction is because of how your first few games went dont refund the game continue playing because it is defidently one of the best games that have come out recently. Blows H1Z1 away. I hope my review got you to buy this game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Especially when the game loads stuff like the world or starting screen.So please Optimize your game first! Not in time like right now before you add any other features. Not everyone is wealthy enough to provide a proper computer but asking for a freaking better optimization is everyone's one true right and its one of the most important thing that can put a video game in good games list.But if you say ""Not an option bruuh we are targeting high tier PC owners.""

2017-07-02,0,0,545,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. For being in early access this is one of the best games I have played in a while. I feel like while there are many changes left to make on the game (Optimization Fine Tuning Etc) I also feel like the potential is extremely large. Check the Steam charts and this game will be #1. My only warning though is if you do have a bad to mediocre PC setup you may want to check others reviews and videos on it since it doesn't run perfectly on all computers. Personally I have an Intel i 6770 4.00 GHz and a GTX 1080 and my game runs at 60 100+ frames at all times.

2017-10-17,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,As one of the best selling games of this year I am afraid to say I can't recommend it.I have played 26 hours of it and it feels like a hell of a lot more because it's repetitive lonely and so luck oriented that I just do not feel any desire to play any more.Repetitive spawn in the crowd grab a weapon shoot some players with giggles fly in the plane jump out parachute down search houses for gear run away from blue wall of death run away from blue wall of death run away from blue wall of death .... you get the idea lol. Every match is pretty much the same.Lonely search houses for gear either get killed early on because you landed near someone who managed to find gear quicker than you/better gear than you or ... get gear run away from blue wall of death run away from blue wall of death run away from blue wall of death run away from blue wall of death get killed from a distance by someone you didn't see who stopped for a second to shoot you as they were running away from blue wall of death lolLuck oriented parachute down and search houses for gear. Your success depends on the quality of gear you find and if there is a conventient vehicle nearby. Other wise ... you'll run away from blue wall of death run away from blue wall of death run away from blue wall of death (with weak/no gear) and get killed by player who found better gear than you.The only reason I played so many hours after wasting so much time running and trying to get near the white circle seeing nobody and then suddenly getting killed is there was a rumour that if you played a while you might get better. No. You just need to be lucky in where you drop and what you find. An expensive very modern rig will help a lot too the game is laggy and gives pretty low fps if you have anything worse than that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Changes (to fix issues) thus far are very slow. It's new. I really love the battleground/battle royale feature in these survival/shooter games (h1z1 arma3 Dayz) heck even non baattle royale such as miscreated has it's features. Right now I run a i7 6700 32gb 1070gtx yada yada and this game is incredibly sluggish. Frames are fine just the latency issues with servers and the game interaction latency is off putting. Long distance firing is highly inaccurate at this point. Again in a few months or after it goes on sale worth a shot. Right now thumbs down.

2017-05-22,0,0,717,True,Recommended,"Okay so wow. Been playing for 2 days and I've seen the scope of this game I was even 2nd remaining one of the rounds.I already feel compelled to give a good word towards this title. After hours and hours of similar titles (DayZ mod and standalone Minecraft Rust Ark...) It is very refreshing to have a title cut the and get quick to the action.No food to worry about no stamina during your brief periods of running no more spending hours and hours trying to group up with your friends because you have to each find a map compass etc. Nope! Not anymore! Start the game and Bam ready to grab loot and kill with your friends. In many ways it is refreshing. In fact my only complaint is that the stupid title for the game deterred me from even acknowledging when it released. That and the fact that ""ugh another early access game?"" Even so it puts DayZ SA to shame in terms of providing sheer FUN. Sure you don't have that survival aspect seen in other games but frankly I find that getting stale.Whether on your own or with friends it is great fun.

I have several hours in this game and I can say that this is one of the most fun and enjoyable FPS games I've ever played. Gamers are whiney. They pay half price for an early access game and then complain when the game has bugs or crashes. Yes the game is not perfect. Yes sometimes you run into cheaters.Ignore the negativity buy the game get some friends online and you won't want to put it down. There's a reason why this is one of the msot popular games of 2017 and why it's actually getting ported to Xbox by the end of the year unlike most Steam games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-03,0,0,710,True,Recommended,"This is a GREAT game. Probably one of the best game i think since Dota (not Dota 2) was a custom map in warcraft that is hitting big and fast in the online gaming community. The difference is that Dota was growing a bit slow at the beginning and growing steadily while this is extremely fast at the beginning probably due to of a lot of streamer bought this and played it which worries me (the fast growing part not the streamer playing it nor the cause).Before the cheaters the record breaking concurrent players and the stake bought by Tencent This is a really fun game where you can just running around doing weird stuff with your friends or you can try winning the round or just being annoying in a random matchmaking etc etc. What makes a game great is not the graphics nor the optimization nor the story (sometimes bear with me) nor the gameplay and nor the technical stuff. It's the feeling that you get when you play the game a game needs to be ""humanic"" (i don't know if it was a word but i hope you get what i mean) or ""human"" probably is the right word it doesn't matter if the story sucks or the gameplay is not perfect It is the feeling of pure joy of playing the game be it for the story or the gameplay. PUBG let me feel that again after years of gaming the feeling of joy when the first time i played counter strike and dota the communication with friends people the moment when you just want school time to be over quickly to play it with your friends.Sadly nothing's perfect. Even counter strike in the old days are squirming with cheaters in most servers dota players (in my area at least) is becoming toxic and salty. But we still play it. Because we like it we love it. It's not ""human"" if it's perfect but i think not perfect is better.So Yes. I do recommend it but i really hope for the game becomes better. Better server better anti cheat better optimization etc etc. I know how hard it is to make a highly demanded software and being pressurized to do so. So i know that the devs and the people involved in this game/company are doing their absolute best to keep the community happy.Cheers.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-01,0,0,116,True,Recommended,В PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS сотня игроков в постсоветское время десантируется на вымышленный остров Ерангел в Черном море. Остров заброшен повсюду разваленные запорожцы и наши родные уазики а на стенах полно революционных надписей. Местные жители явно уходили в спешке и оставили много полезных предметов оружие патроны и снаряжение.Цель пережить всех остальных. А уж как ее достичь каждый решает сам. Хочешь прячься по углам и жди когда враги сами перестреляют друг друга хочешь сам отправляйся на поиски противников. Второй вариант подойдет либо очень опытным либо очень смелым игрокам. Если верить внутриигровой статистике лучшие игроки здесь вообще не геройствуют показатель kill/death на верхних строчках рейтинга колеблется от 1 до 4. Как говорит сам Грин PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS игра в первую очередь тактическая. Здесь вам не шутер.Остров большой. Очень большой! Бывает что выживших осталось человек тридцать а вы до сих пор никого не видели даже издали. Не переживайте вам просто везет (или не везет если вы жаждете крови). Но и сидеть весь матч в одном укрытии не удастся и не только потому что спустя десять пятнадцать минут вам станет неимоверно скучно смотреть на местные пейзажи.Зона боевых действий постепенно сужается. Почти сразу после начала матча (язык не повернется назвать это боем) на карте появляется выделенная белым область куда надо попасть за определенное время. Кто не успел тот умер. Положение области в каждом матче случайное так что предугадать удобное место высадки не удастся. Потом область постепенно сужается. К моменту когда остается десять двадцать игроков ее размер сокращается примерно до 1/150 карты.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-27,0,0,393,True,Not Recommended,I love this game but I can't recommend it if it is going the direction of microtransactions.A game published in early access alpha should NOT be starting a microtransaction economy. Especially since the devs promised they would not do this.I will change this review to positive if they revert to their original stance otherwise they represent another nail in the coffin of the game development industry.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-10,0,0,162,True,Recommended,Let me preface this by saying I have a LARGE number of games at the time of posting this over 800.Most games I buy on steam end up having less than 20 hours over the course of several years. With this game I've owned it for less than two months and I've got almost 90 hours played. If that doesn't show that this is a fun game I don't know what else does.The Pros 1.) The game is never the same you can go to the same exact spot every game and get different gear even if you are lucky enough to have the plane go the same course. Every game is different the only constant is YOU and maybe your friends.2.) This is the survival game I've been wanting for a very long time no real focus on exploring and building no useless zombies getting in the way no overly large map where there isn't much but terrain and you will never stumble upon a single person or ever be found.3.) There are steam community items for this game and I don't personally care for most games that have items you get in game that can be sold for money I have to admit the way they do it in this game is amazing the only item that I've encountered that gives you an advantage would be the gas masks full and half which are also found laying around the map for you to pick up and equip. The items are 99% cosmetic and while certain clothes do help you in that you are harder to spot you can find them on the map and equip them.Cons1.) The first real negative to me about this game is it is early access there have been a lot of games released on early access it is becoming a negative feature to have your game listed that way.2.) Optimization the game runs poorly at times and while I fully admit they have made large number of improvements there are places and times where you will see large frame drops and lag spikes its improving but the problem still exists.3.) While no two games are the same at the moment with only one map and only one real gamemode which does get a bit repetative.OverallThe game is a lot of fun with a lot of replayability and is especially fun to play with a group of friends.8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-14,0,0,134,True,Recommended,Product received for free. The game is a lot better than H1Z1 KOTK but there are some things that need to be fixed still. There needs to only be one texture that everyone in the game will see not just some people. Example (one player cannot see grass the other player can the player that can see the grass can lay down and think that he is hidden but in reality he is not. And you can get killed very easily). The game is still a very great game and I encourage people to buy it. There are only little things that can be fixed very easily. It tops H1Z1 KOTK by a lot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-06,0,0,617,True,Recommended,"Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is simply the one of the best games I've every played. The game mechanics are simply wonderful gun fights are realistic (bullet drop one shot headshot kills effective range) the border is randomly generated so the game is a new experience every time running is a reasonable speed (though it might seem slow if your running a ways) and there is loot EVERYWHERE. It usually takes less then a minute to find a reasonable gun after you land. PUBG also has a unique starting experience when you ""spawn in"" your character appears in the back of a C 130 cargo plane allowing you to choose when to jump and where to land every time a new match starts. When playing with friends you could all jump out at different times or land at different places. The map is amazing and offers lots of places to hide buildings to breach (and die in) and lots of terrain changes to give you (or the enemy) the upper hand. Also because there are so many players it takes about 5 seconds to find a lobby.All that said PUBG does have some minor issues. The cars can be quite clunky and some times glitch out (or hit the smallest thing and flip head over heals) and while this is usually really funny and only does minor damage. It can also be really inconvenient say when your in a car shootout and your car spontaneously glitches into a tree... At first PUBG was REALLY poorly optimized and my PC (Ryzen 1700 OC Radeon 480 16gb ddr4) was only getting 40fps on high settings (there is an ultra option) but in the most recent update the game runs MUCH smoother 80+ fps on ultra. The only other problem I have seen (my friends have had this happen but I've never run into it) is when buildings don't load in when you land and look like a chuck of colored rock for a minute or so which can sometimes get your killed (Appears moving the game to an SSD helps a lot).Despite these bugs the development team is hard at work (with weekly patches and monthly content updates) ironing out any problems. Also if you have been turned away by people getting banned on the forums think about this When someone talks about (or posts a video) of someone hacking others see it and also become aware of the exploit / hack. This in turn promotes hacking. The dev team has already banned 25 000+ players for hacking since release and I have never seen a hacker in game my self 80 100 matches under my belt.Hope to find you in game negasaurus",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It has a great concept of battle royale and is still the most played steam game however the dev team need to do a lot of work. On a high end PC your fps rate fluctuates between 30 70. To actually have a decent fps (Unless you have a alienware area 51 P) you need to have all graphics really low making the game just look really horrible. I would recommend it. If you can get over certain bugs and the bad video quality then I would 100% buy it. It's really fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The only issue that i have about the game is that the developers seem to focus too much on adding new things each week with their updates instead of focusing on where they need to optimizing the game. The texture glitch that i get all too often when first landing in a game is really annoying. Also the frame lag that i get all the time when the game first starts is also very annoying. Other than these which dont really affect game play after maybe the first minute of the match i have no other issues with the game.Also lets not forget about people getting falsly banned because streamers cry every time they get killed from someone they call them ""stream snipers"". Could it be a possibility that they are just better at the game and got a good kill. Please stop banning people for stream sniping because last time i checked thats not against any kind of rules in any game it happens when you decide to stream a game you are going to get those people who are watching your stream and looking for you to kill you. If you dont like it then stop streaming the game simple as that.Overall i give this game about an 8/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But let me get one thing straight This game is not by any means perfect and I'm not claiming it to be. It has its flaws for instance the first 30 60 seconds of a game after landing there is horrible server lag I've had friends with the same problem and sometimes it's takes more then one button press to pick up an item. However the hit registry is good and the overall gameplay is nice. It is a demanding game but can still be run on mid to low tier desktops. (I'm running a gtx 720 ti and amd quad core 4300 and I'm getting a consistent 40 frames)Compared to h1z1 I prefer battlegrounds as the game is more skill based and in my experience I die a lot less from unbalanced weapons or glitches.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-13,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Quite entertaining so far. It's kind of game that you didn't plan to spend so much time on it but ended up playing it more than you expected. Playing it with friends is highly recommended it'll boost the FUN and LAUGHS. The only down is the lag if you have a potato PC like mine. I have to change the setting to very low for this game in comparison to medium setting for Black Desert Online (which has a WAY better visual btw).So far I would recommend this game for those who enjoy FPS and survival type of game or for those who just don't have much free time but still want to play something good to kill their free time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-10,0,0,60,True,Recommended,This game reminds me of playing poker tournaments years ago. You can get dealt some great hands early or bad hands. Then you just try and last and out yourself in the best position to win. Its fun with friends and definitely worth it for that experience. The community should be way more toxic but aside from some wannabe streamer celebrities people are pretty nice for pick ups. I think theres some shennanigans though they will have to sort out. I've had some partners that have been so out of control good that it seems borderline suspicious. Or they are just that freaking good. Who knows. Worth $30. Lots of fun and gunplay is solid for a game like this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Stream Snipe banned? Just chill people make mistakes especially for a new company. Learn how to deal with it or stop this bs. Its not like YOU are the one banned its not like YOU never mistakenly accuse someone of doing something they never did. Beside this this is a quite a good game 11/10.

2017-05-31,0,0,668,True,Recommended,PUBG is showing a lot of promise and its definatly way above and beyond what other Battleground games are capable of. It seems that the dev team are actually working on the game all the time with hotfixes and issues that the community brings up with finally new content on the way different types of servers its probably the best battleground game you can get.Given it does have the same annoying deaths/stupidness of previous games and the price is rather high for the base gamemode itself and the customisation of characters is lacking severly but if they improve that with constant weapon refreshment map pools this game is probably one of the best to come out on the market since Arma 3.Plus note dont buy it if you have a potato PC loads of people have issues with textures and FPS if you dont have an up to date graphics cards ect,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Tries to open the game and the game crashes again but in the main menu itself. Tries again to open the game and it opens. Reconnects to the game !!! Congo !!! But guess what ? I am in the plane and i dropped off but my teammates cant see my marker on top of me. My marker and probably my ""other pre disconnect player body is still in the spawn island"" as my teammates told me. Good thing i can see my teammates markers. But they cant. So they freak out every ing moment i come infront of them. Who would not freak out when there is a player with no friendly marker on top of him just following you everywhere ? My teammates assume enemies as me and die because we both almost looked the same. Meanwhile my other part dies off in the island becasue of the zone and i get a prompt saying ""i died out of playzone"". But i am still playing. In the end my teammate dies so i am automatically shown the way to exit the lobby because it thinks i am already dead in the spawn point. I cant do anything else but exit because the screen is stuck.

Now I will say that this game is nowhere near perfect but it's also still in early access so I don't expect it to be polished yet. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone simply because it is extermely fun to play both alone and with friends. The gunplay is a little weird at times and certain guns feel like they have a little bit too much recoil but as you play more you will find the guns you like and avoid the ones you don't.

2017-09-02,0,0,400,True,Not Recommended,Was thinking of doing a game review for the full release. Although right now an issue has blatantly revealed itself. Therefore revealing another issue that urked me enough to write this. This review about the support services of this game. Game ran smooth for 170+ hrs of gameplay. Their recent update is crashing all AMD computers. 5 10 minutes into the game you will crash. Issue has been brought up on reddit and their main forums on 09 01 17. I've come to realize that their customer support is pretty atrocious. Considering that people pour money into the steam market for this game. Even more disturbing that they havent addressed anything. Today's steam announcement only talks about their tournament and GTA counterpart.Still no one on both official and reddit forums has received a reply since 09 02 17 2355 hours.In conclusion Be aware that if you buy this game that may cause you future problems or bugs. There will be no immediate help/messages from their tech or customer services that will be offered.UPDATE Still nothing but I think I speak for the community. 30 minutes ago Dany2k said I think that over 50% of the Playbase have the same issue. The Problem is the support here and the activity of the admins/publisher. Im pretty frustrated that noone cares.SOURCE https //forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/61828 amd gpu users are crashing without error/?page 3,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,278,True,Recommended,It's a good game for a Early access start the game mechanics are completely different to the alternative H1Z1 which revolves around quick paced and jumping all over the place with rediculous cartoon like skins this game includes a variety of different weapons and tactics to try. However the lack of current customisation on your character may be frustrating to some who may want the character they look at in third person to be visually pleasing to them. For the people who were not in the Pre Alpha build it may cost an extortionate ammount of money to gain some of the exclusives to your character this could be seen with the player unknowns crate which has a current selling price of 1000 on the market. However there also skins that may help gameplay which you can either buy or get for free by opening the current pioneer crates.I think that if you want a difinitive experience of the classic Battle Royal this game is the best choice for it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you can see ID named as 'wq****' 'qq*****' 'waigua****' they are mother ers that selling hacking tools. They have took 7 of top 10. Not sure if the other 3 are their clients. Hacking tools are so powerful that can fire weapon faster than it normally can ignore bullet drop no need to lead on target even shoot you through walls.

Sounds are extremenly un realistic as it seems you have super human senses and can hear footsteps in buildings 50 meters away from you. Good arcade game for the young kids and those ultra cool streamer guys who can get everyone banned cause they whinge like little es when they get legitimatly killed. ( use stream delays derps)Ive had a chicken dinner which is when I stopped playing. Most empty win of a game ive ever experienced.GTA5 did a much better job of this battle royale mode. ARK has a royale mode which all over this also.So this is my opinion but I can see alot of ppl are enjoying it each to their own. Not for me though.

2017-06-21,0,0,458,True,Recommended,At first this game had me like no other from the same genre i was very surprised at how addicting this game is. But after spending 89 hours on a game and not winning a single match takes a toll on you. (And no i dont dislike this game just because i haven't won yet). I've been playing Duo queue and Squad but i still keep losing. Sure getting top 10 is pretty simple. But when the game is just pitting people against eachother on open areas and the ones who are behind the right tree or hiding in the right bush with just plain luck wins. That's exhausting I've been trying my best to improve my game i searched for information on the internet where the best possible spots for good loot is i've been improving my aim my tactics and everything. But it all comes down to that last circle where people are having PLAIN F*CKING LUCK when it comes to positioning. Other than the fact that this game needs some solid adjustements this game is decent. I don't like being two punched killed by people when it takes more than 6 punches from myself i don't like that people can kill me with a vehicle even though i jumped sideways just to dodge it seconds before it would actually hit me i don't like the fact that sometimes you can shoot through people even though you should have hit them. If they change the fact that the little circle is actually RANDOM and not just picking the open areas i could actually like this game a lot more. It would be a lot more fun if there were some kind of mayhem right in a city. I also think that the punching mechanic should be fixed ASAP. I like this game and everything will probably be better in the future and when that happends i might change my recommendation. But for now this game is nothing i would recommend for anyone at its current state. But now when a lot of things has actually been improved i can change my recommendation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-16,0,0,179,True,Not Recommended,Edit 3 So they added first person only mode today. They even ed THAT up. I understand this mode is in beta but its not that hard. I am a developer myself who works with Unreal Engine and I just don't know how the hell they ed it up so much!_______________________________________________________________________________Edit 2 Just avoid. Servers are unstable as . Spend your money somewhere else. Once they fix the performance issues then it will be perfect. Until then I cannot recommend it._______________________________________________________________________________Edit Random lag spikes unstable servers. Want to know how unstable they are? A server shutdown mid game once. They also shutdown the servers for maintenance without warning.Purely because of this I can no longer recommend the game until fixed! Original Lets keep this as short as possible Pros it is an amazing game combat is well balanced weapon customization is amazing.Cons Poorly optimized however remember that it is an early access game and has only been public for about a month so it wont run correctly on all systems. Lag on opening inventory is most likely caused by the blur background effect. This is new to Unreal Engine itself and is experimental so I assume this is most likely the cause. Random frame drops and lag is just due to poor optimization.Overall Great potential. Just needs optimizing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,169,True,Not Recommended,While I greatly enjoy the core game and do recommend it I would hold off on a purchase until the situation with paid crates is resolved. There should be no Micro Transactions during the development period paid early access is about supporting the creation and refinement of the game and not making a massive profit. What Greene has here is great but I urge other buyers not to purchase this game in order to discourage him and other devs from using their communities in this way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,309,True,Not Recommended,Crates and keys for cosmetics while the game still runs like the first 5 minutes of the game are so incredibly laggy its unplayable the list of bugs is endless yet here our dev team is making crates and keys to take money while the game is still in early access. Nice priorities,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-11,0,0,53,True,Not Recommended,"I play a bit of PUBG now and again and I can say in its current state its a Buggy Laggy mess. Even with a 1080ti and I7 5820k all overclocked you STILL get a choppy framerate. ""bUt ItS eARlY aCCeSs"" Yeah that it is. But when developers decide to put CS GO esk. crates into the game (IE Mircotransactions for a bit of texture) I can tell Playerunkowns dev team is starting down a path. I feel as if they care more about Skins than actually producing a decent game. And yes I understand that they have two different teams working on two different things. But less skins and a more playable game would go along way with the PUBG community amist all the banning going on for the buggy crap IN the game that only the dev team can fix.EDIT Hold up. Someone got banned for honking a bloody horn? My god didn't realise we lived under STALINS REIGN.

2017-08-13,0,0,103,True,Not Recommended,I have been playing on and off due to a few things but my biggest complaint is that i spend 20 minutes in a game running from fights or trying to sneak up on someone because of one fact i dont have a ing gun and if i do i have thirty bullets you have to spend half the game looting just to find a decent gun with ammo if you want to have any chance of getting kills my best games/games that I had won I literally spent 15 minutes looking for loot and the best thing i had was an m4 with 120 bullets and level 2 helmet. pretty ing rediculous that you either have to go to HUGE blood baths to find anywhere near this amount of loot in a couple of minutes or you have to spend the whole game going house to house to find gear this is a tacticle shooting game SHOOTING GAME I spend most of the ing game just finding something that shoots thats not a ing shooting game thats just a bad version of dayz increase the ing drop rates dude.....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-30,0,0,39,True,Recommended,Overall pretty great game. The closest game I've played to this would have to be the Culling and this game outshines it. Positives Huge map Interesting concept good servers great early release balanced weapons.Negatives In my first game with all chat on the community players are pretty violent. Although when on my team they are typically much nicer. I'd recommend turning team chat only. Harder game to run. Its also easy to waste 15 minutes getting strong with weapons and armor just to be running to a play area and immediatly get shot dead from far. Like a huge build up to an uncounterable death. 8.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-08,0,0,338,True,Recommended,I have been playing this game for a while now and my specs are GTX 970 8gb 2133mhz ddr4 ram and i5 6600k(not overclocked) and I get above 60 fps at mid settings and very high render distance. So yes the game isn't as well optimized as Battlefield or Call of Duty and so on but it's not a big company that is making the game.On to the Game! It delivers the Battle Royale Experience!!!Pros Different Sized Game modes Proper weapon balances with Assault Rifles Snipers and So on While the map is the same everytime the experience isn't! Some people get tire because all they wanna do is the same strat each time but if you just switch things up and go solo during squads or just drive around trying to run down players and try challenges just for fun you will experience more of what the game has to offfer! Gun play might be a hit or miss to some depending on your preference of 1st or 3rd person (there are servers for specific types if you'd prefer playing in just one view). If you like Ghost Recon you will mostlikely enjoy this over the shoulder shooter. Driving mechanics are pretty good! (Except for the 3rd seater motorcycles...they are death traps) Bugs (rarely happen but can be funny as hell sometimes) EARLYACCESS Weapon attachements are meaningful and very useful! Strategies will be important in reaching for a chicken dinner...or NOT just go guns blazing and grab the DINNER by force! While it's one map it is well designed and gives you plenty of ways to start of your Battle Royale game (I love Zharki) $30 had me a bit worried but now I can say it was worth it to me I count $1 per two hours of play and I have surpased that! (REMEMBER you can always refund it ) So don't be shy!)Cons Needs much more optimization Bugs (rarely happen but can suck sometimes) EARLYACCESS One map (they're is a new one coming but they have not said when) Updates have slowed down a bit (we're still waiting on vaulting which was announce about 2 or more months agoVerdict 7/10 GameYes your specs will impact your gameplay but for an EARLYACCESS 100 player battle arena! Grab a group of friends or get on a teamchat of random people and get to know a new squad or solo the crap out of this game if you're looking for a battleroyale to sink your gaming teeth in then I suggest you give Player Unknown's Battlegrounds a try!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,388,True,Not Recommended,This game is a hell lot of fun. It's all about survival and in co op about teamplay. You need tactics and aim otherwise you won't make it to the top. I could tell a lot more about the game and how fun it is to play BUT they are making the same mistake as a lot of mini developers do. First they gonna break their promise to not add any microtransaction to the game before it's out of alpha. They are gonna implement it as a 'test' for now but that's how greed starts. Well I would have no problem with the grates beeing sold as well for real money IF they still could be aquired via incame money like the overwatch system. But no it has to be the CS GO system. Maximum greed. You can't be sure if you get a duplicate. It could be that you have to spend 50$ for an outfit to get it all together. That's sad.This game started out so well. Good weekly updates a lot of communication and an open ear to the community. I hope the last point hasn't changed and they will review the steps they are gonna take. Until then I will not recommend buying this game and give them any money. Greed shall be punished.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-21,0,0,718,True,Recommended,I can't say enough about this game. The development team is killing it. This is probably the first time in a long time that I have felt comfortable with my early access purchase. If you are on the fence about PUBG and you're not sure about the hype just stop now and make a purchase. You will not regret it.The combat maintains a great level of realism while also allowing for some arcadey action bleed through. The constant updates from Bluehole are absolutely phenomenal and I love how they are continously improving the gameplay experience and stability. This game has single handedly saved Early Access as a platform. It is a game that all development teams should emulate if they plan to go down this route. Games like DayZ and Miscreated should be on their knees thanking PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds. Without them the EA platfrom surely wouldn't last another year.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,470,True,Recommended,Get it just don't expect the world from an EA survival shooter. Currently only solo/duo and squad with no other game modes and your rewards are chests you unlock by obtaining points. The amount of which is determined by kills/rank. Top 10s usually get you 500 and wins over 1000 points if you are active in the game. Hit detection(possibly lag) is an issue and stability of the game servers are average at best currently. Optimization could use work but not so bad where you are losing serious fps. If everything is going smoothly easily one of the best survival shooter/battleground games out. Personally have had some really fun melee fights and some intesnse gun fight. Gunplay reminds me a lot of Socom 2/3.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But this game is gold when played with friends.....Ups 1. FUN2. Challenging3. Its gameplay is just good.(im hoping more survival elements will come up)4. Looks really great(graphicaly)5. Matching is really freaking fast.6. Got dedicated servers( pretty much you can play in any continent) BUT there are flaws in the network too sadlyFlaws are 1. Sound Bug( this is the most annoying for me i guess because the sound gets scatter when many people are shooting it sounds crappy and broken)2. Not yet optimized in my opinion. i guess its 65% optimized?3. Minor network problems like sometimes delay and rubber baanding at time. BUT its tollerable unlike in For Honor(i havnt experience getting disconnected too)4. Loading times of assets is alittle poor. (Optimization)5. Some bugs here and there from time to timei recommend it even though i see some problems. but i can understan why there are still some bugs because it is in the early access. It is a must have now if you have the money and not that sensitive in some problems. This game is not perfect but it sure is fun.Recommendation to the game( Must see updates)1. Make the network connectivity great( the first one to be addressed)2. Heavy Optimization is needed ( my pc is a Med High rig in games like Ark overwatch etc... but im running it on low and med on some settings only)3. FIX BUGS there are a handful at the momment. ( sometimes textures load significantly long)4. Loading times are hmmm ok..5 More survival element diversity of things on the map6. Polish gameplay7. i know zobies are comming soon. hahaha. I just want to mention it8. Better Title screen/ UI (its a little unresponsive)That is all I hope this help. I bought it out of sheer urge to play it. could no wait for a sale. hahaha.

2017-10-12,0,0,1446,True,Not Recommended,The game has been accessable for gamers during several monthes by now and Bluehole barely bother to update the game at all despite they have sold several millions copies. Many streamers have more and more started to play Fortnite Battle Royale in pure frustration because of that.Before you buy it wait until you hear more possitive things about the game like they fix the frustrating bugs.1. The company Bluehole looks to never fix bugs which frustrates many players and streamers.2. You need to spam the pickup button just in case the game didn't notice you pressed the button in the first case. This alone is a frustrating bug.3. Armor bug when will it be fixed!!!! Never???? There is a armor bug in this game where bullet completely ignore armor. For example yesterday when I looked at drDisrespect while he was playing he had Level 3 armor both on head and chest. When he got shot by a SCAR L with one bullet on his head you could clearly see that his health dropped by 45% from one bullet and his armor wasn't damaged at all. That mean his armor didn't count at all. Level 3 armor is supposed to reduce damage by 55%. So his health went from 100% to 0 within 2 seconds when he had the best armor in the game. This bug have existed for several monthes by now and they never looks to fix this bug. You can see this bug in every other game or so.3. Also jumping out from window feels like a random thing if you will succeed or not. Even the best players on twitch fails to jump out from windows every other try. Even if you clearly press jump and crouch at the same time you don't jump out. This is also a frustrating bug.4. Sometimes when you try to shoot with the weapon it doesn't fire at all often in close quarter combat. Don't know if that's because the game lags so I am already dead when I start to shoot who knows...5. Lag and framerate. Lags like hell from time to time. Could be much better. Compare this game with Fortnite which works like an oiled machine.6. Desync fix it please. This bug happens really often.I wished this game was like Fortnite Battle Royale which doesn't have any of these frustrating bugs. It's hardly any bugs there at all. It's fully optimized already in alpha/beta.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I commenly find myself reaching for a note book and pen to draw out car locations gun location (obviously not for killing )) to help me memorize the great possibliies that game alows you to have. You definitely do not need a good pc for this game i ran it on my 1995 windows 1998 pc where it ran out 2 fps on ultra settings. Compared to Minecraft and Roblox this game is like a babyies game the graphics are very neutral in which you definitely do not see communist propganda and Donald Trump. 10/9 ign would definitely recommend.

In a game where you need to survive by blending in and staying hidden paid cosmetics matter. If there's clothing that really mimics the colors of trees and buildings and this clothing can only be found in crates that's pay to win and that affects the entire playerbase by putting those that pay at an advantage.I used to like this game a lot.

Jump out of the plane arrive on one of the building s roof a glitch happened then I slipped fell down to the ground. I ran inside seconds later I died from falling.2. Jump out landed on a wrecked car stuck there for minutes until someone saw me and I bet he laughed then he killed me.3. Jump out there were no buildings but I saw items floating tried to get one of two then suddenly building shows up I stuck in a wall then dead from falling.4. Manage to the TOP 3 I was laying down on rice fields suddenly I sneezed and accidentally stood up d#mn they shot me dead.5. Jump out the server got lag and all the buildings look like a melted chocolate wait for 4 minutes then rushed to go inside a building. I got a pan then there s a guy with a shotgun so do the math.6. Developer updated the game yeay I got to ride a bike go to maximum speed and there s a small bump ahead I and bike do stunt together I landed with my head along its level 3 helmet dead from falling oh come on!7. Ride a bike another bump ahead and I slowed it down success for not doing a stunt. Suddenly there s a car landed on my head from behind. Another unpredicted death. Come On!Yesterday I experienced that I could see the map much more clear than ever before. No melted buildings or stuck on a roof anymore. The developer really did their homework day by day.There are plenty of updates going on and still I came back and look forward another stupid careless deaths in this game.

YES ITS EARLY ACCESS YOU NOOB Is optimisation progress good though? YES THEY'RE CLEARLY WORKING HARD Are they prioritising new features over optimisation? NOPE THANK GOD!When you have a game that is designed by a big production company a design studio with 40 teams of 40 people each and they're all working to ensure they get their salary on time and their bonuses not naming names *cough* EA *cough* Activision... then you have issues. The game will never be made for the players because it's not made to please a customer it's made to please the wallets of the creators.When you get a game made by a player someone who has spent years of his life playing games. Someone who started out in the business modding existing games gets picked up to assist on a Battle Royale genre title and then leaves to pursue his own goal of making the best game he can with the skills he has learnt. THAT is when you get a good game... usually I've not forgotton your treacherous Dean ""cash thief"" Hall...My point remains though Battlegrounds is a game for the players currently it's a little bit casual which is fine 3rd person is a though it rewards lack of skill and incompetency but 1st person only servers will be here in the end of July update so it's all gravy!Last night after a gruelling few hours on PUBG i went downstairs to get a drink as I walked into the kitchen I saw a frying pan on the cooker and for a second I almost picked it up and tucked it into the back of my trousers like I was going to crough run for cover behind the fridge!!!!The game gets in your head every time I die the first thing in my head is.... well honestly the first thing in my head is ""F**K YOU 3RD PERSON GOD DAMMIT HE WAS THERE THE WHOLE FU**ING TIME WATCHING ME WITH HIS T ANGLE!!!!"" but the second thing in my head is always ""what did I do wrong why did I die how could I not die there next time?""THAT is how you make a good game the game should be predicated on getting better through improvement there's no pay to win there is no easy mode there is no deranking to play with noobs you can't smurf... you just have to get better tweak settings to get a higher fps go for sensible drop zones play the circle find the dips and crevasses and defelades to give you the best position to win a fire fight good comms in team play. A good game is one where you get better with practice and PUBG smashes that category!BUY IT ENJOY IT AND HOPEFULLY ONE DAY WE WILL HAVE AN EPIC FIREFIGHT IN THE TIGHT WINDING ALLEYWAYS OF PRIMORSK OR THE TALL SPRAWLING APARTMENT BLOCKS OF YASNOYA!

2017-06-13,0,0,73,True,Recommended,Review written after 20 hours with the game over a week and a half This game has me absolutely addicted the tension of always being on guard from an unseen attacker gives this game a simlar feel to other battle royal/permadeth games (e.g. the culling DayZ). However this is probably the most polished and rewarding battle royal type game i've played. Games are relatively quick but extremely intense. I've read a lot of complaints about the game performing badly on people's computers i personally haven't had an issue (3rd gen i7 with a GTX 970 so nothing extrodinarily new or fancy).Things that I feel need worked on Movement getting over walls and climbing onto things is terribly inconsistent bordering on frustrating. (note this is supposedly getting fixed with new movement mechanics in an upcoming patch)Vehicle physics They are wonky...all there is to say really.Post game game takes forever to load up the main menu again I'd recommend this game only for people who REALLY love realistic shooters or survival games. There is a lot of 'nothing' happening a lot of the time and it takes a certain type of person to be okay with that. (Patience is everything),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-13,0,0,244,True,Recommended,only got it cause my friends kept telling me to get it but now im enjoying it. worth it,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-13,0,0,49,True,Recommended,A game that's well worth the hype despite the early access stage it's incredibly playable and fun. The optimization needs a lot of work (i'd advise turning everything except shadows view distance and textures to lowest since everything other than that seems to cause massive stuttering when combat is initiated) and the physics are quite buggy but the amount of replayability and fun here far exceeds what most early access games have ever offered. If you have a potato PC then I'd strongly recommend avoiding this until the FPS issues are sorted out (currently a #1 priority of the devs) but if you have a decent PC and don't mind possibly having to play with oatmeal quality visuals then prepare to enjoy one of the most entertaining and addicting multiplayer games of the year.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-13,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Need some serious optimisation . i have a medium configuration and the game dosn't want to even load the map . BTW my computer runs Shadow warrior 2 and Outlast 2 in ultra settings. early access is really becoming some serious t early access means that the game is not totally finish and needs feedback it does'nt mean that the game is 20 purcent finished.

Yet they were able to accumulate more hours in this game in a single month than Jenna Marbles was able to accumulate the number of guys fapping to her channel. Take a look at this reviewer compLeX who has 243.4 hours in the game and starts ranting about how he is disabled and the game caused his autism to magnify. He then goes on to try and manipulate the player base by stating some damn mendela effect that he knows the AK was never burst fire but now it is and starts blaming some multiple universe melding with our own like.. What is this Thor 2? In conclusion The game is good and if you ever wanted a murder simulator mixed with a type of Hunger games scenario try the game out.

2017-07-09,0,0,148,True,Recommended,I will start this by saying that this is probably the best battle royal esc game that money can buy right now on steam. Although you need to stay warned that it is still in Early Access and there can be bugs and such. It's a great and modern battle royal game with customization of weapons vehicles and a large map to travel around. This game runs great on my PC aswell on high settings for only having a GTX 960. If you liked H1Z1 but want a modern version with more to offer buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-06,0,0,160,True,Recommended,WTF! this game had 5k+ positive reviews in the first 2 days of its release. based on my experiance with the game it is so much better then h1z1 as of right now. are there a few bugs yes. but they are highly minor issues at best. optimization is needed but past all that the game play is solid. especialy for a game thats only been out a couple weeks in early access. when u first play go ahead and tweek your graphics settings till u get the desired fps because of the optimization you will want to do that. if you like pvp in survival and you like h1z1 king of the kill do not hesitate to buy this game and uninstal your h1z1.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-04,0,0,517,True,Recommended,"Like H1z1 but better in almost every way. This game already has tons of content relatively balanced combat and a much improved squad mode compared to other ""battle royale"" games.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-09,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Works almost perfectly (EU servers) which is a huge ing surprise for an Early Access title. Slight lag at the start when you have a 100 players running around but it stabelises once you get to about 80 70 people which happens within the first two minutes of the game.Haven't had a single crash/log in faliour yet.The gunplay is pretty solid and reminds me of ARMA 2 Insurgency and the like. Main complaint with it so far is that the shotfuns are useless for some reason. An AKM shot should not be a 100x stronger than 2 3 shotgun hits at close range.The gun tuning is pretty neat tons of gun mods are avalible and you can build something trully unique if you get lucky.The loot is pretty well spread so unlike DayZ you wont end up running around 30 houses until you find an axe no every building has at least something thankfully.The map itself is pretty nice with lots of destinct landmarks and what not though I do hope they add more maps with different biomes. Could be fun fighting in a snow map or in a jungle.TL DR The game is laggy for the first 5 minutes when the match starts but other than that I can't really fault it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-04,0,0,751,True,Recommended,Love this game. Even though it is causing a slight form of PTSD. Lol. Only thing I wish the game offered was more items in the boxes or more points from games to get more boxes. Can't be a good killer with no sweg. &lt 3,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I was NOT expecting to enjoy it or even like it a little bit for that matter being a FPS and MOBA player who really doesn't like 3PS's that much (never played Arma either) but I was pleasantly surprised. Very fun very intense game. Hope the devs don't give up on it... &lt /3 Definitely get this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-04,0,0,72,True,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds has the potential to be the best Battle Royale game yet.If you want a good blend between Arma and H1Z1 KOTK I'd highly recommend this game. I've played many hours of KOTK and after only a few on this game I can already tell it's going to do great things.Some positive things to note about this game +Core mechanics are already in place and working are usually well.+Looks great on a system that can handle it.+Plenty of weapons and gear.+The gunplay feels very good including all the animations that come with them.+The game sounds especially gunshots sound amazing (might just be personal preference though).+The map size is just about perfect.+The UI for the inverntory is good.+Spectator mode for when playing with teammates. You no longer have to be bored while waiting for your friends to finish the game.Some negative things to note about the game Sometimes FPS will dip quite suddenly. However so far I've found that to be only when I'm around a large number of players. Sometimes it will take multiple tries to pick up an item or open a door. I've experienced slight rubber banding occasionally.All of these negatives may just be issues with the servers that will get fixed in the future or they may be bugs. Either way they don't take away from the game too much. Yes they're issues that need to be addressed but I feel confident that they will be fixed in the future. The game is still an absolute blast to play.8/10 right now. Easily 10/10 when the negatives get fixed.

I've been playing since the game has dropped and literally nothing has changed. Aside from new guns here and there and a new weather map and the release of the game on xbox nothing is new. I mean yes this game is fun and very enjoyable with friends but needs many things. I understand its early access but come on there is more motivation to get this game to be mlg and sue other companies for there idea being stolen than to improve the performance and add new content. In my opinion i am done with PUBG until Mr. Greene finally steps up and starts dropping some content for God's sake.

2017-09-28,0,0,120,False,Recommended,Update 01/08/2019It is fun. Slower paced than Black ops 4 and Fortnite. Doesn't feel as fluid as them but that doesn't necessarily detract from the game. Just a different feel you need to get used to. Needs a lot of patience. The guns feel really awesome and are hard to learn for me. I have not run into any cheaters yet. Runs well on my new system Ryzen 5 2600x GTX 1080 Samsung 970 EVO 16 GB RAM. The map variety is really nice. The new snow map has really changed the game for me. I play solo in most online games/shooters. The devs could be a lot better but also a LOT worse. I'm probably naive to the more detailed criticisms but that's how I generally am with games. I have a lot of fun playing this so I am recommending it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-07,0,0,114,True,Recommended,Player Unknown s Battlegrounds is a thoroughly enjoyable battle royale game that pits you against 99 other players in an 8KM by 8KM map. You can also play Duo s which you and a friend can team up against 48 others or team battles with 4 of you. I was a bit pessimistic when I was thinking about purchasing this game. I saw a couple of my friends had bought it but I wasn t sure. I ended up getting it anyway after watching some YouTube gameplays and i'm glad I did!. The aim of the game is to stay alive until you are the last man (or woman) standing. You loot shoot and get off your head on redbull and pills as the game makes the map considerably smaller and smaller forcing players closer and closer to each other. I can honestly say that in all my time playing multiplayer games I have never experienced a game quite like this. After reading reviews for the H1Z1 version I gave it a miss so this was my first go at a Battle Royale game. The stress of hearing someone open the front door while you re training your sights on the top of the stairs. Hearing the other player search the house. Room. By. Room. Eventually he begins to climb the stairs. *shuffle* *shuffle* *BANG* *BANG* *BANG*. He collapses. You change your trousers after shi*ting yourself and take a deep breath. You loot his corpse and decide it s time to clear off someone surly heard those gunshots. As you open the front door to leave *BOOM*. Some tos*er was waiting for you with a shotgun. (Yes this was a real scenario I experienced). Every game is different and equally enjoyable. Although to this day I still haven t won a game I can t help but play it. I really hope the Devs stick with it and don t abandon it. It is definitely GOTY material. There are however some issues. As the game is in early access it is a bit unstable. Lag isn t frequent but it s there. Rubber banding when it happens is really annoying. And crashes. Let me tell you there is nothing more annoying than being in the top 10 left alive and the server kicks you because of a crash. If you aren t running a high end rig I would avoid this at the moment until it s a bit more stable (something the Devs said they re working on) but definitely keep your eye on this gem.TL DR Fantastic game with a brilliant atmosphere of tension and stress let down only by the fact that it s a wee babby at the moment and just needs a bit of polish. Keep up the good work Bluehole!TribalHARRY.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-25,5,35,555,False,Recommended,Even after all the backlash that this game has gotten and rightfully so the bugs desync and hackers in the game can turn anybody off the game however there is something about this game that keeps getting me back the core mechanics of the game is what makes it one of the best battle royals on the market right now. Having played the main battle royals (Fortnite Blackout) and other indie BR games I can safely say that this is the best due to many reasons the gunplay the gunplay is one the best if not the best of all battle royals and in general the satisfaction of killing someone from 400 meters out with a kar98k or gunning down a squad with your ump will never get old. Secondly the maps sanhok is where you will find the most fun and quick action with erangel being a close second I am not a fan of mirmar however there are others who enjoy the slow pace of the map. I thoroughly enjoy each of the map s aesthetics with their own iconic landmarks and their own guns and vehicles so this is why I believe this gives a heads up to PUBG especially when other games only give you one map the more the better right?Finally why I believe this is the best battle royale shooter is due to the skill gap you will not become shroud overnight heck you would not become shroud with over 1000 hours of gameplay the learning curve in this game is great the satisfaction you get when you finally aim right and hit the guy in the head after all the misses in previous games will never be topped.So in conclusion I will not recommend this game currently if you are planning to buy just because even after a whole year of going out of beta there are still major problems with the game which I have previously stated and which should have been fixed by now the smoothness and support of the other major BR's just blow this out the water and I would recommend blackout and fortnite before this they both have their ups and downs however from a personal standpoint this game has given me a great time especially with friends (and has given me money too!) and I cannot say I feel the same way about other games in the battle royale genre.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-24,7,96,48,True,Recommended,"Player Unknown's Battlegrounds has been blowing up lately. Breaking records on steam while still being in Early Access.Now let's start with the core gameplay of PUBG. You drop out of a plane on a large island with 99 other people. While looting the island and all its buildings you'll be forced to stay within a certain area called the Player Zone. The Player Zone get's smaller and smaller during the game. Since loot is spawned randomly games will have a certain factor of ""luck"". The graphics in PUBG look great if everything is maxed out and the map is 8x8km which is rather big. However unfortunately the map is pretty boring. While roaming the island and looting your way through it you'll come across loads of attachments. These make looting a lot more interesting. Now you have a reason to keep looting once you have a gun armor and some medical supplies. Deciding what place to go next takes a bit of strategical planning would it already be looted? Where will the player zone move to? Do I use the car or do I go walking so they won't hear me? Etc.Player Unknown's Battleground is rather buggy. The game doesn't have the best optimization and has a lot of buys/flaws. You can't climb/vault at all putting your gun to a window and peaking doesn't work great and loads of other small bugs. Now don't get me wrong the game does get updated and new weapons get added from time to time but they honestly should focus on fixing the bugs a bit more.Now why is Player Unknown's Battlegrounds receiving so much negative attention? It's due to a couple of reasons. First of all the bigger your game gets the more people you get that dislike it of course. Second of all the developers broke a couple of promises. They've promised us there would be no micro transactions during Early access yet here they are. They've delayed the vaulting update 3 times now they're calling out and threatening other Battle Royale games for copying PUBG banning people who kill streamers with the reason ""stream sniping"" &amp they're not really fast on fixing updates and bringing out new content. Does this mean Player Unknown's Battleground is a bad game? No. In fact it's a great game and although it's a bit boring if you play solo the game is great and one of the better Battle Royale games out there at the moment. It's a blast with friends and before you know you have been playing for hours. Looting until your loadout is perfect and sneaking up on players is really fun and killing enemy's is satisfying for sure.Overall if you're looking for a good Battle Royale game Player Unknown is a great option. Just be sure you like the slow paced gameplay. If you're not entirely sure if PUBG is something for you I can highly suggest free variants like Fortnite.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-10,0,0,332,True,Recommended,This game is definitely worth the buy. Player Unkown seems to be very vocal with the direction they are taking the game. They have weekly updates. It is a military tactical style shooter. So if you have played Arma/ Dayz/ Squad then this game is definitely for you if you enjoy the Battle Royale concept. It on h1z1 in every aspect in my opinion they are two different games but its hard not to compare them h1 is to arcady with almost nothing to show for in updates over its 3 year span whereas PUBG first 2 weeks seemed to show more promise.Rate this game 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-14,0,0,57,True,Not Recommended,Addictive and fun game BUT.....clearly quite a bit of cheating going on that takes a lot ot the fun out of the game. Players teaming up in solo play for one. Also several times I have gotten the first shot off at close range and hit the other player but they kill me instead ( and they are not wearing body armor). Needs to be optimized more but I can live with that because it is early access. I may take some time away from the game until I see that the cheaters are gone. What kind of loser plays a game like this but cheats and feels any sense of accomplishment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-16,0,0,270,True,Recommended,"Intense PVP every round is different and extremely fun with friends! About me I have never played similar games (Battle royale huge multiplayer etc) or even third person games for that matter and it was a gamble if i would like this game but i said to myself ""whatever i can try it if i don't like it i can refund it"" but after just a few games i fell in love with the game. Personally i love games that can take my adreneline up make my hands shake and so on and this is just that. When all your friends have died and are spectating you watching you fight the last person my hearts starts pumping like it has in no other game. Pros Intense PVP No game is like the other different loot different airplane spawn different safe area spawn and varies between ""oh i'm here solo sweet i can loot in peace"" to &amp quot there is 8 other people at here"" Tons of different weapons and attachments Every car ride is a ing gamble will you just drive calm on the road or run 30m into the air over a mountain with a whole squad beneath you shooting at you The most fun i have had with friends in a long time Neutral The RNG this game has can make you love the game or hate it. Sometimes i go into 4 different buildings and all i find is a pistol with 15 bullets meanwhile my opponent goes into a small shack and finds an AKM and a helmet. Sometimes you might land in the middle of the safe area or across the map from it with no car in sight. Cons Optimization my friend has a medium end rig from 2015 and runs the game on high settings no problem. I'm running it on a high end rig worth 1200 that i built 6 months ago and i can only run it on low settings. Input delay takes a second from where you click your action button to where it does what you want it to do (enter car open door etc) but it's easy to get used to. Shooting 70hrs into the game and i still don't understand the mechanics. Sometimes i can one shot a fully geared guy with a shotgun across an empty field and sometimes i put 8 bullets of an AKM into a guy with nothing and i don't kill him. Bugs and crashes game has crashed 6 times on me and all have been at the most important moments. Sometimes you get stuck in a door or the car you're driving might decide to do a backflip for no reason.Even with the list of cons i still love this game i highly recommend anyone to buy it and atleast try it!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-23,0,0,125,True,Not Recommended,"5/23/17In the current state of the game I can't recommend Player Unknown's Battlegroundsthe 4 tickrate servers are unplayableThe bugs and glitches in this game are overwhelmingHalf of the time when I close the game it won't close and to be able to do anything I have to restart my computerThis is one of the worst optimized games (not as bad as DayZ when it first came out) I have played considering the graphics are not good they are just ok.The servers are awful. Stuttering teleportation and overall unresponsiveness when picking items up or performing any action.Annoying bugs occur all of the timesuch as constant switching weapons without pressing any keysweapons firing as semi auto even when you have it set to full autoblack boxes appearing when ADS with some scopes (namely red dot sight and 2x scope)items on the floor not able to be picked upWhen someone is shooting directly at you it is very very difficult to find which direction the shots are coming from unless they are really far away.Cars can run over you despite you being 6 feet from where the car's pathYou can run yourself with your carCar's collision boxes are messed up sometimes if you drive into other cars or barrels your car will collide many times per second causing massive lag.I finally start doing really well in a game and then get kicked one person before last 10 with the mesage ""Host closed the connection""Compared to H1Z1 everyone is this game is a bullet sponge. H1Z1 takes a lot more skill in my opinion because headshots are crucial in that game. In PUBG Headshots are not prioritized in any 1v1 situation.My friend got stuck in a wall and couldn't move the borders eventually consumed him.When openning the settings menu I get major lag spikes.When you physically run into players you will start teleportingThe falling animation is glitched currentlySometimes you will swim on landBy far the most overpowered item in this game is the supressor becuase for enemies it makes your shots sound like they are coming from whatever direction they please not from where you are shooting.with a uaz I ran into a motorbike which was teleporting all over the place on an x y and z plane. It sent my uaz barell rolling 15 feet in the air.The airplanes will sometimes make no sound including the one you spawn in.This game as a whole is massively broken.If you are a fan of H1Z1 stick with that for now much better for the price of 10$ some places.30$ is a lot of money for a game this broken the only way I would recommend it is if you have friends to play with which makes the game a lot more fun and enjoyable.One redeeming quality of the game is that currently the devs are working really hard on adding new content and fixing bugs.In my personal opinion this is one of the worst early access games to hit steam.7/2/17In this recent update I have been come across some very interesting issues One game I couldn't look up or down despite my character's head moving up and down Another game my camera could turn around but my character couldn't. My character was stuck facing EastThese bugs make the game unplayable and should be addressed immediately8/3/17In the newest monthly update which was supposed to be in July but got post poned The Devs have provided us with the most broken state of the game PUBG has ever been in. FPP Duos is completely broken and unplayable optimization (at least for me) has got a lot worse despite saying they fixed some optimization issues in the patchnotes. In FPP gunshot sounds are very unreliable. The servers currently are as if we were all playing on Walmart Internet from the late 90s. This update until a fix has been complete and utter nonsense.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-17,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,I understand the game is in testing/pre release form. However with a price tag of 26.99 you would expect a much more stable and reliable build. I had to turn my ingame video settings to the bare minimum to make the game playable at all. But then by that point I might as well of been playing tomb raider from the early 2000's. I will happily buy a pre release game and I understand there will be issues with it though this game is way too overpriced at the moment for how broken it feels. I will when it finally is released buy the game again and hope to have a much more positive experience.Thanks,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's sad that there are so many hateful reviews from indivuals who continue to play the game watch PUBG streams and pop a chub over any new content released .. it's incredible what bluehole has accomplished especially with this type of growth. So do me a favor chill out and trust the process. Keep providing feedback and encouraging PUBG Devs that's what motivates companies to continue to innovate and pour love into their work. For a $29 game that you have played 10 times longer than any of the $60+ games in your steam library I think you have already seen a return on investment .. so do me a favor and stfu unless you have constructive feedback.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,446,True,Recommended,This is pretty much the best game you can just play and have an awesome time in. $30 dollars is bang on fair but $/hour is going to be a hell of a lot better than most AAA titles.Everyone is whining they are putting mircrostranctactions into a $30 game for cosmetics only. Which is exactly where the entire gaming has been saying that's fine.Don't worry about your graphics settings everyone plays on low with AA textures and maybe shadows up. So? It doesn't look bad at all. It's actually the best looking battle royale to date which isn't saying it looks like far cry 4 but still.These negative reviews are just backlash for starting to add the mircostranstaction system into it. So? Steam community market the skinsanity it'll be on this game. My questions SOOO? They are just skins and make they game more interesting. Soon we might be able to buy cool skins on the steam market for $1 each. How is that bad?The core gameplay will be unaffected. If they ever give players an avantage for spending money (they won't because they understand the importance of comptetitiveness) I would change my review to negative.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is enough of a variety of guns to be able to suit your needs from close to far. Think of this game as a much better and more balanced H1Z1 KOTK. It does have some frustrations moments tho.

It is fun for the first few hours as you can look past the bugs and RNG based gameplay. But once you get past the 15 hour barrier this game becomes extremely annoying. You will die. A lot. This game is unforgiving and will you over given the chance. The zone 75% of the time goes down to a massive field (Because that is about 50% of the map) where you will be forced to prone in the grass or risk dying instantly. Most of your deaths will be t. I have died numerous times because people come from the blue zone directly behind me. This game is not fun nor is it worth the $30 pricepoint. This game is over hyped to all hell.

Personally I have had fun with the game but the frustration outweighs the fun by far so I wont be playing this much anymore. Tried it and time to call it a day.

People just appear in front of you. The connection is so bad I genially considered thought my pc was broken and my Wi Fi. There is constant lag between picking up items opening doors and getting in vehicles. The buildings just don t load in. Did I mention the bad connection? People just lag everywhere. Don t bother playing duos or quads due to the amount of lag that occurs. Changing the settings does nothing but crash the game. I died from walking into a rock. You can run yourself over. (believe me I struggled the grasp this myself) Hackers.So yeah if you want to waist 25 or $30 or so dollars go ahead! This is perfect.Story time Me and a friend was playing we were in a boat. Both seated in the boat. He ran me over with the very boat I was sitting in. Then I got revived got back in the boat and drowned even though I was sat in a boat surrounded by oxygen.

2017-11-01,0,0,137,True,Recommended,I bought this game by word of mouth. I was told that it is a really fun game. It is in fact a very entertaining and fun game. However if you are someone like me with a mediocre PC set up that has to run the lowest graphics to boost frames then I do not completely recommend this game. BUT if you have a decent set up then I do recommend it. Here is why..Why to buy Competitive creative and most of all exciting. From the moment you leave the plane you are constantly on edge checking corners trees and sound whoring for footsteps. If you like fighting to survive this game is for you. Why not to buy You'll hardly win. Semi Hard to learn. Most streamers with good set ups will dominate the field in gun skill aiming and spotting you halfway across an open field simply because their graphics and frame rates are better. This game keeps me coming back for a few reasons My friends play I want to be better and I like RP Survival even if my whole squad is try hard kill zoning.

Well when this game was first annouced on steam me and my group of friends straight away bought this game and it was a load of fun. Srsly no joke. back then i had a computer and was mostly sad to say that i couldnt play the game for long cause my computer would overheat. And after some time upgrading my pc i notice. Holy its not my pc its this freaking game. Loading into game hearing tons of footstps and the plane flying but just the loading menu there for 5 to 10 minutes.. lagging all the way to kingdom come even though my pc is actually good better then before i might say. Not only me but my friends too sudden DC and crash game Bullets dont register move back into cover and somehow the enemy still hits u in the head cause the servers are amazing hackers to ruin the game but yet my buddies and I still play this game cause we enjoy it. Our luck in this game is not so good we get s*** starts and things dont load plus we dont really win most of the time but we still ave fun. Now that the latest updates FIX PUBG and all have come... wow its still the same. i think ive unistall and reinstall Pubg like 6 times already but i still get crashes randomly s*** fps in game somehow parachutes?? dont start with that still lag in the air. Fix your godamn game holy sh** i know you guys have so much money and this is such a good game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-30,7,76,593,False,Recommended,Not since Battlefield 2 have I been addicted to a game more. My brother urged me to buy this back in June I was afraid I could not run it as I was only running an older laptop at the time with a GTX 460M. I tested it out with his steam account &amp was able to play it 20 25 fps. But it was enough to get me hooked. In Early access it was poorly optimized. So much so (And this isn't really a good thing) I ended up building a budget desktop just to play this game. Its become a nightly ritual. Play a few games. And if we do not I end up dreaming about it. Long story short I ended up upgrading again (from 750TI to 1050TI) Now I'm getting 60 75 FPS And to me the game is completely playable and even more enjoyable. I do recommend this game to everyone I talk to wither you want to play solo or in teams its a great laugh. And this is the ONLY game I have ever been able to watch others stream. Very watchable.

2017-12-21,2,11,30,False,Not Recommended,Early Game. Run loot something to get a gun and try not to get shot while lagging and rubberbanding around. I dont know how even looking around can feel so crappy but it does. When you get a kill it feels good. Mid Game. Realize you need to book it to the next circle and spend the next 15 mins running for a car while looking over your shoulder trying not to get spotted. Late Game. No you got shot in the back. Or you are able to land what seems like it should be enough bullets to kill someone only to realize they picked up lvl 3 gear and have turned into a sponge. Meanwhile your lvl 1 vest might as well be soaked in kerosene.Its fun at times the test server had significantly better performance but it still feels weird. Again looking around just doesnt feel right. Now I haven't played since the 1.0 patch ... release? But I dont have much hope. The game has very fun moments especially when you are with a few buddies and it delivers some awesome unscripted moments. Although all of that is overshaddowed by a really underwhellming experiance and I honestly dont understand why it is loved so much. Great idea better left to other devs.Also Im running a FX 8350 with a 1070 FTW I know Im at a disadvantage with my AMD chip but damn. Going from 90fps to as low as 15 (On the test server) is a annoying to say the least. Facing one way away from the city I have a great experiance Then turn around and its a powerpoint. This makes for some rather frustrating gunfights trying to figure out if thats recoil rubberbanding lag netcode crap fps.Update. The performance issues I talked about have been significantly improved. It no longer feels like you are lugging around sand bags trying to spin around. It's not perfect but the devs are making leaps and bounds in the relm of improvements. Still with that said and the fun moments it gives I still don't find enough enjoyment in it. I know I am a minority here and the game is wildly successful but it's just not for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes there are some issues but they don't show themselves very often and anti cheat is getting better.If you have a lot of friends to play with this game is an absolute blast. I for one don't play Solos very often but you can definitely have some tense incredible moments happen in that gamemode. You can play seriously in Duos or Squads or you can just kick back relax and frag out with your friends. Desync has been a rising issue some days it's fine other days it's borderline unbearable but when you're having those incredibly satisfying Kar98 headshots or getting a double kill with a frag you'll forget all about it.There's no reason this game should be mixed on Steam.

2018-06-22,2,8,989,False,Recommended,PUBG is the ultimate competitive Battle Royale game.Nothing comes close to it's realism it's intensity it's competitiveness it's versatility or it's satisfaction in the genre. There aren't many better feelings than a Chicken Dinner when it comes to competitive gaming and all this is the reason why a paid game shocked and dominated the gaming world even overcoming F2P giants like Dota and LoL to become one of the most played games of all time. You'd be daft to think it was all just hype. Now I just want to take a moment to address the entitled toxic circlejerk that is currently tanking this incredible game's review rating. Firstly Hackers. Personally I have experienced maybe 5 definite hackers in my 625 hours of playtime yet I find a lot of people screaming 'ANOTHER CHINESE HACKER WTF BLUEHOLE' almost everytime someone hits a nutty shot or outplays someone whether that be streamers twitch chat or friends. It's to the point where it's such an easy copout for a lot of people instead of just accepting that someone is better than you because of how stigmatised it is. Not saying that hackers don't exist they exist in every competitive game just that myself and everyone I know have not experienced nor seen much of it if at all in the past 200 hours during my total play and view time. While there is also an active update system to counteract new hacks pretty much every single day. Secondly Optimisation. Just to preface PUBG is one of the boldest undertakings in gaming right now 100 people in one 16x16 (or now 4x4) map complex looting system with hundreds of items weapons and throwables with hundreds of loadout combinations multiple different destructible vehicles and structures and an infinite number of gameplay scenarios that can playout. All of this packaged into a game that offers two different playmodes (TPP and FPP) and has multiple queues and maps. This is not an easy game to 'optimise'. To cover my bases Fortnite has roughly 8 years of development and could run on a Macbook please stop comparing the two they are different games. Personally my game runs like an absolute dream and my computer is not some unreachable titan of a thing and I have friends who have much lower end specs than mine and say the same. Yes sometimes I have clipped on things and die because of it but it's far from regular and every single day and every single patch things are being improved. So to literally abuse the developers on EVERY social media outlet on EVERY new update is a gross underappreciation for the work this game requires and just goes to show how little these people actually read of patch notes or the development roadmap PUBG have set out. For example Patch Note #15 releases with a MASSIVE list of performance gameplay and stability improvements and all these people can scream about is 'lol copying Fortnites battlepass lol money hungry fix the game first' completely missing the fact that the team that does the games OPTIONAL cosmetics is completely separate from the team that is regularly improving the game. These are the same people that fill every PUBG related comments section with 'suing Fortnite for stealing the Battle Royale genre because you're jealous and your game is dying' and other much less coherent rants because they can't read more than the clickbait headlines regarding the case because they are the lowest common denominator such headlines are made for. Protip they are not suing out of jealousy they are suing because they have a solid case for Epic literally stealing game game resources when they were working together. I personally don't give a if it goes through or not but misinformation helps nobody. Just a quick list of improvements I want to see and will be on the developers backs about so I don't get labelled too much of a PUBG fanboy Perfect optimisation Rewarding ranked and progression system Decent map and gamemode selection Remove TPP the game is best experienced in FPP and the split playerbase just makes everything even harder More support for the esports sceneAnyway with the game being the best it's ever been by a huge margin with a brand new map and brand new content with a keen esports scene thats finally getting the official support it deserves with the toxic part of the community loudly announcing their departure from the game AND with the game being on special for the first time ever now is the perfect time to play!

2018-06-20,1,6,30,False,Not Recommended,the game can be fun however considering the devs tried to sue epic games over the concept of a royale game and even used the frying pan as a argument you can see what kind of mind set the develepors have. now i know my meazle 27 hours arent impresive but if you get 40 fps on a game that looks like it was made in 2008 then you can see how the gameplay becomes frustrating and boring. For those who like to put up with the cons of pupg (examples as Poor hitreg server lag poor performance low quality textures and plenty of bugs that can kill you for no apparent reason) then i fully reccomend it. If you can enjoy your time then go for it however if you don't then idd much more reccomend other br royale games such as cuisine royale or realm royale or even fortnite if you like the style.If the devs listened to the community more and stop have this childish mindset then perhaps this could be a much mor eimprooved game.Side note This review is not only from my personal experience of this game but a combination of research and experience of friends and family.I hope you all have a good day.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Literally can't believe how popular this heaping pile is. At first glance I would think this to be a bad port from some console game. Not to mention servers completely crap out half the time mid game it will close the game out for everyone saying disconnected from host while being unstable half the time. Wish i could say it was my internet but no its not. Game has so much potential wasted on poor optimization and poor server quality. Fix those game will be great.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But holy moly theres just too many to call this a working game.A first person/3rd person shooter with the absolute shiiiiiidddiest sound support ever to be available? I just dont get it I suppose. Id rather have a shiiidddddy music playlist than listen to the studder of all the sounds failing to sound? The game is still enjoyable to an extent. However a gun shot should probably sound like a gunshot. A person walking should probably sound like a person walking. A drivable vehicle driving full speed should be noticable but its not always the case. Every great shooter available relies heavily on sound. And this game has the most broken sound mechanics half available in all my experience of shooters. If i had known they couldn't even get the sound to work properly Id have not bought it.Right now if more than 4 people are in the same area it sounds like you're going to be trampled by 1 000 000 ladies in high heels. This is not an exageration. Its just everywhere. low quality studder stepping of a million ladies about to trample you. This is the game play. You hear nothing but the following the occassional plane the area bombings the studder steps and if you are lucky enough to be alone in an area the gunshots 500+ meters away that aren't all that threatening at that time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No one tiptoes side to side when aiming down sight JUST MOVE. Why do you slide forward when you stop running? I feel like i'm running on ice skates when I play this game.

2017-08-04,1,6,168,True,Not Recommended,"where to begin with this game when i first got it it was pretty awesome had a good time playing and fighting. your first experinece the first 30 hours or so will be pretty awesome and fun to you after that time has passed is when the problems with the game begin to show its true colors. lets start with the basics1) optimization if you are below a 1060 ti graphics cards get ready for lag and playdough buildings when you first start the game you will come falling from an AC130 and everything will seem fine until you get closer to the ground and see the map has not rendered completely yet after it does (2 minutes or less) there is a 30% chance you died during the lag fest because someone was not lagging and manage to kill you while you couldnt move or tell where you were in the first place. hitting tab as you get close to the ground with help manage this and allow you to move after lagging hard for 30 seconds. the game is the problem not the computer. i am able to run wolfenstein the old blood and many other games that are good in graphics just fine but this game i cant render buildings fast at all for some reason?2) RNG RNG plays a huge factor in this game you got level 3 armor and helmet and a nice AK and M16 and start your way to the zone feeling ready to take on the world 20 players left and the circle is so small its scary and then it hits you....the blue circle that damages and kills you for being out of it moves faster than you can run people are camping the trees and rocks and shooting you AS you run from said circle closing in and why is that? because the safe zone spawned on the other side away from you and made you run in order to not die from being outside the play zone but thats not all...if you run so early then you die from players that got lucky from the RNG and are in the circle without having to move players who are running next to you from a distance who thought the same and just happen to see you with their 3rd person perspective without even turning their body to face your direction and a car is following behind you because they made it inside just now and also ran you over because you were in the way and unable to notice in time or cant do anything about it. this game is beyond luck based all because if you are decked out good and RNG is not in your favor than you die from someone or the barrier or a combination of both.3) micro transaction the developers had stated in the past that they will never be implementing micro transaction into the game they lied and did anyway in the latest update. broken promises this early leave a bad taste because now i assume they will do it again soon or later with something more important. its kinda like applying for a job that says 15 dollars an hour and you go into the interview and suddenly its 12 dollars an hour...not that big a deal but the problem is that its just the tip of the ice berg what happens in a few months if they break another promise but much bigger because they assume you wont care? i understand why they are using micro transaction its to fund a tournament but then again a game based around luck wanting to put a tournament together? that sounds kinda dumb but i wont judge also by the math i did i got this 25 dollars an hour + 80 hours in 2 weeks 2 000 dollars * 53 106 000 lets say at most their dev team consist of 25 people 106 000 * 25 2 650 000$ in paid labor for the game in a year sooooo no that whole ""fund the tournament"" they can provide if they wanted 1 000 000$ to first place and 500 000 to second and so on and so forth so to anyone that feels these crates were needed to fund the tournament they are not needed.4) the community check the comments of this review i can promise you will see people who will complain stating im wrong or not playing ""right"" im sorry that i dont camp houses every single game all the way until the blue wall is on me and making me run across open field to some snipers who waited and want me dead now its not my fault the devs decided to make the barrier near impossible to outrun unless your on the other side where its a shorter distance so it goes a lot slower. many of the die hard fans will defend tooth and nail this game for some reason because to them the devs did nothing wrong when actually they lied did not optimize the game correctly banned someone for stream sniping when there is no proof said person actually did. a huge issue with the community fan boys is that they will tell anyone who says anything negative that the game is ""fine"" ""git gud"" ""position yourself better"" when actually its not fine you cannot git gud when a game does not have a training mode or anything to help you learn anything and you cannot position yourself better if your outside the white circle at the end of the match because at some point your gonna need to run for it and thats when you die from someone who got lucky to be in the circle or the blue wall of death.skill you can win by doing literally nothing you can hide with just your fist and win if they suck that bad at finding you its a running camper simulator and thats that. if you want to play a game where skill is not required and you can win by being the sneakiest person possible get this game they want to host a tournament and expect people to actually consider that this game takes skill?!?!?! when?!?! after you ran from a blue circle of death or after you stop being hurt by RNG? take your pickconclusion can i recommend this game? at this state it is in and how the base is and how everyone has been acting over the past few days on this game i cannot in good concious recommend this game to anyone unless you like a game where you can win without even touching a gun and have half the community jump down your throat for even talking bad about the game when everything stated is the truth. will update this review if things change for the better or not.EDIT fan base is the most cancerous fan base on any game you complain about even ONE little thing and you are the problem automatically examplegame not optimized amazingly yet ""its your potato PC dude get this and that and it will run sooo much better"" hey fu ck face no one bought this piece of sh it 30$ game and expect to pay another penny just to play it thats not how the world works i get an SSD will benefit all games but the fact that this game actually NEEDS it to run better is just sad it does not even look on par with skyrim on xbox 360 and somehow it needs a better graphics card and SSD? give me break fan boyshit reg is broken or not great GIT GUD SKRUB you just suck dude its not hit reg its fine for me. let me explain this as slow as possible if my aim is on someone who is not far away even if the bullets are not static it should hit still...simple if i shoot and my crosshair i on them or im aiming at them and it goes through them or does nothing its not me its the game was that simple enough?NETWORK LAG DETECTED get better internet that works....if its all games but since its only this crap hole of a game i dont think better internet will fix this issue anytime soon.i dont want to upgrade cant they just optimize this game? your too poor to get a new internet or better computer? get a job you lazy . that is literally the answer i saw in the forums for someone who did not want to upgrade just for this game.if you want this game understand it will you off you wont be able to ask for help an you will suffer lag and render issues beyond all possible reason.the price for this lame piece of sh it game is NOT 30$ its about 120 to 1000 depending if you seriously want to get upgrades to do the job that the devs should have handled by now.edit boycott streamers and this game until bluehole starts unbanning those accused of stream sniping and unban those who got banned for honking horns around streamers. stop giving in to streamers.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Having microtransactions in an unfinished game that promised earlier that no such thing would occur during the early access period isn't a good start for this game. If you're ok with such practises then by all means get it. You don't have to spend any money after buying but the act of breaking promises and the direction this game is heading is not really ethical in my opinion. Even though the money goes to charities and prize pools and what ever you want to justify them with doesn't change the fact that they monetised this baby before it could even stand on its own.The game is riddled with bugs and glitches that can get you banned for encountering if you do not immidiately leave the match.

The gimmick wears off quickly and just leaves you angry.I missed the 2 hour cut off to get a refund so I'm stuck with it and figured I get into it and really try to play it well. Short answer you cannot. The guns don't hit anything even at close ranges but it doesn't really matter. You'll get one shotted from an unknown direction and the 15 minutes you spent gathering items and staying hidden will mean nothing because someone just happened to come up behind you. Skill or weapon quality have no relevance. You will be killed and never see the person who shot you or from which direction.There is no reason to own this game. 0/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

People give Trump for putting his name on Trump tower yet this narrcicistic put it on a game. It's just gonna be the next DayZ Standalone.Update 5/7/2017This game is still ing trash. Just died from around a corner right after landing because the game lags like ing at the beginning of the game. Basically if you land before there's less than 10 people left the gunfight is going to be a complete tossup due to lag and desync. It's seriously so ing pathetic. It baffles me that the game has so many sales. The gaming industry is truly ed if this passes for a good game. 0/10Update 5/17/2017Ahh another end game situation. Crouched in a 50 meter engagement guy strafing left and right quickly can shoot with perfect accuracy basically making any kind of preparation or angle holding ing useless. I'm really glad there isn't a penatly for moving while shooting didn't knoow this was CoD.Update 5/29/2017Classic game. Loot was barren couldn't find any weapon besides a crossbow. Track a player for about a kilometer and trail him to a house on a hill. He is inside watching the back window in third person. I can see his gun pointing through the wall when it then fires through the wall and hits me. On his screen he was exposed to fire and was pointing through the window yet on mine he was in cover. Another day another death from around a corner. It's shameless at this point. Oh but it's okay guys its early access. /sUpdate 6/21/2017End game scenario. Was caught between a fence and a hill with guys dead ahead of me. My only solution was to cut through the holes in the fence and head up hill to a better position. However the fence is textured will holes in it but you can't actually walk through them. It's honestly pathetic. Fences will be 2 feet tall and your autistic player fails to jump over them because he doesn't understand the concept of stepping over versus jumping straight up in the air. It's fine though they're adding another pre surpressed airdrop crate weapon so we can praise them for updates.Update 7/13/2017I was looting a settlement with some friends minding my own business when all of the sudden a message comes up with network lag connected. I could talki to my friends and still use the internet so I'm not sure why the game decided to randomly off. Luckily you cannot move during network lag so I was stuck in place until I inevitably died. 10/10 Nice update definitely fixed the network issues.Update 7/22/2017I simply cannot fathom how much is wrong with the community in this game. They all cry and complain about the TK'ing drama yet it doesn't affect any of them. Furthermore every single player somehow manages to sit in a building and third person peak never actually playing aggressive. The game caters to campers and 3Ppov abusers alike. Do not buy this game.Update 7/24/17I officially give up. This game is such I cannot stand it any longer. The game is a laggy unoptimized piece of and PlayerUnkown should genuinley deserve a slow death for even bringing it into the world.Update 10/8/17I decided to give it another chance and holy Still all of the same problems and whole new ones. The community seems to have changed a great deal. Lots of campers every game sometimes 3 4 people per building in squads. Caters to the worst kind of player with nothing but RNG loot no matter what.

2017-05-28,3,4,210,False,Recommended,Playerunknown s Battlegrounds colloquially known as PUBG (pronounced pub gee) is if nothing else conceptually efficient. 100 players parachute onto an island. The last one alive wins. An unoriginal idea executed in an original fashion That s the merit of Battlegrounds.Battlegrounds is the culmination of years of genre experimentation by designer Brendan Playerunknown Greene. Where contemporaries polish the graphical and technical edges of an established formula through iteration after iteration Greene has been honing the very formula itself. The game is aesthetically bland and prone to technical hiccups but compared to its battle royale inspired predecessors a few Arma mods and H1Z1 Battlegrounds is refreshingly accessible.Newcomers who don t religiously monitor video game trends can grok the beginning middle and end of their first match. Players float onto an island raid vaguely Eastern European towns or dusty ramshackle forts for randomized gear and stay within the confines of an electric blue circle that slowly shrinks the map from miles of open terrain to a single square foot forcing all survivors into the limited safe space.Along the way to the center of the circle the player eliminates the competition or allows it to fight amongst itself. Whether the player is sniping from a distant cliff going house to house with a shotgun or simply hiding in the brush the number of survivors will inevitably tick down as the blue circle pushes them into a spot like a giant trash compactor of conflict.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-16,1,4,38,True,Not Recommended,Before anything else I know and I get the fact that this game is on early access state and I've nothing to say something against of it. It's not on this state like his bad brother that still on early access like 2 years however this is a honest review that trying to make devs aware what's wrong with this game.First of all It's really have a bad performance. I kinda understand why it's bad. Large map with a hundred players and lots of props along with a hella much items is hard to manage for average computer but recommendations that devs made should barely run this game. I've a decent rig that probably runs every latest game titles at least at 60FPS but it feels like on this game rig is coughing and begging me to kill it before it takes too much pain. I've never been more unconfortable while playing other games.Along with bad performance game have big issues like stuttering freezing stucking at loading screens rendering various objects which makes me to see and somehow shoot people from walls black dots while aiming weird camera angles on some situations flickering and some minor issues as well. They should focus on technical issues instead of releasing content like weapons or maps. They are literally makes me downvote for this.The content that this game offers for now only one map with few different variations one gamemode with different team size and different camera angle however every match you'll find yourself on different situation and it's not makes game boring. Different item/vehicle placements random drop points and things like that is an another good side.Graphics have big issues. Lightning never works properly especially if you are inside of buildings. Also while talking about buildings interior is always same. They exactly use same interior on almost every building. Well map is too big I don't expect each interior has different one but at least make some varierty.I don't recommend it because it's make you crazy on this state however it still looks promising and have a large community that keeps game alive even it has only one gamemode along with just one map. You can literally find a game when you press ready. I've never felt like that before. It's really a good side of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's hard to belive but this ""game"" keep getting worse and worse with each update.Just decided to play another game after taking a few weeks break and all of a sudden my FPS is almost halved in places where I would previously reach 120 140 and not only that it keeps jumping up and down which makes it 10 times worse.They also took a very smart decision to remove the map selection simply because they ing suck.At this point people should just let this one die and move on to something better.Update Just tried to play this with some friends after many months. In the first 10 minutes I encountered several bugs. FPS in menu does not cap despite option being on. Friends still shows all freinds offline. Crashed with an error code while trying Training Mode. Crashed 2 times while attempting to play Squads. Reconnected to the match and it worked. Tried 1 more time to play Squads crashed again with a different error uninstalled.Super enjoyable experience it's amazing that this game is still so bad after so much time and countless ""updates &amp fixes"".

2017-08-19,0,0,179,True,Recommended,To PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS or not to PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS that is the question. PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG for short) is an immersive imaginative and down right ingenious survival game and is absolutely worth your time and money. I will now give you my unmatched expert high IQ opinion on why.PUBG overcomes the usual hurdle of boredom that is incestuous within this genre. This is done by the wall mechanic or as I like to call it the Chad Cremator. This wall comes honing in at regular time intervals and the Neaderthalithic Chads are not competent to move from the bathrooms they get stuck in. While they were playing football and chasing girls I was studying the frying pan and eating chicken dinners. This wall mechanic alone makes this game more interesting than anything similar on the market.The downsides are that this game is Chad s flavour of the month. Seriously. All you hear are Chads talking about the most recent sports game (*Sigh*) and Swedish kids shouting Kappa this and Kappa that all over the map while their sisters are swooning over my neckbeard and fashionable fedora. This game is also sub sub sub sub optimized and cannot run on my potato laptop. So I might as well knit my lovely Waifu a new sweater even though she always takes it off (the cheeky minx )).All in all this game is with parting with your hard earned normie salaries if you can run it. Go and show the Chads that the Incel army has arrived.REEEEEEEEE.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-29,0,0,23,True,Not Recommended,"I can't recommend this game (although I've played it a fair amount). There simply isn't enough depth. The core gameplay loop of ""Drop loot move to the circles"" is unfulfilling and certain mechanical flaws mean that the gunplay itself isn't satisfying iron sights are not accurate world objects often have ""surprising"" collision characteristics and damage is very unpredictable. These issues mean that it's almost never a good idea to have a real firefight and combine with the availability of third person abuse to guarantee that the most effective strategy for winning is conflict avoidance.These are combined with an absolutely tone deaf approach to community management unenforceable rules (""stream sniping"" can get you banned) and forthcoming microtransactions.I have hope that first person queues when available will improve the game somewhat.Update The first person queues are better than third person but I still can't recommend the game. The unfortunate fact is that the gameplay just isn't very interesting.

2017-07-19,2,4,1,True,Not Recommended,I only played the game for an hour before getting a refund. The system specs are very understated. My system exceeds the specs but I needed to run the game at half resolution with all graphical features turned down to minimum just to get a playable framerate.For what it's worth I found the game quite dull and frustrating. You're hanging around in the lobby for a couple of minutes then you've got the long dive to the island and then the parachute descent then you frantically hunt around for a weapon and then a better player kills you. Repeat. So you're getting maybe one minute of actual gameplay for every 10 minutes you invest in the game.I'm sure it's fine for the more hardcore gamers who are willing to put hour after hour in to getting good but for casual players like me this game is perhaps a bit too unrewarding. There's simply not a lot of fun to be had unless you're either really good or really lucky.To the developers Good luck with it though. It's a great concept. Hopefully there will be a way to make the game more welcoming to new players or at least to trim down the time between games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Okay so... there is a lot you need to consider before you buy this game...1) You can't build The amount of people i have seen try and land on a tree or try and look at the ground and shoot is stupidly funny. People from Fortnite are all trying this so you will see alot of questioning actions to what players do in this game.2) Sound is key Sound is what keeps you alive. This isn't saying you need a $500 headset just to play the game at a good advantage just turn up your volume and buy a pair of headphones they will help alot.3) You need to aim and control your recoil Aiming in this game is key to surviving atleast for another 15 seconds make sure you can tell where your enemy is coming from and if you are standing in a good position.4) This game is demanding You will have fps drops in this game don't run it if you can't get good fps. It will be your downfall and why you'll die don't play this on a potato.5) The game is full of bugs You will walk through untextured buildings cars will fly in the air at the height of the plane drop and you will be forced to abandon a house with that ammo you need because yoou can't open the door.Overall the game needs work.

The Gamescom Invitational Crate first has to be bought with in game BP then you can optionally hold the crate in your inventory or it can be opened with a key which you can buy for $2.50 each.For the team at Bluehole the Korean studio responsible for Battlegrounds the decision to offer microtransactions is simply a part of the early access process.

2017-08-05,2,3,280,True,Recommended,I have been waiting for this title for a long time and I am fully delighted that I can play this genre without any problems. The game works great for me (GTX 1070 / 8GB ram / i5 6600k)PUBG is a game based on the same type of game as the H1Z1 is Battle Royal and it's not that complicated...We load into the start island where we wait for the players.After 1 min the game starts flying with the plane whose direction of flight is random.We decide where we want to land and when we want to jump out.After the flight from the plane we control our character we can open the parachute when we want to immediately after the jump / mid / at the end.So now the pros and cons (the probability of skipping the details included) (+++) The ability to decide where we want to land Large variety of weapons (Like for Battle Royal) Attachments 6 types of medications (Med Kit / First Aid Kit / Bandages / Syringe / Painkillers / Energy Drink Compatibility of weapons accessories 6 vehicle types (Uaz Open / Uaz Close / Buggy / Dacia / Bike 2 seats / Bike 3 Seats Large mapI THINK THAT'S ALL ( ) In some places there are drops of FPS Problems with jumping some objects (until they do not add vaulting)The rest of the negative I will add as I will reforgot,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-08,1,3,251,True,Not Recommended,This game was a gigantic amount of fun for the time I played it. Random bugs and questionable gameplay was part of the fun to be honest. My negative review comes from the downward spiral that this game is becoming. PUBG is now to the point where success has blinded them from their audience and jokes on us they already have our money. I've dealt with random glitches and crashes that have prevented me from playing for well over 2 weeks and I have been unable to fix through steam or bluehole website support. Telling me to reinstall my game after I've listed exactly what i've done to try and fix my problem is an absolute joke and they should be ashamed of the customer service they are exhibiting this far into the games production. Literally unable to play because of a crash on startup and since I cannot be helped by the game makers themselves I do not recommend.

2018-03-09,0,0,417,False,Recommended,TL DR worth it in it's current state and it is significantly better than when it was in early access. Don't let the negative reviews tarnish your image of the game.It's come a long way but it has a lot of improvements to be made before it really shapes up into a well polished game. Simply put it's A LOT of fun when it works without issues and you manage to play a full round without running into a hacker. It's getting to that point where most games are like that but the occasional hacker and server issue/bug will pop up and it makes your 1 30 minute game very frustrating. There are constant updates with new content and improvements so be patient. I bought this game at full price and even if half my hours (215 at the time of writing the review) were enjoyable and the other half were not fun I still got my money's worth for 30 bucks (like 30 cents an hour). Honestly PUBG was the first battle royale game I played (couldn't get into H1Z1 when it was big) and I can't play any others. The quality of the game is just way better than the others even Fortnite (which is free but it's just like... not fun and cartoony).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-06,0,0,11,True,Not Recommended,Okay first. I like the game idea it's neat. But that's about all the pros i am going to give this game. The cons are The community is so bad it'll give CSGO a run for it's money. The guns all feel the same and the loot is similarly boring and re washed nonsense that you find in 99.9% of other games that include some form of looting. The gameplay is extremely repetitive and sometimes very short. You finish doing the same thing over and over with only a slight change in scenery. The process is Drop in from airplane &gt find loot &gt proceed to circle &gt more loot &gt Run to next circle &gt run like a madman some more &gt Possibly find a vehicle &gt Get to next circle &gt Possibly kill of get killed &gt Next circle &gt Kill or be killed again &gt Win. The only variation of the above pattern is the chance of dying doing any of those steps at any given moment. Plus the load times and time you need to get in game is pretty high so sometimes if you die first it just sucks and you've wasted a few minutes of your life doing nothing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-23,0,0,212,True,Not Recommended,I cannot with good heart recommend this game until the crashing issues are solved. Every game i play i crash 5 10 minutes after dropping from the plane and this didn't happen the first day i got the game only a few hours after starting to play did i start to get this issue. My cpu isnt overheating nor is my gpu. In fact when the game isnt crashing i get a steady 60fps throughout the entirety of the match.Long story short game is fun but i can't play it because it crashes every round.EDIT So i have solved the crashing issues myself however i am still giving a negative review solely because the developers do not listen to the fanbase when it comes to things that need to be fixed. There are a ton and i mean A TON of bugs in this game. But despite that the dev team has opted to devote more of their resources into adding more content rather than fixing the servers and optimization. Now i know that a dev team has dedicated teams for bugs and what have you but they could easily use the truckload of money they have made to hire more bug fixers. They use more of their resources to make new content in order to market it on their twitter to attract new players. They are doing exactly what every other alpha game developer does and that is get a ton of money from a bunch of hype and then never follow up.I hope they prove me wrong but so far this is what the game is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-29,0,0,187,True,Not Recommended,PUBattlegrounds is a multiplayer online game with massive rounds featuring 100 players. PUBattlegrounds is also very popular on twitch for streamers. It s a 100 man arena death match on a deserted Russian island.Unfortunately if one of those other players is streaming on twitch and you kill them you re likely to get a 7 day ban. Streamers can ask the developers to ban anyone and it happens with hardly and delay whereas ant hacking reports you ll make by signing up on their forums will take a month or two and never amount to anything.Furthermore in these bans they presume your guilt and out the burden on you the player to somehow prove you did not watch a twitch stream of another player in your round.These streamers think they re a lot better than they are so when they die it s obviously not their fault.Seriously poor PR management. Seriously poor stance on these issues. The developers care more about coddling streamers to grow the game than to create an enjoyable gaming experience. Even though they promised to not release monetization while in early access before they finish the core game they are now starting to sell loot crates that need a key that costs cash.But that loot crate situation is really just an aside. It s the stream sniping mess that stops me from recommending this game to anyone. 0/5.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Having said all this supporting this game is something I'd erge many of you to do. The dev teams works at a phenomenal pace releasing updates and content at a rapid speed. Obviously some updates are more relevant than others but the community will get what they personally want eventually.With an increasing player base by the day there probably isn't a better time to get into the game.

No it's not like Overwatch's system where you can actually earn the same things through playing. There is literally content locked behind more money that you can not get despite having paid 27 for the (access to the) game. Such a bad move.The game itself is pretty a pretty good 100 player skirmish where you can play in parties of 1 4 players. There are still a lot of bugs though and the developer constantly pushes out buggy releases and hopes we deal with them. Just recently he pushed out an update that lagged out the whole game until the players thinned out to a smaller number as the server for some reason couldn't deal with the load. Let me emphasise this he purposely pushed an update that broke the game and he's done it several times normally with patches 2 weeks later. But he did it and he did it to push out his micro transactions so they are on time with the real world event they are complementing. (He also said he wouldn't push micro transactions in early access but hey popularity and money changes people).All in all if you're gonna get it you might as well make sure you have friends to play it with to make you forget about the screwed up stuff the developer is pulling.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And one to KoTK who is gifted to be the newest but who above all else desired money. For within these mods was bound the strength to govern the Battle Royale genre.

The game is also centered around luck and sometimes aim and gamesense. If you get lucky then you are bound to win the game. The starting zones basically chooses who is going to win and are most of the time miles away from where you start. Also why is there the scar and the m4. There only needs to be one as they are basically the same guns. The game is also not very beginner friendly as they do not know all the controls and how things work. Bullet velocity is also really buggy as bullets are 1 700mph in the real world and running in the game is around 5 10 mph. I know the distance is alot to compensate but its always way too much even when someone is very close to you you have to aim alot in front of them the same with cars.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-27,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,So this is what 100k+ people are soiling their pants over? I expected much better. The map is terrible for starters Seriously I can't even tell where the heck I am on the map. Have the developers heard of a legend? Jumping in the game could not possibly be any more useless. I tried jumping over a fence no bigger than a foot and my character couldn't make it. There is no purpose to jumping you can't climb anything either. When you're getting shot at and see a small fence or railing and you run up to it thinking you can climb it or jump over it then get shot to death you ask yourself... why? Why is this feature not in the game? But at least you can crawl so I'll throw the devs a bone here.Another thing is that if you wait too long doing important things that are required in the game like scavenging finding weapons gear etc you will get warned that your character has to proceed to the play area. If you do not do this a blue circle will envelop your location and start to drain your health until you step out of it. I ran for a minute straight trying to make it to the play area and by the time I got out my health was below a quarter. I understand this is to eliminate camping but at least let it so the player restores the health lost after they step out of the circle. Very dumb. Performance is complete garbage. I am running on a 980 and a 6600k with 16 gb ram yet to achieve an almost fluid 60 fps I have to turn down the graphics to the absolute lowest AND lower the resolution from 2560x1080 to 1920x1080.. that is unacceptable considering I more than surpass the system requirements to run this. The game is playable then of course but it looks like someone threw up all over my screen after having one too many drinks. The concept here is cool and definitely worth checking out but the technical state of this game is pitiful right now so save your money. There are so many amazing and quality games on Steam you can pick up right now during the summer sale for $30 so do yourself a favor and spend it elsewhere.

2017-10-06,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,"PUBG itself is a great game at it's core but it suffers from too many problems. The optimization is terrible encountering bugs are common there are microtransactions when it was promised there would be none and the developers just aren't good people.Bluehole and PlayerUnknown himself have been trying to say Fortnite ripped them off even though PUBG obviously built off of games like H1Z1 King Of The Hill. He also has no problem banning people just for killing a streamer. Yes if you kill someone that is streaming you have a good chance of getting banned for accusations of ""stream sniping"" even if you are 100% innocent. PlayerUnknown seriously does not care about his fanbase. He threw in a bunch of annoying microtransactions before the game even got released despite saying he wouldn't he bans people for no reason he acts like he's the creator of Battle Royale and he's just an all around to his fans.On the topic of Fortnite let's be honest Fortnite Battle Royale is better and PlayerUnknown knows it. The game runs better it's already out on multiple platforms it is 100% FREE the servers are good hackers are already getting banned anyone caught teaming is getting banned the community is better the developers are better the developers put out video updates almost weekly and way more stuff.If you are looking for a good Battle Royale game go install Fortnite. It's $30 cheaper and 10x better.Update #1 10/6/2017 Since I just remembered it I would also like to go more in depth on the topic of Bluehole inserting advertisements in the game. Yes a $30 has ads in it. For anyone that doesn't know Chinese players have a lot of issues trying to connect to Chinese server due to the poor connection. PlayerUnknown had the bright idea of advertising connection boosting (and by boosting I mean making it bearable) advertisements on his game. Yep. $30 game. Advertisements. In all honesty I wouldn't be surprised if Bluehole was purposefully throttling Chinese speeds to make them cough up cash for a service almost equal to the game in price that apparently isn't even permanent.

2017-08-01,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,I cannot endorse a game that continues to cater to streamers who get members of the community banned because they refuse to put a simple delay on their streams.I cannot endorse a game that after months of play hasn't patched lag in the audio. Lag when encountering enemy players. I cannot endorse a game that doesn't allow you to jump or vault. (coming soon coming soon bla bla bla)I cannot endorse a game that has micotransactions but the game itself is still terribly broken. They have turned it into a for profit mechanisim by using streamers as advertisting and the purchasing of items only proves this.And finally the most important part of all I cannot endorse a game where you don't have fun on a consistent basis. When playing a game where everytime you encouter an enemy you experience audio lag or suffer from a terrible refresh rate.They allow streamers to have test server access to practice and get better.

Ofcourse there are small details that make this game differend but the overall concept is almost the same.The reasons I prefer PUBG over H1Z1 (believe it or not) The menu is less buggy. More (team) communication with voicechat. 99 people is just perfect for me. Custom matches. Better graphics (altho less stable).For the rest I can't figure out why people say it isn't close to H1Z1. They are both Battle royal games.Last The game isn't that unstable as people say. I understand this could be better but if I look at games like ARK....

2017-12-02,0,0,176,True,Not Recommended,After playing fortnite for over 3000 hours I was eventually rather bored of its gameplay and decided to try another battle royal. I decided on player unknown battgrounds because of it's large player base (although pathetic compared to fortnite). In my first solo match I was able to make it to 2nd place but some bully named GeorgeArkArk camped in a corner with a shotgun and killed me stealing my amazing win. I still remember the horrid details of his camping playstyle. As the storm's eye I mean blue circle closed in on our position I was forced to enter a region I was unable to have control of. I panicked and rushed in gunz blazing and I managed to dink him twice. But because of his 3rd person he was able to see me coming into the house. He gunned me down and I lost the match because of stupid 3rd person and from that day forward I played 1st person only because it is fair and square. This game would be good if they made it first person. See in fortnite 3rd person is a part of the game and is deeply integrated. PUBG is a poorly designed title and I gave it many chances. I faced georgearkark once more in a first person server and he got obiliterated and destroyed by my amazing skill and aimz. He added me on steam with the name toeslobber74. This child was pathetic and attempted to scam me. He took my boreal forest falchion csgo knive. I reported him but steam won't answer. None of this would have happened if 3rd person was not in the game. I would not recommend this camping simulator to anyone. Go play Rainbow Cubt Siege if u want to camp nig.

The gun play is great and the looting system is always interesting. And you often won't feel like you lost because of something that was t every loss or win is deserved.NegativesThe game is horribly unoptimised. I very easily meet and surpass the requirements for this game but every time i land even in the most unpopluated tiny abandonded town the buildings will take up to 5 minutes to load in so i can actually enter them so landing anywhere near another player is an instant loss as they'll be able to loot the building and kill me before i can even get in the building thats if my game doesnt freeze before i even hit the floor.I cant recommend this game due to this fact its extremely fun but mostly unplayable at this time.

2017-08-11,0,0,488,True,Recommended,"You'll see bugs. There's flaws and bugs like in tons of other games but the good news is that Bluehole Studio the publisher of the game makes weekly and monthly updates. All the updates are obviously made to improve the game.The weekly updates are often to improve game performance meanwhile the monthly updates are often bigger and contain new weapons &amp vehicles. I've been playing on both EU NA and AS servers during these past months. I still prefer to play on AS servers right now. At first I obviously played on EU servers but I quickly found out that there was ""loot lag"" on EU and not on NA servers. Because of that I changed and started to play on NA instead.However NA servers seems to have slight issues nowadays with some sort of lag spikes which AS servers doesn't have. So even though I play on AS and have higher ping the game feels smoother.Besides that there's also some problems with the different scopes. When you're aiming the bullets doesn't land exactly where you aim. Find out more about it here This is obviously something very annoying but this is already fixed and will be included in the upcoming update.Weapons..The updates also contains new weapons like I stated above and this image below is the newest weapon to come.Besides that you'll have a ton of different weapons to choose from. AKM (AK 47) M416 M16A4 SCAR L KAR98K AWM and a bunch of others. Pistols and shotguns. There's tons of weapons and not only that you'll also be able to get attachments for different weapons. Extended mags etc.Not only that..There's multiple vehicles in the game. Cars Boats and Motorbikes. You'll have a buggy that's made for 2 people meanwhile you can ride 3 people in the motorbike and 4 in Dacia's and UAZ's. In the upcoming update a new motorbike will be included which you'll be able to ride 2 people on.Besides that in a game like H1Z1 you'll basically win a game if you have a car. That's kind of lame and boring. At least in my opinion. In PUBG you'll probably die if you're using vehicles. Especially in the later circles. To have a car boat or motorbike before the first circle is often awesome though as you'll be able to travel far away to loot before going in to the circle and fight until only 1 survive.It's a strategy game. A perfect blend with Action Strategy and ""know how"".Most people probably think that you'll be able to join a server get some loot and run around killing people.. And that's true to some extent. But these people usually ends up dead in 15 minutes or so.This game is not about how many kills you get.. This game is all about surviving until the end. You could obviously go ""Rambo"" on your enemies and blast their guts out of their bodies.. But even Rambo will have a hard time doing that.. As it's 100 people in total.I've managed to win with 15 kills and 1 kill. So anything is possible as long as you're using your head. However I personally prefer to kill as many people I can as I like to go ""Rambo"" on people.The people who use their brains are the ones winning.I give this game 8/10 due to the small problems they're still facing.. And 9/10 once they fix the lag issues. However I do give them 10/10 for their efficiency problem solving and communication skills. H1Z1 would get a low 4/10.The bottom line here is that PUBG is what H1Z1 should have been by now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,1,2,2011,True,Not Recommended,This game is the best among all BR projects. Its kinda golden middle between all others and if U really a fun of the genre u have to get it.But!Its purchaisable now and minimal REQs are published on official game's page. But its playable only with recommended. If u have i7 7th series GTX and 8Gb of RAM u have to do plenty of action to get even 55 60 FPS (which arent good for shooters at all anb BR especially). I have to play it HD with everything on low and DirectX10 shaders... and still I have already had tons of moments where all the deep and challenging core of the game was ruined by bad optimization (circle shrink to big city 30FPS lose lots of smoke around 40FPS lose sudden rush in building 20 30FPS lose) and all matches are rankeds... so u r forced to play it challenging way but u cant cuz of poor really poor optimization. I dont like such fake marketing things thats why Battlegrounds got my Negative review for now. They promised to optimize this game during CBT stage (they said about that in January 2017). In the end of CBT they said about some optimization to EA stage... Now they r saying about middle of the next month... I hardly believe them and only reason that I bought the game is great mechanics and potentional and presonally the creator PLAYERUNKNOWN this guy is great. I want to believe but I have already been fooled twice I ll be the first one who switch his negative review right after I get playable 70+ FPS in this game with my hardware (which is among minimal).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-05,0,0,249,True,Not Recommended,It is an interesting idea executed poorly. It feels like an environment focused game where shooting was an afterthought which destroys the game because shooting is the central focus to win. Sighting firing moving while firing gauging hits it all feels random and jerky. poor servers and bizzare frame drops don't help the shooting situation.Every game plays out the same way Get a weapon combo you may or may not have had before encounter a brand new combat scenario you haven't encountered before win / lose fights without any take aways for how to improve think about what you would have done differently tactics wise after you're killed attempt to apply what went wrong to the next brand new scenario die. That is the only way to get trigger time and without any way of using the feedback from shooting the game goes nowhere. Rinse and repeat. The third person view gives a huge advantage to peekaboo players hit registration is terrible vehicle and building interaction is clunky and awkward. You will get hung up on small debris jagged edges and invisible barries in rocks.Buy the game play a few rounds to see for yourself then refund it.

2017-08-11,0,0,481,True,Recommended,A great game but with each massive community it toxicity will appear. The gameplay is great guns feel like they have a real punch to them. Shotgun range is actually accurate to real life for one thing. A great game to play with friends. But the community can be horrible. The discussion page will be filled with nothing but people complaining about microtranscation which are for charity and prize pool for a tournament. Even so there are stilll free crates with quality loot. One complaint I have would be the attitude of the developers and them leaning to side with streamers in any heat that occurs. Bans are not something they will have a hard time doing. But as long as you don't team in solo stream snipe or exploit bugs or glitches you'll be fine. The major flaw to this game is it is not well optimized but this is an early access game and a very good one at that. The developers even same to make sure it doesn't stay in early access for to long. But overall this is a game I've put many hours into and whole heartdly enjoy. a great game especially with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,"Can we have an anti cheat that actually works ? What is it with companies releasing ""early"" stage games without proper moderation of player activity? If you want our positive feedback don't create terrible experiences. The game on a whole.. I was expecting a sort of weapon crafting last man standing survival situation. I imagined sitting in a tower my ramshack/homemade sniper rifle on my hands. The sweat of nerves and adrenaline flowing peering through the scope as i watch for ""survivors"" on the field. Thats' not PUBG. You drop in and can only pick from pre distributed weapons on the map which appear to always be in the same places on the ground. Hackers know exactly where they are and will land faster then you grab the weapon and headshot you before you even know whats happening. I have personally watched my Deathcam replay to see people jerking back and forth like they're cycling through targets on an MMO through walls knowing exactly where you're hiding. There is no crafting system no customization of your player. Most people look alike or are naked. The reward chests are always the same rewards as your friend no random loot at all so don't expect to look unique compared to your partners. I'm not a fan of the ""restricting"" playzones that constantly shrink to corral players closer to each other. I feel it should only do that if the map detects there is no one near you or the match time is approaching max. It shouldn't constantly be a race to the center of the circle as the circle will kill you more then the players will. I would have preferred no area restriction unless you're alone within a mile to create long lasting survival situations. You die so fast because of someone knowing where everything is. That you really don't get to enjoy the environment and the rush. I've started a match and died within seconds only to jump into another match for the same outcome. When i don't die instantly i die to the ring closure. Why let us choose where to airdrop in if you're just going to force us to herd into a small area. I feel this defeats the concept of such large maps which this game definately has. They are massive. You can't outrun the circle it always moves faster then you. Verdict It needs a lot of work polish customization details and reward improvements to make us want to continue. Match types for longer times or no map restriction options.

Also for a game obsessed with realism the sound design is a joke. PUBG is a classic example of a brilliant concept poorly executed. Thankfully FORTNITE will keep Battle Royale alive and playable.

Other players who have extremely powerful weapons with 6X scopes seconds after landing i call crap. Still land and see viallages fully looted when the other dude landed a mere second or two before me. Play something else don't bother Devs favour streamers and cheats. Updated May 10 2018DO NOT buy this garbage. Has its moments of fun but is rife with exploits ie aim bots and not sure what to call this one but people looting small villages in a matter of seconds when both your parachutes landed at relatively the same time. Game is in early access and yes once again it has its moments of fun. But seems the Dev is more interested in seeing how many millios of copies it can sell in early release than actually dealing with cheats exploits and people who report you as cheating when they die to you ie streamers who think they are God's gift to the franchise god forbid you should kill one in a fair fight because your ban is incoming. And the Dev's seem to side with the streamers what a lonely game it will be when it is consisting of about 200 streamers and that is all. Hey Bluehole ! Streamers are NOT the vast majority of you community here but I assert they are in fact the vast majority of whiners. Until this *cough* game *cough* is fixed so that third party programs are detected and dealt with before they can ruin a round. Or until the whiners aka streamers are taken to task your money would be better spent elsewhere. Or also fisxed so that in the spawn area I do not have to listen to ""china number 1"" for a min repeatedly or when Bluehole takes actual interest in fixes and gameplay rather than money and sales and premature tournaments and such please play with your tongue in cheek. Because when you chute in and every house in the village has opens doors due to the guy who landed a second or two before you please realize you do not stand a chance. BUY something else or buy it play it a few times and wait for the Dev to actually take an interest in it rather than their new 110k+ cars.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now that an article was published clearly boasting how amazing the Anti Cheat system is for PUBG the OCE servers are now flooded with hackers. These range from speed hacks to aimbots and rapid fire bolt action rifles. ""banning 6k players a day Close but no cigarPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS had a very promising start. Finally a battle royale game with devs that aren't just money grubbing apes. A nice balance with decent enough gameplay and hitreg that was normally alright. That's leagues ahead of H1Z1 already. Unfortuately once you start to play it you'll start to realize the flaws and due to the recent controversies surrounding the devs poor desicions I can not in good conscious reccommend this game.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is very weird. I personally felt that the guns felt like garbage to control. The bullet drop always felt like a bit too much and the zeroing system is near useless I can't imagine using anything other than 100m zeroing for any shot. You start off alongside 100 other players in this huge map with various cities spread throughout. Those are the hotspots and you can expect to see a lot of players diving in and trying to nab the best loot. If you don't like diving into the cities you can choose to parachute anywhere on the map for example some small homes outside of the city. The issue with this strategy is that the loot outside of the cities is little to none and you feel like you're picking through scraps. It also makes for a much slower and boring game as you'll spend most of the match despereately trying to run into the circle before it closes in on you considering vehicles are relatively rare and most players will nab them up quick. If the circle is too far away there's a good chance you'll just die face first on the grass. On the off chance you do finally make it towards the last few closing circles you'll almost always just get headshot by someone a mile away hiding in a bush with a kar98. This brings me to my next point.SOUND AND VISUALSGood god. The optimization is GARBAGE for this game. I have a decent rig and i'm still forced to play on some of the lowest settings to even reach 60+ FPS. My game looks like play dough and yet I still barely get an acceptable framerate. Don't buy this game for the graphics you'll be utterly disappointed. Let's get to the sound. Good sound design in a game means that you should be able to close your eyes and hear where your enemies are and hear what's happening all around you. While this game has great sound effects the placement is awful. The sound of someone upstairs will suddenly and jaggedly shift as you creep up doors sound exaclty the same no matter how far away you are. Another big issue is the bullets. When an enemy fires at you you hear the shot crack off into the distance but it's very hard to place where it's coming from. The shots landing in the dirt next to you are FAR louder than the shots coming from the gun in the distance which is bothersome. This makes it almost impossible to pinpoint the location of enemy fire. Prepare for lots of deaths where you hide behind a rock and you think you're safe only to realize the shots are actually coming from behind you. The sound levels are also ATROCIOUS. Bullets landing in DIRT should not sound louder than the gun discharging them only 100 meters or so away. You could chalk that up to realism but this is a video game. If the realism intrudes on the basic gameplay than it is worth mentioning. Planes also sound stupid loud.THE WOES OF EARLY ACCESS DEVS (Bluehole) TAKING SIDESI'm done giving games free passes for having the early access tag. If your game is then it's You are not reviewing the game for the future you are reviewing the game in it's current state. This game has a plan to come out in 2017 but it is NO WHERE NEAR completion. The game is alright but it needs A LOT OF WORK. Onto the devs. The main dev promised that the game will have no microtransactions while the game remains in early access. Unfortunately he broke that promise already. He claims it's for ""the life of the game"". Meanwhile this game is constantly on the top charts on steam and has sold millions upon millions of copies. The game's servers are garbage as well. They're constantly having issues to the point where you can expect to not be able to luanch a match for DAYS at a time. In fact at the time of this review we are on about day 4 of massive server issues. I have been unable to play for almost a week only because the servers are so bad. Absolutely unacceptable to be putting in microtransactions when there are people who can't even PLAY the game. Secondly the devs have been banning people like CRAZY. It's usually because a streamer gets killed and they falsely accuse their death on stream sniping or hacks. The devs hear this and immediately ban the player no questions asked no warnings whatsoever. In a game where you can not see the name of players until you have killed or been killed by them it is unacceptable to blame it on stream sniping. Out of the 1 million + players on this game what are the chances that I would load into a game with this one player in it. Astronomically low. Let alone that I would be watching their stream or would even know who they are in the first place. Devs have not communicated very well on this issue.FINAL VERDICT 4/10There's something here. The gameplay is promising but needs some tweaks. The 30 dollar price tag isn't asking for much but for 30 dollars I should be getting a hellavalot better game than this. The game badly needs optimization. The devs are very questionable making this game an outright UNSAFE BUY for anyone hedging on the early access tag. I would not recommend this game to anybody unless you understand the RISKS of purchasing this title. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS Is ultimately a below average game with a very drab future.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-12,4,2,68,True,Recommended,To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer s head. There s also Rick s nihilistic outlook which is deftly woven into his characterisation his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature for instance. The fans understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes to realise that they re not just funny they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp Morty truly ARE idiots of course they wouldn t appreciate for instance the humour in Rick s existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. And yes by the way i DO have a Rick &amp Morty tattoo. And no you cannot see it.

2017-08-05,0,0,74,True,Not Recommended,"I bought this about a month ago with real faith in the Dev team and the promise it showed given its ""Early access"" state. I've not played much (25 hours at this point) however the last 2 or 3 weeks have been drastically negative for the game and I really hope it isn't telling of the future. I now can't recommend it for the following reasons.First point The devs lied. Let's get it out of the way. They said they wouldn't introduce paid content until full release and have sold more than enough copies of it to have kept that promise but they are adding a key/crate system. The excuse is to fund a gamescom e sports event but this has 2 issues. One being that they have more than enough money that if this was important to them they could have funded it themselves and two being that this is still an Early Access title. The game still has notable bugs that can make or break play and yet they want to push it to an e sports level. This seems ridiculous and frankly wrong. This game does NOT need to be an e sport title yet so don't push for it.Second point The latest patch. The last patch at time of writing this broke large amounts of the game increasing lag and the frequency of lag spikes. Several graphics issues and drastically reducing performance. They have apparently been working around the clock to hotfix these issues and they are partially fixed but not completely. Even on a moderately high end rig like mine there are still horrible glitches which have cost me the game more than once (I am also an awful player but when the buildings won't even load models in I think I'm not only to blame). Like I said they're working to fix this but if they've been throwing money at content creation (see point 1 about boxes) rather than optimisation and fixing issues and preventing new ones I do have to worry about how they are balancing resources within development.Third point Stream sniping. A large amount of the success of this game is down to being popular with streamers. It's no wonder that it is given it's tense unpredictable and also has a some time for the streamers to interact with the chat during quieter moments. However players are now getting bans for stream sniping which is nigh on impossible to prove and given a high profile streamer can have hundreds of people report a player for something a real worry. I now have to worry if I kill someone with the words ""Twitch"" or ""TV"" in their name because people are getting bans for otherwise simple kills. Stream sniping is a pain in any online game and I understand the streamer's frustrations but every other online game I can think of says that stream sniping is a move but not a bannable offense. Given the nature of this game is to pick people off it makes it even harder to prove and people getting week long bans from the game for this seems absurd. It comes across as PUBG is molly coddling the streamers that made their game so big just to keep them playing. Favouritism is not ideal in the gaming industry.Last point the lack of a PR team. With at least 5 million copies sold at this point Bluehole (devs) should be able to afford a PR team to clean up after the issues that are pointed out above. At least do damage control. While the devs are great at communicating what they're doing regarding actual development everything else seems to be falling apart. Hire a PR team or at least a PR person so they can save any lost face they can.So no I won't recommend you buy it yet. I may update this in the future if any of these issues change but I can't recommend this right now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I mean come on having some framedrops or bad performance here and there is one thing but having to edit your lauch options so that the game uses all CPU cores and still have it run 1 3 5 FPS for 10 seconds straight just because you are trying to check your six is not worth 30 euros. And me having recieved this game as a gift doesn't mean I would not recommend anybody spending 30 euros in this.I am honestly not trying to hate. This is just MY expencience with PUBG. I really would love to see this game become a steady playable mix between ARMA and H1z1. Still dreams are just dreams and hopes are just hopes.So let's hope I'm dead wrong about the devs not caring. Although that is exactly how it feels right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But the biggest problem that holds this game back is the developers. They just do not seem to test anything they throw out in the updates. Early Access is no longer an excuse to not test things internally and make sure it actually works. The players are no longer here to test your product. Optimization is without a doubt the BIGGEST problem.I'm running a Ryzen 7 1700 EVGA GTX 1080 with 16GB RAM and this game still brings my heat levels to simply unacceptable highs.This game is still not worth the money that you will pay for it.

2017-07-28,0,0,151,True,Not Recommended,At its core PUBG is an extremely fun and enjoyable game. The gameplay is fun and while there are still several bugs and glitches the dev team seem to be working on those. (This review is written during early access).However the current state of the public relations between the mod team and the community is pure The main developer of the game (PlayUnknown) acts like an immature teenager There have been several bans for team killing and the mods use no descretion when looking at these bans. If a member of your team attempts to kill you (sometimes occurs whan random user ends up in your queue) and you kill them and they decide to send in a report good luck on contesting it. The moderaters simply do not care.One of the promises from Player Unknown was that ingame purchases would not be introduced until the game left early access. Yet for some bizzare reason money the game will have paid crates. The final straw right now is the fact that a well known streamer (Summit) recently whined about dying to a stream sniper. No proof just a complaint and as a result the player was banned for 7 days.Avoid this game until this stops.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I think they would be better off having multiple game modes. 1 CQC type where everyone is already in something maybe the size of your average battlefield map and another with the full sized map but without the ever decreasing play zone. The play zone could even stay just perhaps decrease a lot and i mean A LOT slower to help promote strategic play. As i said i would like to see game modes so you could still have the traditional mode... i just think this game needs something more else i see it just being a bit of a fad that will die out relatively quickly.

2017-04-25,2,2,27,True,Recommended,WRITTEN AT THE TIME OF 1.4.2 PATCH.When it comes to Dead by Daylight there's a lot of positives and negatives that come from this game. Here I'm going to try to look at it from both sides of the argument.Positives Somewhat fast paced gameplay that keeps you on edge Soundtrack and sounds set the tone Great party game for people who love a fun time Flexible gameplay for different characters Can be addicting! From my experience when solo queueing I've found games quickly. I don't know how this affects anyone else but this is from my point of view.Negatives Wait times for parties. If you want to search in a party for a game on Dead by Daylight you may as well make a sandwich and watch a couple movies. It's going to take a while. The community. It's almost as if CS GO's toxicity has met with Dead by Daylight. You can find rude Survivors and killers in many different scenarios. It's almost as if some people like to ruin the game for others. Bugs. The developers have said multiple times that they will fix bugs that are prevalent in the game but take a seemingly long time to fix. I don't know why this is but hopefully this gets fixed for the future. Matchmaking. Imagine you have just purchased the game 0 hours and freshly started. You go to queue up in a game as a rank 20 survivor and get survivors rank 20 18 and 17 while the killer is rank 3. This has actually happened to me after a rank reset (every 13th of the month). I was absolutely baffled. The matchmaking needs an update preferably more towards an ELO system. Also the game runs peer to peer so if you happen to run into a Killer who has very high ping good luck.Overall OpinionThrough all the issues that I face in this game and will continue to face I still will play this game. It's a fun game to me and I love the fact that it's somewhat of a grinder game. My overall verdict of the game would be a 7/10. Score will go up as more things get fixed throughout the games development and updates.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A lot of recent reviews have been mad at the devs trying to make money from the event pass but that's a really dumb thing to get mad about 1) they need to establish a steady revenue stream so they can keep creating and making more content (like the new map that just dropped and new guns) 2) the event pass adds a new experience to the game that wasn't there before and if you don't want to buy it you don't lose anything. Fortnite does a very similar thing and no one complains about that. The game is a ton of fun I've been playing it since it came out on early access and it has come a long way from there and I enjoyed it back then.

Fewer than 1% of players used the trade system to buy and sell in 3rd party websites and PUBG corp want to earn money from every single transaction so they simply killed the trade system ignoring 99% of players. They don't give a to their community they earned tons of cash already but they don't spend money to maintain their broken servers.They are much worse than EA and Activision. at least EA doesn't give you broken game with laggy servers.Now i realize why fortnite is taking over PUBG. becasue Epic games care about his community.Guys please stop feeding companies like EA Activision and PUBG Corp. they are ruining the whole indastery. Stop buying falsely over hyped early access games just because you hope that it will get better in the future.I'm a victim of false hype of this game myself. I bought this because i like the mobile version. but this was not like the Pubg mobile. I regret spending my money for this. and regret spending 26 hours into this game.I'm sure PUBG will die soon in the future because of it's developer. but even if PUBG dies the developer already made tons and tons of money and they even don't care about their game anymore. so either PUBG dies or not players are real losers.You lose game over.

2019-01-02,0,0,532,False,Recommended,Hello everyone When PUBG first came out I was not really interested in it because at the time I was playing more of CSGO. I eventually bought the game however in December of 2017 and I haven't looked back since. I have been enjoying this game so much due to its uniqueness (PlayerUnknown was the first guy to introduce the battle royale genre in gaming even though he did so in ARMA first). After having 485 hours on the game here are some things that I find great about this game and other things which need improvement. The main reason that I love this game is that it is different every time you play it. I haven't had the final circle end at the same exact location ever since I bought this game which means that every time I queue up for a game there's an element of surprise of what I will encounter. I think this is the more significant point for me because I'm not constantly running towards the same area but rather get to explore different parts of the map and battle other players differently each time depending on where the encounter occurs. In addition since I bought this game there have been numeours updates to it (majority of which have been beneficial) so from that you can see that the developers somewhat care about this game and are constantly pushing out new updates. PUBG has come a long way since it was first released and since I bought it. At the time there were only two available maps (Miramar and Erangel) and some aspects of the game were different as well. Vehicle physics bullet penetration and the maps themselves were all different and have been modified in a positive way since then. Vehicles used to be extermely unsturdy and easy to flip but thankfully they have been fixed since then. Some things that could be improved are that the weapon spawn rate should be increased on Erangel and the game still is not fully optimized as it should be. I along with majority of the other players have mini stutters at times which can become annoying. They don't occur all the time though but it would be nice if the developers fixed this issue once and for all. I don't like the Sanhok map but that's personal preference. The game can be very frustrating at times but that's just the nature of the game since you're always competing againsts 100 other players (if playing solo). However most of the time it is an extrordinary game that really gives you an adrenaline rush when the player count starts getting below 10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's hard for me to take 99% of these reviews seriously because they are putting PUBG up against a perfect world how about we compare the game to the actual market.. Where games are NOT optimized bad graphics horrible gameplay dead community developers don't care or abandoned and pose as a COPY and PASTED game over the years now PUBG looks amazing right? I wish we could WRITE a REVIEW comparing the people WRITING THESE REVIEWS to the people IN A PERFECT WORLD now you look stupid right?... Now to the masses of people claiming to be banned for stream sniping maybe some of you have actually been banned unreasonably you can fight it. However there are more than 200 000 REVIEWS of you that are GUILTY and LYING to get out of a situation. You really think 200K PEOPLE ARE BANNED UNREASONABLY? Do not NEG review a game because you decided to be an IDIOT and stream snipe someone trying to enjoy the game because you are a FAN.. Grow up! Play the game! It's not hard! Me and many of my teammates have killed SHROUD NINJA Viss and the other top streamers on this game we have NEVER been suspected of it because we don't go around HONKING HORNS AT THEM AND PLAYING MUSIC AND CHASING THEM DOWN AND BEING LIKE HEY IM A FAN THAT WANTS TO GET BANNED... You guys really need to start growing up this type of treatment to developers working hard and bringing in original content is what is going to CONTINUE to kill the AUTHENTICITY that was once in Gaming.. The fix for stream sniping would be for an actual Skilled Ranking System that way players cannot just click play at the same time and get into matches. Again Grow up!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The bullet drop in this game is hard to learn not mentioning the actual guns and their mechanics but if you learn that you can on some newbies. If you drop in popular areas and kill your way out of it you are 70% to be ready to kill anyone else in that game going for drops is risky but beneficial and playing with friends is more fun then solos actually all the games that i won were duos or squads.So i can say if you dont mind dying alot but at the end winning some insane games this game is for you if you dont like preformance issues in online games or t driving mechanics dont bother trying this game all in all this game but also praise this unexpected blessing from the godsvery nice/very nice,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-25,0,0,434,False,Recommended,Pubg is an absolute amazing game lets get this straight. The mechanics and game style are just amazing. You probably see all those people down in the review section complaining about how laggy and poorly optimised the game is. The truth is they probably just have a bad pc. I use Geforce now on a 2015 mac book pro and i run it at 60 fps on ultra settings with no issue. I played this game for 5 hours straight without experiencing any lag issues. Ping depending on where you live could vary hugely since there are only so many servers around the world. I personally haven't had a ping issue and my ping is always below 30. The biggest problem for me right now are all the Turkish people in the European. I can deal with Russians and Chinese as most of the time they atleast try to communicate with you in english. But Turkish no! Every ing game i que up there are always Turkish people who just talks to each other with ear mic and expects you to understand everything they say. What pisses of me the most is that they don't even try to talk with you if u don't speak turkish. If you are gonna ing speak turkish with your buddy go queue up ing 3 man squad or duals. It has got to a point where I'm forced to switch to NA servers in order to play squad while experiencing 100+ping. I understand that europe is a big continent and people speak a lot of different languages but can the dev team atleast give the player an option to choose english only or others when they are queuing up for a game...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-19,0,0,225,True,Not Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a very fun game when it's working right. The down side to this is that is rarely works in that way and instead you get a very stuttering lagging bug filled experience that is just plain frustrating. The engine is poorly optimized and you spend a majority of the time researching ways to get it to run smoothly rather than enjoying it.

2018-06-13,0,0,229,False,Not Recommended,"This is one of the worst multiplayer games i've ever played by far.Let's start with the game's performance graphics are not that bad but nothing special to justify the horrendous performance of this game. You'll need a powerful pc to achieve ""stable"" 144fps (assuming you have a 144/240hz monitor which should be a staple in any competitive setup these days) and even then the game suffers from micro stuttering. I've never seen a setup that runs this game flawlessly without stutters. I'm running an overclocked 8700k to 5ghz and a 1080ti also overclocked with a pretty optimized system and i have the occasional drops and stutters which is unacceptable for a game that runs on high end hardware and its out of early access. Various ""optimization guides"" do nothing don't waste your time.Now let's go to the network performance as expected it's also abysmal it suffers from the worst hit registration I've ever seen the variable tickrate doesn't help either and according to performance analysis videos the game hits 30hz after 8 minutes and struggles to maintain them. It's not a fair comparison due to the number of players but for example csgo runs at 64hz with 3rd party services offering 128hz options and battlefield also runs at 60hz. Latency is also a big issue you can't ping the server to see latency stats and sometime it feels like you have 1k ping this of course can be explained due to the horrible netcode in general.Gameplay wise i guess it could be ""good"" if you are so invested into the trending BR genre but for me the lack of hitscan weapons option erratic recoil inconsistent network performance awful hitreg bad performance etc makes this game an unplayable mess.For a game that sold so many copies and it's out for so long it is unacceptable to be in this state every update makes the game worse the devs are incompetent and they only care about selling more lootboxes and keys so don't waste your time and money.4/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The gameplay is kept brisk and tense thanks to the ever shrinking play area which forces confontations and/or stealth gameplay. The gunplay is satisfying and it feels as though the game is very well streamlined compared to ARMA or DayZ when it comes to inventory management and gameplay.+Loot is reasonable and not frustrating to gather.+Tense gameplay. The thrill of the hunt is real.+Even more fun when played with friends.+Games don't last too long. The pace feels just right.+Gunplay is spot on with plenty of customisation options to kit out weapons.+The Devs are regularly updating the game and improving things and much more content is coming.

2018-02-27,0,0,73,False,Not Recommended,"This game is actually OK and I like to play it but I decided it was time for me to write down everything I complain about while going off on one so that in the future I can simply read this and agree with myself. Keep in mind everything written here is exaggerated and not entirely litteral Player Unknowns Battlegrounds is f*cking sh*t After the frog lickers who made H1Z1 decided to ruin the game and their source of income Brendan Grenne PUBG creator fume inhalor and part time ASMR pedophile on the deepweb decided to fill the void by providing the world with his own version of Overwatch. As you can see the game failed entirely with only a pittiful 3 million all time peak of players and only making it to the #1 most played game on steam... Which really isn't all that impressive considering Steam has been dead platform since the Windows Store came to PC in tandem with Origin and Uplay's undeniable rise to power.I will give it to PUBG it really kicked off the Battle Royale genre. It really paved the way and showed the world where the real gap in the market was... Just in time for a team of actual developers to sweep in and make Fortnite. But enough history why can't I reccomend PUBG? Well really its really simple really. PUBG is total and utter wank from a gameplay design and functionality perspective. Every time you get into a game expect to drop to 30 frames per second just for the loading screen if you get past the loading screen then feel free to enjoy the numerous sh*theads who love blasting sh*t music from ""Em and Em"" and ""Kendick Lemur"" while simultaneously telling me to ""DrrrOp ScHeeoOl"" in a variety of exaggerated european accents.If you're lucky enough to make it to the point where you have to jump out of the plane you have two choices you can land somewhere or you can unequip your parachute die turn off the game and play something else. If you make the wrong choice you best choose wisely where to land the map around you has many locations linearised by the sh*tty planes that only take you through to the bottom left area of the map then further linearized by the shear amount of nothingness on the map and then EVEN FURTHER LINEARISED by your expectation that the zone will be nowhere near where you want it to be. Once you realise these 3 truths you are left with 1 areas to drop on either map. Here's a detailed image analysis of the original map imgur.com and here is that for the new map imgur.com Once you've carefully analysed these two images you are ready to drop at either Rozhock or Impala. If you're lucky you'll get into a fight early die and move on with your life. However if you win you're most likely going to spend the next 25 minutes looting location after location until the zone centers on a desolate flat where the scopes are king and you'll get gunned down within 18 seconds or your money back.But picture this right... You're among the last 2 left alive. A 1v1 scenario. The winner is truely the more skilled of the two right? Not really. You just lie down in a bush and if they don't poke their heads out you just pray that the coinflip zone lands on your head instead of theirs. Lets be honest though... You're never even getting into the top 10. You'll either die to the zone or die of bordem trying to find someone to shoot. Speaking of this is a point that really can't be emphisised enough the mid game of PUBG is SO F*CKING BORING. You move from compound to compound looting what hasn't already been looted and following the zone until you and your entire squad gets knocked from 2 kilometers away by a South Korean tribe of hill people all wielding Kars 8 times' and 18 years worth of Esports experience.What else... Oh yeah the game runs like WANK. UTTER... WANK... I'm running some pretty good specs on my PC with a recently updated GPU and pleanty of everything else to go around but if I don't have motion blur on (which makes me feel sick as f*ck btw) then the game practically pauses and asks if it'd be more helpful if I had my monitor turned off. Oh and while we're at it. Lets talk about bugs. Type in ""esports ready"" for a full explanation on how what can only be described as ""the skyrim of Battle Royales"" managed to turn itself into a meme. Lets also talk about what inspired me to write this review. Old map loading. After playing on sh*tty impala ville for a solid hour I would have LOVED to join my friends on an old map match but this weird thing happened where Mr.Grenne popped out my screen spat in my eyes and told me to go f*ck myself for trying to appreciate the one good place in this game Georgopol Crates.Do I have anything else to say? No. Gift me clothes in game so Im not dressed like a tramp. Play Fortnite. Dictatorships are OK. Please don't ban me for calling you a nonce",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-05,0,0,188,True,Not Recommended,I would recommend against purchasing this game. Many things(good and bad) are blatantly copied from H1Z1 and DayZ. It is extremely poorly optimized and many mechanics are glitchy awkward and make no sense. For example in many situations it will take a normal amount of shots to down someone(3 4 rifle shots or 1 shotgun blast depending on range) but then it will take many more than that to actually finish off the downed/bleeding out(and *WEAKENED*) player. Many many times I have downed a player in 3 4 hits and then after they are downed will require another 6 8 bullets to finish them off. Similarly I have downed players and then at even closer range shot the downed player with another shotgun blast and they remain alive still. Things like the above along with the speed and deadliness of the play circle make the game quite boring to play in practice. In ALL of the 3 4 games I have won I have only gotten 1 kill which is the final player of the game. The rest of a winning match consists of looting and then simply running to the safe circle repeatedly and then hiding. In games where I get 5 7 10+ kills I am almost always killed by the circle coming in while fighting other players and the play area will end up killing all of us engaged. This is very boring that the winning style of play tends to be hiding until top 5 or top 2 and while I think the faster bullet speeds and low bullet drop in this game are good they are about the only aspects in this game I would say I really like.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-21,0,0,205,True,Not Recommended,Insted of focusing on the good things about the game I will focus on the things i dont personally enjoy. There are plenty of other reviews talking about the pros anyways.Spelling and grammar mistakes are included in this review english isn't my native language.Pros Fun gameplay Good party game Gets updated Cons Preformance seems to be random as my friend with an old laptop can run it smoothly but one of my other friend with a GTX 970 and I5 6600k can barely launch the game and has many frame drops throught the matches we play. The third person mechanic in this game makes it possible to peak conors without the other person being able to see you. This can lead to boring fights where two people just stand behind trees or other cover waiting for the other person to peak so they can shoot them. (This is a bit more personal than the others) Being outside the playzone doesn't restrict your vision in anyway so its possible to stay outside the playzone and snipe people inside the playzone at least in the early rounds. I personally just dont enjoy this mechanic as I feel like it takes some of the fun away from the game. You can be doing great an entire game clearing smaller cities with your squad feeling like a true spec ops team and get really far into the game where there is only 20 people left just to get shot from behind by a squad running into the playzone. A wooden window frame can seemingly completly block a point blank slug round from a shotgun.I know that some of the issues i have talked about will be fixed in future updates (Like first person only servers) but im reviewing the game in its current state not the final release.Do i think the game is worth 30 ? No not with its current preformance. Judging by gameplay alone this is easily in my opinion worth 30 .

2017-10-04,0,0,156,True,Recommended,Product received for free. This game is the most fun I've ever had getting murdered repeatedly. It's basically naked and afraid KOTH edition. I really enjoy that everyone drops in with nothing. Basically a level playing field at the start which is nice. The frying pan is actually the best squad member you can have and the mini 14 is fabulous. I've only won once in squad but I really don't play to win. I play to run around naked with my friends and try to kill as many people as I can before I go. That said it's horribly optimized. Occasionally building textures will fail to load even several minutes after landing on the island which is basically a death sentence as those first few minutes are crucial. There are some recommendations online to help with this but ultimately only the devs can resolve it permanently. Regarding Stream Sniping It interests me that they could ban anyone for stream sniping when I can't imagine anyone actually running the game effectively while watching videos from the same rig. The memory leaks are simply too severe especially if you use chrome as your default. Additionally the fault in any legitimate case of stream sniping lies entirely with the streamer. Unlike the viewers they can actually set a delay (in their streaming software) from live that would prevent this alleged stream sniping. It is no one else's fault that they are too lazy/foolish to do so. Ultimately I can recommend it based on the fun factor. However it's very possible that if you're any good at actually killing things you could get banned for killing someone who happens to be live streaming at that time. TLDR if you're good at this stuff be advised that you may be throwing your thirty dollars away.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A lot of people also gave this game a negative rating because of some glitches... oh well every game has glitches but these people these people that just experience one glitch immidiatley get angry and give the game a bad review. Lots of people are angry about the region locks i ask why well they are angry because now they need to play in their region? Wait whats so bad about that i wont get angry that i can only play EU... 2. IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THE MINIMAL AND RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS and the game runs smooth gratz. This game runs VERY SMOOTH if you have a decent pc lots of people can confirm that... in my opinion the worst thing about this game are the developers they kinda on their game for example sometimes when servers are busy and all of this your name becomes #unknown you have trouble inviting friends into lobbies etc.3. There is nothing wrong about the game its self really well thought of good selections of weapons very good fighting environment. Lots of people dont like Miramar (desert map) i personally dont like it either but i sometimes play it to break the Erangel (original/first map) streak from what i have seen of the new 4x4 map it looks great. Maybe the developers finally decided to listen to the players thats great!4.

2017-03-24,1,1,112,True,Recommended,"This is one of the few games I have put a review for. For those complaining about performance this is a next gen type game with updated physics and graphics. The PC requirements section aren't for ""max settings"" they are the minimum requirements to play the games on lowest settings possible. computer performance. Period. I only have 2.6 hours from launch day but this is far and above better than H1Z1. More cars more weapons more loot better graphics etc. Yes sometimes the servers are buggy and laggy and stutter. Its day 1 servers are LOADED. Never have waited longer than around 3 minutes for a full 100 person lobby. As for graphics and performance. I'm on an I7 CPU chip and GTX1080 I get between 100 150 FPS on Ultra settings for everything. I am very happy with this as its only around 20FPS less than I get on H1Z1 which has been out a long time. Now for the negatives (which I hope get some attention from devs..)1 Ground movement seems clunky sometimes. Opening doors is a bit slow and getting into vehicles can take a few tries. Have spammed the enter vehicle button a and then gotten back out of the car. This could be better optimized. 2 Parachuting is eh. I understand this is going for more realism but you could double the fall speed when close to landing as it just drags on and on forever. 3 My biggest complaint (which may only apply to groups not solos) is that you cannot pick up additional gear to put in your inventory to give to your team. Example I am looting a big house partner is 5 or 6 houses down. He needs a backpack. Well I've already got one but I can't pick up an extra one to keep when we meet up. He has to find his own or run all the way to me to gather it. I believe this applies to most other wearables (helmets vests etc.). 4 This is a positive and negative. The player crates in the lobby you can buy with points. This could be a really cool thing if the loot was a little better. I spent 700 points got a gas mask. Teammate spends 700 points and got a tie. Like a tie to wear around his neck. Can't even really see it! lolBUT WE HAVE SPECTATING NOW!!! So really the negatives disappear because I can watch my teammates live on!!All in all I expect a lot of good updates hopefully we won't get screwed like with DayZ devs.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-02,0,0,641,True,Recommended,"Figured I'd make a review since their seems to be a surplus of children down voting with their ""60 hours"" and less. PUBG is a phenomenal game. Solo keeps the adrenaline pumping from start to finish duos let you have a chill experience with a buddy and squads bring out the teamwork among your friends. I have 330+ hours on this game as of now and every single match feels brand new. You can decide where you start a match (even if your flight path doesn't go directly over where you want to be you can glide over there.. yes it takes longer but you'll probably be alone.. Consider it the carebear start with you being where you want to be. A win win scenario) I came into this game with no interest in other games like Arma or H1Z1. Tried em didn't like 'em. PUBG came out as a third person game with a promise to have First person down the road before final release. That promise is about to come true and people are still finding excuses. ""Third person is too easy you can peek corners look at this look how easy blah blah blah"" Now first person is coming and its ""The field of view is such a disadvantage I cant believe this is what we get"" Also First Person is getting dedicated servers. So it wont be FP vs TP. FPvFP/TPvTP. Enjoy both. This game does have a SERIOUS RNG element which can be daunting when you first start playing as you may lose gun fights due to a pistol vs an AR scenario... However I personally find the RNG element very satisfying. If certain guns spawned in certain spots nobody would ever roam the entire map or drop in random locations. They'd all drop where the AR's and Snipers are and that would be that. So imagine competing vs 2 people for the AR in the area vs 50 people who want the AR in the area.... RNG is a gift not a curse. (Most times lol) Now. Heres where I'll make something clear for the cry babies. Microtransactions are &gt &gt &gt &gt OPTIONAL &lt &lt &lt &lt The cosmetic items that you receive from said transactions give LITERALLY 0 stat boosts. NOTHING. 2 of the 3 crate options are even available for FREE. People dont have a problem with MCT's they have a problem with RNG MCT's. Yet the same people crying are probably the ones who have multiple skins in CS GO from chests they bought keys for or straight from the MP. Every game has MCT's. E V E R Y G A M E. Except like Diablo &amp SC. But even those get rewards from deluxe edition preorder bonus' for other blizzard games. No stat boosts no valid reason to and whine imo. You paid $30 for this game. (A great price btw I'd gladly pay $60 for this game at release) Yes their are bugs and glitches and cheaters. The games been in ALPHA for 4 months. Give time. You get monthly updates. Weekly bug fixes. A responsive and active dev team. What more do you want man.Worst problems so far... Lil buggy at times Desync is still a serious issue but is to be expected in Alpha. Has had major improvements in the past month though... so don't see this as a problem that will continue. Only 1 map but 2 more are on the way which is exciting. and even that 1 map has multiple weather settings so 1 map may be foggy or rainy or sunset or sunshine... Enough to hold you over.. I'd recommend this game to anyone and just tell them be patient with the bugs. In fact I've personally bought this game for the entire squad I play with. Would love to see a 4 pack deal come out in the future for future players who want to play as a team and save a lil money... but as I said its a steal at $30. The devs are working hard. People need to gtfo themselves about micros.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-26,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,"11 hours of gamepaly and I can tell you the game currently is not worth it.I bought a copy of this for my buddy and I on humble bundle paid about 40 canadian since part of it was going to charity.Blue hole is the studio that ""Playerunknown"" the guy who created the mod went to they are a South Korean company who seems to be new at gaming they have two games out and I think Brendan made a huge ing mistake going with them I'll list the reasons why.Mods on the PUBG site aren't helpful they have been doing more trolling in the bug report and suggestions area than help they ask you to send in then it's mostly players who end up trouble shooting stuff more so than the company.The company blames the engine they are using for the issues they are having the company doesn't seem to know how to code in the Unreal Engine enviroment the current major issues are as follows Hit registration (You will fire multiple rounds and not hit anyone but they will kill you with one round) Netcode (Issues are with the servers mainly since they cheaped the out and went with AWS (Amazon Web servers) these ARE NOT gaming servers they are webservers and voice servers and that's all they should be used for) Graphics are not optimized at all (Graphic textures will sometimes not load till 45 to 50 seconds after you have landed thus normally getting you killed) Support staff isn't helpful (They are snarky and mostly troll on their forums rather than taking suggestions and utilizing them they also randomly merge threads without a merge notice causing people to get lost in threads and then the threads about that needs to be fixed get buried in the bottom.)My rating on this game is DayZ pre .60 patch which as we know was horrible at that time and still isn't great. The game has potential but they need to quit cheaping out since they've made 56 million off of the game and have a engine they pay 3K per quarter for. They also refuse to upgrade that engine since it will cost them money this shows a lack of care and a lack of concern which is something I would expect out of a non triple A south Korean studio since I've had a similar experience with SDEthernet the guys who made Navyfield.Now in saying this I will continue to play since I have friends who play but I will not recommend this product to anyone.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,343,True,Not Recommended,At first it was really fun looting was awesome and the pvp was new and exciting. After about 100 hours and about 50 matches the game becomes boring and you keep losing to the same strategy. I have noticed that now that I have had the game for about a month I am starting to get very bored of it. I have come to realize a pattern in the gameplay and it drives me crazy. I will loot and defend my position in the starting circle for about 5 minutes before having to move to a new location meanwhile being shot at by someone with a sniper who is hiding in a bush. Then if im able to escape I can continue looting only to have to move again in about 5 minutes. This pattern continues and I continue to get shot at by SKS's and Kar98's which I cannot see because the players are camping behind trees or bushes until I get to the final circles where I am then shot by an AKM or M16 who is camping a building and I cannot see where I am being shot at from. I do not recommend this game because it is very hard to see where you are being shot at from and it ruins the fun of the game. Why should I spend 20 minutes looting and getting gear just to be killed by someone I cannot see. Player Unknowns Battlegrounds could be a good game all they have to do is make muzzle flashes brighter and make players stick out more across father distances like Rust. If they would to that this game would easily be a 10/10 but because they havent put this into the game yet I can only rate it a 6.5/10 and I would not recommend you purchase it until they fix this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I like how strict it is in certain aspects but with the ""harrassment"" of streamers doesn't really make sense. Ex. If a squad rolls up to a compound and honks thier horn repetitvely without the knowledge of a streamer being there. Even if the squad is circling the compound what are the odds that they're just trying a new tactic to lure out players? Nah instead it's automatically seen as stream sniping and harrassment. I don't remember who said it but ""Brendan and crew isn't out there to police for streamers or at least they shouldn't be.""

2017-11-05,0,0,249,True,Not Recommended,Let me get this straight. I am NOT leaving a negative review because this game is bad as a matter of fact this game is fantastic and I think once a few things are fixed up it will be a must have for every Steam user.BUT at the moment hackers are absolutely rampant in the mid to high leaderboards. This is because Bluehole signed a deal with Tencent to have the game released in China while Tencent are making these hacks and selling them on the backend. This is seriously damaging the game and making its players very unhappy while little to no steps are being taken to fix this problem as of yet.Also the amount of bugs glitches crashes and game breaks is ridiculous. I have to force reboot my computer around once every 15 20 games because the game will just kill my computer. And that's also not to mention the terrible optimization because even someone like me who has their game on their C Drive running a 1060ti with 8GB RAM experiences consistent frame drops down to 5 15FPS for up to a minute.If Bluehole can just get their together fix the bugs get rid of the hackers and this shady deal with Tencent I can change this review and everyone can play PUBG without getting so frustrated.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-24,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,Save your money and time. Just dont buy this game. Here's a basic description of the game You'll spend around 20 minutes running just to get killed within the first 10 seconds of your very first enemy encounter. You'll get bored of the game after a week. There is no longer any satifaction in winning. Servers are so unstable that 80% of your shots will actually never register. Death Cams are bugged. 80 out of a 100 players lay in the grass waiting for you to pass. Barely any content added (other than crates... that you need to pay for to open). Surprisingly this game is a serious waste of time. Lobby is purely filled with screeching brain cell lacking children or russians. Game still contains hackers. Never recommend dropping in populated zones. You'll find yourself a very nice revolver whilst 12 of the enemies that are surrounding you will some how have a fully attachment loaded Rifles or Sub machine Guns. Sniping is only possible on stationary targets and even then every sniper shot tanks and the enemy disappears in the distance. Etc Etc EtcThe only time this game is relatively fun is when you're playing with friends and not playing to win.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-01,0,0,192,True,Recommended,"F*ck do I play this game a lot! Do I hate myself for it?! Yeah I do! But I just love this game so much that I cannot stop playing it... so let's try to figure out the puzzle on why I hate to love this game. Why I love it Random as Some drops from the plane yields me a drop in po i with a full load out and I am taking out squads left and right! YEEEESSSS!!!! These are the most rewarding drops even when you have 3 to 4 craptastic drops this one drop of ultimate domination makes you feel so boss that the chicken dinner that you may or may not win seems small because you killed a squad or 2 by yourself! The winning and killing in this game is so satisfying! Sound design in this is amazing! Got an awesome headset? Well get ready for some awesome sound! Footsteps and gunshots can all be traced according to the sound and direction. When you finally hunt down that sound and murderlate the squad that didn't know you were there... Is more gratifying than eating that fried chicken you deprived yourself of because you were on a diet!!! Rip your teeth into that fried chicken!!! You deserve it! Why I hate it I am a late night gamer in the US of f*ckin' A! and that is a problem..... the problem? CHINA #1 China #1 China##### 1111111!!!!!"" China China!!!! ARRGGGGG!!!! I HATE THIS SO MUCH! !!!The fact that some of them just leave their mic on and they are in a busy internet cafe is super annoying!! Some times it even drowns out the beautiful sound of the game.... You might as well stop playing in squads because no one at night can understand you because the chinese have taken over the US servers.... this sucks more than a hooker sucking a golfball out of a garden hose. It really sucks and my losing streaks happen when I play at the late hours of the night. No communication no killing no chicken dinner... and I am not a winner. I feel my loses and deaths are not justified.... The bugs and the lag! I can't go a night without network lag. This is forgiveable considering its a early access game and I hope they fix it as well as the bugs like getting stuck in a door falling through the world getting stuck in a tree after a drop and never getting down team chat is silent and you can't get it to work the server is default to Asia even thought your not in asia and there are more I just can't think about them right now.....So why do I recommend this game? Because I love killing in this game. When you finally join randoms that just rock and kick those are the best moment that can only befound in PUBG.The randomness of cars flying because you shot it to oblivion epic sniper battles 4 squads battling it out while you wait in the shadows and car chases out of nowhere are just so unique and unscripted. That when you experience a moment of when you won an ambush by the skin of your teeth with one last bullet of your thompson 45acp that PUBG is so unique and entertaining you just can't stop playing! Even if your random squad can hardly speak a lick on english....I hate myself for loving this game.... help me.... please.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,"Honestly...I mean HONESTLY how fun is this game?Not very.It gets incredibly stale extremely quick. You spawn in run around maybe kill off one or two people and die. Sometimes you get lucky and kill off more than 2 and then maybe you'll make it to the end and get a nice ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!"" message. Then you go back to the lobby and do it again on the same map.Yes the combat gets intense but after playing for a decent amount of time I can say that it's really boring to do the same stupid nonsense every game. I haven't had the pleasure of being banned for stream sniping but as a general player who just played it for a little while I can tell you it's sort of embarrassing to say this is the top Grossing game on Steam. They pulled in SO much revenue and only update the game every 2(ish) months with significant content.The devs are crybaby whiny money grabbing stiffs who treat their player base like garbage and ban people because someone sneezed the wrong way.Microtransactions have no business being in this game because it's early access. They should have used the millions of dollars in revenue to bring on some new devs who actually know what they're doing and release more stable consistent updates improve server performance AND take the game out of early access. I had fun with some friends the first few games I played but beyond that it's nothing special. You honestly would probably get more enjoyment out of watching someone play it on Twitch than playing it yourself.All in all You're paying for a battle royale. 100 players with no real context other than ""kill everyone else"" and when you win you get nothing but 50% in game credits toward a loot crate that you can just buy with real money for some reason.This game isn't impressive and yes it's cool to play what people are playing but do yourself a favor and download Epic's Fortnite BR mode. It's free updated every 2 days or so and you can actually build your own shelter. Way better. Tired of this game getting tons of sales and being updated so rarely.

2017-08-06,0,0,170,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Ok so I think I have a fair amount of hours. When I got this game It was fun had some minor FPS issues due to my cpu only being 2.5ghz upgraded that to 3.6ghz and with a gtx 1050ti I get a stable 90 fps on high at 1600x900. After the last 2 large monthly patches the game now runs like dog poop. Constant stuttering 90% chance that I will get network lag detected. Oh and don't forget a game that has made well over 100$ million in sales has to put microstanactions and say its for testing so we broke people can fund Esports. 1st there is no way this game can be competitive to much RNG in it map is to big even with FPP now the core of this game can not be changed to allow for it to be a competitive esport title. Just because this game has EA strapped to it still doesnt justify so many issues. I have many EA titles and they are all playable and get better with updates. PUBG has only gotten worse with updates.

Controllers are supported but you are better off sticking with a mouse and keyboard. The controller functionality doesn't feel on par with WASD controls.It is still in development so don't lament the first time you run into some friction... I often land to find that the buildings have not rendered. Meanwhile nearby players are gathering loot to kill me with if they haven't already.I would be fine if they stopped development altogether though. I have got almost 100 hours of adrenaline pumping gameplay in. It has been worth every penny I paid for it and I would be willing to spend 3 000 more pennies if need be.It is also worth mentioning how quick the matchmaking is. This is really nice especially when learning to play the game. It is usually less than two minutes from death before I find myself back on the ground trying not to die again.It is fun in solo mode.

2017-09-04,0,0,119,True,Recommended,I would recommend this game to anybody under the following conditions that you should follow 1) Start off by playing solo for a couple of hours then play in a party with friends.2) Do not care about the clothes or 'supplies' that you get from rewards as they are very disapointing.3) Have the urge to get a kill intead of hiding until last 30 as that would give you less rewards or 'battlepoints'.4) Never get angry when you get killed by someone and you couldn't do anything about it. Try being calm and enter a new game or just don't rage.I wouldn't recommend this game under the following condtions that occur 1) Quitting the after dying in the first 3 min of the game.2) Many glitches such as random barriers that you will crash against or getting stuck in doors.3) Getting bad loot can mean you have bad luck and will have a 99.9% chance of dying before last 20.4) You won't spot an enemy when they are hiding in random grass fields that are about 10 meters from you. Rendering is poor in this game.I highly recommend this game if you have friends that play this. Playing alone is pretty boring and you can easily get fed up with the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-15,0,0,351,True,Recommended,"This is going to be long but here's the deal I've now played this game both on a computer that was stacked. (1080ti 32GB ddr4 i7 the works.)I've ALSO played this game on a mediocre PC. (i5 R9 270x 8GB ddr3 the basics)Here how this pans out.This game is severely addicting but it is not for the faint of heart. You will love the game but as soon as the round is over unless you get the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner its easy to feel discouraged but also motivates you to better yourself.The map is ginormous which is both a pro and a con you launch out of a plane (with 100 others) at a location of your choosing based on your map and there are so many large compounds and landmarks to explore and get used to the loot spots for. Really this leaves the tension at max level since it makes it that much less in control.Here's why i hated the game Regardless of whether i was on the good build or the bad the game lagged and glitched in the same ways The map is huge so even with a hefty rig there's a lot to render all at once and it can really drag on your FPS. Not only that but the game is littered still with different bugs and glitches. I've come across one now many times where i can be inside a building that didn't render on my screen but it will still be there for others so i can see people through walls and even shoot them. That might sound like fun and games but that also means a number of bugs that can break the game or simply occur during exremely invonvenient times. On top of all this sometimes you simply don't find any loot. You can drop directly onto a large compound sometimes even by yourself and loot every room in every building with the chance you'll end up with nothing but a pistol or less which really sometimes makes the start and middle of the game almost luck based as the game is 50% distant accuracy which you can imagine is difficult with a pistol or shotgun. Lastly my lead complain The map is almost too big. Not quite so but i find a number of games i spend half an hour chasing the circle which spawns in at random and closes in slowly on a random location and it's nearly impossible to know where the circle will end late game. Too many times have i caught the circle just in time for the next one to start closing in and by the time i finally catch the circles enough to heal up and actually play the game 9 times out of 10 someone is waiting for you on the other side usually from very VERY afar and that's an easy death right there.Really all in all the game is pretty fun. Actually winning a game while rare is extremely rewarding for that reason alone. You'll find yourself enraged as you ready up for the next round. What's the point of anger anyways It IS a ""Battleground""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-01,0,0,510,True,Recommended,If you played The Culling before the cancer patch you will probably like this game. It's basically the same besides a lot more people and the combat is largely focussed around guns. So it will be pretty hard for the developers to make the combat system slower **cough**culling**. A large amount of the complaints for this game are focused around micro transactions. Something to note is that all of the items you can buy on the steam market are cosmetics that in no way alter your gameplay. On top of that if you are like me couldn't care less about running around in a yellow suit. You can just sell everything on the steam market. I've made like 7 dollars by selling garbage to kids with their moms credit card but if you get really lucky some items are worth hundreds. So there is that on top of the game being super fun(mainly with friends). Only con I can think of is it seems to mainly drive off your cpu. So if you have a great gpu and a ehh cpu like me you are probably going to be playing on low medium.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Only one box of bullets can be found in every room.作为一种生存类游戏 玩家可以被发现的弹药太多了 和其他道具 这造成了可怕的后果 球员们为了运气而竞争 而不是为了生存 这更像是一场大型的射击游戏 而不是一场生存游戏 更糟糕的是 太多的弹药和道具让玩家更愿意隐藏 而不是攻击玩家去获得资源 这使得游戏在某些阶段非常无聊 我的建议是 除了手枪 其他枪支的子弹是分开的 不是在一起的 在每个房间里只能找到一盒子弹,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-09,1,1,110,False,Recommended,Only recommending this game for the occasional fun you'll have. Here are some examples of how your first 50 something games will go A. You'll land in a hotspot and be killed before you grab a weapon or while struggling to pick one up with the clunky UI. B. You'll land in an area by yourself and have all the loot you can dream of. Then you'll be killed by someone who drops you before you can even turn around to shoot back. (That'll be a 20 minute game of looting with 0 kills)C. You'll land in a small collection of houses with poor loot. You'll crawl in to each zone like a some stealthy ninja letting enemies run past you completely unaware of your presence. You'll enter the top ten...your adrenaline will start pumping...you'll see an enemy player with his back to you and you'll know that NOW is your time to strike. You'll miss every shot with your mini uzi and they'll turn around and headshot you in your motorcycle helmet.Eventually you'll start getting kills as you continue playing. You learn how to control recoil and land headshots. You'll learn not to take shots if your opponent can grab cover while you're standing in the open. You'll learn that tossing a grenade at an opponent in cover is a good way to force them in to the open.Then you'll learn that PUBG has a horrible de sync issue and that you're getting killed well after you've re entered cover. Oh and sometimes you'll be killed when your game bugs out and an enemy makes no footstep sounds whatsoever. But sometimes you'll play a game that runs smoothly for the most part you'll get a good handful of kills and that'll be enough to keep you from uninstalling. Just take deep breaths and try not to punch your monitor.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Over the course of the last 8 months this game has changed in huge ways. Mostly in not so good ways. Their changes seem to baffle me as to what the developers were thinking. Updates to the user interface the way the game has been ""balanced"" the way the game looks....it went from having a high skill cap to trying to do everything it could to welcome new players into the game. Granted from a company standpoint that is a good thing. As a serious player of the game for a long time the changes they made no longer suit the type of game I wish to continue playing. All crates now requiring keys purchased to open. Adding the level feature like CS GO. Changing weapon attachments which again utterly baffles me. Screwing up the way vehicles drive. Things that have NEVER gotten fixed. Grenade trajectory. Scopes that are utterly garbage like the 3x. Adding weapons in world that should never be found by anybody like the M24.

A couple of new guns and a first person player mode which mind you was just to fix how their original first person was.

You can't just make a game and take all the money and then not give a because you already think its good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if the creator spent all of the money on golden buttplugs.

2017-09-17,0,0,1318,True,Not Recommended,I was gifted this game. I actually love and play it often. let me preface this by letting you know i have a very decent pc that runs almost every game on ultra at 120 144 fps. even poorly optimized games will run passably on my system. But I cannot recommend it to anyone. It's so terribly optimized it's like a bad joke. The framrate is ridiculous there is no reason I shouldnt be able to run pinned at 100 fps or 120. People with a Titan X are dipping below 80 fps sometimes. thats literally the best graphics card you could run this with. And it still doesn't work. Really noticable bad lag in the beginning of every single match. you know? that very crucial time you really want to be picking up guns so you can protect yourself from the people that are right next to you? great. awesome way to start. Lets couple all that with the most awkward UI I have ever seen in any video game and my blood pressure is rising significantly. Did I mention that it defaults me into the AS server every time even though I'm NA? The little things add up PLAYERUNKNOWN. This has been a well known issue with pubg for months. but instead PLAYERUNKNOWN would like to focus on paid dlc and pro competitions for a game thats not even out of alpha! I wouldnt be surprised if it never made it out of alpha. the money has already been made. and those blueholes over at bluehole have already shown me where their priorities lay. and it's absolutely not with making a playable game. When 45% of your matches have server lag youre not ready to do anything with your game. the furthest thing being competitions. Honestly even with the game being somewhat fun by buying this title you're encouraging this type of behavior. I cannot condone it. Show devs that it is unacceptable. I dont know why people follow this guy so much but it seems to me like every single game hes been a part of was a big pile of unfinished crap that made a bunch of money and then was abandoned.

2017-12-29,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Probably not worth the full price. Gets boring very quickly.A friend gifted me this game. I played a couple times alone and it was pretty fun but got rather boring quickly. I played a few games with a different friend and honestly didn't enjoy it at all. We kept dying very early because of lag and bugs.No tutorial. I'd seen some gamplay videos and livestreams earlier but the game would be very difficult for someone who didn't.Proximity voice chat. Everyone starts in the same area and on the same plane and it's very annoying hearing everyone screaming in Chinese when the game starts not to be racist but it is annoying. It is easy to disable voice chat but that disables all incoming voice chat including the people in your party.Tactics. One good thing about the game. Using buildings and landscapes to your advantage of height to snipe and avoid melee attacks and advantage of cover from bullets or for subtlety. Only problem is that this is not unique most other shooter games require use of tactics.Overall the game is by no means worth 30 dollars. I may have picked it up myself were it 5 10 dollars but 30 is completely asinine. A cheaper and potentially more fun alternative would be Fortnite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-02,0,0,656,True,Recommended,Personally I read the reviews for this game and want to add my 2 cents just because most of them are blatant.This game hasnt failed to amaze me in the time I have been playing it.Very well known for its heart wrenching combat its tactical aspects and its rich detail.The game is one of a kind no other will give you such a feeling.Often times I find myself sweating when I last to the final four.As far as the negatives on this game go the game is early access.So yeah you are always going to have some little problem in the game this is wqhy they say its early access.When I bought the game it had rubber banding issues FPS drops crashes loot glitches people modding the game and so on.Within 1 2 updates the rubber banding is gone my FPS have increased and are much more stable my game doesnt crash as often and above all honesty I have been playing the game for 31 hours and havent ran into a single modder.So to end it all I will simply say that this game is only getting better.

The rest of these guys didn't complain when the crates would give you low teir items but now you can buy crates for BP (battle points earned in game) and still have a great time. If anything the crates are the most pointless part of the game and serve no meaning other than cosmetics. You literally do not get guns or any armor or advantages from these craes.

2018-05-04,0,0,653,False,Not Recommended,Was a great stepping stone for the battle royale genre but its time for this game to die. The absolutely terrible anti consumer marketplace is the reason this game is plagued with cheaters so badly that it is drastically affecting the playerbase of this game. To be frank it is sad that a well respected modder like PU can even support a marketplace system like this its just a money grab. A game that requires upfront purchase but then hides cool looking cosmetics behind paid (and some free) lottery crates? I like cool looking cosmetics. I will buy cool looking cosmetics for a game that I have already paid full price for. I will not buy keys to unlock crates to get a 0.0000000000001% chance at getting a good item. The only good thing to come out of this marketplace system is the fact that you can sell things you dont want on the marketplace. Since I've only ever paid the original price for this game I've made my money back and an additional 60$ or so just from selling all the skins I've garnered over time. Unfortunately this is why cheaters are ruining this game and ultimately will be its downfall. If you can make money from this game just playing like average imagine if you won every game because you were speedhacking or aimbotting? When even your average player has the chance to make actual $ from your game selling skins to whales online you know there is a huge problem. This is not what this game should be about. PU is a disgrace to the modding scene and everything it stands for.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-17,0,0,405,False,Not Recommended,"Victim simulator you play as a victim who is surrounded by hunters (cheaters). You can defend yourself by using airsoft guns but it's generally a better idea to just hide in a toilet room and cry. Currently there are two different maps but each is equally boring. It's either Ancient Mexico or Russian Village where every person has a gun in their house. Devs are probably Chinese so they don't even understand their players (devs only know how to say ""China number one"" in English). Everything is basically broken although the game is not that bad.Oh and I forgot to mention PUBG has some crazy DLCs which allow you to turn your character into a superhero with superpowers. You need to pay around 5 10 to get an undetectable no recoil script and you will become a master of rifles! You can also buy teleportation clairvoyance levitation and more!

I myself liked it at first. However as time went on it was already getting stale for me due to the control mess the at first confusing UI and the short lived realism. Not to mention the amount of hackers that have ruined my top ten situations.Granted I did win a solo round on the second day I owned the game. Few people can say that.Then Fortnite was introduced to me by Muselk's channel.At first I was speculative because I was hearing how it was stealing PUBG's idea but when I got into that their take on it is so much cleaner so much more timeless and WAY easier to control and get used to. Not to mention it's just pure genious of a take on it compared to anyone else's attempts.In that light I quickly began to despise PUBG not only for being an already somewhat poorly moderated game and for its poor control design but for how the company literally is screaming at everyone else for their idea being used by them when they weren't even the first to the genre.Bluehole / PUBG CORP get your act together.

Why not do the same for this. People are wasting money on $200 $300 knives for cosmetics. I'm not surprised that it is happening to PUBG. And if you think about it the money from the microtransactions goes to funding the game and making it better. So of course the microtransactions has its ups and downs but it wont hurt anything. And why complain about other people spending their money it's their descision and quite frankly its funny to watch people drop 300 dollars for a trench coat. All in all it is a great game with the amount of loot available. I recommend this over H1Z1 Kotk as it has a better platform and feels smoother whereas H1z1 has a clunky feel to it. The only issue I find with it is it the cars they are very buggy as I've seen a motorcylce have a dead on collision with a Jeep and the motorcycle come out victorious.

I am just as punishing to my teammates there as the spill from mostly non english speaking regions. Not being able to communicate with your team mates is just as infuriating. This is not racism.Put as tonne more servers where they are clearly demanded in Asia and SEW Asia and stop the cascading crush on the remaining servers.

So besides that it honestly just feels good dropping people with your gun I mean one issue is they had zeroing then they removed it for what reason ME battlegrounds? Too much spaghetti code? Ha nah I see it was for the zesty chests wasn't it!Maps As of this review we have 2 maps and me I hate the desert map more than anything. Finding people in the map can go one of two ways it can go the first way which is it s like finding Waldo in the first second of opening your page. And then way two which is looking for Osama Bin Laden that was one hell of a to find for the USA.Guns Honestly guns are simple as I hate having to think do I want this gun or this And that s just a 'me' thing I honestly just think the guns are great and more would be more then welcomed.China Don't lie Brendan Green and the ME Developers you don't want to ban China they pay your in fat cat salary each time they get banned and buy a new copy don t t 'We're working on a fix.' you have had so in long you just want those dumb s to pay your salary and if people wake up and smell the you're feeding them I m sure this game could die faster than it was born. Food for thought ME developers.Final thoughts This game is in all honesty spaghetti code simulator you have no in idea if anything really works you will run drive and die like you re a meth addict in a coma living out all his inner nightmares at once and that s just so beautifully poetic. I honestly loved this game on release I could be so in autistic it didn t matter what I did but now when I actually think I m getting the good the Chinese embassy shows up in my game and just hack the out of me and just cheat. You put achievements in and oh man they were a REAL good idea! I honestly feel both this game and Fortnite could learn from each other but Fortnite really feels like I m taking a refreshing drink were as this game feels like I m a mammoth getting sucked into a tar pit and slowly getting to embrace the sweet black inky end that is Death itself!I give PUBQUEEF a solid Fortnite/Spaghetti Code.Buy your copy TODAY!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,38,True,Recommended,I was on the fence about buying this game. There was a spike in negative reviews a few days prior before buying and numerous complaints about hackers getting banned in game advertising (&lt haven't seen an ad so maybe programmers took them down) and some other things I can't remeber that were complained about. Anyways I took a chance and bought it and walked into the game with a mindset that this game might be a POS. I couldn't have been more wrong. I've been a huge Battlefield fan (Excluding Hardline for obvious reasons and the newest BF) since Bad Company 2 and I also really enjoy Counter Strike. Those are my go to FPS but now I'm conflicted because this alpha release game is one hell of a contender. My heart is racing playing this when I'm inside a house and I know somebody close by is on the lurk. It's like I just hit the best line of coke and I'm watching UFC the adrenaline has my heart pounding so much. The game is still young yet so awesome already. I've been playing this game for less than 24 hours and I'm ready to pull an all nighter on it if server maintanence doesn't disturb my mojo. Look if your not sure if you want this game but have had a GROWING interest watching videos of people playing it. It's time to submerge your balls/va jayjay in it's waters. I give this game 10/10 stars with the hopes/impression it's going to grow into a franchise that competes with the big league FPS games out there. Like if this review gave you herpes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Its standard in all games like this promise or no promise. Yes the games in early access but atleast they are constantly updating the game and moving forwards with development. There shouldn't be a issue with these micro transactions in my eyes it just pays for the game itself! Currently the crates are worth $2+ win enough games and get enough credits and you can just sell the crates and earn back the $30 you paid for the game. This game will only get better and with more funding behind its back it will continue to grow!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,295,True,Not Recommended,Bought the game a couple months ago was fun at the start but once you get the hang of it and win a solo match it is still pretty fun but the flaws become apparent.The game itself is fun I'm writing a negative review because of the developers.Here is why No microtransactions until full release was promized that promise was broken with an Aug 3rd crate coming out. All cosmetics post release will require real money to get out of randomized crates with the possobility of duplicates so expect to spend a lot more money other than for the base game. Custom servers will be behind a paywall after release. PlayerUnkown himself has actually stated he wants to use the CSGO style system in this game so more money there.Devs say a lot of these greedy tactics are to support tournaments however I don't think this is the case. Game has sold 5 million copies mostly 30$ each (Russia is 900 rubles so 17$) PlayerUnkown is showing off vacations to conventions in Korea and more trips to places like Shanghai... so he seems to have little problems spending the money he is making off this game for his own personal entertainment. If the devs can tween fancy pricy vacations there is no reason they need to find all of these ways to nickel and dime players for more money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,1,1,29,True,Not Recommended,"SUGGESTION TO BLUEHOLE Give the main menu a scrolling log panel that displays attempts to open the loading page followed by if it was successful or not followed by a 2 3 second wait message and then another attempt to open the loading page. It would also help if the user is given feedback after 5 or 10 failed attempts so they can go to a help page and find troubleshooting tips. REVIEW The main menu is ridiculously bad stuck on loading so often that I wonder if it's a DNS issue or a server capacity issue. Hitting the ""Reload"" button does nothing half the time. Issuing the commands ipconfig /flushdns and netsh winsock reset seems to work on occasion. Changing DNS servers to Google's DNS servers may help. What surprises me is I can visit https //prod live front.playbattlegrounds.com/ in Chrome and it'll display ""Access Denied"" but in game it just constantly says loading. And this is with Antivirus and Firewall settings turned off. Have probably spent a third of my time trying to get the main menu working it's abysmal. VERDICT Prepare to be frustrated.

2017-05-08,0,0,191,False,Not Recommended,Update Update #12 has ruined this game. Guns can be rare at times and meds are rare which doesn't let you get far. You will search half a major city and walk out with almost nothing sometimes... The gunplay makes no sense with the balance update and makes the game feel terrible. Random sprays get headshots but careful aim is punished with the increased aim punch. I may stop playing due to this update.The game still has the servers go down pretty much everytime I try to play. They still haven't fixed a lot of the jitter through out normal play. That jitter is there even when I have 90 130 FPS. The loot system is also completely unfair. You can have an entire major city to your self and find only a weak SMG then next game die after 5 seconds to a guy who lands on the best rifle with attachements and armour...I am SICK of looting for 30 minutes finding nothing and then dying to someone who has all the best gear. I wish they made it so that looting feels rewarding but it only feels like a game of luck.The game has a lot of fishy players as well. You will watch people 180 shoot someone who is 200 meters away hiding in a building only to 180 and insta headshot you. You will see invisible people who can only be seen by the floating guns they carry. You will also see people who turn a corner and shoot directly at you despite the fact that they never saw you.

2017-10-05,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,Not a fan of this kind of game but this review is mostly against Playerunknown himself. He obviously dosn't care about the game anymore. He is already a millionare and now hes getting greedy by adding microtrasactions before fixing preformance issues. Its also just a stream bait game that is only fun if you play with a friend. Only buy when (or IF) it gets out of early access.UPDATE Nevermind dont buy this its still trash. The full release is a lie. This thing is not done. Playerunknown just rushed the full release to try and get his players back from Fortnite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE BLUEHOLE?! This isn't CSGO where your players expect to be ripped off. Furthermore the fact that you have to earn the crate in the first place to then pay and open it is a slap in the face! Some people I know would take some 10 matches to earn enough for 1 crate so the play time to loot ratio is unfair for most who want to have a good time and end up with something to show for the support they have given your game.Sure the money is important but millions of copies sold isn't enough to give back a bit?The gameplay is good and getting better with each update but I want to see a change in how developers handle microtransactions because when it locks off the sense of achievement then why should anyone play your game?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,111,True,Not Recommended,"While the gameplay is enjoyable with friends the optimization is god awful on both PC and Xbox One ESPECIALLY the Xbox One. The Melee system is trash. Devs go ""Oh yeah we're releasing a major patch on the 20th JK just the 20th for our West Coast Players anyone on the East coast on is 2 AM or later"" just tell us that it's the 21st if most of your player base is going to end up playing the new content on the 21st rather than the 20th. I'm petty as hell. The game is poorly optimized the devs give misleading release dates for patches (Yeah sure it might be the 20th in THEIR own little time zone but for the rest of the country and the world for that matter it's the next day) it barely runs on the Xbox One or Xbox One X (and I primarily play this on the PC) their rules of conduct have too much ambiguity or are plain ridiculous (Stream sniping....In a game where every match is randomized? GTFO. Prohibiting different teams or players from cooperating? Really....It's a fair tactic to last until the end GTFO.) melee is barely functional.DayZ 2.0. Mod creators looking to make a buck off their mod and the execution is more botched than that one in Oklahoma.ATM I'm too lazy (and don't have the time) for some fancy formatted detailed review. I'd rather just give the short and sweet petty moaning version for the time being.oh and get the damned chinese off of NA servers. region lock this bloody game already. it's bad enough i'm stuck with south americans on dota and world of warcraft now it's the chinese in pubg. is it too much to ask for a game that is properly region locked so i can actually play with a population that is more than likely to speak the same language as me and thus able to communicate more effectively?",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,1,1,139,True,Not Recommended,I would say this game is fantastic but it is nearly uplayable with how many god awful bugs and lag it has. Not only everytime I try to play a match I spend the first 7 minutes lagging out of control. So badly things are invisable and I walk through walls. But I also get this lovely bug that makes my curser not properly work when trying to click on anything in any menu. I have internet speeds at 230 mbps a computer that can EASILY handle this game and my mouse works great on every single game I play. I have never have a problem like this on ANY other game I own and I have gone through 30 games in the past 2 weeks without having this problem. I also tried EVERY SINGLE fix in the community to try and get results and still nothing. I set my graphics on lowest reinstalled verified integrity reinstalled all my drivers. NOTHING. It's like as if their software doesn't know how to work with my computer because it only seems to be me who is getting this awful gameplay every time I try to load it. I would of never paid for this game is I knew I'd be spending 140 hours of lagging and trying every possible fix just to play a normal god damn match!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,Now that the game is out of early accsess you would think that it would be in a state where it feels finished (maybe not compeletely polished but at least close to being finished). Without a doubt this game does not feel finished. Everything about it feels clunky and buggy Which isnt helped by the constant server issues and excessive rubber banding. The server issues are extremely frustrating when you have to try to pick up your weapons while being chased down by other players because most of the time you will have to leave empty handed or try to fight off the player while you are being thrown around by the servers.Some of the issues are minimised as less and less players remain but this doesnt mean that its perfect by any stretch of the imagination. It still feels clunky and the game definately suffers from poor optimisation and leads to an experience that doesnt feels smooth no matter what framerate or ping you are playing at.Overall you can get some fun out of it but for the most part it leaves you wanting so much more and I hop that the developers can fix most of the issues but since the game is now officially released i belive that many of these issues should already be fixed. The game still seems like it should be in early access but it has a lot of potential and i hope that that potential is reached.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's been almost a month of development and the server latency is abysmal exploits and hacks are widespread with no action against them and doing things like editing the .ini files to fix things like mouse smoothing and 3rd/1st person FOV from a claustrophobic 60 was blocked.And yet the dev says that the game will come out of early access by the end of 2017 at this rate it'll probably turn out like another dayz.Just don't buy games like these and wait for a AAA developer to take this concept and blow forever early access games like this out of the water.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,75,True,Not Recommended,I fell in loved this game the day i got it i was good at it. And it reminded me of Arma 3's Battle Royal.I won a few games and got close to winning many in my 40 hours of playtime (As of this review). What ruined the game for me was the player base. This game got extremely popular and without a ranking system i am up against people with insane skills. I like a game with a decent player base but i hate PvP games with to little or way to large playerbase's.As this game gets more popular (As with many games) it gets full of hackers. And not just obvious hackers which completely ruin the game there are many small private hacks that make you wonder if they are cheating or not because of they advanced features.I didn't suspect people hacking until i experienced obvious aimbots and teleportations in matches.With the summer sale going on right now even though the game is not for sale hackers will still plague games everywhere. And there is no way to stop ALL of them.I loved this game but with the community full of hackers its hard to enjoy the game that is fully based on PvP. It's another one of those games where they have amazing devs who update the game frequently and listen to their customers and what not but other people have to ruin it by cheating because they are sad and pathetic.I may change my review in the future if cheating in this game is brought up and semi fixed by the amazing devs of this wonderful game. Cheaters ruined the game so this game is not a review to say the devs are bad their amazing (especially Player Unknown for creating this gamemode in the first place). But cheaters have ruined this game so i wouldn't recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-28,0,0,127,True,Not Recommended,Yes I recommend this game but I just want to point out that I played this game for 70 hours and it was TOTALLY FINE. Then one day I wanted to join my friends on it and play it again. It booted up well but it looked like I had pop up ads trying to show on the screen not allowing me to use any of the UI buttons. I reinstalled the game. Checked anti virus and everything was fine. What I mean by that is there were no viruses in my PC. Anyway this might sound stupid but the only thing I could acctually think about happenig is that somehow I am using the asian server of the game. This is extremelly frustating because I paid good money for this game and I can say it was one of my favourite games in my library. I absolutely love it and the fact that some stupid ####ing ads not allowing me to play the game is extremelly annoying and what makes it EVEN MORE annoying is that I don't seem to find any help on google which could mean I am the only person in the EU that is having this probelm. Honestly I would have never given PUBG a thumbs down but this problem is a pretty big one since I can't even play the damn game anymore.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When these players kill me and it shows their name 7/10 times they have Chinese characters or things such as 'SoySaucer' or 'ChinaNumbahWan'. Sure not all of these people are connecting from Asia and sure not only Asian people are playing this game with a huge ping advantage by lagging. But until there's a region lock on servers I'm not playing. It's highly frustrating to be shooting someone and then they slide fifteen feet to the right untouched and blow you away. Besides encountering ping abusers the game is pretty great.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-17,0,0,1135,False,Recommended,"Playerunknown's Battlegrounds I had bought this game during the summer of its release. I was using a $120 gpu and played the game around 45 fps. I only played this game once a day for about 10 minutes since that was all my heart could handle. After owning the game for a month and only clocking in roughly 10 hours i decided to purchase the game for my friend he had the game before but refunded it immediately he was more of a ""Last man standing"" kind of guy if you remember that game. After playing our first game together we realized it was 10x the fun with friends we continued to play that game all day everyday for the next week until one of my other friends wanted the game but couldnt afford it so i stayed up all night gambling away my csgo skins til i could afford another copy after 2 hours of trying i finally had enough. We played the game the next day and had a blast together. We continued to play everyday from the time we woke up til our parents were waking up for work. We slowly stopped playing after performance issues started to arise in the game after a month of 25 fps we completely stopped. Everybody started playing their other favorite games such as ""CS GO"" and other games. Then school started and the game was just a memory we hardly talked about it. Months pass and and next thing i know its my birthday my parents had bought me a GTX 1060. I put that badboy in my pc and something dawns on me why not put it to the test I launch PUBG and jump into my first game after half a year of not playing it. I was sad to see i only got 55 fps until i realized it defaulted me to ultra settings i then switched back to my own settings to see i got a constant 90 fps i continued to play the game everyday. This game will be remembered throughout my life many memories were created from this game many lans were held because of this game i will continue to play it and i will continue to crap my pants everytime a new map is added. Please continue to further improve this game and add more content i will remain loyal to this game as long as you remain loyal to the fans.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-26,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,Bad game overall. Latency and hitbox problems need to be fixed. You will likely lag all over the place just shooting your weapon at someone else. Good luck hitting anyone at range. What you see isn't what the server responds to. Someone can be standing completely still and you will still miss them due to server errors. Only playing because I have a team to play with. Otherwise don't buy for another few months.Edit Make that never. This game is utter garbage. Melee is impossible lag is insane near other people and all the textures twitch. ALL OF THEM. Now it isn't like being completely paranoid at every bush on the horizon doesn't add to the fun but it is stressful.Specs 16gb ramSkylake 6700k980gtYeah. game is crap.Release Edit LAg is gone.

And this is all still in EA so this can also be blamed on the devs for enforcing such an impossible system when the game still isn't anywhere near completion.I have not been banned myself but if I am banned for something like that I can very well tell you that they have lost a player until I would be unbanned and the system is changed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-02,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,the game is some what fun (extremly repetitive) but fun that aside though the support it garbage i created my account started playing and quickly noticed i wasnt earning Battlepoint every game my reward is betwee 100 300bp and once at the main page it stays at bp N/A so i contacted support and while i waited 3 days for there reply i looked into my issue to find that this has been a recurring issue since the launch of the game havent done the slightest thing to fix it... so i wait for the ticket to be responded too which it was and the kindly asked when the problem started told them since i first played waited 2 3 more days for them to respond again this time Greetings Thanks for contacting Support. Unfortunately we are not able to adjust player stats or currency. There is no troubleshooting that Support can provide that we know resolves this bug. If you have not already done so please post about this on our forums as this is where we're collecting bug reports. (which i find hilarious because there are plently of solutions such as reseting my account/deleting it and allowing my to remake one.) so then contacted steam and asked for a (temporary) refund so that i could either re purchase the game or gift to my other steam account in hopes to fix the issue and was denied. so it is very apparent to me that niether steam nor En Masse give 2 about customer satifaction and they just want are money and so i am here to tell everyone DO NOT BY PLAYERS UNKNOWN its just a complete rip off of h1z1 king of the hill mode which is sad because h1z1 is currently 10$ cheaper than pubg and has A LOT MORE CONTENT such as an open world mode very similar to unturned just with way better graphics. so dont buy PUBG go buy h1z1 its cheaper better and doesnt just act like bugs dont exist and keep taking peoples money despite knowing theres a problem and not resolving it,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-09,0,0,126,True,Recommended,"This game is pretty damn fun. I have about 40 hrs in it which isnt that bad for me considering that i dont play games continuously because of my low stamina. It is game that is incredible to play with people. The cooperative aspect is a must. Even though the map is the same each game can be totally different. This game provides me with insane heart pounding sweat inducing action that many games dont provide. Now I know that there is a new game called Fortnite that is free and I do recommend you play that one as well but never forget about pubg. Pubg is a game that will last a while because of how scary and competitve it is. I mean honestly every time i hear a bullet wizz past me i ing jump. However the biggest concern of the moment right now are the bugs including the infamous ""network lag"". This is the biggest drawback to this game. The server connections are always so prepare to wait for the game to respond. My ISP is bad so literally every time i jump out of the pant and land I encounter this monstrous amount of lag that lasts between 7 12 min. My game freezes and i cant move at all or leave the game.

2017-09-13,0,0,338,True,Not Recommended,"Pros Fun very addicitive with a group of friends.Cons Hit boxes are trash. Not sure if it's lag in the server itself or what is causing bullets not to register but over all the hit box/reg is completely trash. Ever played a FPS where your shots that should hit dont hit but your shots that looks like they shouldn't hit HIT?! This game is one of those. There are one toooooooo many times where someone lives that shouldn't have. I've watched streamers and youtube videos where people take 2 3 shots from a Kar98 to the head and still love or doesn't get knocked out. Game is solely based on RNG once you drop out of the plane. UNLESS you drop into a populated area (big towns abundant places to loot) with a bunch of other people. This makes the game fun sure but no one likes to go into a game jump into populated area hopefully first room you find has a shotgun so you can blast the others. Bad luck and you get killed matchmake and wait another 2 3 minutes for a game to start if you die again then go back to step one and match make AGAIN. Pretty much just keep doing this until you get lucky and kill people and grab all of their loot. Non populated areas or areas where there are 3 6 houses sometimes offer complete trash loot. Pistols 10 x red dot sights level 1 helmet level 1 backpack etc etc. Now before you guys go ""Well dumb*ss go to where there is loot!"". Not everyone likes to play the play style of jumping into a crowded area and fighting to see who gets the good loot. some people go towards the lighter areas and hope to find at least an assault rifle and go from there. Melee or fist fighting in this game is again HORRIBLE! My friend gets knocked down but he also knocks the other guy down I run in there and see that the other guy's friend is reviving him. I run up and throw at least 8 9 punches he revives his friends and then turns around and kills me. $ % !#$% % ?????????? Other times you land after parachuting and you go straight to someone to fist fight and once again hits don't register when they should and do when they shouldn't. Sometimes when you land on perfectly flat land you lose half of your health. I am guessing this is a bug/glitch? sometimes when you land near a tree or building you kind of just float with your parachute open you don't really ""land"". Vehicles in this game are not too bad 3rd person but driving them in first person is pretty annoying. Small bumps gives you big air and big bumps kind of just stops your car and causes you to lose health. If you get hit with an SKS with a supressor from farther than 1000M you're pretty much dead. You can barely hear the shots and the direction of blood splatter on your screen DOES NOT point you to the correct direction. I guess they did this on purpose? I don't know. Have lost a handful of games from shots/people I can't even see/hear. Pew pew whish whish and you're dead. Vehicle sound and door opening sounds are bugged at times. I was hit by a car that didn't make any noise until I was already dead. I always close my doors when entering a house and was killed by someone who I never heard the door open. This isn't just complaints other people have experienced the same non sense.In order to be good at the game you have to pray to RNGESUS or just be lucky with your shots in the beginning and get teh good lewt. SKS or any other sniper with an 8X + supressor and just camp it out. Head towards the circle as soon as it opens up and find a mid high level area to take cover. Being the first one there gives you the advantage. In the end it's all about positioning once the circle is too small. Go watch some folks on twitch before you buy and pay attention to how they lose when they lose. It may steer you away and I personally don't blame you. More balancing could be done to make it fair for everyone. 5% skill is needed to play this game the other 95% is luck and RNG.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-25,0,0,143,True,Not Recommended,Okay so here's the way it is I like this game. The gameplay is fun and its super competitive. Sometimes the hit reg is sorta bad but obviously better than CS GO. Here's where we get to the reason I do not recommend this game. This has got to be the LEAST optimized games I have ever played in 5 years of being on steam and 7 years of playing video games. When you join a match for most of the community there are many types of ways the game breaks.1. The game gets stuck on the loading screen AND NEVER WORKS.2. You get in but the game crashes. 3. You get into the match but none of the buildings actually load properly and you can walk through them and see through them as well. 4. You get in the match but the buildings don't even show up. You can see EVERYTHING around you but cannot enter a building AT ALL to get items.Also in general the game is super laggy for a lot of my friends and doesn't work almost half the time I try to get into a match. All in all I like the base game. And I really didn't want to give it a bad review. But the game is so unfinished that I cannot bring myself to write a positive review recommending the game in it's current state. The amount of bugs in this game are SO BAD most of the time that I don't actually want to play the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

What this game is lacking is the intuitive features like Fortnite rolls out keeping their game interesting with unique features. This game inhaled a lot of money and I'm assuming they thought they were going to stay on top without offering much more.They could easily still turn this game around but they'd need to give a lot to their players to get the fan base back up.

However it's a early access game which means they are testing the game and some functions out including microtransactions. The microtrasaction is not game breaking and it dosent make the game a pay to win game. You can buy a key to open a crate for a article of clothing. Like is it really that big of a deal over clothing that has nothing to do with gameplay no.Overall the game is a fun game to play. It needs work on performance but with monthly and weekly updates the game should be running smoothly before release. I love the game alot.

It has many problems fixing those and then adding more content and game mechanics which has been promised before should be the priority.According to Steamspy the game sold around 5 350 000 copies so far that means after the 30% cut of Steam they made roughly 100 million dollars before taxes. They barely had to spend on any marketing either so my guess is that's enough revenue to get this thing actually finished without the need for a few more millions.3. They said they want that money to launch the first PUBG eSports event during Gamescom.As I've said before they have enough money so might as well fund this tournament by themselves. Even then we still haven't got our final product what we paid for.Competitive games tend to have a team composition with selected weapons and roles the gamemodes or the maps usually even out the chances for both participants and the outcome of a match comes down on pure skill and/or teamwork.Here from the very moment of your feet touching the ground RNG takes a HUGE part in the experience. It affects your loot it affects your positioning by the placement of the circle.When you can camp inside a 3 level building with an SKS and at least lvl2 armor on you for like 20 minutes while others have to run kilometers to be inside the playzone or even better drive there so everyone hears you and knows your position before you even realise there are others in the area than the chances are far from equal.I have no idea how it's going to work without altering the gamemode or the loot system. If they do than it's not really the same game anymore. If they don't than it's not competitive gaming but a little get together sponsored by the devs.Oh and of course the game is unfinished it has many problems yadayada. Altough i haven't mentioned many of them especially from a technical standpoint they are still there and should be taken care of before holding competitions with prize pools and such.4. The devs promised there will be no microtransactions until the game is finished.No comment on this this was a straight up lie.Now it feels like the Early Access warning has been just stamped on the store page and has no actual meaning anymore since the game is being treated now as a complete product or at least that's how it feels like so be aware. Original review It runs quite well on my rig so i won't complain about optimalization issues. However the servers are just garbage. Issues with hit registration and such are rampant. Sometimes even opening a door can be quite a challenge.The game mechanics themselves work well the gunplay is great the vehicle physics are okay for a game like this looting and the inventory system are straight to the point. Character movement is responsive enough never felt like I failed because of a crappy camera or way too long animations and such. SOLO ONLY EXPERIENCE Now my biggest problem with this game lies at it's very core the battle royale mode. In the first few hours it was very satisfying to get into TOP10 or at least TOP30 most of the time but that initial sensation wears off quite fast. Then the realisation comes it's all about luck and RNG especially in the last few minutes of a match. Anyone who isn't the last one alive is considered a loser doesn't matter if you are 2nd or 99th. If you aim to survive as long as possible (which is the goal of the game) it gets quite demanding physically and mentally. You have to listen to noises made by other players force your eyes to notice very few pixels in the distance sneak around be all tactical plus the anxiety because you have only one chance per round. This is a drawback because the amount of energy invested doesn't get reflected in my fun o meter or ingame rewards.First it can get quite boring since most of the time nothing happens until the end of the round.Second this type of gameplay contradicts the impression of ""just hop in and play"". And why is that impression? Because there isn't any kind of progression system gearing or anything involved outside of matches that would affect the actual experience. Press a button get thrown into a lobby instantly and go.If you just glide down to the most populated areas to have some fast action the chance of getting killed fast is quite high. Wasting around a minute in a lobby and another one until you reach ground just to die maximum five more minutes later rinse and repeat do the same thing over and over again isn't so much fun either in the long run.It might be able to give me a totally different impression if I'd join premade 4 man squads but playing solo is just...meh.EDIT I've tried a few rounds with both premade and random squads.It's a bit better and less chaotic due to the fact that getting shot at by someone from somewhere doesn't result in an instant death but only a knockdown. This leaves much more room and time to respond to the situation both for you and your teammates. However dying in the first few minutes is a pain in the butt because oh boy spectating for the rest of the match which can take up to 20 25 minutes is just a no.And the rewards...everyone gets less than half of the currency compared to what solo offer which is really contraproductive in an online game.Apart from all this the reason why i give it a thumbs down is because of the price/value. I'm aware that it's early access but I'm going to rate a game by it's current state. Promises and such isn't going to cut it anymore too many negative examples from before.At this point the 30 euros pricetag doesn't feel in par with what the game provides and how it provides. A single map and a single gamemode with a little bit of character customization that's all.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-04,1,1,2757,False,Recommended,I rarely write reviews koz im LAZY AF ... but duo to the negative bombing of this game for the stupidist of reasons.. I have to write something abt thisHISTORYThis game was created by a Bluehole ever heard of them before ? Guess not so that's 0 exp for you.. the team consisted of a few members the creative director is a casual gamer/modder.. these guys are not ubisoft EA WB.. Then Boom the game gained alot of popularity the game topped every single game on steam.. set a new bar for all other games.. Did they expect that.. no they had no idea how far where they going.. no one did.. So what happens next.. a weak infrastructure unexperienced team low human resources available.. WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN NEXT ! they would suffer Servers can't handle the crazy amount of players. the Dev Team were put under a huge amount of pressure.. they are finding it hard to rebuild their infrastructure while coping with Whiny kids demanding insta fixes! Big AAA games take years to develope.. while pubG ( not plunkbat.. whoever created the name plunkbat ) need to rebuild bad net codes.. renovate infrastructure.. redo millions of bugs in there game.. THIS IS ALL LOGICAL.. So YES the game has server struggles.. the game has bad tickrate the game can be laggy the game is not well optimized the game can you off at times.. but given the circumstances.. the game is GREAT .. you can't expect more from such a start.. If you look at the game's status when it was launched until now you can't deny the HUGE improvement they've did on all fronts.. cheaters servers gameplay maps.. and seeing them going forward like this i have to say the future is bright for this one.. ( unless Evil Epic mess things up for them ) .. Then come the little who nag abt crates keys microtransactions.. DEAR kids.. as long as its not pay 2 win no one is forcing you to buy anything Heck i've sold cosmetics worth of 90$ .. i buy keys open crates sell.. or just sell right away.. that's the smart thing to do ! i've bought most of my games selling csgo crates pubg crates trading cards.. SO STOP Whinning.. moreover in life there are different teams doing different tasks .. some do bugs some do community teams some do cosmetics.. so cosmetics or not fixes will happen when they are bound to happen.. Community team respond to players way better than big AAA companies.. Simply Put if you want to play this game enjoy the battleroyale gameplay.. you have to bare with the problems and understand why they happen.. otherwise just uninstall.. stop crying all over twitter discord reddit steam.. its really off the mature patient and loyal fans of this game!Update I have to add the last 3 updates to this game improved the performance a bit added new guns and QoF improvements.. i see this gaming going the right way !,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-25,0,0,56,True,Not Recommended,Since the latest updates the game has improved but not by much. There is still weird visual glitches. For example the red dot scopes have this flashing black box that pops up. There is stutter in weird locations. No its not my computer as it always happens with the squads im playing with also. There are game breaking glitches in this game that make it unfair as well. The biggest example is the fact I was playing with a buddy in a rain level which covers sounds well. He did not get the rain sound so he could hear foot steps and cars just fine unlike anyone else. Huge advantage but completely unfair. That just means there are others that are having the same glitch making it unfair.Shooting from a vehicle is impossible as its not smooth. Vehicles and driving are a joke you will hit the smallest rock in a car and go flying in the air doing barrel rolls for years. Jumping over things is frustraiting. Simple jumps even sometimes mess up badly. When you are in the plane YOU STILL CANT HEAR ANYTHING BUT THE PLANE. One of the biggest problems is if you have your voice chat on and you can hear everyone. You will notice the huge number of racist people. It seems like if your racist this is the game to play. Its a huge turn off and made me completely have to mute my chat. You cant go around reporting everyone and you cant even tell who is talking half the time. Its pretty bad.Its a fun game do not get me wrong. Its just not up to par with other games yet. Great potiential and I will keep updating when patches come out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-03,0,0,312,True,Not Recommended,After many Duo Squads and Solo games I have came to a few conclusions. While the game for hte first few hours can be intriguing the later game becomes frustraiting for many reasons. 1. The Large map is a bad idea and I mean BAD. While it leaves alot to explore and gives you what seems to be more replay value it also leads to a lot of treks across the unknown with little to no cover. No real forests or rock clusters really leave 50% of the map open field.2. No way to practice shooting other then land in a populated city. Then the chances of surviving are slim to none. 3. The blue circle while a great idea on this large map makes it more of a hassel. 4. Not a true survival game.5. Takes 4 5 Shots to bring most people down. Even head shots seems to just ping off. (Hacks)6. End Game! 95% in a open field leaving you no choice but to lay prone and hope all the hackers have been killed. Also pray your inside the circle.7. You land in a huge city. I survived and I have gear this is going to be better... Where is a car? I see some. (Run over) Crap those are blown up or rusted out. Isn't this a huge city? The circle is approaching! I have to run no time. (You Die From Getting Shot Running In Open Field)My suggestion. 1. Smaller maps 1/4 Size with 50 player matches2. More Circle Reductions with Shorter Timers3. A Practice Range 4. Incorperate Wounded in Solo instead of having to shoot a clip into someone. 5. When wounded you can heal yourself but alot slower then with help. A 30 Second Timer? Whatever...6. More More and More trees rocks house clusters and things on your map for cover. A group of trees would be nice. Should I say a forest?7. Ban ALL Hackers and set Servers based on IP8. Raise the damage of all weapons. Yes it needs to happen #unloadclipsWhile I am not stating anything new these are the things that are needed to make this game playable for most people. I find myself with 2 4 kills a game (If lucky) and then dieing from the blue death circle. I like to play games with good graphics so I have my settings rather high and feel that the minuimum needs to be raised to creat a level playing field. My grass shouldn't have to look like mindcraft. I get 50FPS with some spikes but playable. The new map set to comeout sometime soon should give the game a little better backbone. The way I see it though is as long as the game is making money why should they change it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Even though the devs need to really do some work with this game it is in no way bad. This game beats all of it's current competition like H1Z1 ect ect.. I can almost compare this game to a roller coaster. It can make you feel like you want to play more be better aim better be better and be the last man standing shinning above all or it can make you want to uninstall and get a refund. The pros You can play this game with friends or just random people for the most part they random people are nice and want to win just as much as you do so no need to be so worried about soloing.The cons The NA server are filled with Chinese people. I'm not rasict but when most of the lobby on the NA servers speak Chinese instad of english there is a blantant issue. #LockTheChineseServers This game is totally worth the money in my opinion and currently stands as my favorite game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-29,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,Watched a number of youtube videos of people playing this game and was excited to try it out. So far I find myself thoroughly dissapointed. I'm sure the game could be fun but so far my rounds have started out so disasterously that it just feels really tedious.Because you constantly have to start over in a new round the initial learning curve is pretty tedious. I've played 5 rounds so far. one round I couldn't find a weapon before being shot to death one round I found a pistol was able to kill someone with it that entered the building but took damage doing so. Which alerted another player to my presence who bolted in with a shotgun and anhilated me one round I tried parachuting into a less popular area at the start. Unfortunately someone parachuted there with me. They found an assault rifle right away I found a pistol. I got destroyed. Another round I couldn't find anything but shotguns and pistols. Finally the gas forced me to move out of town towards the circle into a clearing and I got wrecked by someone with an AR 200 yards away with no means of returning fire in any real way. The last round I just played all I kept finding was pistols. Hoping to avoid the above situation I stuck it out and I finally found a Scar L. But by the time I found it the gas had already been moving in. It quickly moved past me and I wasted 75% of my life trying to catch up with it. By the time I reached it the time had already expired for the circle to constrict again and I had to run for my life to stay out of the gas. After a few minutes of just straight running I finally reached the circle and immediately got gunned down because I had no real cover as I didn't have time to strategically move with cover since I had to avoid getting stuck in teh gas again. Honestly I think I would have preferred getting killed much earlier so I didn't waste that time essentially holding down W and praying for my life.It looks fun when you have weapons and have time to scan your horizons try and find enemies and use strategy to win firefights. But so far the vast majority of my experience hasn't even afforded me much opportunity to do this. I'm either immediately outgunned or I have to wait too long to try and get a gun and get out of the area that it just becomes about me trying to get away from the gas.It's not much fun at all. Kind of I wasted 30 bucks at this point. I'll try to update this if I change my mind or something changes. But so far at least for me this has been a huge dissapointment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-25,1,1,2485,True,Recommended,Having 500+ hours played on PUBG more than 50 Chicken Dinners (Wins) and almost 900 hours in H1Z1 KOTK I have to recommend this game for everyone.At first you will need to get used to things like Bullet dropRecoilThe Safe ZoneMap/Building LayoutsLootingMovementLike anything you try for the first time practice makes perfect.SOME Things I like about the game Variety of Weaponry In PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds there are a huge variety of weapons to use to murder your foes. Currently at 20+ PUBG offers a fairly big collection of ARs DMRs SMGs Sniper Rifles LMGs Shotguns Pistols Throwables and Melee weapons to come across while looting. Let's not forget that there are almost 40 attatchments to attatch to your guns which alter recoil bullet spread and more.Skill CeilingFrom aiming and knowledge of bullet drop to jump crouching out of a window (I am aware that vaulting will eliminate this) to positioning knowing the right time to attack your target and learning spray patterns PUBG has a pretty high skill gap. Don't get me wrong even pros get killed by plebs with double berrels sometimes. Knowing the ins and outs of Po i (EEEEEE) and things like recoil patterns can give you a huge advantage over players most of the time.Reliable Hard working and Open minded DevelopersA couple months after PUBGs release the devs changed a looting mechanic where when you tab drag an item into your inventory it would make you do a pick up animation and also had a pickup delay that was slow and sluggish. Normally when you enter a room you can easily press tab and swiftly drag an item or items into your inventory and move on with your day without any delay at all. The community was concerned with this change and asked for it to be reverted to it's previous state. Soon enough the developers replyed saying that they would reroll the mechanic change. This is only one example to show that the developers are open minded and that they care and value the communities opinions. They push out small weekly updates and huge monthly updates that fix bugs add features and weapons and changes to the map we have currently (Erangel).Things that ARE being worked on Optimization and PerfomanceSome people playing PUBG are having trouble running the game. When playing I usually get 90 140ish FPS which is nice but there are some times where I go down to the 50s which is not pleasent. I can not wait for the day that I can get a perfect 120 144fps. They are working on the optimization and they push out fixes that help FPS every update.For extra information I currentlly have a Geforce GTX 1070 and an i7 6700k with 16GB of RAM.Overall the game is very fun and enjoyable I recommend to give this game a try (especially with friends).If you want to see many of my highlights playing PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds check out my youtube channel where I make Highlight videos weekly! https //www.youtube.com/channel/UCttCif95sLE4kqZPyW7CMKA,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Frame drops for some players the environment doesn't render properly ( because you have AMD ).Verdict Great game. Its an early acces so don't expect the best performance but it's definitely worth the money. Fun to play with friends.*UPDATE* After I wrote this review the developers updated the game with apparently some new content as well with some performance improvements.

2017-05-21,0,0,94,True,Recommended,Okay this game is very very fun especially with friends it becomes a blast. The Gun Handling is amazing the map is beautiful etc. But the only real problem I have is the what the currency is used for in this game. It makes no sense why would you make it only used for player customization. I understand why they didn't want you to lets say unlock weapons to spawn with. But the least they could do is create a Skill tree or something along those lines. Just to the very least give another incentive to continue over and over again. Which is exactly what i'm going to do for most likely over 100 more hours. But like I said if the Devs read this or people like this idea ask the Devs for this. Maybe the skill tree doesnt have to improve gun handling or accuracy (Even though that would be amazing) Maybe it can just be passive skills like armour while worn by this character its defense is upped by a amount. Or that healing items increase more health. Or if they want to expand it into weapons maybe increased accuracy etc. Or even maybe your can go faster than the cars allow if you mess with the engine a bit (LIke a tinkerer ability to make certain cars go faster or to tinker with rifles to make them go full auto instead of Semi Auto.And after all that is said this is just my personal opinion if the devs of they read this. If they just throw this out the window then oh well it's their game and it is awesome.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-29,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,Summary RNG ! Fun gameplay.Audio balance is poor and not customizable.9 Parts walking simulator to 1 part firefight does not make for an enjoyable shooter.Client synchronization is iffy.Hackers are a thing.Paid loot boxes in a game I already had to buy. My rating for the game Hard pass. I wouldn't recommend it even if it were free. Full review If you think there is even a small chance that you will not enjoy this game don't waste your money on it. Its essentially all of the worst aspects of a shooter game rolled into one hot mess. Most of the game is wandering around hoping that RNGesus has blessed you and that you can find half decent equipment. A small percentage of each game is engaging with other players. Due to the very loud gunshots and very quiet footsteps a lot of luck is involved as to whether you will kill someone before they know you are there or vice versa.The gunplay may or may not be any good but since there is only one game mode (battle royale) you won't really have much time to find out. Once you die thats it. All of your time and effort will have been for nothing. You get to spend another 1 to 2 minutes just standing around waiting for a round to start. Then you get to spend another 1 to 30 minutes hoping to gear up and not die again. There is also an issue where what you are seeing and what other players are seeing is not in sync. This leads to being killed by people who aren't looking at you. Its very easy to see if you spectate another player and watch how all of their shots are no where near the enemy but still count as hits.I also ran into hackers twice (that I knew of) in the 9 hours I played. One was speed hacking and the other was using an aimbot. Oh yeah and they have loot boxes. Of course the keys to open those boxes cost real money to buy.

Despite the technical difficulties things are actually getting better. When I first purchased the game I couldn't even open my inventory without the game freezing up for seven seconds an eternity in a competitive shooter where one headshot can remove thirty minutes of planning. Solo play is dominated by campers but creates some of the most heart pounding an intense moments in gaming that I have experienced in years. Squad play is definetly superior to me it allows you to be more aggresive and focus on teamwork and tactics and trash talking your friends when they make judgement errors and then are in time out for the rest of the match spectating you because they died. This is a terrific game and continually getting better. There are serious issues still to be ironed out including the lobby where you create and join and then connect to matches however if you can overlook having to refresh your UI inbetween matches for squad play there's a lot of enjoyment to be had during gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If they're not camping in a house with a shotgun they're camping in a bush with the terribly OP Kar 98 (The Kar REALLY needs to be found only in crates).

2017-08-16,0,0,15,True,Recommended,"I don't post reviews often. I'm reviewing while this game is on Early Access. It's amazing. The first few games I played did not feel great but the more I played the more entertaining it became. The shrinking play area makes the opening moments very tense as you scramble to get gear. The random generation leads to some truly amazing emergent gameplay. The first ""chicken dinner"" (win for my team) that I got was in a field of hay. It was rainy and it was hard to see what was going on. We were crawling in the field trying to get a bead on the enemy. We heard some fire jumped up to find where it came from. I got hit and was felled. The play area was shrinking and I was caught outside the field and died. Even though I was dead my remaining two teammates were still in the game. The field was so small and my two teammates were prone in the hay hiding and hunting for the remaining two enemies. It was tense. One wrong move and we could have lost. The enemy fired first my teammates got a beat on the two enemies and took them out immediately winning us the game. The next game my teammates got killed early on. One left a present for the enemy a grenade taking himself out with them. I was alone with a crappy double barrel shotgun and 10 rounds of ammo. I kept finding accessories and no other weapons. I got pretty far just running away from other teams and sneaking as far as I could as the circle got smaller. I got into an open field and crawled trying to stay out of view. I saw a plane fly over to drop cargo. I stood up and right before I could react I got run over by a car. Hearing my teammates laugh when that happened was pretty great.A+",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The more I played and the more I watched it became apparent that geographic postioning became just as important as finding that sniper rifle or securing the care package.This game is for those who enjoy clear communication team work and patience you can go through an entire game without seeing anybody until the last few minutes and then end up in a firefight equally you can run the entire game not see anyone and get headshotted by an unseen assaliant.It is frustrating and exhillarating in equal measure with new guns being added and talks of a new map and weather cycles I see myself playing this game for a long time to come.And hating myself along the way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After a short while the red light came on in an instant everyone around me was sucked out of the back of the plane like young girls collapsing at a Justin Bieber concert. My 14 year old video game prodigy R and squad leader told us to land at school I thought maybe because he forgot his backpack or a homework assignment we followed our order and heeved out of the pack of the plane. We immediately lost a squadmate because he has an AMD only setup and disconnected/crashed into an entirely different game our other friend JJ thought he would be hipster and land at ruins but never made it to the ground as he fell through it. At least he tried shouting out as many enemy positions as he could while drifting into the no clip abyss below. It was my and R left as two. I started collecting gear when R came under fire to some guy named bananaman. R's pre pubescentvoice screached the proximity chat and nearly saved his life by disorienting the opponent but he was gunned down because he refused to remove his 8x scope off his M16 poor bastard saw the acne on the Rick And Morty watching shrek that killed him. After R went down I enraged with fury losing three squadmates so quickly was not what I signed up for. I took aim at another enemy nearby.

The game is so much better than H1Z1 King of the kill. For example the way killing players works is so much better in PUBG This makes it easier for me to kill players.

This is one of the most interesting forms of Battle Royale that I have seen. With this game being in beta and having only released recently it trumps the other battle royales similar to H1Z1.Now to go with the good and the bad The Good 100 Person PVP Limited Open World Single Duo and Squad Gameplay. (1 +2 and +5) Customization Variety of Gameplay Not Pay To WinThe Bad Glitchy Sometimes slow Ethernet drops Frame Rate bombing areas and sometimes textures seem blurry if not given enough time to load. Randomly Crashes Limited Customization (Crates are time consuming to obtain and you get duplicate items constantly. These duplicate items ruin the chances of getting high end gear.Now considering the small list of the good and the bad I do overall recommend this game to anyone who is patient and has had experience with beta's.

2017-08-31,0,0,11,True,Not Recommended,"As of the current state of the game I cannot reccomend it. There are way to many glitches and bugs (and some features that are just utter yes I realize it's early access but I feel like at the top of the ""To Do"" list should be fixing the firing glitch. Not even 5 minutes before writing this I come out of a building and I see someone waiting for me. Armed with my S12K I line up the iron sights to my opponents head and I click the LMB. Nothing happens. I click it again still nothing happens. Gun was fully loaded with 5 shells in it. But this ing glitch makes my gun not shoot and my opponent kills me. Glitches that ruin the game like this one should be fixed as soon as possible. And it's not just this. There's the fact that people can get left behind on the starting island or if someones textures don't load they can drive through walls in a car. But it's not only glitches that make this game not worth buying. It's some features too. Like the whole ""Outside of Playzone"" crap. Yes it's good that you make the playzone smaller it makes the games go much faster because it would take a very long time to find the last person in a massive map but you can't out run the playzone barrier. If you're not already inside the Playzone you'll be able to maybe loot a couple of houses when the game first starts before you have to focus on constantly moving to the Playzone. You get shot and need to search houses for a First Aid Kit? Too bad you don't have enough time! And then if you get caught outside the playzone? Well good luck surviving. You're health slowly deteriorates and you have no time to heal. You have to keep moving and pray that you can get back into the Playzone before the barrier starts moving again. It's a load of The only way to outrun the playzone is to find a car and good luck being able to consistently do that.

2017-08-08,0,0,1003,True,Recommended,"I did put yes on this game however let me be clear on this. I don't think you should buy it just because other people are buying it.Do not compare this to H1Z1. The playstyle is completely different even though it being the same ""game mode"".If you're not that very good at FPS you still can have lots of fun with this game.This game does contain RNG. HOWEVER it is not enough to blame the RNG on you doing something dumb.This game is very tactical and if you like to play it seriously strategy can overcome the RNG part of the game. Although if the odds are in your favor good one but that still does not mean you win. If you're bad you will still lose.Also not to mention all RNG still has % and calculations put into the ""Randomness"" but it still can be factored down to where the circle actually goes and what's more probable than certain spots(obviously not the first circle although they did change it to where if you go to an off beaten path it is more likely you will have to drive to the circle)This game is far from perfect and there are many bugs. Some may be game breaking. So don't expect things to be perfect and take it for what it is.Also I know that recently they added ""microtransactions"" but come on dude you seriously are complaining about skins. LOL you have got to be kidding me. Who cares? If you're not going to pay for something and complain that something costs money when it has little to no effect on the game please do me a favor and look at any other MAJOR game. You HAVE to pay if you want to play new content while this is just purely cosmetics. Aside from that shenanigans I've played 550+ hours and I may not be the top 10 or anything but take my opinion with your interpretation.This game reminds me so much of the DayZ mod on arma nothing will beat that game or even come close to it. However the playstyle of this game reminds me so much of it and that's why I play this a lot. It does have a lot of replayability and probably will be one of the top games played for a decent while.I just hope that the devs don't do some to make this game unplayable and take a wrong turn. All they need to do is open up custom servers and let people do individual settings with the blue and other settings as well. That should open up many possibilities for even more mods to be born.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Parachute mechanics are a little weird (though I am hopeful as its still early access)4. Punching should not kill you so easily5. (probably the first to say it but...) Helmets and body armor should protect you more (it makes sense realistically)But overall this game is fantastic and has really been knocked out of the park!

I've seen the torrent of bad reviews and I honestly them totally unfair. It's filled with reviews of people that claim low framerates on ""high end"" machines forgetting that even the with the best hardware there are settings you should tweak to your advantage. Also recently it looks like everyone is comenting on how bad the event pass is. Sure it might not have been such a good idea but let's not forget that unlike other games (yeah I'm talking about Fortnite) PUBG used to solely rely on profit from selling the game itself and from skin crates and other cosmetic items trade. Fortnite on the other hand has a greater playerbase sells event passes skins and all kinds of cosmetics which don't even have a counterpart in PUBG and has been doing so for a long time. Thing is nobody forces you to buy the event passes. After all they offer no actual in game advantage in winning the chicken dinner which is in my opinion what this game is really about and the ways in which you achieve that goal of course.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Im not a big fan of Fortnite yet i still prefer PUBG but its pretty obvious that his Event Pass is just a bad money grab copy of the Battle Pass from Fortnite. Funny that a game which started a lawsuit against another game about copying their game copies a part of this game and put its in their own game..With the current state of the game i dont recommend the game.

2017-05-08,0,0,98,True,Recommended,After playing a few hours of this I think it's safe to say that this is better than H1Z1. There's more weapons in this and you can also add attachments to these weapons. H1Z1 only has about 5 which are the AK AR Shotgun and some pistols which no one really use most of the game. You get to choose where you parachute in instead of just parachuting into a random location that the game chooses you to go to. You do need a beast for a pc in order to run it but that's not a problem for some. One thing that is realistic but very annoying is that jumping out of a car while moving will kill you or wound you instantly! Other than these two flaws it is an overall fantastic game! Definitely recommend!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-29,0,0,589,True,Not Recommended,"Dear Steam playerbase This game is awful. It it highly overrated by the community and does not deserve the praise it gets. The initial concept of trying to be the last one standing on an island of roughly 100 players sounds enticing at first but in practice it proves to be monotonous and boring. I have about 200 hours on this piece of garbage and ive only had a few moments where ive legitiamly had fun. To pay 30 dollars for a game still in early access is absolutely absurd and to wait almost half a year for general optimaziton is outlandish. How 2 win The only upside to the game is those heart pounding moments when you are in the top 10. Unfortunatly in order to get that far your options are limited. You can camp in a house for a half hour waiting for some clueless moron to stroll on in to your house kill him and then go back to being a hermit. Or you could play extremely agressive and stupid relying on luck to get you that far. Guns The weapons you can find all feel the same (among their class) and while there are many guns it feels like 1 assault rifle and a few snipers. The only cool guns are in care packages which are only found 5 6 times per game and you have to risk your life to get them. I can not tell you how many times I have immediately died after picking up one of these weapons and the times i actually manage to get out alive i will still most likley not win. RNG The RNG in this game is found in numerous features weather it be the random location of the safe zone getting a good gun as opposed to only finding pistols or randomly getting blown into bits by the bombing zone. In order to win so much luck is involved that it becomes less about skill. There are so many variables that factor into even getting a fun time out of the game that it almost is never fun. Gameplay You can boot up the game land on the island and when you do the game is a glitchy mess. Doors don't open items don't pick up and you teleport around nonstop. It is safe to say that part of the teleporting is caused by my poor internet but the rest of the problems are expieranced by everyone. These problems are all caused by lack of optimization. This game is so poorly optimized it feels like i am watching a slideshow seeing every individiual frame and i can never maintain a sold 60 fps while i get 80 100 on most games. I have a Radeon RX 470 4GB edition so this should not be happening. The other main problem with the gameplay is the slowness of it all. You can land in the middle of nowhere and get kitted without seeing anyone for 20 minutes and then get immediatly get shot in the head by a kar98k from a guy 500 meters away. There is a reason this game is called a ""walking simulator"" and that is because that is half the gameplay. The gunplay also feels awful and the bullet drop implementation is inconsistent at best. Conslusion This game is bad except when you make it far. There is a 1/10 chance you make it to the top 10 and a 1/100 chance you win assuming you are solo. Do not play it unless you plan to be dissapointed for hours on end until all the stars allign and you win. There is almost no reward for getting a win except for some PUBG points which do almost nothing. Except buy you a crate with the same cosmetic items you already had.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yet now the patch has gone live adding back the crossbow and the new? vector... The game is struggling keeping it's head above the frying pan. Slowly dipping down and burning it's face. You love the smell of bacon yet it hurts so much. I absolutely love this game don't get me wrong and before the flamewar starts... Yes... I am not THAT good of a player and have an awful K/D ratio because F it... I back out a lot because my mates games crash A LOT. I didn't have rage quits before but now I do. Examples Extended mag UMP full clip from 3 meters into somebody who had granted a level 3 helmet but NO BODY PROTECTION whatsoever. Didnt DIE and unloaded on me whilst I died behind cover. My internet connection is fine and my pc is bought new (almost especially for this game and my mates to join in on the fun). Yet my friends constantly have the memory leak problem etc. etc. The lag is killing this game. The cheaters are killing this game. Eventho I think the devs are doing their best to fix the issues. For me it's not fast enough. This whole day (today) has been agony eventho I have multiple recorded sessions where I get a couple of kills (7 being my highest in 1 game playing it fairly agressive). I just dont know what to say anymore I am torn in between wanting this game to be good yet the servers are crapping on all of us. Again... Not the best player but def. a fan. I am very positive but now I am very sad as the game seems unplayable for a lot of us and missing a lot of fun due to the agressive lag etc. Steer away if you don't want problems. But join if you enjoy their format. Hopefully they will fix it sooner rather than later. Thanks!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The kill camera really helps identify if someone has cheated against you. I love the match replay they have put into the game as now I can see how many close calls I had wandering through the desert.I believe Bluehole will fix this issue with cheaters soon as the report button can now be followed with the review of death cam and match replay. Hopefully this will lead to less people crying foul when the kill was skill or luck.I fully recommend this game to anyone whom loves first/third person shooters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-15,1,1,50,False,Recommended,OverviewPUBG is a battle royale game where you get chucked into a cluster of a 100player server where you fight other players. GameplayLet me give you a general rundown of the two ways a match will go Land alone Get decent loot Move to last couple circles Shot in the back of the head by someone you never knew existedAlternatively Land where other people are landing Find only a pistol Turn corner and get emptied into by someone who found a SCARIn a squad/duos add the extra stage of being killed after being downed.ReplayabilityAs well as there being 2 maps (3rd on the way) and tonnes of guns meaning near infinite ways to die Bluehole/PUBG Corp also have these 'events' which are pretty fun like a flare based supply drop mode shotguns/melee only and a 10 man 3 team TDM mode which all deviate from the main game and from my experience are far more enjoyable. They keep it at a continuous pace instead of seeing no one for literally (not figuratively but literally) 20 minutes and then getting shot in the back of the head by an AWM/SKS/Kar98k/etc you drop you see someone you shoot and if you die it's only a 40 second wait between drops. They have them available for fairly short windows but change them around pretty frequently.Game IssuesPUBG has always had an issue with optimisation both with the game client and on the serverside. The game used to run sub 60 on everything except NASA supercomputers but now it's more reasonable and you'll be hard pressed to see it go below 80FPS on mid range gaming parts (I have an i5 6600K and a GTX 1060 and get about 80 on ultra but you can squeeze out more using reshade or just turning settings down). However issues still remain with the server. The server can run at anywhere from 8Hz to 20Hz meaning that superbullets ( explained on this page www.blurbusters.com ) occur frequently and is a serious issue on a game that features a more realistic damage model. It also impacts the hitreg and is most noticeable before the first 10 20 people die then the server starts to normalize but doesn't reach consistency until about half of the game is dead. Battlenonsense has a couple of videos on PUBGs netcode and I'd recommend giving them a watch. PUBG also has an issue with cheaters especially on Oceania/Asia servers. The anti cheat isn't effective enough and doesn't even detect macros which leads to like this. Apparantly the macro which allows you to fire the SKS full auto fires so fast every second shot is recoil less.MicrotransactionsPUBG features cosmetic only (for now) microtransactions. This used to only be clothing items but now it's also including gun skins a la TF2/CSGO. Come on guys I already paid like $30 for this game you've made your money and you're not improving your games infrastructure you're just trying to make cash grabs. The Big Question PUBG or FortniteI personally enjoy the faster paced gameplay of Fortnite but can see that some of PUBGs systems are more advanced like weapon handling and weapon attachments but I also dislike how complex PUBG can be and how often it becomes a contest of whoever shoots first wins or whoever has the SCAR wins. I believe Fortnite is more balanced and enjoyable (shotguns are broke AF but you can just not use them) than PUBG but to each their own. ConclusionPUBG can be fun at times and is made more so by playing with friends but it does lead to some moments where you just have to call t and switch off to another game. Bluehole/PUBG Corp are scum but their game is enjoyable at times. I give this game a 6/10 overall a pass mark. It's enjoyable in it's current state but has large issues and room for improvement.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,784,True,Recommended,Product received for free. When reading reviews for this game you will have to dig through a ton of negative reviews during periods of time when they ban people. The dev's on this game aggressively pursue cheaters. So in the month of october people were using a bot script to sit in games to farm in game currency to buy chests and then turn around sell those for steam money. If someone is complaining about being banned on this game during a ban period it is because they were cheating.Also microtransactions are ONLY for speciality clothes. You can also sell your chests... which gives you the ability to make steam money from in game items. Microtransactions are cool in this game.

While the market is on the verge of being flooded with Battle Royale style games PUBG was my introduction to the genre and despite the issues this game has I'd say I've been very well introduced.For the uninformed PUBG takes place on one of two (as of writing) 8x8km maps. Up to 100 players (though usually around the 95 mark) skydive from a plane into the map and must loot buildings around the map to find weapons armor medical supplies and other gear while defending themselves from nearby players. A couple of minutes after landing the first white 'circle' is revealed on the map and players have 5 minutes before a damaging blue wall of energy (the blue circle) starts to close in around it. Players must at this point run or drive to the white safe zone. As the match progresses the player count decreases the playable area becomes smaller forcing players to encounter one another and the surviving players get better and better gear by looting the bodies of their victims. By the time the 5th circle is revealed and there's about 15 players left the end of the game approaches. Most of your opponents will be highly skilled with top tier equipment and you must change your tactics if you want to win that chicken dinner.Let me say up front before I dive into the meat of my review that this game has one of the steepest learning curves in any game I've played. It can be extremely difficult and frustrating to play when you're new as there are a lot of mechanics to learn and PUBG offers you no practice outside of just playing the game. You have to learn what all the different guns are what ammo they take and what attachments go on them. You have to learn the map and all its building types. You have to learn how to judge distances compensate for bullet drop and travel time and control recoil. You have to learn circle timings and other time management skills. There is so much to learn in this game that it can feel overwhelming at first but if you stick with it a lot of it will become second nature and you can focus on improving specific aspects of your play. For example I'm pretty comfortable getting into firefights now and I can pretty accurately line up Kar98k shots quickly and control a full auto spray with the M416 SCAR L and other such automatic weapons. However my time management needs a lot of work as I'm frequently finding myself outside the circle running in taking unnecessary damage.Which brings me onto the gunplay mechanics. PUBG's weapon handling was completely new to me when I got the game. My aim in other shooters is far from stellar and the recoil and ballistics mechanics made that even worse. However after about 150 200 hours I became a lot more comfortable controlling sprays (hint shoot in bursts crouch pull your mouse down). It took about the same time for me to get comfy with bullet drop and leading targets at a distance. I personally think the gunplay in this game is very good. It rewards skill and practice despite the inherent RNG factors involved in spraying. I have read complaints about hit registration and while I have had some questionable instances of this myself it has never noticeably affected the outcome of a firefight.Speaking of RNG factors I think that this is the most contentious point regarding the core gameplay. You're never guaranteed to find good loot or be close to the first circle. I have died many times because I got a P92 and the guy next to me got an M16. I honestly do not think this is as big an issue as a lot of people make it out to be. If you drop in hot zones right under the plane you're taking a risk and you need to assess if the potential payoff is sufficient to warrant taking that risk. It's simply another part of the game that people need to play around.The circle mechanic is another one of those frustrating for new players gameplay mechanics but it is much needed without it matches would never end. As it is now I feel like the circles move a little too fast. I'm often forced to just keep running after making it into one safe zone to make it to the next in time. While this is an important part of the game it's another RNG factor that you must play around and it can cost you a game if you're dealt a mean circle and can't handle it. The main reason I believe people are having circle issues is that they're taking far too long to do other things such as loot and fight. Players must learn to recognise when it's time to leave their loot spot and how to go about it including locating a vehicle if you're sufficiently far from the safe zone. Again this is a risk you must take when dropping near the edge of the map you're less likely to be contested for loot but you're also much less likely to be in or near the first safe zone.One of the great appeals of PUBG is that it supports a wide variety of play styles. Many new players will adopt the passive style where they land in a small uncontested area get their loot and just avoid as many fights as possible to get far into the game. More experienced players will likely play more aggressively landing in hotter spots to try for better loot while being comfortable with an early firefight. Some players may choose to land in the hottest spots on the map and get involved in the early brawl for a central location with minimal gear. Others still may combine these approaches landing in a safe but loot rich area far from the plane to get their gear in peace before driving over to the safe zone and starting to take fights. The reason this adds so much to the game is that all of these strategies can win you the game if executed sufficiently well. Every player can develop a personal play style that works for them and if things don't work out or you want a different experience you can simply switch up how you play.Not only can you play by yourself but you can team up with up to 3 friends. My favourite mode is Duo FPP since having a second player opens up so many more tactical possibilities that simply aren't possible in solo play. Squad can quickly become a nightmare as 4 players all need to communicate and coordinate. That's not to say Squad isn't fun in fact it can easily be the most fun due to how chaotic it can get but it means your entire team needs to be sharp cooperative and decisive if you want to get far after all a team is only as strong as its weakest link.Finally I want to address an important topic and that is hardware and performance. This game is far more optimised than when I first bought it let alone since it was first released onto Steam (and people need to recognise that) but it's still far from perfect. I have an Intel i7 6700HQ 2.6GHz 8GB DDR3 RAM 1600MHz and a nVidia GeForce 960M w/ 2GB VRAM and I average around 40fps on low medium settings. This is a very intensive game that you will need to have a beefy PC to run at a good framerate. I also have issues with textures loading and also some stuttering issues that I hear are at least partially mitigated by installing the game on an SSD (I only have a 5600rpm HDD). The game's minimum specs will allow it to run but will not make it playable. I recommend at least 12GB of DDR4 RAM and a nVidia GeForce 1000 series or better graphics card.To sum up PUBG is a fun and challenging game with a steep learning curve that rewards practice and relies strongly on mental performance and decision making skills arguably more than raw mechanical aim. If you're a fan of CS GO's tactical gameplay or just first person shooters in general and are looking for something a bit different this is a game I would absolutely recommend if your hardware can handle it. Just be aware it still has some issues. Overall I give Playerunknown's Battlegrounds an 8/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-19,0,0,111,False,Not Recommended,This game is like a curse. Never have I wished I never bought a game more. It showed so much potential. I love the hardcore realism with the combat and I thought it could get better. But alas this game is created by a company that puts making money before making a good game. Filled with hackers bugs microtransactions for a progression system that should have been there to begin with. I just dont understand. This game has made so much money for the relatively small team that made it how could they be still so money hungry. The custom game mode created a feature we wanted forever is going to be monetized. Every step forward they make they take 3 steps back. Like they finally added the feature to choose maps which is great as the desert map is filled with nothing except the islands which no one drops. So they added this map choosing feature and as soon as this new map comes out they force you to also have the chance to enter a desert game if you want to play the classic map. There still isnt a training mode which is almost nessesary for most people to get good with not only the common weapons but the rare ones from supply drops that you pick up only to die because you dont know how to use it. Bluehole milking every single penny out of this game is almost disgusting. Dont make my mistake.I forgot to mention how this game make your pc as loud engine.

2017-06-19,0,0,45,True,Recommended,A great experiance if you ever wondered what it would feel like to be in the Hunger Games this game will test your skills in finding hostiles and avioding threats that are just to strong to fight. It is very random in the sense you don't know what equipment you will have by the end of your first few matches. You will reach a point where you end up being killed for making silly mistakes but this shouldn't stop you because you keep learning. For those who have come from Arma 3 this will be very easy to play and win at as most if not all of your skills can be used in a variety of situations that will be all to similar to your previous experiance. If you want a battle royal game that will test your P v P combat then this is the game for you but you need to be prepaired to die and learn otherwise this game can get a bit boring if you don't have a team. I play as a solo most of the time so on the occasions that I do have friends playing with me I end up making mistakes as I end up making solo play decisions. The game will be coming to Xbox soon so if you would rather play with console buddys you may aswell wait because I expect the game to be exactly the same just with a few patches.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now whenever I load into the game it takes forever and by the time it does load I'm at the end of the plane route whereas my teammates have already jump in some other area that I am half across the map from.

The game has almost been fully released in almost a year now and it's still this ""Fix PUBG"" is a joke as of right now the recent ""fixes"" they put out only gets worse and worse for me. I really hope by the time they finshed with all the fixes they promised us in their Fixed PUBG website is true and they would continue to patch this game up but as of right now don't but this game until they fixed all the damn bugs desync and optimized this damn game.

Same goes for hitregistration. Many times you'll find yourself wondering how an enemy survived so many apparent hits while you seemingly die instantly.This game is fun and addictive if it works properly.

2017-08-27,0,0,120,True,Recommended,Whenever I play alone or with a team Player Unknown's BattleGrounds gives me adreniline everytime I get into a match. It feels satisfiying even when you killed that one person whether they were in the same building as me or trying to pick ourselves off with snipers from long distances. Now I am a new(b) player and am still trying to get better. One of the best things about PUBG is that there is skill planning strategy and patience. Although many people will talk about the how microtransactions in PUBG are stupid (I agree) but at least it's only cosmetic and is is no way pay to win. You first spawn on an island only spawn to spawn on a plane to parachute at a bigger island. You only start off with clothing and some storage space on your character you don't spawn with guns you have to find the guns. Once on the humongous island you (or your team) must survive and kill to be the last one(s). The first time winning was relaxing as me and my friend won. Some problems I wish for is that people with weaker hardware can still play on a more lower settings. Also there is some controversy going around that I only heard recently all I hope is that Bluehole should hold up to this. TBH I don't know what the hell everyone arguing about. But whatever I still recomend this game to people who play games like DayZ or like something skill based.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Зачастую если попадается туман или дождь большое количество игроков тут же ""ливает"" из игры и я их понимаю...ибо играть всю игру в тумане из за которого ты видишь только лишь на небольшой дистанции перед собой или в дождь именно он раздражает меня больше всего..всю игру этот давящий на нервы шум из за которого не слышно шагов и звука работающего двигателя.Это небыло бы минусом если бы эти погодные условия появлялись периодически а не присутствовали на протяжении всей катки. Звук пожалуй самый большой и главный минус этой игры для меня.Если по вам ведут огонь с дальнего расстояния не всегда понятно откуда ибо звук раздается отовсюду оглядываясь по сторонам слышишь его то спарава то слева то над собой...это очень плохо сказывается на жизни и здоровье моего персонажа )Отдельно хотел бы сказать о читах в игре специально не стал заносить ""читы"" в минусы потому что не замечаю такого огромного количества читерюг как об этом трубят чуть ли не на каждом сайте по этой игре.Да действительно в этой игре есть читы и некоторые нехорошие люди их используют однако разработчики потихоньку с этим разбираются.Сам встречал лишь пару тройку странных моментов но может просто я сам рак...В общем всем советую приобрести PUBG и приглашать друзей играть вместе с вами это интересно и залипательно.Так же хочу отметить что это единственная игра в раннем доступе в которой я уверен что она выйдет в релиз!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Like exploding vibrating cars when its beside a rock the wrong way Character movement feels like you're treading on water all the time. Maps are too big. You spend a lot of the time walking across empty fields with the auto run (if you can't find a car). Laggy.

There are way to many issues to even list them all but the main problem that I seem to run into consistantly is that at times I am not even able to lauch the game. Reason behind this? Your guess is as best as mine. All I know is that if I want to play a game that I own I should be able to play it when I want where I want to. However that is not the case when it comes to PUBG. I would love this game till death do us part if the people creating this pos game would get there heads out of their a # and focus on developing content that actually matters.

2018-07-19,0,0,307,False,Recommended,PUBG is becoming a cash cow. The core gameplay is the same but it goes further and further toward milking it's players. I find this particularly obvious in the Sanhok Event Pass which is pretty much a must for getting any sort of cosmetics. Furthermore the insane price of the damn thing this isn't Fortnite I paid $50 for this game in EA and all I get is a shoddy T Shirt?However I must stress that the core gameplay remains untouched. It is by far the most tense and tactical battlegrounds out on the market and despite it's hacker problem and various bugs it remains a decent overall game. Running &amp gunning ghillie suits backflips on motorcycles advanced weapons and mechanics for this is what PUBG does and it makes for quite an interesting playthrough. Personally the win result is more rewarding here than other battle royales such as Epic Games' Fortnite.

2017-10-05,0,0,716,True,Recommended,PUBG is a fun experience and I enjoy playing it on a daily basis. However the game suffers from severe optimization flaws and development issues. Frequently the game will randomly dip framerates due to poor decisions like forcing post processing as well as poorly optimized architecture and geometry in the game. One of the worst offenders of this is the city of Yas where you will consistently notice dips in your framerate of up to 30fps. If the game's developers can iron out most of the optimization and performance issues while introducing new features and gameplay mechanics this could be a very successful titlle. I doubt it will though.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have watched the deathcam repeatedly to see who actually aims their crosshairs at me and who does not. Press R after you watched the review to report and state the legitimate Reasons.This game is highly recommended. It took my away from CSGO TF2 Battlefield 1 and lets me drop into the zone as much as i feel like for either a quick suicidal game or a long Splinter Cell where any means necessary is attempted to try place first to win some Chicken Dinner sponsored by the BlueHolePubG has it's own Forum. Steam discussions about the game are full of complaints but people don't know that they should be posting is on their SPECIFIC FORUM Found here from suggestions to new updates news All here https //forums.playbattlegrounds.com/tGraphics are great. UE4 which is constantly being improved. Gameplay is mixed from campers to people that will try and drive over you. Most of my kills comes from killing people that are driving towards me or past me. Crates are delicious rewards ie. money back to your steam account so you can spend it wherever you please. All you need to do is play and early Battlepoints. The crates double in price though and are reset weekly. So your first random crate will be 700 battlepoints which you can potentially earn in one or two games. Then it becomes 1400 2800 4200 etc. etc. it keeps increasing. Then there are also specialized crates up for the week or something that can also be sold to the market but it costs say 5000BP to get this.EVENTS mode is really cool for weekends usually 72hour events ranging from 10 man teams all paratrooping into a designated space Get hurt if you are out of this zone and shoot each other up First team to 200 points wins.*8 man Squads play the same maps Different event First Person is the only recommended method of playing this game. It feels legit. Maybe even like a simulator for after the world apocalypse happens and if you survive make sure you're the last man in the arena. Developers have also tried doing daily updates to remedy the hackers ie 25.mb daily updates Constantly improving. Incredibly high recommendation Also the price of an account for this is good to match the ratio/cost to hacker after caught.They should probably bring in the mobile number authentication so you have to bind the account to your number like with Dota and CSGO/ etc. so that once a hacker is detected any account you create and bind to that number is detected as a previous cheater.

2017-07-08,0,0,365,True,Not Recommended,Almost lost for words over the state of the game since recent update either me and my friend are the unluckiest players on this game to date or the recent patch has absolutely destryoed the chances of finding a gun within your first 20 minuites of gameplay just finished a 2 hour session on pubg in which 3 of 5 times we dropped at gun range being the only ones to drop there and after searching the entirety of the surrounding area somehow every game weve only managed to find ONE gun between us that wasnt a pistol. im well aware that there is a certain amount of luck attributed to this game and the loot spawns you get but i mean or christ sake we risk our game to drop at a highly contested area only to find 10 minutes later that we're still both in search of a sight and a gun that can fight at range seeing as most fights are fought at range due to the style of map that we are forced to play on. E.G open plains and hills with open lines of sight you would of expected that we would have a fighting chance of fiding a weapon and attatchments that suited this gameplay. i love the idea of this game. but since the recent patch or whatever you seem to have done to the spawn rates. im contemplating uninstalling. im all for dying again and again because i understand thats the game and i enjoy it. but i WILL NOT accept that it is fair that i have only uzi after looting THE GUN RANGE when somebody who landed in a shack down the road has an sks with 4x.

This is for you!Short Every respawn takes 3 Minutes No enemy contact most of the game &gt Simply boring most of the time Loot Loot Loot ... 30 min game time... saw no one ... die... Ugh Whole thing depends a lot on luck to find something it is utterly depressing to just get hunted down with no gun .(you spawn unarmed) Lag all the way you might see blood splashing on your device (hit) but on the server side it might look different (no hit) Cheaters Wall hacks speed hack aimbot... you name it Can't believe I played this so muchWhy did the gaming community come to the point to accept unfinished games like this is beyond me. But heheheyyy they are already creating Bandannas and that sells for hundreds of dollars on the steam market while the game still lags... Get your priorities straight.Long How a match goes Start Search it will actually quickly find a server and you will be placed into a lobby (10sec). Now after 100 Players (or when it is a slow day 60 Players joined 10 30 sec) it will start a timer (60sec). Why? Well I don't know but a lot of people with slow PC's say the lag around a lot during this time. Still it doesn't help the lagging while in game. Now you can enjoy the view from above the airplane slowly crosses the island and you can drop down once you find a spot you like. You will then approach ground and land. This usually takes 90 sec. Now you will frantically try to find anything that can shoot you might be in luck and find something or stand there at gun point with nothing more then some sneakers you found (but neat they come in different colors). Nobody wears shoes anyway since they make more noise... And if both you and your enemy don't find a gun you can start the fight to boredom pardon fight to death. You will both attempt a ""Supermanpunch"" for a while until someone luckily hits and lags into the right place at the right time killing the other one with the massive flying punch. Now this whole fun took 3 Minutes to start with the outcome of a depressingly laggy 3 Minute fist fight. Now if you won you are in for a treat of boredom most of the time nothing will happen and you can watch the crappy pick up animation. You can argue I'm just bad at this game and you might be right. Even if I'm bad I want to enjoy this but the long wait times and being hunted down with no way to defend yourself makes it dreadful.

2019-01-19,0,0,142,False,Not Recommended,I'm going to give this a thumbs down. There are moments when I enjoy the game but it certainly is not worth it as the developers are people from what I have read.Pros Good to play for and giggles or just to hop in when everything else bores you. This only really applies to the smaller maps. Well for me anyways. Graphically this game looks nice (Though it is not the prettiest that is for sure) and feels a lot better WHEN you have the PC that can run it. Smaller maps seem the most well designed and have the most action and gameplay for sure. Lots of weapon choices and attatchments. Having the drop is a nice touch for players that want to get involved in more action as this leads to a possibility of big and risky gun fights. Bigger maps have a higher risk factor as you have to work with what you can especially when you drop where most others will drop. This makes the game feel more intense on the bigger maps as it becomes a kind of high stake senario. Wait times are not as bad as they once were for me so this was a good improvement when hoping into a game. The elements of the game such as getting from one place to another figuring out the best route to go and to attack what utility to use and what other equipement you feel would be best to use for the rest of the game duration. This can extend pretty far and that makes me believe this game has a hard learning curve to become good at. ONLY ONE THING GOOD ABOUT THE RED ZONE It can help to trap enemies or to be able to get away during gun fights that you may not win due to being at low health.Cons The dysnc and netcode. There has been a lot of times where I would shoot straight through an enemy even if the enemy was standing still. The Death Cam also can cause you confusion at times because a player may be aiming behind you (sometimes very much behind) but hit every shot on you while on full auto. Cheaters are still present but I can say that I don't see them as much. However a lot of my deaths from the cam it seems the enemy usually snaps right onto me instantly as they ADS. Bad optimization for slower systems. On my old PC with a 970m I could barley hold 50 60FPS on low settings but once I built a new one I could handle the game a lot better. The Pass's and Keys are also ridiculous. Obviously you can still play this game just fine without this. However it is honestly a scam in my eyes from companies that do this. The movement can feel so damn awful and sluggish most of the time. This along with most of the other issues have been present since BETA though I can say there still has been some improvement. The problem is that it hasn't been much. Bigger maps can be extremely slow and boring. The loot on the bigger maps seem to have gotten worse as well. Weapon attatchments seem to not do much of anything to improving the gun. Weapon recoil on most guns are absolutely awful and can make them pretty much useless. You can control it and possibly get a kill while fully auto but the other guy usually seems to have no recoil whatsoever and lands all their shots on you.I'm sure there are other cons to this game then I have put but I can't recall them at this time.I only recommend getting this game IF and only if the game is below 10 bucks on sale.I would recommend playing ROE but their privacy policy is absolutely sketchy. Also keep in mind that BlueHole is owned by Tencent Games so they are also responsible for how this game plays out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-30,0,0,168,True,Not Recommended,This game happens to be one of my favorite games in all of my time on steam and I think that a game that good should not be so terribly optimized. Now this is MY opinion on this subject I think that instead of the devs realeasing new content for the game they should first optimize the game. Now why would I make a comment like this on this particular game? It's because if we the people do not say anything to the devs then it will take longer for the devs to realize that their game is not properly optimized. Also another thing is if they fix this optimization problem their audience of players will drasticly increase and this will help PUBG grow and surely become a well known game. I want to hear from you guys what do you think about the optimization?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-19,0,0,83,True,Not Recommended,This game is ok. You can have a fun playing it. With a good amount of work this could become a pretty good game. But there are a couple of things you should know beforehand Performance is currently pretty bad. Especially in close range combat lag mostly decides who wins. This point is understandable due to the early access status. Overall quality of the game is pretty low for its price. Some gameplay elements are pretty bad implemented and graphics aren't even nearly at what Unreal Engine 4 is capable of. Most annoyingly is the awful texturing. Especially annoying when it's super easy to distinguish a well textured player character far away from the low quality ground textures. Early access isn't really an excuse for this. Amount of content is rather low. The game basically only contains the minimum of gameplay elements necessary for such a game. Generally nothing wrong about it a game can be good anyway. But what's missing are ways to see from where you were shot when you're dead how much damage you dealt to the opponent what body parts did you / he it what players are currently alive and how many kills does each one have post match statistics ... the possibilities are unlimited. Some of these information might be critical in team games but in solo games they are not. Luck plays a pretty big role in this game. You can like this or you don't. I won't go in detail here but when I die I want to deserve it simply because I was the worse player. This isn't so common in this game. The Third person view contributes to this point a lot. I hate it. It can be abused heavily. It's annoying to die to someone abusing it it's not fun killing another one abusing it yourself (well I'm sure people that enjoy hacking also love the Third person view).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I would have continued playing it regardless. The rush of adrenaline you feel when you are top 10 in a heated battle for the chicken dinner is almost unparalleled. Honestly the first time I won a game with my friends was one of the most thrilling sweaty heart racing moments of my life which is probably a sad reflection of my boring life.

2019-01-31,1,1,58,False,Not Recommended,TL DR This game is a complete and total dumpster fire and i wish i could get my money back from back when i bought it.This is a battle royale game a game all about PVP a game all about shooting that basically rewards you for not playing and punishes you for trying.This game has nothing special about it nothing unique the only thing that this game has is poorly designed maps that just seem to get less and less cover the more maps they add shooting that is so terrible that it makes me wish i never had ing hands to even TOUCh this damn thing and weapon balancing that is so garbage that a 9mm submachine gun outperforms nearly every assault rifle in the game.Its not that the game has some quirks its not that there are some things about it that can be over looked the CORE MECHANICS OF THE GAME are so absolutely flawed and the fact that the devs refuse to do anything about it is ing baffling.Shooting is absolute garbage with guns that either never seem to hit or when they do deal absolutely disproportionately small amounts of damage to what the caliber is or perform so well that there is next to no reason to use any other gun. Why use an m4 a winchester a sniper a shotgun when a ing smg can do all of those weapons jobs so much better. Why even try to engage in a firefight if its just going to give you the disadvantage? why even play the game at all?News flash you shouldnt its an absolute ing dumpster fire and i wish i never spent money on it much less stick around to see it in its current state. To my knowledge there has been nothing changed about gunplay aside from new guns added no interesting gimicks or iconic areas in any maps aside from po i (and thats just because it was the hotspot for the first map for ing forever) armor is still completely useless until you get level 3 rifles still kick like a mule yet never seem to hit and smg's are still spray and pray monstrosities that can kill you in seconds from practically any range. They have not changed the shooting at ALL changed up map layouts at ALL. Theres always 4 5 big cities one in the center that everyone goes to and ing nothing in between. Guns have and still do and probably always will feel like clunky disasters which take up so much of your screenspace while using iron sights that people can literally hide behind your ing gun model and are so utterly useless while hipfiring or spread tightening that they might as well not even bee in the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-26,0,0,371,False,Not Recommended,i'm completely rewriting my review here because at this point so many other issues are coming out of this despite the buzz around the game that peopel should know the problems... hackers are still very much an issue which is to be expected from such a popular game... but the problems from the developer side are just as much an issue.... the focus instead of being on fixing bugs/crashes and game mechanics very much seems to be on cash grabbing. which could very well mean the creator/devs aren't very concerned with the problems in the game. the only sense of progression other than leaderboards is loot crates with cosmetic items. you can choose a new crate (definitely has a 2.50 key purchase requred lock on it) or a random crate (likely will give you a locked crate may give you one you can open with basic skins). this is the only reward you get for your playtime. it didn't used to be this way. there were no locks before and there are even locks on crates that there weren't on before. they just now released a patch where they added in weapon skins (obviously complete with new boxes to pay to unlock) instead of focusing on fixing bugs crashes and garbage netcode. i've got a strong feeling this trend will continue especially with the release of the mobile version of the game. now to the bugs and crashes..... there are often crashes that occur when you are loading into the game from the initial start area. you may even just not load into the start area and there will be an infinite loading screen. this should have been fixed long ago..... picking things up is inconsistent you will think you'd picked something up because it made the noise of you picking up and gave the character animation for doing so and you'll find later that you had left it on the ground regardless of all the signs you had (bad netcode issue?). there are times you will shoot someone blood will spray out of them but no damage registers.... this at times is game breaking and has lost me several wins. there is a death cam supposedly to help you identify hackers but the cam itsself is buggy even causing me to crash at one point (not a recurring thing i'll admit). vehicles are a damn nightmare there are even invisible objects you will run into at times or the vehicles will glitch out and explode. motorcycles are absolute death traps. a HUGE thing to mention along with all of this is that chinese servers have STILL not been region locked despite literally EVERYONE not playing from an asian server begging for this to happen. there are insane amounts of hackers coming from these regions (not that there aren't NA hackers obviously) but the developer team's disregard of player's wishes is definitely concerning especially since hacks and bad netcode have been a very serious issue in gameplay. there's more but this is already super long. i wouldn't recommend purchasing this game as it is let bluehole fail first since they are trying to cash grab instead of fixing gameplay issues so they learn how bad a move that is and let them patch some of these issues. if you want to play pubg play the free mobile version instead of funding this money hungry group.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-18,0,0,1125,False,Recommended,First time writing reviewer here. Don't really care to write reviews much but I feel like I should in this case. I'm not going to deny the fact that the developers were wrong during the early stages of this game (game release date onward). It was clear that they weren't focused on fixing the game itself and more so focused on generating revenue through ingame purchases. However you have to understand that BlueHole was originally a company that made cellphone games. So ingame purchases is pretty much second nature to them. I understand people are upset about this but too much of the current and former player base are being too salty about what happened. If you weren't so salty and have been following up on patch notes you can really tell they have changed the direction of their developers. Yeah they made the pass a purchasable thing but you don't HAVE to buy it. Why do people complain about ingame purchases when you don't have to buy them. A lot of people are ignorant and believe that a one time purchase can fund an entire company forever is rediculous.IMO PUBG deserves more positive ratings because they shouldn't be judged on their past. )I used to get 100 frames with similar settings but AA and Post Processing on very low. But recently I've tried setting my graphic settings higher and I still maintain high fps through the entire game.

It's got a fair bit of bad press because of poor optimization bugs and hackers.The optimization isn't that much of a problem. Before I upgraded my graphics card I was playing on a pretty low end rig and did alright on low. Bugs happen sometimes they are unfair and suck but thats pretty rare these days. I've had maybe 2 matches out of 300 where I ran into something like that. And I haven't seen a hacker yet. What this game provides is a game that really rewards tactical strategy and that turns camping (always boring in other games) into a heart pounding blood pressure spiking experience.Hiding in bushes camping in buildings behind doors waiting for firefights to happen and then picking off the remaining people all viable rewarding experiences. It will punish you. Over and over again. But its fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is the only game that does this and i have tried everything i can to fix it. ""fix Pubg"" hmm good luck. i deserve a refund even after 200 hours of gameplay. edit still a broken game. right now the servers are too full to play. instead of putting you in a queue and making EVERYONE wait 3 minutes to enter a game they block you out completely just because you happened to log in at a busy time while those who are already connected are ""grandfathered in."" additionally dsync is still bad. expect to peak a window shoot a few bullets at an enemy run 3 6 feet to out of line of sight behind cover only to take damage and die. you cant blame the players for that. there is honestly not a lot wrong with this game in terms of an actaul list. gameplay is great when its working right truly. if they fixed server issues including dsync and server capacity and descreased the amount of time it took to enter a game in general the game would be quite enjoyable.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-11,0,0,180,False,Recommended,9 Stars / 10 StarsColloquially known as PUBG and pronounced pub gee is an efficiently conceptualized battle royale. 100 players parachute onto an island (either desert or the one used in BETA) with the last man standing wining the unoriginal idea executed in an original fashion and attaining the famous 'WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER'.Much like already present battle royale inspired predecessors DayZ H1Z1 and a few Arma mods which are aesthetically bland and was prone to technical hiccups but PUBG is refreshingly accesible. The in game towns are inspired by raided Eastern European towns or dusty shackled forts wherein you can stumble upon randomized gear with the players main objective to stay within the confines of an electric blue line that slowly shrinks the maps from miles of open terrain to a single sqaure foot of land thus forcing all survivors to fight for the top spot into the limited safe space. The details allow players to either snipe from a distant cliff raiding house to house with a shotgun or the ever famous Micro Uzi or simply hiding in the bush. As blue circle pushes closer survivor number will inevitable tick down. As time flies by even the smallest detail in game has purpose. For an instance when the doors to a house is open the chances of it being raided or being used as an ambush and far greater than a closed door (players become very attentive to such detials as they explore deeper into the game).There are many ways to play this game aggresiveness of players based on what weponry they salvage or prediction on where the circle would be closing or just trying to survive before guns blazing at the end of the game. PUBG relies on Progression &amp Regression Contruction &amp Destruction Total success or utter failure creating deep existential pleasure centered around the three key beats of the game Land gear up and survive to the end.A few glitches do exist but with the team involved in creating this beautiful game operares on a tight budget and impossible deadlines but still in my opinion PUBG is fluently the most imperfectly perfect game ever released.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-15,0,0,245,False,Not Recommended,Pubg is a good idea gone terribly wrong. What started as fun battle royale game has ended as money hungry loop to feed new accounts to the ever increasing amount of cheaters in the game. Problems with this game are numerous ENGINEFirst thing I have to mention is just how bad the game engine is. It was absolutely the cheapest engine the company could buy at the moment they decided to make the game and they had very little experience with it. This made optimizing game terrible as players started with 20 30 fps (now optimized to 60) but game still stutters lags and feels unresponsive.The engine is not also optimized to handle suck large player amount as 100 in same map. This leads to low tick rate and client side code running which can be seen as lagging players and troubles to hit target. With client side code the enemy can shoot you when you are already in the cover as you are still visible in their client.PHYSICSPhysics in the game is absolute trash. Game looks and behaves lot like Arma 2 based Dayz as movement feels pretty heavy you have same controls and gun physics as in Dayz. This is however where the similarity ends. Guns in the game are horrible to shoot. They have huge recoil slow bullet speed and bullet drop to make shooting realistic . This would be ok if the damage of the bullets would be high to compensate for the realistic take on the shooting physics but the damage at is peashooter low. Armor in the game literally halves all damage from ALL guns so average player with tier 3 armor takes about 6 10 bullets from assault rifle to kill when shooting at chest. No armor piercing rounds no one hit kill headshots no different penetration for different rounds. The developers have literally never shot a gun in their life and seem to refute to do so.Footsteps in the game make absolutely too much noise. Developers are against benefits to players and banned re shade (which makes graphics move colorful as game looks dull gray) while literally every player that has sound equalizer cranks footstep sound to the max. They can hear your footsteps literally from the neighbor house.There is garbage spawning everywhere in this game. Clothing provides no special armor bonus or make you harder to see in any way. You can also decide your clothes before the round starts. So why does clothing spawn everywhere in the game? It makes loot management which is already bottom tier garbage even worse.DEVELOPERSThere is no region lock in the game so all cheaters from other continent (guess where?) are welcome to join NA and EU region. There are possible million cheaters in other continent that come to NA and EU servers to get away from their cheater infested servers and to win more games here. As players can make money with the game by selling loot which can be bought with in game currency that you get when you win the round it becomes beneficial to cheat in the game.If you address the problem with the cheaters from other continent and wish for region lock developers will ban you for racism and xenophobia. Developers also seem to not listen to community at all and make decisions at where to make more money / save costs. For example Developers can t code grass in the game so that it cant be removed with hacks Fix Lets make new map with no grass at all. Next map will be snow map so problem solved also. Maybe 4th map will be in the moon? Developers can t code net code Fix Call players racist when they address the problem of non region players having massive lag and advantage with it. Developers can t code game code and there are tons of cheaters in the game Fix Ban only the game key but not IP so the cheater can just buy more copies and repeat the cycle. Also ban all useful 3rd party tools like ReShade and let cheaters modify client side code to their heart content.Other very bad decision form developers has been adding real money locked loot boxes to the game. They are literally copying loot boxes from such wonderful and loved companies as EA and Ubisoft. What could possibly go wrong?There is too little time for Bluehole to see what is going wrong with the game before next hot thing comes out and streamers players and media jump the ship. Pubg will be left alone full of cheaters RMT lootboxes and non existent server management. It seems unlikely that Bluehole manages to release another big hit after Pubg with such horrible development so hopefully this is the last time we hear from the company and their biggest scams in gaming history.Please thumb up if you find this review useful so that others may find it also! ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You can be the top of the world defeating everyone steal enemies loot when u kill them and become stronger and stronger. But then some kid is camping a house with a 2barrel shotgun and BAM... he is gonna scream his microphone while teabagging ur dead body and then you'll have to start all over with nothing.This is the first game of this type i've played without lag issues with good graphics and overall none noticeable bugs and wow its amazing to play! This games really make you feel alive when you're getting closer to top10 you'll heart beat insanely and the adrenaline kicks in this is better than drugs kids!Thats why i have to recommend this game you'll miss out something if you dont try this!+ Adrenaline!+ Graphics+ Controls/mechanics+ Sound+ Early Access thats actually working.Thank you for reading my review!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Takes a lot of time to master it but it's really fun.They still could fix lots of bugs such as graphic glitches bad vehicle physics ect but it's still in early access and they promised it'll be out by end of the year so hopefully they'll fix most issues and make game more playable for everyone.Conclusion Really fun game very minor hackers bit buggy but really enjoyable high skilled game.

2018-08-04,0,0,160,False,Not Recommended,This game is a hole of low frames and tons of pros and the game is unfair to new comers who want to play the game there is no way to for them to get better at the game If they added a training coruse then it would be fair to new comers or just add ranks so that they can play with people on there level. The low frames are a big issuse if you want to play pubg on a 2011 gameing computer you will have no chance playing PUBG because it loads in maps But one good thing is that Blue hole is still trying to make players have more frames. If you want to have a fun gaming experinse this is not the game. Play CSGO play L4D2 but not this game I would play and have no idea where the guy is and it turns out that he is cheating long range with a SK12 I don't know how bad the battle eye system is but I heard it was pretty good but now you can play with cheaters and never no about it.If you can if these problems then the game will be so much fun playing Cheaters Frames Sound Gun play(Add) ranksI would love to play this game but it's just really bad and the gameplay is just bad for a new comer.

2018-09-12,1,1,162,False,Not Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is one of the most popular games on the PC. The game was one of the first to implement a Battle Royal system where players are dropped into a large map with 100 other people and their main goal is to be the last man standing. Other games have used this style before PUBG came out like ARMA 3 and H1Z1 to name a few. However the impact the game has had in the video game market has left an impact on multiplayer games as a whole. But that was back when it was in early access and was still relevant. After playing 160+ hours on PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds I can honestly say that I am completely done with the game as of today. Everything has led up to this point including horrible performance in gameplay and frames per second inclusion of awful microtransactions and their attempts to 'fix' the game.PlayerUnkowns Battlegrounds as of 2018 has reach a point that its popularity is steadily declining because of how lackluster the whole experience feels. Many people complained about the lack of overall polish and steady flow of gameplay in its early access days back in 2016 2017. The game would chug frames even dipping below 60 frames per second if areas were heavily populated and/or alot of activity was happening. Close quarter combat was met with frustration with how poorly the game would tank in frames as you fought someone indoors or in close proximity to them. When the game launched December 2017 maybe people felt dissapointed that the game still underperformed as it was fully released. The same issues that plagued the early access of PUBG were still in the game. As the months passed people were starting to leave PUBG because of the lack of updates and lack of overall polish the game needed. Although Bluehole has addressed some of the issues the game's had it still is left as a 'hot mess' to say the least. Even today the game still has issues with firefights as you can directly hit someone and it won't register. However the main contributor as to why the game has steadily declined was the inclusion of microtransctions especially the 'battle pass' they implemented before the Belgium Championships.Even while PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was in early access Bluehole decided to implement microtransactions for cosmetic items. The devs tried to implement a system much like CounterStrike Global Offensive where players can trade skins for real world currency and create their own market based on what people value the most. However most of the items that were available during the early acces stage of PUBG were barely adequate enough to warrant someone to wear on their avatar. When the game fully released on PC there was still no reason to buy any of the clothing as they felt bland and uninspiring. Things got even worse when the full game was released and they included locked crates where you would have to buy separate keys to unlock them. Finally there was the controversial 'battle pass' that cost $10 to buy. What this does was that it gave you access to locked clothing and gun skins as you completed challenges much like Fortnite. However again the items the Battlepass offered did not warrant the value or time they required because the cosmetic items were ugly and unattractive. Many people also saw this as hypocritical that Bluehole would implement a system from a game they were trying to sue at the time and saw it as the 'final nail in the coffin' for them. Although Bluehole has made efforts to fix their past mistakes it hasn't meld what they have done in the past. Bluehole has released several 'fix' updates to address the issues that have plagued PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds since its release. They have provided steady frames to the game fixes in performance for close quarter engagements and even added a few maps weapons and vehicles along the way. Although these fixes have kept the game stable they have not addressed the main issue that plagues the game. The game is a mod of the Unreal Engine and many of the issues that plague the gaming engine are apparent on PUBG even more so. Unlike Fortnite where it was built from the ground up PUBG has many issues that keep it from being excellent. Since the game is a mod it suffers from inconsistencies in performance especially when it comes to gunplay. Much like PUBG's counterparts DAYZ and ARMA 3 which use the same engine as PUBG gunplay is very bipolar. If you ever get into a gunfight with someone who has a higher ping in either game you will be met with devastation as the other player will dominate you. Sometimes it can go the other way where someone can have a lower ping and your bullets won't register and theirs do. Since the game is very competitive the lackluster performance diminish the chances of winning it is all based on luck.As of today I am completely done with PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. I have uninstalled the game and will not be touching it anytime soon. I love the concept that PUBG has the inclusion of customization of not only your avatar but also armor and weapon attachments to provide more depth than Fortnite has. However because of its lack of polish the company's past mistakes and their attempts to fix them have not made the experience anymore worthwhile than when it was in early access. There are too many things holding this game back from its competitor Fortnite which has become more popular and more relevant today because of how marvelous the game performs and their numerous updates to the game that keep it fresh. Hopefully Black Ops 4 will have a better Battle Royale mode as it seems to be getting alot of attention from streamers. That's why I am not recommending this game to anyone it is a tragedy beyond saving.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-18,0,0,57,False,Not Recommended,THE DEVS OF THIS GAME INTENTIONALLY ENCOURAGE CHEATING SO THEY CAN MAKE EXTRA MONEY OFF CHINESE GOLD FARMERSGold Farming is a multi billion dollar a year industry in China with prisoners being forced to play games like WoW CSGO and now PUBG to get currency or items that can then be sold for real money.In PUBG these Gold Farmers use cheats to win as many matches and get as many crates as fast as they possibly can to get as many items they can sell as they possibly can and with many items selling for hundreds of dollars as well as PUBG being dirt cheap in China this is a profitable venture if done on a large scale.BlueHole gets money every time a cheater makes a new account. BlueHole gets money every time a gold farmer sells an item on the marketplace.BlueHole takes weeks to review cheating reports because in those few weeks a gold farmer could easily have made triple the cost of the game in China if not far more depending on the items they got. Then after BlueHole has made their money and let the farmers make their money they ban their accoutns so they have to buy a new one and boom BlueHole just made even more money.BlueHole needs the gold farming business to be profitable because if the farmers make money so does BlueHole.This is why they take so long to respond to reports. This is why there are still so many cheaters. This is why they take measures that screw over legit players to make it look like they're doing something while not actually affecting the actual cheaters.Cheaters Extra Profit for BlueHole.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-15,0,0,33,True,Recommended,A personal favorite in my collection of MULTIPLAYER games and the true masterpiece of the growing battle royals genre. This game was not one I was actually very exicted to get watching twitch streamers and others play it felt boring the game looked very bad and only see twitch streamers just wrecking the hell out of noobs. But I was wrong. I got this game when my friend dan begged me to buy it and play it with me and this game has generated the most amazing stories and adventures I've ever had in a multiplayer game since playing in my friends minecraft servers. Gunplay is very extensive with attachments ballistics and tactical styled gameplay similar of those of the arma games. Vehicles are pretty decent and the huge player base adds to brilliancy of this multiplayer game and better yet the new contents not stopping due to this game being in early access and the fact many more gameplay elements will be added. Every game mode is also pretty good solo gives you the feeling of the lone wolf situation and I've been jump scared by other players and on the edge of my seat when I here a person creeping in the same house I'm in. Duo has created some interesting situations with my fellow team mate and I and squad has made me many more new friends and has tested my teamwork many times. Even though this game is pretty good there are actually plenty of issues 1. Bugs this is an early access game so expect tons of crashing and glitches.2. Graphics this game is poorly optimized and the graphics are pretty bad of a unreal engine game.3. Microtransactions this is a issue with many different game devs and blue hole just decided to add them in before full release ( big mistake as this accounts for many of the negative reviews)Overall this game would be a 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Patch 1.0 came out and added lots of great things just got boring for me once Fortnite came out. PUBG has pretty boring gunplay. The game is also not easy to run on a PC. Bluehole also sentenced PUBG Corp to slavery now it's just a money making machine looking to make weapon skins keys to buy and people to cater to. The game also has absolutely awful netcode the last I played it. At this point PUBG simply isn't the game for me anymore it's boring and not a lot is under your control unless you camp a building then all of a sudden it's easy to frag out with 15 kills with your sks. You can for sure be a god at pubg as long as you get 60 fps in a city you're fine since most people cap at 20 everywhere.

2017-07-02,1,1,1216,False,Not Recommended,"Great potential poor implementing. These words can perfectly describe this game. The Battleroyale topic has exploded with PUBG more people approached the game mode and PUBG actually had a great opportunity to become a legendary game.I've been playing this game since June 2017 so almost a year. I've got 130+ hours on the test servers and over 1100 hours on the base game. In the begining I found this game mode quite interesting and entertaining the game was also in development in early access stage so i overlooked all the mistakes it had. It's been a really good time for a while the game had a special atmosphere and stylish mechanic structures. However everything has slowly slided to the opposite side to me after December 2017. The game has come out of Early Access. My expectations were extremely high as this game was probably the most popular multiplayer title at the time and maybe still is. However this whole ""leaving early access"" process was just words. Nothing changed apart from the game becoming even worse. We had serious issues with rubber banding multiple glitches performance issues insane amount of crashes. That point i would have been happier if the game just stayed as it was before. This is not how you transition a game to full release from early access. The game actually has managed to survive this period and kept its popularity however i do believe many people lost their motivation and their hopes. I mean this can happen it's fine nothing is perfect right? The issue is this happened half a year ago. 6 months have passed some of the issues have been adressed some of the issues were ignored some new issues were created etc. I can't really say anything positive that happened during this 6 months period. Maybe the only improvement was the optimisation around February however it was not enough on it's own. I feel like the devs have taken this game to a direction where it's all about putting unnecessary features in the game ignoring to address the biggest issues placing useful contents in the game very slowly (Just think about the 3rd map Sanhok that has been tested for 3 months now and it hasn't even hit test servers yet and let's not even mention the snow map which maybe we'll get in the next 10 years if we stick to this speed of development.).The other huge issue especially for ""veteran"" players who has been playing this game since the begining or since last year is the inconsistency. What do i mean under inconsistency? For example developers have changed scopes multiple times (somewhere around 5 changes just for the 8x Scope.) changed sounds changed environmental elements changed sounds changed weapon mechanics etc. In nuttshell they changed a lot of things but too many times. Some of them were good changes like sound effects animations etc. but most of these changes resulted the game becoming inconsistent. You as an old time player who mastered the use of some equipments weapons always found yourself feeling stupid to struggle with all the changes and learn everything over and over again from the begining so you can compete. The worst fact on top of this is that the game doesn't even have empty servers or practice/training range to test all the equipments weapons and new features before you go in a survival match. You could argue with me that you can just pop onto test servers and try everything that won't affect your stats or that you can just join matches and practice instead of trying to win. But I don't want to look for that new 8x scope for 20 minutes to try it for a few minutes before someone shoots me down meanwhile i am messing about. This game has burnt me out i lost my motivation to play it with effort and joy i am dissapointed and the only thing i am hoping for now is that a better company to release a quality Battleroyale title and mode which is already in progress then i will say good bye to PUBG. Anyone who is satisfied with a multimillionare company who is making slow progress with their product prioritises emoji animation crap weapon skins and loot boxes for money and other like that instead of addressing more serious problems then i wish them good luck in this game but i don't want it thank you very much!There is also a ton of things we could mention that is a huge problem like avarage 17Hz servers microlags crashes (still exists) connection issue messages in the lobby all the time issues with displaying friends being online etc. I don't recommend this game anymore.

And like everyone I started out garbage. I now average 6+ kills a game with ease and always get into the top 10.This game isn't Call of duty. If you aren't going to take a step back and think about your next move when it matters then you'll die and its as simple as that.It requires a certain kind of player its not for everyone but no game ever will be.It has a very well earned reputation and despite what people say I've never been banned for killing a streamer and there has to be sufficent proof for stream sniping.

2017-09-11,0,0,241,False,Not Recommended,Nothing really feels special about this just an fps with more walking and waiting than normal. From what I can tell the only unlockables are aesthetic things to dress your character up like a bad free to play. A spineless developer that jumped on the pewdiepie hate train while the generally annoying community yells things worse than what he said at the beginning of every match. Poor controller compatibility unsatisfying controls in general. To top off this sundae of a game you can get permanently banned from your paid game just for playing in a way that a streamer doesn't approve of. I almost wonder if this is some sort of parody trying to point out everything wrong with the worst steam has to offerEdit I gave it another chance after it came out of early access and added a couple maps and I'm surprised at how much worse they managed to make it. When the servers get too busy they still make you constantly refresh instead of putting you in a queue like any other game. The only unlockables are still aesthetic but now most of them cost real money. Now when you save up enough in game currency to buy a crate you have something like a 60% chance of getting a locked crate that you have to pay to open. They've fully copied fornite's season system making you look at all the stuff you're not getting every time you level up unless you decide to let them suck more money out of you. The graphics are fine but the tactics they use to drain you remind me of every bad smartphone game I've ever played. They might as well just add the option to pay $20 to win the match you're in at this point,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-10,8,49,351,False,Recommended,Recently i've read a lot of negative reviews about this game. However i cannot confirm most of these reviews.. Most of the time people talk about bugs and bad server tick rates.. i have not really experienced any of those. Of course sometimes you're sitting in the plane and can't jump out sometimes your car is doing weird things but overall it's not as full of bugs as people say. I'm using a GTX 1060 (6GB Vram) and an Intel i5 8400 and most of the time i have more than 100 fps except for big cities like Yasnaya or Poch1nki (edit apparently this name is being censored by steam) ... And for those saying it was full of cheaters well.. you're probably just bad or don't have enough experience with weapons. PUBG is permantly trying to get rid of cheaters for instance you can't play PUBG with family shared accounts anymore. On the other hand its kinda true that it's still 30 and they probably added weapons to make more profit but this money can also be spend to reinvest on the game.. unlike fortnite they only get money when people buy the game or when you sell/buy a weapon skin on the steam market (taxes). They are currently working on a new map which again requires money. Speaking about Fortnite.. it has become a competitor to PUBG and therefore PUBG is constantly losing players earning less money. If you're thinking about buying this game you should only do it if you're certain about your CPU/GPU and believe in PUBG's developing progress. In my opinion there are a lot of games on steam which are being improved all the time and are worth buying for they are being worked on all the time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-30,0,0,41,False,Recommended,"Short Version The game is in an entirely different state as to what the Negative reviews would lead you to believe. The game is unique it pits you against 99 other players. There are 3 game modes. The crate system and event passes are only for cosmetics the same with the leveling system. PLAYERSUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is worth a go even at the full $30 asking price.I will start off by saying that I was partly expecting this game to be an unoptimized bugfest hackerfest poorly weapon balanced game. I couldn't believe the reviews that were bashing the game could be true. It may have been at one time but it doesn't seem to be the case anymore. I have a GTX 750 1 GB slim card with 8 GB of installed memory and with the setting all turned to very low (except view distance) and steam overlay turned off (and the other option under it turned off) the game plays well on MY DATED HARDWARE. I don't have noticable FPS drops (with a couple exceptions) and the game is running around 30 FPS or more (roughly can't tell 100% without the FPS counter). The added cherry on top? The game still looks amazing on low graphics! I haven't had one case of a hacker killing me yet as far as I know. To be quite honest the game I play and the game the negative reviews describe are two massively different games. (My only current complaint is that a thing or two on the interfaces get cut off with my 4 3 aspect ratio. Only the option to remove the upgrade slots you find in game for the stock and you can't change shoes or pants (sort of) in the start up menu. Switching to a different ratio allows me to selecet the cosmetic items in the start up and I don't really ever take off the stock items on guns in this game and can still add them so that isn't huge.) Keep in mind this game has 8x8 km maps and 4x4 km maps with about 90 to 100 players each round.Also you don't need the event pass for the new map!The game's premise is that it is you vs 99 other players (typically a few less then that). You find weapons weapon upgrades ammo armoured (or armored for Americans) vests and helmets cars ect before other players do! You have a lot of freedom on the maps as well. There is a ""blue ring"" mechanic that forces players into a progressivly smaller area. It does it just enough that you move towards the center of a progressively smaller circle but not enough that you always feel rushed (even without a car). Each time the ring moves closer in it does more and more damage if you are outside of the play area. As for games modes you have solo the free for all mode. You also have Duo (you and one other guy vs 49 other 2 man teams). The other game mode (which is where I learned many of the game mechanics at first) is Squad you and three other guys vs 24 other 4 man squads. The gun mechanics are very nice but take a little bit to get used to. The game''s leveling system seems to be purely cosmetic based (and bragging rights?) based.Speaking the in game payed content all you ever need the in game crates for is cosmetic items. They barely even let you blend in (if you are smart about it) so the advantage is very very little (if exsistant). The enviroments also change quite a bit between the 3 (current) maps making the ""blend in advantage"" even less. Everything you can get from the crate you can buy on the PUBG Steam Store as well many stuff being .03 cents! You can get very nice outfits for .50 if you so choose. (It also appears that you can get some cosmetics from leveling up nothing to notable in my opinon.) I almost dare say it be better to just pick and choose what you want from the Steam Market.The game itself seems to get a bad rap from an bad start up/ launch. You don't need the event pass to play the new map the leveling system (in my opion) is pretty much useless in terms of actual battle usefulness (only comestics). If you don't want to do the key crate and want a bunch of cosmetics just go onto the PUBG Steam Marketplace! For $30 it isn't a half bad game.With that little blurb out of the way this game is one of a kind and does it pretty well. I got the game for about $20 expecting there to be a complete mess in game with a combination of hackers and bad gameplay mechanics. Needless to say neither has happened (at least in 21 hours of gameplay).",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-09,0,0,158,True,Recommended,"What a fornominon this is.....The whole idea of ""battle royal"" isn't at all a recent consept. It has been around for a very long time! But in a gaming sence this is the one game that has personified it. In the best ways possible. We need to give credit to Arma DayZ and Rust to getting near the consept. But when it comes to battle royal this beats them all hands down.(In terms of game play)The combat is fantastic. NOBODY GETS WEAPONS AT THE START. You all find them during the game. Thus ensuring a chance for even new players to trump the vets.The enviroment is vast and if you get stuck on the other side of the island as the death circle is on the other. Pray to God you manage to find a veacle.The shooting is clunky which is good. This makes cheap shots realy hard to pull off. BUT BE WARNED! Hackers are present in the game (I have personaly encountered two....that is pathetic to say it's a for fun game)The only draw back is that this game WILL be moniteriesed by the accursed ""LOOT CREATS"" system....that just sickens me. Because they made the game to not spawn you in with weapons. To compensate they make loot creats incredably hard to get. It works like this....1st crate 700 points2nd crate 1400 points3rd crate 2800 points.....and so on. Until the next week it resets the points......That is shady as hell PUBG.....To end this review I like this game to play casualy.

2018-01-10,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,I usually dont care about reviews bad games. If they are refund it and done. But this time Steam wont give me a refund because I spent three hours on the game. The three hours spent I was glitching everygame I spawned into. Literally spawned in with no body and coulnt move. The next game I went through the ground and fell into the abyss. I was on dirt and then glitched into it and my game froze. The game stutters and ultimately is ugly imo. It goes for a Realistic Battle Royale type game here and for the concept it succeds. My problem is that this game had been in early access for a while and I stayed away from it becuase I personally thought the 30 dollar price tag was asking too much for just one game mode. But after playing a great deal of Fortnite I decided to give this game a chance becuase a more realistic and overall bigger expierence sounds great. But all that time in early access literally did nothing if the game still plays like an Arma mod that was made by a five man team. I have seen this game make fore great videos online but overall it doesnt feel competitive to me ad I can imagine what it feels like to be in a Pubg Tournament and glitch into building and get stuck so that an enemy player can come up punch you to death. The only thing this game has imo is an idea. The idea is great but it feels far from finished. I dont really understand the commotion this game sturs up in the comminity. I am really sad because I spent 30 dollars on a game that didnt work and Steam wont give me a refund to buy dragonball fighterz instead. Its cool though. I gambled on a game that already had MIXED reviews on steam. The real problem is that I shouldnt have to gamble wether a game that I pay for works or not.Until a really great battle royale game comes out I will stick to Fortnite which in all honesty is really good but just like PubG not without problems.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Mainly since the Pioneer crates are purely cosmetic at the moment and adding minor weapons (if balanced) won't ruin the game.Certainly gets my seal of approval considering it's early access and unlike other E.A. games isn't broken in more ways than one.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

First you jump out of a plane and hope you find a gun before someone else and when you fail to find a gun you will get shot in the back by someone you found an AKM. Every. Game. If you're somehow lucky enough to find a gun before your opponents it will matter none the same. As you will be rubberbanding so hard all over the world it will give your opponent enough time to hit you one time in the head with a punch to instantly kill you.

2017-10-29,0,0,269,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT I died 3 times to my UAZ glitching off a bridge and sending me into water exploding. Also experienced approximately 13 crashes so far due to RAM issues but PUBG doesn't have the capability to take up 32GB of RAM. Servers are game still needs a lot of work. edit+ needs region lock. the game is ruined by the intense flood of asian hackers. i remember going onto asian servers for fun and only hearing asians screaming but now that's everywhere on NORTH AMERICAN SERVERS. All because China banned PUBG they flood our servers. region lock please for the love of god. fix your bluehole you know what needs to be done. edit++ tried it once more. died to 3 hackers then another game just so happened to have a flying pistol spamming houdini. Very Promising! PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a very unique battle royale game despite there being many made already. H1Z1 KOTK or whatever thousand different names they've given it is NOTHING like this one. The company shows a lot of promise and they actively patch various bugs glitches and gameplay issues. They also know how to listen to a community instead of just stealing people's money and running away with it. It doesn't even NEARLY deserve the mass amounts of negative reviews that it has received and I don't think that'll stop their game from growing. Here's why Decent Gameplay The controls are very nice even from the start. I didn't have to modify much to get the controls to my liking. Just a holster and crouch rebind then I'm done. Voice chat is practically useless unless you're a troll. Very smooth movement system and I'm looking forward to the new vaulting and climbing to even further my statement. Let's just hope to God it's smoothened out by the time it's released. The bugs and glitches are not much to think about. I find it very hard to get angry at dying to a bug or gameplay glitch mainly because I can just restart and get right back into a match easily. (That is if they aren't doing maintenance for once. Still a good thing that they're doing some fixes to the servers. They used to be horrid. ) Sometimes you'll find your motorcycle FLYING into the sunset and then randomly explode into a shower of ash and metal. But that's not something to be mad over. I find myself falling out of my chair laughing so hard that I begin to cry. Bluehole / PUBG Corp is actively working to fix these issues and hopefully they don't cease to stop. The forcefield (""blue zone."") The forcefield though seemingly copied straight from H1Z1 is quite different from it's less popular counterpart. The recent update changed how forcefields work and actually provide a sense of PvE into the game instead of every thing being head to head combat and shooty shooty bang bang. Graphics and Sound Now this is the tricky part. Recently the graphics have been optimized quite a large bit but before I was getting around 40 FPS with my GTX 1060 6GB. It really shows promise in their company and developers. The graphics are pretty well made. But I still don't understand how you allow people to make it to where they can disable rendering entirely and drive straight through buildings that should be there but aren't at all. (Plenty of info on that around the YouTubes.) Overall PUBG Corp has done a very good job at making sure that it's nice and optimized. I can easily reach around 170 FPS on high rendering settings. In my honest opinion the sounds are amazing. Once you first start playing like me it was relatively hard to distinguish one gunshot from another. But as you start playing you start to attune yourself to how they sound where things are coming from etc. I love the attention to detail especially on the sound of a far away gunshot. For instance if you get shot at from somewhere the bullet will be faster from the sound wave. The bullet will land first then followed after that the sound. I love how in depth they made the game with those little details. ...Microtransactions...? The main argument that I see in a lot of reviews is that the company ""BROKE THEIR PROMISE ON NO MICROTRANSACTIONS."" But there are none of the sort. You don't have to pay ANY real money to get crates and if you do it's your own fault. They never implemented any sort of way of buying crates other than through the Steam market and I'm not ever sure if those benefit the company. I don't even think it would need to since it's ever growing player count. For God's sake there isn't even an option to buy them at the rewards screen so why would you think such a stupid thing? Rating 9/10 Now of course there are some major things in the game that can be VERY difficult to play with (E.G. vehicle collisions being screwed up.) but those usually get fixed pretty fast when someone actually takes the time to point it out. I like the way that this game is heading and I think that getting it out of early access within the next month will be a huge step for both the company and the game itself. So far I'm very impressed and so is a lot of the playerbase. Let's keep it that way PUBG Corp.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-08,0,0,37,True,Recommended,this game is better than H1Z1 and a pretty good execution of the battle royale concept that arma III modders originally popularized. if you like pub but you aren't familiar with arma and it's modding scene you should def check it out much of the realism and other aspects of pub that people love were originated in the arma series made by bohemia interactive. personally i think the hype surrounding pub has gotten a little carried away. the biggest problem is that it's extraordinarily poorly optimized i have to run mostly low settings to get 60+ fps consistently on a brand new i7700k/1080 ti rig with 16gb ram. i've heard some people with high end rigs say they get decent performance on low or medium settings but many if not most players seem to have performance issues like i do. this wasn't as big of a deal when the developer initially promised to address all the performance and optimization issues before focusing on the monetization of the game via esports or a crate system or advertising or other typical ways that very popular games are milked for cash. unfortunately these promises were broken quite blatantly and while there have been some small fixes or improvements for some issues for the most part performance even on high end systems remains a huge problem. yet somehow the crate system esports and in game advertisements and transactions are all a part of the game already and recently a new company was formed to help monetize the game more effectively.to make things even worse recently the pub developer bluehole has publicly threatened the developer of fortnite over it's battle royale expansion when you start threatening people and implying you have ip rights to a concept you got rich with but very clearly did not originate but lifted intact from a modding community sponsored by another developer well let's just say that's not a good look. while people have been slow to anger with the pub developer (i think because they love the very unoriginal concept so much) the patience of much of the community regarding the continuing failure to address various performance issues and other fundamental problems with the game while it is being aggressively monetized at the same time seems to finally be running out. hopefully it's not too late for bluehole to rectify some of it's recent missteps. i think if they continue to focus on the monetization of the game while ignoring the communities' pleas to address basic performance issues or threatening people over the use of a concept they did not originate and don't own then they may snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and lose the opportunity for pub to become a major esport and maintain it's current popularity in the long run.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-16,0,0,893,True,Not Recommended,Where shall I start? So lets start with what the game is all about. You and a bunch of ppl (100) gets tossed into a plane and will have to make it with what you find the the island after parachuting down. Its the adrenaline rush with hording loot and making it to the end without dieing. So far Ive been on both sides of the game meaning Ive had a bad computer and bought a new one so Ive felt how it preformes with low specs and high. When I where new to the game my aim where completly and I MEAN complete I remember the first kill I made were probabaly after 10 games I where in heaven for a brief 10 sec before I got naded to death. The first Victory were the one where I kept hiding myself until it were 1v1 and I hit him once in the leg and won. Basicly my day were made from that victory. So from being utter trash Ive become a decent player with around 20 wins and a positiv KD in all the game types on EU (main) and NA. Buying this game with low spec in my eyes might kill your appreciation for the game. Landing but unable to enter a building since its not rendered having issues in a duo/squad fight since its causing some lag here and there. Aswell as loot spawning in later then normal. Now Im running the game on ultra on everything except Post prossesing and Foliage since Ive heard its pointless too have that in this state of the game. Pros A decent sized map.Alot of players (meaning short waiting times) 0 5 sec.Low server problems.Alot of ways to kill ppl Melee shooting driving over ppl and nade. Decent shooting experince.Adrenaline rush esp. in 1v1. Good amount of updates (weekly and 1 big each month).Good textures if you run it on ultra. Over 160 hours Ive personly not encountered a cheater or what might seem like a cheater. So when ppl spam cheater dont really listen to them. +Devs are making a great job banning ppl so things are getting done on that part.Cons At this moment of time laying down into grass aint working on long range since the grass dont load in. Meaning ppl can spot you from a mile away with ease. This is why ppl are running Very low foliage. Cause its pointless to have it on ultra when its only affecting you to see less. Only 1 map (But its coming out more maps every soon).Only 3rd person (Being worked on to make a 1st person mode aswell).Surtain weapons seem to be a little off on the bullet drop.If the game want you to die it sure does so. I dunno how many times Ive gotten killed cause the circle are the worst over and over and over again. Making it impossible to survive or the loot is utter trash. After looting 10 houses you leave with a melee wep and only that. Meaning the loot balance is still somewhat off sometimes you might find 4 AR's in the same house.Parachuting is somewhat poor to manover. Should be a little better and easier to turn and so on. Sometimes the parachute just becomes turle mode and moves slow as before hitting the ground.All in all its a repetitve game drop out of the plane loot die/win and repeat. But its also so much more every game creates different encounters making every game a possiblity for something great. Ive personly had games Ive ressed a full squad killed a teammate and won in one single game. Driven over ppl/been droven over ... but at the same time its the inner drive to kill ppl and win that makes me still jump into a new game over and over again. Hope I see you on the other side ! DAs of 19.01 I advice anyone looking into buying this game to stay far away until they fix the cheating problem. I have been quite silent to the cheating problem as I felt alot had to be with ppl just playing badly and calling out cheats asap. Yet the past week Ive encountered 5 cheaters that simply kill you across the map. I normaly dont look at Killcams either since I ofter know the fact to why I died (Poor positioning aim or something else). So esp or not something I look at since I atleast had a chance normaly to kill em first.Bluehole have made no good effort considering the amount of players/money they made from the launch to encounter this problem and been quite silent which simply destroys the community. I stand by my original post in the sense that the game is and could be beyond anything else Ive played as it gives a good rush. Yet when you put in a good 20 min into the game and end up dieing to a cheat game after game it start to devour you.So according to me stay away until this is fixed and the reviews become better! ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However if we are playing solo we are forced to try get into a Squad FPP as a solo because of the ""estimated wait times"" being broken.

It looks and plays really well the set up is unique and its the first game in many years to actually make me feel fear and stress. It is a stressful game but its oh so fun. Best played in a team every time I play with friends i definately switch the recorder on becasue something funny/exciting/memorable is guantreed to happen. The rewards of various items of clothing are a little bit of a let down to play several games and rack up enough points for another reward for it to simply be ""another plain white t shirt"" is really diappointing but i suppose that is part of the game.I have come across several glitchs and it has crashed once or twice but it is still under development.

2017-08-20,0,0,133,True,Recommended,"I want it to be known before i say anything this is an early access game. Its bound to have some issues with it. (though personally its like 2017 and some issues happening rn is kinda like ""what?"" but we'll get into that)PROS 1) Fun as hell gun play with bullet drop and attachments to upgrade your guns around the map2) The feel good moment when you win a gun fight actually makes you feel amazing (at least to me anyway)3) 3 types of gamemodes solo duo and squads. solo for solo duo for 2 players and squads for 3 4 players4) Some players in this game are really fun with the proximity voice chat you could yell at eachother playfully talk to eachother or some other dumb things that could be fun5) Not a wide variety of guns but a pretty good amount for you to think about a favorite (And plus they are adding more and more as time goes on)6) Supply crates will drop around the map holding some REALLY good gear but a lot of players will be going for it so its that whole fighting to the death for it i love7) This isnt just a run and gun shooter either you will most likely to use everything you have to win a game and you need to choose when and how to fight and always check around you for other players trying to get the drop on you8) A crate system that lets you buy them with IN GAME CURRENCY that once opened gives you some clothes some looking better than others (Right now there is a crate you need to buy a key for with $$$ but its only for this event and the money goes to raise funds for events prizepool for tournaments as well as charity so i dont see an issue)CONS 1) They REALLY need a volume slider for gun shots or grunts your character makes when shot im a very jumpy person so when i get shot i freak out for a second because its pretty loud when its quiet. (This is just kinda personal/for jumpy people though)2) Like i said its a early access game so its gonna have some issues but one i just cant wrap my head around is the graphics not loading in once you are forced to pull the parachute at first i thought it was just me but going on reddit and other foarms i saw it was happening to other people. and when i say graphics dont load i mean you are looking at a building that looks like it was from ps1 and if you enter that building you have a constant falling animation and sometimes you'll frames will DROP hard im talking slideshow sort of deal. This REALLY sucks when its early game and you should be looking for a gun to fight with but instead you run around the map like a headless chicken. (Although there is a way to force your graphics to load when you are forced to pull your parachute then hit tab to open your inventory and your screen will freeze for a bit but once it comes back your graphics will load but it really does suck sometimes because it takes a while sometimes honestly i shouldnt have to do this EVERY game i play now but i do so i dont die waiting for my graphics to load.) RANT OVER lol 3) RNG plays a role in this game as it IS a battle royale game but it kinda sucks when you get the short end of the stick with loot and you see this dude with full armor helmet and rifle and all you got its a pistol with level 1 body armor.4) This game should be WAY more optimised then it is right now my computer may not be the best computer on the world but its also not potato. I can run recent games no problem even on the max settings. I shouldnt be pushed to use VERY LOW on almost everything like i do with this game. (Which really sucks because some people have no problems with the game is it look SO PRETTY on their screens while im playing a ps1 game. This also ties into the whole graphics wont load point i made)5) The game is pretty low on content with older players sense they arent adding new things right now and focusing on fixing bugs and help the game on a technical level which is totally fine. But i bring this up because for some people this game MAY get boring after a while so be ready for all of that when getting into the gamePERSONAL 1) I get house sitting is a strat but when i die to it i want to die in real life honestly2) There can be some annoying people in the voice chat if you have it on its hard to describe but youll know what kind of people im talking about if you play this game for a while (Though this can be fixed by mutting the voice chat)3) I wish they would work on the snow map over the desert map honestly i hate desert maps.4) ""CAN I GET A MOTHER ING CAR??? JESUS I HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR 5 MINUTES STRAIGHT"" honestly sameOVERALL this is is fun when it works though i wanna bring this up as well. solo is NO WHERE nearly as fun as duo or squads. This game is such a co op game that i have trouble in solo because it gets to boring. If you got friends to play with this will be your game its super fun with friends. If you are interested in this game i say give it a chance maybe $30 is a stretch... but i say it COULD be worth that much but its hard to saw with the state its in right now. gl and hf in your games non the less though.7/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-19,0,0,95,True,Recommended,TL DR This game is a MUST BUYI'm going to keep this short and sweet. This game is AMAZING. The gun fights are something to behold when both sides are well equipped. This games gets 2 times better with every player you add up to 4 for squad gameplay. Looking for loot and killing dudes is a genius idea because who doesn't like LOOT and the sweet smell of blood in the air. This game is a must buy. The only real flaw with this game is that the movement can be clunky at times the network lag can be annoying and the optimization is terrible TURRIBLE. This game would be a solid 8/10 in my book with 10/10 potential assuming they fix the problems that I named.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-11,0,0,321,True,Not Recommended,"This is a great game. It has even more potential. Has its glitches and issues just like any other. However there's one huge problem with this game. If your playing on any server especially North America (NA) then wether its solo duo or squad you have a 98 percent chance to be paired with or against mostly chinese or some form of asian ethnicity. In all the time on PUBG I've only encountered 1 let me repeat ONE Spanish speaking person. Which Mexico is part of NA so thats a bit odd. I've found a total of 25 English speaking people on the NA server since I first started playing the game up to writing this now. Those 25 English speaking (2 were british and 1 was austrailian) all told me the same thing I'm writing about now. Its bad when you join a match and when you hear the other person speak you immediately say ""oh thank god you speak english"". If you've watched Youtubers your not watching the actual public games. Those are private servers those people are allowed to use to promote the game. Back to the main topic. I understand Bluehole is a company run by asians specifically southeast asians South Koreans. So I know this and honestly think they are the right ones to develop and keep this game going from my experience with the game. Also like thier logo. I don't have a problem playing with asian people. Won a match of squad with a Chinese guy who only knew ""stop go no"" and I even shared the screen shot of the win. But that was one time only and has never happened again. And I've played all the modes extensively which on the NA server is dominated by asians that can't even speak english. And this game when not playing solo is all about communication. However if I'm in a squad that has nothing but asian speakers on a NA server at any given time then I do have a problem with communication. Its a NA server for a reason. Most of the language spoken in NA (Canada U.S. Mexico) is English. Even players from Russia speak at least enough English to work as an amazing team. I wish it was just the NA server. Its actually all across the board. So until they either Region Lock (they have thier own server and sometimes it runs smoother than the NA in my 27 different squad match tests of it) the asians from the NA server or limit how many asians can access a NA server at any given time then I can't in good faith recommend this game for anyone on the North American continent. Your experience of the game will be layered in bad taste after bad taste. It actually bothers me to have to leave this negative review. Thats how much I like this game and have had fun with my friends. But if your friends aren't on and you want to play squads or duo's then yeah its a bad day. I'll keep an eye on the changes they make. If they fix this problem then I'll gladly change my review and then recommend it. But until then please don't buy this game. I don't want you who are reading this to have a bad gaming experience due to not being able to communicate with team members or have your ears screamed off by asians in the waiting lobby/squad match because they are just talking away at the highest pitch during the match to people that aren't even in the game. Most new people don't know about that and its why most of us change to only team chat or mute it all together and use only discord if our friends are on. Sorry Bluehole but its gotta change guys especially when I've heard a few people call the asian invasion of the NA server an ""ethnic form of griefing"" due to this whole issue and a lot of North American players not being able to get onto servers because so many asians bring them down from logging into it. Yes its actually happened. And this game unfortunately has sparked a whole lot of racism between asians and everyone else. Its sad that it has happened but you can't blame the harsh feelings towards asians because of these issues. However its not just asians that are at fault. Bluehole didn't anticipate this many asian people all at once and that was a SEVERE oversight. And that is putting it lightly. So if your looking for a fun game that will always stay fun even through frustration of losing sometimes this is not the game for you. Not in its current state with all of the issues with asians on the North America server. So for my North American gaming brothers and sisters please avoid this game until that problem is fixed. Godspeed and good gaming my friends.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-13,0,0,207,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I enjoy this game much more than I do H1 it has its issues but its an early access game. They have patched this game up more than I have seen any other devloper do. The developers listen to community feedback which makes this game that much better. I would suggest anyone looking for a battle royale game to pick this game up.Pros + Gameplay is tactical &amp a lot of fun. + Hit box Hit registration better than others ive seen in this genre. + Game modes include Solos Duos Squads/Fours with competetive 5's coming soon. + Weekly updates to improve games quality+ Working on tracking and banning cheaters/hackers.+ No micro transactions Cosmetics/Crates are bought with in game currency earned by doing well in the game. Cons Right now the only thing that really needs to be cracked down on is the optimization of the game. Again this is an early access title and most known issues are being worked on. Optimization Game needs to be optimized have to run the game on low otherwise only get 50 to 60fps. Servers lag is being worked on but still an issue and generally only when game first starts and picking up items.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-28,0,0,426,True,Recommended,Definitely a game worth playing but not paying that amound of cash on it. At least not on prea alpha.As an avid player of survival games like Dayz and Miscreated and working in the industry for the last 5 years I can say a few things that burst into my mind This game is the best battle royale at the moment but only for the moment if they continue like this. Great potential for competitive gameplay but definitely it isnt. The game has major mechanic failures due to crappy engine but everything can be fixed The overall level design is on point but it has major flaws that couldnt integrate the game into competitive hype. A few examples 1. Jumping mechanic is a fail You need timing to succesfully jump something (if jumpable) No need for this in this kind of game.2. Major level design flaws Small gaps in objects that look ok to jump but they wont pass you through. This includes broken walls disconnected fences distance between objects like two boxes tiny blocks of cement etc. You will get fooled and killed just like a rat in a maze.Although I understand their idea of money grabbing with micro tranzactios I dont understand you they implemented change of clothes into the game. Why would I want to change my black shirt to a pink one mid game? I changed my clothes by accident a few times while I was in a rush and I ended the game dressed in white although Im trying to camo myself. And about clothes... Why is the variation so small? 4 Shirts and 4 pants is not enough... Make some camo ones bring a diversity of camo ones.. You can do so much more blueHole.... And dont tell me its because pre alpha.. this is lazyness. Although I play with all my friends do I recommended it to someone else? Yes but after they fix all this. And yes after they charge a price that equals the quality of the game. Right now is overpriced and overhyped.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-05,0,0,494,False,Recommended,This game is pretty good. One of my favorites however there are bugs. You got to understand coming into this game the developers aren't some multimillion dollar organization and came from nothing so of course there is going to be some things that need to be fixed. Also for those complaining about the 1.0 release of course there is going to be bugs. I used to play WoW and when that first came out as the 1.0 (aka Vanilla WoW) it was buggy. Took Blizzard years and years to get them out and still has bugs to this day. (Side note PUBG came out as the 1.0 but they never raised the price any even though it was supposed to be $60 once it s fully out so they do know that their game is not ready to be advertised as that.) But if you can try to put that aside and give them the benefit of the doubt it is a very fun intense game that requires full attention and smart tactics to survive to get that delicious chicken dinner! I'd give PUBG 8/10 soon will be 11/10 once bugs are flushed out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Even so best casual/survival game I've played in a long time. Very enjoyable. It would be great if they added a reconnect feature tho cause the game crashes ALOT.P.S.

I don't really get it with this game too often Sometimes I won't feel like playing but overall it has become my favourite game by far Would definitely recommend this if you're buying it with some friends or even solo can have you rushing with adrenaline while fighting for that number one spot and it's getting down to the last 10 people heart's pounding and all you can hear is maybe footsteps and louder and louder gunshots all around until it's just you and the other guy fighting for the chicken dinner. 10/10 would recommend. ing chicken dinners.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-28,0,0,397,True,Not Recommended,The Twitch renessaince that started last year made this game popular after the fall of H1Z1 King of the Kill. The concept is still exciting however after 8 months of being in early access state it's becoming more and more obvious that the developers bite off more than they can chew. This game is highly incompetetive simply because it has the worst netcoding I've ever seen. You can't make a game with a netcoding like this. It should have been fixed already but it's just getting worse and worse the more people play the game the worst the netcoding will be. If I'm right and I'm 99% sure I'm right after 1.0 releases nothing will change they focus on things that are not priority. Bluehole failed and will fail to meet the expectations. This game goes down the drain after H1Z1 and honestly I don't think we'll ever get a decent Battle Royale game until AAA developers will start working on them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The devs made the promise of no microtransactions but they needed some kind of economic revenue to keep improving the game for us. If you let microtransactions that are even more lowkey than CSGO microtransactions then I'm afraid you are a bandwagon sheep that doesn't understand a good game when they see one or how an early access game is supposed to be improved from an economic standpoint.

2017-04-01,0,0,364,False,Recommended,This is a great game! (For certain people) First of all this game is fairly hard to run. I'd recommend you have decent specs before purchasing this game. However this does not mean you need a gaming beast to have any fun whatsoever. On low settings it can run quite well on nearly anything. Since it's early access release PUBG Corporation has done an incredible job optimizing and improving the game though it is far from perfect.This game also contains a somewhat high skill cap. Many players are set off from the game early on which is a shame because of it's high skill cap. This game takes time and dedication to earn that chicken dinner. As a result of this winning a match is an extremely satisfying and relieving experience. This game may also involve camping... Lots and lots of camping. Like I said earlier this game has a high skill cap so making it to the top ten as a newcomer to the game isn't. This is why many players (Possibly including you) will camp until the blue circle forces them out of their position. Until you reach the point where you are fully used to the controls shooting mechanics utilities and the map itself you probably won't be able to play as aggressive as you may want to. I rarely see complaints about the complaints about the community but I just want to clear anything up for anyone considering buying this game. The community (Other than the area you stay in before the match starts) is in that sweet spot between irritatingly competitive and annoyingly bad. If you go to the official Player Unknown's Battlegrounds discord you will find thousands of dedicated players willing to play with anyone there. (Side note There is no way to buy loot boxes so any complaints about the game having loot boxes I believe is ridiculous. And lastly hackers. This is an issue I hear about a lot from the community. I play primarily on North American servers and European servers. After 249 hours in the game I have never once encountered a blatant hacker and with the new death cam feature can confirm that hackers are very rare. Of course it is an issue with the game as it is with almost every other online game but I don't see it as nearly as big of an issue as many make it out to be.PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is for the kind of player ready to stay dedicated and ready to get angrier than you've ever been. You have to be the kind of player ready for a competitive but still fun experience. You have to be able to communicate with your teamates and most of all you have to be patient. You won't be Shroud in your first game and you have to know that before going in. I'd say if you're looking for a more casual should try out and easier experience you should try out Fortnite. With no bullet drop or bullet time it's a game that's much easier to pick up and play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I spent months watching many different twitch streamers and youtubers play this game which is what lead me to buying it but now I genuinely regret doing so..It's not like I can't play the game it's the fact that it's meant to be a fully released game but it plays like I have never won a game despite my countless hours of trying and thats due to either hackers or some idiot camping in a house thats been there for alomost 3 4 circles.. Then theres the problem with the peaking system.. I'll peak round a wall and get one shot but an M4 and I'm pretty decent at lining up a good peak but yet as soon as I peak that tiny little but..poof.. I'm dead.. are people really just that good? No seriously because there have been times I've caught someone out on a ridiculous peak shot 4 maybe 5 shots of scar directly at his head and this guy was peaked for a good 5 seconds not 1 like me and I've used XBox capture to review my clips not the broken Death Cam system cause everyone knows that that thing is absolutely terrible.. but yea I hit him with them 5 shots and didn't even knock of his level 2 helmet? But I get one shot after literally one second of peaking while wearing the same helmet.. talking about helmets and stuff... the lack of loot spawns CHRIST! It's outrageous i'll drop down check 3 4 houses and I would have found 3 pistols a frying pan a grenade and some meds.. but yet I can hear AKs going off 2m away from me.. the way this game is made makes it unplayable honestly every thing is RNG based and I'm a guy that has terrible luck in general so when someone like me plays a game that requires unbelievable RNG luck then I get bored really quickly.I have had a couple decent games but then still once I earn a decent amount of BP I'm forced to have to spend MORE money on keys just to open crates I've worked my off for... like I hardly get 200 from a single match and once you've bought one crate the price then doubles making it harder to obtain a case that doesn't require a key. Rip off merchants thats what they are BlueHole need to sort this game out or it's going down the drain. I've never been so dissapointed with a game my entire life.

2018-01-12,0,0,258,False,Recommended,This is a great game and I can only see it improving with future patches. However there's one main issue and that is the hackers that ruin the game for everyone else. Likewise I feel like many people exaggerate when they write reviews saying that hackers are in a majority of games as i have only ever encountered 2/3 in the 100 odd games i've played though they are still a problem none the less and a region lock for the Chinese is one of the things the developers need to work on in order to keep everyone satisfied.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-08,0,0,395,False,Recommended,So the game has some pros and some consPros Gameplay The game is fun the gunplay is solid and the battle royale format feels fairly perfected in this game.Winning An odd thing to specify but for this game it makes sense the feeling you get when you win is unlike any other win feeling in any other game for me personally it took 200 hrs of play before my first solo win and I've heard from people I know who play this that that's the usual it seems like a grind for a simple win but it's fun trying to get it and never feels like a chore also as I mentioned an indescribable feeling when it happens.Pacing Some people say the game plays too slow and it can at times but it can be fast if you make it. Dropping in an unpopulated area will make it feel slow since there will be a lot of travel before you encounter anyone dropping in a more populated area (named cities) will make encounters happen almost immediately. Early starters probably wont want to do fast starts as until you get used to the guns you'll likely lose most firefights but doing populated drops will help you get better at firefighting you'll learn the way you like to play pretty early on.Loot/Looting The loot system in this game is simple but just in depth enough to feel good it's simple enough of having different equipment levels going up to 3 the higher the level the better the equipment. Weapons don't have levels out right since it's how you feel about a weapon that will determine whether you want to use it or not. The attachment system is also simple enough you'll find random attachments and they'll say what type of gun they're specifically for (SMG AR etc.) and you'll se if your gun can take it or not.Cons Optimization The game will require a ton of your PC's power despite not seeming like it really needs it this means a lower level PC will not be able to run the game and you'll need a beefy graphics card and processor.Crashing The game crashes a lot more then any other game I've played it will crash at any moment leaving a game joining a game playing a game pretty much any moment its open it can crash granted in game crashes have greatly reduced since it was in early access crashes while joining a game happen most often some crashes so bad you can't close the game or tab out requiring you to restart your PC. Hackers This game has a lot of hackers so many so you'll usually use the death cam feature to see if the player that killed you was one. These hackers ruin matches and you will always be annoyed if one of them killed you their hacks range from freezing your controls to the usual aimbot. The game has done an amount to combat them but they still plague the game unfortunately.The Kar 98 K This is one gun in the game and it is broken. It's way to powerful for how common it is it will destroy any helmet in one shot and kill you instantly if you're wearing a level 3 helmet you'll survive 2 headshots and if you are revived after this your level 3 helmet will be destroyed. Body shots are pretty much a 2 shot kill for any level vest (1 shot with no vest). It also doens't help that this is the gun of choice for the previously mentioned hackers who when using aimbot will always headshot you giving you no chance of defending yourself. There are stronger snipers namely the M24 and the AWM but these are uncommon drop crate items meaning they're only in the drop crate and aren't as likely to be in there as the more common weapons which balances them.Overall In summary disregarding all it's issues the game is really fun it perfects the battle royale genre and does it better then most other games flying the battle royale flag. However if you don't enjoy tactical shooter games you may not enjoy the game too much but even if you aren't a fan of tactical shooters I'd still give it a shot you'll find out within the steam refund period if you will enjoy it or not so if you don't you can refund it easily.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,73,True,Not Recommended,Interesting game concept unfortunately the implementation stinks. there's lots of issues with objects that shouldn't block bullets preventing you from shooting someone while they have no trouble shooting you. The performance is very poor considering how dated the graphics are.

2017-10-17,0,0,329,True,Not Recommended,Another game where the developers hide under the guise of early access to sell you an incomplete game that they never plan on fixing. It's sad because the game has potential and is fun to play. However the numerous bugs glitches cheaters and lag spikes is infuriating and is a huge turnoff. You would think that with all the money they made off of their 13 million customers they would be able to fix these problems but it seems the developers are too busy laughing themselves to the bank.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
