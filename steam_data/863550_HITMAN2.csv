3,77162885,english,"Overall: Relatively Niche Masterpiece

The Hitman 2 has only  ~18000 reviews at the time I post this review. And I see only less than 40% of the players have even completed The Finish Line, which is the 2nd mission and 1st full-blown mission in Hitman  2 (Night Call mission is kind of tutorial-ish). ~14% of the players completed the last non-DLC mission.

Considering the quality of the game and the effort (where user can see) put in to making this game, I think this game deserves more attention than it already has. 

Pros:
One of the longest lasting stealth game franchise. (Though not all of the individual games are stealth games)
Excellent overall gameplay.
Top-class map design.
Great details scattered all over the maps.
Every map is designed to be played multiple times.
Not really ""open world"", but it makes you feel that you, the player is proactively exploring the map, the possibilities of assassination and putting scattered pieces of story together. The subtitle on the start screen is well said: ""Make the world your weapon""

Cons:
The story telling is not as good, telling form only Hitman and Hitman 2.
The movie between missions are static pictures in Hitman 2, instead of CG movies in Hitman.
Compared with the base game, the DLC is not delivering as much volume for its price tag.",1602050554,1602050554,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198256342486,107,2,5051,4047,4876,1602064062

34,77010045,english,"TLDR; Amazing game.

If you are playing Hitman™ just for the sake of completing the story missions and be done with them, you'll be very bored and it's a waste of money to you, because you're missing the point.

Sure, mission objectives are way too easy (if you turn on the 'mission story' aka clues), the main selling point of Hitman™ games are the challenges : created by the dev, custom made by the community and by yourself). The game is a sand box that forces you to find creative and satisfying ways to blend in and eliminate your targets. You can spend countless hours doing recon on the movement of your targets, observing their behaviour and plan your method. Timing of your execution is both crucial and brutal depending on your play style.

Gunplay is intentionally difficult to discourage run and gun, if you're strategic with it though, the intensity of landing headshot after headshot feels solid. Just don't do quick save and quick load once thing go south, instead adapt to real time consequences and you'll be rewarded with a very fulfilling gameplay experience.

Not a fan of the UI, especially the [RELOAD] notification. And the fact that we need to tap a few keys to access the larger map.

14,76746520,english,"Best game in the franchise. As if 2016 wasn't already great, the game mechanics are furthermore improved in this latest installment. 
The added in feature of being able to hide crouched in bushes/ plants helps a lot with the stealth aspect of the game and on missions where there is a high amount of NPC/ guard personnel. It's a graphically demanding game but it actually runs not bad considering I am using a computer with below minimum system requirements. Some lags here and there but over all, even in the Dubai level it's smooth as hell. I can't wait to play it on my own computer with higher specs. 

The storyline continues on from where 2016 left off, and it gets way juicier. The progression of the story keeps you interested, and you get a lot more explanation on things you might have not been sure about in the 2016 game. 
The game is very challenging, but in a manner that is not broken, but based off captivating and entertaining gameplay. Not the kind where the challenge is based off how clunky the game mechanics are. The way it should be. You are rewarded for carefully thought out decision making, timing with actions, and most importantly patience. You pay dearly especially on master difficulty for haphazard playing style.

The sandbox levels are detailed as the predecessor, the opportunity/ mission story mechanics have been improved, being made multiple times more intricate, whilst each mission story is very unique, never once becoming repetitive. The amount of different roles and disguises 47 assumes in order to eliminate a target is mind boggling and in a league of its own in terms of stealth gaming. 

Best game in the series, if you have a good gaming rig, it's definitely worth full price.

And the World is you Weapon- a silenced pistol, saw-off shotgun, poisoned spaghetti, a screwdriver, and even LSD-laced cigarettes are all ways to get the job done. And this goes for just about any target on any mission. If you can find it, you almost certainly can use it to finish off your mark.

64,76615140,english,"Ok, I'll keep this one pretty brief. If you enjoy stealth, in any respect whatsoever, get this game. It is, in my opinion, the best of its genera to date. Every mechanic is fleshed out and consistent throughout, and once you've learned the ropes, you'll be able to manipulate every facet of each level to your advantage. 

The level design is stellar across the board, and each is brimming with absurdly nuanced detail. When you think you've seen it all, you'll return to a level that you thought you'd memorized completely and find a whole new wealth of ways to take down your targets.

I've put in many hours on each location, and none of them have ever felt stale in the least.

Another aspect of the game which stands out is the pitch perfect comedic writing. The npc banter is consistently hilarious, and watching them lose their minds every time a small mess is made is always a treat. 47's one liners are likewise excellent, and David Bateson's absurdly stoic and dry delivery sells the jokes perfectly.

The game is optimized well for both controller and mouse and keyboard, and while I do feel that controller is slightly more comfortable due to the movement and button ergonomics, IOI clearly did their work in porting this game to the PC. Whatever your tools, you'll be able to have an excellent experience.

Hitman and Hitman 2 are stealth masterpieces. Go forth and make the world your weapon.

-although HITMAN2 is considered an ultimate stealth game,there's absolute no point going crouch if you want to kill someone,you can run or walk to victim he's deaf asf

-if you kill someone with lethal weapon there's bloodpool on the ground,now watch what happens when guards come in,NOTHING hahaha

-notification system bring it back,when you running in certain areas you act suspicious don't you think ioi?

-in master difficulty,if I shoot camera nothing happens seems like guards are watching at their smartphones instead of camera screens

-game-pausing inventory,let me browse weapons while I am approaching to my next victim

-MAP,when I open map it freezes game again,you can't watch targets moving

-did any of iOi staff ever threw a coin at grass? if it makes ""cink"" sound then you might reconsider developing video-games

-opening or closing door does not bring any attention at all,when we will be able to open/close door slowly? I hope you understand it would increase difficulty in a good way

-you can't whistle or knock while you are covering at wall to bring attention,games like mgs or splinter cell got this many years ago

-same one fighting animation,again and again,there's not a single one npc that can counter hitman moves

The story might be somewhat lackluster, but that's not particularly important to the Hitman franchise. The locations are varied and interesting with numerous opportunities providing unique scenarios to complete your mission.
Furthermore, this is probably one of the most accessible Hitman games in terms of difficulty. There are quite a few features that would help newcomers to the franchise (instinct, mission stories, challenges).

Hitman is a unique stealth game, when you give the freedom to how you gonna kill the target, gun blazing is an option too, just not preffered. You can sneak in wearing disguise hiding in plain sight, which is the key element of hitman game. After that you choose how you kill the target, stab directly, trap them, sabotage the environment to make it look like accident. If you a hardcore stealth gamer, you can do it with more traditional stealth too. The choice is absolutely yours.

This game has a pretty low skill floor and very high skill ceiling, depend not only the difficulty, but also depend on what is your goals, since this game has a lot of score parameters. Also that what makes this game is highly replayable, from kill the target with different method, complete the challenges, explore the map to play a contracts or escalations. This game is suitable even for gamers that suck in stealth like me.

Environment is top notch, ever map feel alive with tons of npc wander around & behave like in real life. Each map give various challengeto the player, with the exception of Whittleton Creek wich is kinda too easy.

Every single level just drops you in and the story naturally unfolds before you as you explore and pull on the different threads. 

The real fun comes from replaying the levels multiple times, exploring different stories/character interactions, and trying to complete various challenges like the Silent Assassin and Sniper Assassin achievements for each mission - what set out as an attempt to capture the magic of Blood Money resulted in 2 games as good or better than Blood Money.

One con worth noting is the disappointment that you can't go back and play all of the past elusive target missions which dropped from time to time.

A sandbox game that has different ways of eliminating people. Expect a lot of waiting for the right moment to do certain actions without getting caught, running around to find the right items and costumes and pretty much doing mini story lines that don't add much to the game. 

If you want to complete everything on every mission, you will end up re-playing each mission 20+ times either by poisoning, drowning, shooting, pushing off ledges, or following one of the mini stories. It seems interesting at first, but gets boring/repetitive. If you don't care to do everything then you can complete the game in less than 10 hours.

I'm not mad at IOI for siding with EGS over Steam for the next game. More-so disappointed. Steam players were there first. Though I at least UNDERSTAND their mindset here, given that they're in a tricky spot as game devs. I AM mad, however, at Epic Games for taking advantage of IOI like this, and by extension, the fans. Last I heard, those guys are predatory in nature towards the fans. They may be good to devs, but public reception is THE thing that makes or breaks games, and many actual players are pissed at them for being secretly bad. It's just that no one talks about it, realizes it, or cares about it for one reason or another. As for IOI themselves, there's no way we can change their minds about the EGS port. We just want them to release the Steam port ALONGSIDE the EGS port when the latter releases. If they NEED a wait time, then I hope it's no longer than 1-2 months, 3 at the absolute most. I feel like the year-long wait time for the Steam release is the biggest problem that everyone has with this deal. And even if that problem was the only one that was eliminated, far less people would be angry at this.

TL;DR VERSION: IOI isn't really at fault here, they just got played by Epic. We're mad at Epic for this awful deal they struck, given that Steam players were there first. We won't stop IOI from doing this, but we at least want them to drop the year-long wait time b/w EGS and Steam ports.

I can no longer recommend this game to steam users as the developer decided to make the 3rd game of the series, Epic Store Exclusive. Someone might call this a review bombing, but it's not. This is very much relevant because Hitman (reboot) games are inter-connected and your progress is shared across the series. The developer said they will offer a ""seamless process"" of carryover from Steam to Epic, but after having experienced previous Epic releases that were riddled with technical issues, I will have to take that statement with a grain of salt. 

I gave them the benefit of the doubt with all these different DLC and edition non-sense. In return, IO Interactive gave a big fat middle finger by participating in the Epic's predatory practice. If Epic wants to compete with steam, they should do it fairly by offering better UI and services. They could use the money they have from Unreal Engine and Fortnite sales into improving their shitty store and launcher, but instead they take the easy route by throwing that money at the developers and f***ing over consumers. By participating in Epic's shady practice, IOI studio completely lost my trust.   

I won't be pre-ordering Epic exclusive Hitman 3. I will wait a year or 
maybe never buy their games again.

Great improvements from the Hitman 2016 with a lot more contents. 
Must buy if you liked playing the previous one. I like how the game gives you the freedom to roam around the map and do whatever you want. There are so many different options for beating the missions and challenges. There are active events like elusive targets, where you get one chance at taking down a target for a special reward. 

It does feel like you are buying the same game twice though, if you paid the full price for the Hitman 2016 then bought the Hitman 2 DLC. And your progress from the previous game does not carryover.

24,74990337,english,"The game is beautifully awesome, don't get me wrong, but a recent marketing decision from IOI has changed the entire scope of Hitman.

Hitman 3 will now be exclusive to the Epic Games Store for one year.
Keep in mind the numerous downfalls of the EGS, but consider the following as well:
Elusive Targets were only reactivated ONCE in Hitman 2. Just bought the game and wonder what ""Elusive Targets"" are? Well too bad, because you can't play them.
Keep in mind, Elusive Targets were only reactivated for Hitman 2 and not Hitman 1 (2016) so NO ONE was able to play those ET's.
Imagine, with the EGS exclusivity, everyone who plays the pre-Steam beta will have played the ET's and then what? Will IOI reactivate them for Steam ONCE and then never again? The entire community has been riding IOI's ass about that since 2016, to make ET's permanent, just keep them on a monthly cycle (likeawoman) but so far, that has been unanswered.
Also, if you're in the EU, the EGS breaks the EU's GDPR [b][i]LAW.[/i][/b] Yes, EGS BREAKS A LAW by being themselves.
For those who don't know, the EU GDPR is a data protection law, and we all know about EGS and what they do with data. I'll leave it at that.

""durr, EGS gives developers a bigger cut than Steam.""
Let's be honest EGS simps, there's a bigger market in Steam with more consumers. The amount IOI would make in one year on EGS would equate to 3 months on Steam.

I'm not saying anything about anything, but this may be an interesting time to look into ""obtaining"" Hitman 3 if you can't wait for 2022 for Steam and don't want to buy it on the EGS.
[spoiler]ban me MrFreeze2244, keep simping for IOI, you hambone, keep simping[/spoiler]

As if the numerous people who've spoken out about this EGS exclusivity weren't enough, the Steam user ""Unrest"" said it best:

[i]""Epic Games Store just announced it has secured Hitman 3 for a full one-year exclusivity. Despite enjoying Hitman 2, I cannot support this predatory business practice of PC exclusivity, nor the recent actions taken by Epic on the Apple and Google Play stores. I've seen a backlash against consumers using ""review bombing"" tactics, but what other choice do consumers have? Consumers have no real avenues to be heard in an organized and effective way, and the unfortunate reality of review bombing is that it works, even if the product in this case doesn't ""deserve"" it -- what other option is there that would be both visible and impactful?

Imagine if consoles had all of these separate stores that we see on PC, and companies competed with exclusivity not just between different consoles, but within each console ecosystem. Consoles are already closed systems, but it would practically require collusion, if not legal regulation, to accomplish, both of which are objectionable propositions. Would console gamers stand for that? It would certainly degrade the spirit of console as a platform, which is to streamline gaming accessibility.

Conversely, the spirit of PC is about choice in a more ""open"" ecosystem, so while you could argue that exclusivity deals are ""natural"" to an open market, it defeats the imperative of choice by holding products hostage. Consequently, an open market should allow consumers to push back and refuse products or practices they do not want, and thus the market should adjust. However, the avenues by which consumers can express this perspective are limited, and only further narrowing; also, not all consumers are savvy or interested enough to follow the business behind the products they may want, nor understand why certain practices may conflict with their best interests. So, we're left with somewhat of a minority of enthusiasts that do understand the repercussions, with few options to rebuff, thus the need for amplification to inform the unaware.

Exclusivity is not only anti-consumer, but anti-PC. Do not allow companies to continue to dictate your choices via brute-force business practices.""[/i]

In short, Hitman 2 is an awesome Hitman game.
But IOI's business practices are something we cannot agree with.

31,73284410,english,"This review is based off of the experiences of a person who has played every Hitman game on release- Codename 47, Silent Assassin, Contrats, Bloodmoney, Absolution, and NUHITMAN 1 and 2.

HITMAN2 is elaborate. It is well crafted. There is heart in the music, the level design, the voice acting is tolerable and the maps are sprawling. So why do I give it a negative review? 

This game feels like an achievement-unlock simulator, not an assassination simulator. In order to unlock 47's tools of the trade- various weapons and the like, you must replay missions over and over again to the developers exacting specifications. Every level has dozens of 'achievements,' and these achievements give you 'mastery points' which, upon hitting a certain 'mastery level,' unlocks a new piece of gear for you. Every mission comes with at least 2 'Story' assassination possibilities, in which you simply follow the instructions Diana Burnwood tells you and you complete your task with a perfect Silent Assassin rating. It's pathetic. I often felt like I was playing a movie, rather than playing a game. Any attempt to deviate from the developers 'story missions' is punished severely, as you will not unlock any additional gear or weaponry unless you attempt to satisfy the developers specific set-ups in each mission. In previous Hitman games, if you absconded from a level with weaponry- unique to a character or just a generic rifle from the guards- you could then bring that weapon into a previous mission or into your next mission. This was a natural, fun, exciting way to replay the Hitman games. You could return to a safehouse, see your collection of weaponry grow, and have fun AT YOUR OWN PACE. The new Hitman games, despite trying to provide the player more opportunities than ever before, actually feels more restricted than previous titles- which is insane.

The lore and story of Hitman has always been two-dimensional in many respects- Codename 47 was story heavy, HITMAN 2 was lighter on story but made you connect with a handful of characters in a seamless way. Contracts and Bloodmoney were paper-thin plots which both had incredible pay-offs at the end. The new HITMAN 'plot' retroactively ruins the character of 47, turning him into a moral and ethical individual bound up in some sort of 'code' with a mysterious past which he must fulfill with the help of fake-Sean Bean, a character no one knows or cares about but was thrust into the world of Hitman in order to make this new 'plot' function. Essentially, everyone you are sent to assassinate is the absolute worst scum of the earth and they are all intimately connected to some sort of global conspiracy. Do you, a contract-assassin for the ICA, receive any money for these tasks? No, your only reward is 'Mastery Points' and several more minutes of awful, genre-breaking plot.

Furthermore, when the game ends, they want you to buy additional levels to 'get the full story.' I will ALWAYS negatively vote a game which forces you to purchase additional content to comprehend the plot of the main game. Furthermore, the entire idea of selling levels as individual products is what forced IO Interactive into making each level an on-rails movie-like experience- by trying to pack SO MUCH into so few levels, as large as they are in size, one can't help but feel like this is 'busy work' to extend the life of this game.

The removal of signature weapons from previous Hitman titles also did not sit well with me. Where is the WA2000? Where is the Kazo? Where are my two Silver Ballers? Instead, they are remodeled, renamed, and shoved behind a high-level 'mastery point' which would require hours and hours of busy-work grinding to unlock. By the time you get the Tools Of The Trade, your full arsenal, you cannot be arsed to play these levels again anyways. 

I understand a younger, new generation is obsessed with achievement unlocks and the vast majority of players of NUHITMAN 1 and 2 have likely never even played the previous games or heard about the franchise until Square-Enix's PR campaign. There is so much effort, love, and care put into this game by IO, but the actual spirit/essence/what makes Hitman games a Hitman game, is ultimately lost in their desire to bedazzle you with next-generation graphics. I cannot recommend this game to anyone seeking an authentic Hitman experience- this is very much the Hollywood spectacle, Miller-Lite draft version of Hitman. Incredible that a 14 year old game with janky coding (Blood Money) has, to me, far more replay value than this modern release, which I believe I will not likely replay again.

Edit: In lieu of IO Interactive selling out to Epic-Games exclusivity, I also wanted to take the time to mention a massive contributing factor to my negative review. Always online. This is a single-player game with very light tacked-on multiplayer elements which aren't truly multiplayer to begin with. Frankly, you need to ask yourself why you should support a company that takes all of your progress and stores it exclusively on their own internal server. They can eliminate all your progress intentionally or simply by shutting off their server. Essentially, much like Steam, you are buying a license to merely 'borrow' the game- but unlike steam, where if I am offline/have no internet access, so long as I was logged into my account I can enjoy my games. IO interactive only wants you to play the game if you A) Are constantly online B) Don't mind a corporation taking all your save data and refusing to let you store it locally, and C) Uses your connection to their server to gather private information about you to sell to third party advertisers. 

Frankly, these practices are the very essence of anti-consumerism. I thought they were forced on IO by Square Enix with NU-HITMAN 1, and was looking forward to them removing the always-online with their next games. Instead, it appears IO Interactive is doubling down on this. There is ZERO. BENEFIT. WHATSOEVER, in allowing a corporation to do this to you, the consumer. Think about it logically, without appealing to the concept of corporate-brand-loyalty: How does this set up benefit you, the paying customer? The answer: It simply does not. It's a middle finger in your face, and worse, they rub that finger all over you while their other hand slips into your pocket for additional cash. Even understanding that the world is rapidly moving to always being connected to the internet, there is no excuse to take YOUR save files and hold them proverbially hostage on some server in Denmark somewhere. If IO Interactive shuttered its doors tomorrow in bankruptcy, you will never be able to replay this game nor save your progress- essentially wasting the money you spent.

42,75023996,english,"HITMAN 2 is the second game in the World of Assassination trilogy that continues the story of 2016's Hitman game. As of writing this review, I have sunk in 258 hours into the game, which is definitely a large amount. I've unlocked a large arsenal of weapons, items, throwables, and fish. I had never played the 2016 game before this one, so I bought the GOTY Legacy pack to experience the levels from Hitman 2016 as well. So, with all of that out of the way, did I enjoy Hitman 2? 

Hell.
Fucking.
Yes.

Hitman 2 is a murdery sandbox simulator that allows for out-of-the-box thinking and sheer creativity to complete a large array of missions that are related to murdering people in some way. You play as the bald, tux-wearing Agent 47 as he travels the world to hunt down and assassinate targets. Each target that he assassinates gets him closer to figuring out his true identity. The story sounds pretty good (if not a little cliche), but Hitman is know for it's stealth gameplay. 

In Hitman 2, the gameplay is miraculous. The controls are superbly tight and responsive, sneaking around and peering around corners feels divine, the gameplay loop of overhearing conversations and or disguising yourself as a high elite guard to sneakily assassinate your target is extremely satisfying, and the game allows for multiple ways to take down targets. The only problem that I have with Hitman 2 is that going for 100% is a nightmare.

It's a strange thing to fault a game for; ""having too much content"". However, Hitman 2 has a ton of minute challenges that you can complete by exploring the world. However, there are so many of them that I have never even seen yet. And mind you; I HAVE 258 HOURS ON THE GAME. I would be complaining way more about this, however, if the challenges were only able to be counted as completed if you finish a level, but they go away as soon as you do them-even if you die 6 seconds after completing one.

Overall, Hitman 2 (and 2016, for that matter) are colossal games with 2 starting locations for Hitman 1, 6 regular locations from Hitman 1, 6 locations from Hitman 2, 2 extra locations from Hitman 2, 6 Hitman 3 missions (should be coming soon), and the other non-story missions that are also in each locations (as well as the escalations, elusive targets, contracts, and 3 sniper assassin maps). That's a lot, but you can only get them by buying Hitman 2 Gold edition and the GOTY legacy pack. These 2 things will get you everything you need for this behemoth of a game.

Frankly I just don't want to embarass myself by exposing such madness to the world. However, in this case I have to make an exception in order to counter, at least by 1, the review bombing that is starting to occur.

There is a rise in anger by some folks that I am having a hard time understanding. The Epic Games Store has recently announced that it has secured Hitman 3 exclusively for a time, and this has thrown some people into a hissy fit of epic proportions (see what I did there?). What does it really matter which market you buy the game from? The cost to you is exactly the same on release, so that can't be why you hate the idea. Is it because you don't want another program running on your machine? It's a very small program that can be closed when you're not using it. Is it because you have all your games on Steam and don't want to risk spreading your collection around? OK, that one is a bit harder to argue, but still not exactly an issue. Use the GOG Galaxy launcher and link them all into one launcher. Problem solved.

Honestly, everyone should be thanking Epic for kicking Steam. Steam has been such a powerhouse for so long that it is great that someone is finally starting to rock their boat. Admittedly, Steam deserves massive recognition for what they accomplished by providing this platform, but then they stagnated and enjoyed their power. Developers had to pay Steam prices or lose a lot of exposure. Consumers couldn't shop around for different sales in an effort to save a little here or there. It was Steam or, what, GameStop? 

How does a market exclusive inside a PC harm any consumer? I can still get the game I want for the price I am willing to pay on the hardware that I own. It's still playing on my PC. As opposed to console exclusivity which can only be played on that console and nowhere else. Want Last of Us 2? Gotta go buy a Playstation 4! Don't have one? No joy for you then. Want Hitman 3? Gotta go buy a PC then! Oh wait, I already own one of those, I just have to open this tiny program instead of that tiny program in order to buy it.

Marketplace exclusivity inside a PC isn't anti-consumer or anti-PC. If anything it's a better example of the PC mindset. Give me what I want, when i want it, and as cheap as I can get it. To be upset about that would be like getting mad at a brick-n-mortar store for having an exclusive so you have to drive to their store to buy a thing instead of another store. P.S. Walmart has exclusives.

If you're looking at buying Hitman 2 in August 2020 and forward, cooperative play servers are shutting down this month. No coop sniper mode or competitive ghost mode. 

The stability issues are disappointing. Freezing at the conclusion of missions, or rather, not loading the next screen since the .exe itself doesn't actually lock up. Random crash to desktop during gameplay happens a couple of times a day. Sometimes it's a corrupt save file where the game crashes at nearly the same spot every time, but mostly it's random. Upgraded drivers, deleted game folders and verified files. Tried running with/without Big Picture mode. Disabled Radeon overlay. Nothing makes a difference. The game runs smooth as butter (better than Hitman 2016) and then it crashes. Your mileage may vary, which is why overall I still recommend this title.

60,74908017,english,"Maybe one of the best games ever made?

I imagine many of the recent negative reviews are based on IO Interactive's decision to launch HITMAN 3 as a timed exclusive. I'm not sure why people have such a hatred for Epic. Is it just because of the fragmentation, even if it takes a combined 2 seconds to open a different thing? Or you just click on the shortcut to the game like you always do? Is it just because they make Fortnite and people have a hatred for that too? I'm not sure. But they have said your progress on H2 will be transferable to H3 even if it's on Epic and not Steam. Besides that, considering Hitman has always been a niche series and they're publishing and developing this one purely independently, I'm fine with them getting all the help they need. 

Now, for the game itself. 

HITMAN 2 is a followup of the 2016 HITMAN reboot/prequel. Much like the previous Hitman games, you are Agent 47, continuing to work for the ICA as a paid assassin to go and kill people. As it tends to happen, secret societies containing the most elite of the elite end up being the targets, and you must use whatever tools you have possible to stop them. Be it disguising as others to get past their security, sneaking around a back way, running and gunning (I wouldn't recommend this one because of the AI ""improvements""), or so on. Despite that little comment, the game is remarkably open ended about how you handle things.

The game looks beautiful, the new maps are nearly perfect and each give off a wildly different tone and setting. They are designed like lovely puzzles or tricky climbs, and each with AI that have different patterns. Learning how the pieces move is incredibly satisfying, and I have nearly no issues besides the ""Always Online"" requirement.

Despite this I have to major gripes with this game.
The first is that you constantly need to be connected to properly play this game, there have been multiple times when I was in the middle of a mission and I would get disconnected and have to wait while the game tried to reconnect me. So if you get this game make sure you have decent WiFi.
The second is the elusive targets. To give you some background elusive targets are missions where you only have one shot to kill the target, you can't save at all and if you die you can never replay that mission ever again, this is an awesome concept and I probably would've loved to play them. But that's the problem, the elusive targets would only be available for a period of time, and once they went away you could never play them again. This is frustrating because I never got to play these missions and if you but this game now you won't be able to either (unless Io reactivates them which might happen but it would take a while). It sucks because you pay money for a game but you miss out on content because you didn't own it at the right time, and you also miss out on exclusive items that you can only get if you complete the elusive targets.

it's a great game. compared to 2016 it's more of the same, but you get a few tweaks like the briefcase and hiding in crowds/foliage which is cool. miami and new york are some of the best maps in the rebooted trilogy so far

cons:

lots of frustrating decisions regarding this game series and the game itself.

-bugs and technical issues not getting fixed in hitman 2

-some items in this game are extremely overpowered and unbalanced

-they abandoned ghost mode in the middle of the game's lifecycle when it had so much potential

-they are shutting down ghost mode servers altogether and only giving us a few weeks heads up without even giving players the tools they need to set up their own servers.

-in-game progression being online-only. this was a problem since hitman 2016 and to this day they still haven't addressed the issue.

-hitman 3's VR will be exclusive to the playstation, and it won't even use motion controls! only a bloody dualshock controller 😂 wtf IOI.

-and now the epic exclusivity deal.

-also since hitman 3 won't be on steam for a while, linux players won't be able to use proton and play the game on their systems. they're getting screwed too

it's too bad really. i used to be a diehard hitman fan who would have purchased their most expensive special edition of hitman 3 along with whatever DLC was going to be released after the game came out. now i barely even have the excitement to get it with a huge discount on steam a couple years later.

Going to buy the third installment after a few years for a ""bargain bin"" price, either that or I'll be on the lookout for the ""FitGirl"" version instead. F**k Epig! F**k IOI!

-----Paragraphs below would show my enthusiasm for this franchise. It's a clear receipt of how happy I was to have played this game. Now, it all went to shite because of this ""exclusivity deal"" done for the third and final game.----------------------

One of the best games I've ever played! Here's the thing, if you love stealth games with a captivating story, this one's definitely for you. When I say captivating story, I'm not saying it's in par with the likes of the Witcher 3 or Yakuza 0, but it's more about the mysterious world of espionage and assassination that makes you want to come back for more. Of course, it's not a perfect game, as there are some glitches here and there, but these can actually be ignored, due to the fact that they aren't Fallout 76 levels of game-breaking bugs.

I don't think many people realize this, but Hitman 2 is actually a puzzle game. Most of the time, you'd have to explore the map, observe the target's routes, and formulate a plan from there, on how to take them out. Hitman 2 does this magnificently, with ""Story Missions"" and various opportunities around the map. Heck, it even deserves to be called a sandbox game, due to the fact that these Mission Stories do not even need to be followed to assassinate the targets. Many of the game's challenges would motivate you to think outside the box in carrying out your executions.

The replayability is also commendable, as the developers are constantly working on road maps which adds content to the game each month. The escalations and contracts are at the core of the game's replayability, including the challenges and unlockable contents.

Overall, this is a must-have on your library. I bought the Gold edition and the Legacy Gold edition on two separate occasions, when both were on sale.

50,74623483,english,"Epic Games Store just announced it has secured Hitman 3 for a full one-year exclusivity.  Despite enjoying Hitman 2, I cannot support this predatory business practice of PC exclusivity, nor the recent actions taken by Epic on the Apple and Google Play stores.  I've seen a backlash against consumers using ""review bombing"" tactics, but what other choice do consumers have?  Consumers have no real avenues to be heard in an organized and effective way, and the unfortunate reality of review bombing is that it works, even if the product in this case doesn't ""deserve"" it -- what other option is there that would be both visible and impactful?  

Imagine if consoles had all of these separate stores that we see on PC, and companies competed with exclusivity not just between different consoles, but within each console ecosystem.  Consoles are already closed systems, but it would practically require collusion, if not legal regulation, to accomplish, both of which are objectionable propositions.  Would console gamers stand for that?  It would certainly degrade the spirit of console as a platform, which is to streamline gaming accessibility.

Conversely, the spirit of PC is about choice in a more ""open"" ecosystem, so while you could argue that exclusivity deals are ""natural"" to an open market, it defeats the imperative of choice by holding products hostage.  Consequently, an open market should allow consumers to push back and refuse products or practices they do not want, and thus the market should adjust.  However, the avenues by which consumers can express this perspective are limited, and only further narrowing; also, not all consumers are savvy or interested enough to follow the business behind the products they may want, nor understand why certain practices may conflict with their best interests.  So, we're left with somewhat of a minority of enthusiasts that do understand the repercussions, with few options to rebuff, thus the need for amplification to inform the unaware.

Exclusivity is not only anti-consumer, but anti-PC.  Do not allow companies to continue to dictate your choices via brute-force business practices.",1597942516,1597942516,False,406,24,0.618545651435852051,0,True,False,False,76561197963942135,1742,65,1307,0,1307,1564752447

I've been a fan since 2004. By looking at my username, you can already see how much of a fan I am. Until today.
I've bought every single installment of this franchise on as many platforms as I could.
I started my whole musical career and currently sing in a Philharmonic Choir. I play the electric guitar because what Jesper Kyd has inspired me to play.
I study software engineering because I dreamt of being an AI director in a game company and Epic Games Exclusivity is what I get. 
IO Interactive has become the next Electronic Arts. Not only did you guys not listen to us about how this game's constant connection to the internet and your privacy terms bothered us, but also did exactly what we hated: EGS exclusive for a year,
Yeah. I'm not gonna spend $100 on Epic Games. I probably won't even buy this game in 2022. I'll be too old to play the game by then. 
The buyer of this game should know that the story concludes in HITMAN 3 and it's not gonna be an explosive one. It's just another cliche horsecrap story. You always hunt for items that the developers want you to hunt by replaying the maps over and over again. If you wanna play it for free, hit me up. I'll send you a bunch of stuff.



Original review:
Okay I'm gonna play this game for a long time - considering NONE of my progress from the 1st season was transferred, and I have to say something first.
CUTSCENES!!?
What is it? A moving comic book?? 
I just don't understand the reason behind such thing.
The gameplay is not the same since they've made some nice improvements but it's not that ""breathtaking"".
It's just HITMAN 1.5
Other than that, it is a great game when it's fully and completely released with the rest of its expansions.

Update as of 13 November:
See, the devs were probably short-handed for the actors. So it's okay.
I've just completed Mumbai and I must say, the game is ""breathtaking"". My bad IO Interactive.
With the legacy pack and the sniper assassin and the rest of the expansions all under the same roof, it's truly a dream come true for someone who's been playing the game for 16 years. 
This is just amazing.

Update as of 15 November:
Just finished the game.
You can expect a lot of replayability and +300 hours of gameplay.
We can all understand the reasons behind the cutscenes being this way. I'd be happy to
help the studio shape the game the way they want it more than it already is anytime.
Thank you IO Interactive.

40,73989697,english,"Make no mistake, this game involves killing. 
It involves sneaking.
It involves disguises and social engineering.
But at its very roots, it's a puzzle game.

Hitman 2 is a continuation of IO Interactive's new take on the Hitman series and boy is it awesome! Gone are the linear levels that plagued Hitman: Absolution. This game is as sandbox as a game can get. There are thousands of lines of dialogue and many different situations that you can get yourself in.

I remember shooting a maid inside of a mansion and skulking about for 20 minutes. I came back to find guards hauling the dead body inside of a body bag. Nobody knew it was me, so the most I got was the guards saying ""excuse me, sir, please move out of the way."" It's little interactions/details with the game world that really make it feel alive. In fact, the game world IS alive. Every non-player character has their own lives inside the world and they go through their own 'loops' so to speak. 

Let's say a chef works at a kitchen, that chef will do everything you would expect (including the chef going to the back room to get more ingredients for a dish they're preparing). Let's say you poison those ingredients; now the chef will add that ingredient to a random person's meal. While that random person is grasping at their throat while poisoned, they distract the guards who leave their post which would allow you to slip by unnoticed. It's little interactions like these that make the game a lot more cranial than the standard assassination game (I'm looking at you, Assassin's Creed). 

You can really plan your attacks and be as stealthy or as open as you like.

With regards to being 'open', the combat is VERY challenging if you do end up in a firefight. A couple bullets and you're dead. The AI have good aim so they may miss a shot but they're likely to hit you a couple seconds after they declare you hostile. However, the combat is not impossible. If you clear a room, the guards who come in and see all the dead bodies would be confused as to where in the room you are. This will allow you to slip by and go back into stealth or kill all of them while they're disoriented. If you do slip by and go back into hiding, the state of the game will change. Your targets will become anxious and try to leave the area. Some may lock themselves in rooms surrounded by armed guards. Some may pick up a gun themselves and be on high alert. You need to be adaptable to be a proper assassin.

Have I experienced any bugs? Surprisingly? No. With the technical marvel that this game is with game AI and the open-ended nature, I was very surprised that the AI never got confused and could change their behaviours according to the situation.

The game gets a 10/10 from me. There is NOTHING out there like it in the market. The appeal of planning and executing assassination contracts is bar none compared to other games in the genre. If you do not own this game in your Steam library, or if you haven't even tried this new iteration of the Hitman series, what are you doing with yourself? Give it a try! You'll love it, trust me!",1596913541,1596913541,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198010371788,540,148,1699,0,1699,1596912663

The over arching story isn't very strong, but its not weak either. Just tight enough to hold things together. Each mission however holds a nice little narrative for each target, much to the same standard as Hitman 1.

The game-play hasn't changed much, as this entry is more of an add on to a larger game than its own individual entry. With that in mind, if you have the right DLCs/Pack, you're treated to all the maps and missions from Hitman 1, (the season passes and DLC packs descriptions are a bit confusing in regard to their content). Also, just like it's predecessor, this entry has a ridiculous attention to detail in game-play and environment. Absolutely stunning game.

80,73673132,english,"WARNING: Still no field of view slider!
If you are prone to motion sickness, this game will wreck your evening completely!

Other than that, probably the best game in the series so far! The maps are larger than ever, the missions are more replayable than ever, the crowds are still impressively large and the AI seems to be less dumb than before. Anyone remember the mardi gras level from blood money where the guards would start firing into the massive crowd of people (killing hundreds) just to shoot you if you accidentally did a minor crime? Or how the entire map magically learns who you are and where to find you in an instant? Haven't seen that in this game (yet..?).

Their model of paying for each map as a DLC seems good. It seems to me that they put a TON of work into each map and each map is HUGE with loads of challenges, hidden items, silly/interesting NPC interactions and various ways to end your victims (and whoever gets in your way, if you so choose). I can see myself playing a random map in a random way to land another challenge every now and then.

Of course there are some cheesy moments, like that guy lighting a sigarette next to an oxygen container that somehow blows up. That's not how oxygen works (maybe if it was acetylen or hydrogen?)... Or disguising yourself as someones earlier lover and they somehow don't realise you're not their previous lover after talking to you face-to-face... but oh well.
Some of those moments are cheesy in a good way, where you would disguise yourself as some person in the middle of the spotlight and perform the kill in front of a crowd and get away with it (anyone remember the opera mission in blood money? There's now more like that). You may of course just go full hitman style stealthy (or loud..) and just pop'em in the head with a silenced weapon (or unsilenced..). I love how this game doesn't try to stop you from playing the way you want. (Note: You do get a quite noticeable point penalty for ending non-targets, leading to a lousy mission score)

Their slogan is ""Make the world your weapon"" and they mention during the tutorial that ""you are the most dangerous person in the room"". This seems to hold true, as you can end someones life with the help of anything from a car battery to an apple. Some say that 47 once killed 5 guards with nothing but an apricot (I say that, since I actually did that once).

You can still play the game somewhat seriously and have fun, but there is nothing stopping you from causing a few hundred accidents in a single playthrough. So many accidents... Be careful where you toss your (still lit) sigarette, you never know when there's a (not) naturally occuring oil spill beneath you. Never walk through a puddle of water, it may be (not) accidentally electrified. There has also been a massive increase in wrench-to-head related accidents since I started playing. Doctors are reporting a huge increase in food poisoning and coroners are getting tired of reporting the same ""death from impact after accidentally falling from a high place"".

85,73642276,english,"Hitman 2 (what was originally going to be a simple addition or expansion to Hitman 2016) is a social stealth action game with some puzzle elements. In any given mission, you're dropped into a defined location such as a suburban neighborhood (where a secret private security outfit guards your target). And It's up to you to find a way to kill your target with numerous tools and methods to do it.

Much like Hitman 2016, the entire game can be completed in just a few hours, especially if you have prior experience with the games. But the enjoyment comes from the myriad of ways in which one can take out the target. If you took out your target while they were in the middle of their formula one race last time, you'll have to figure out how to get them to drink poisoned milk in the lounge kitchen next time. This is all incentivized by the returning mastery system, which is what gets you new items, gadgets, and weapons as you progress through these challenges.

Hitman 2 has tons of challenges in each level. And these aren’t just like “get 15 kills.” No, they are more like, “kill a man with a stuffed shark” or “poison that guy’s eye drops.” This should give you plenty of reasons to keep coming back to each stage even after you’ve seen the multiple story missions.

The biggest thing that IO Interactive couldn’t screw up with Hitman 2 is its maps. Each time you start a new stage, you want an interesting locale with a ton of variety. This game nails that. In the first stage, you learn some basics by breaking into a fortified beach home that looks deserted. IO follows that up with a bombastic motorsport event at a raceway in November. And then you hit incredible locations like Mumbai and a Vermont suburb.
Each of these levels stand out from one another, but that’s not just because the art and music are different. All of these levels have tons of characters with a huge number of potential routes for you to take out your targets.

[*] Does Hitman 2 improve upon its predecessor in a meaningful way?

It depends on what you mean by ""improve"". It certainly feels like Season two at times or an expansion rather than a direct sequel. The biggest issue with Hitman 2 is that it’s just not very fresh. It’s the same engine with only some minor improvements. However, there certainly have been improvements along the way, things like ""blending into a crowd"" and cameras being more than ""Oh you were seen, now go get the evidence"" taxes. The ""using a briefcase to hide a sniper"" from Blood Money is back (except now you can hide anything in it, pistols, shotguns, even just a syringe if needed). In my opinion, the most interesting and meaningful part of Hitman 2 is the level design. So yeah, six new levels are a huge improvement. There are some new mechanics like blending in crowds, mirrors working for NPCs, the briefcase etc., but the levels are what matters. The game also looks absolutely stunning at times for what it is (levels contain thousands of interactable NPCs). Six new playgrounds are definitely worth it. Sadly, the cutscenes were downgraded, you no longer have your typical CGI cutscene, but rather a static cutscene with only voices talking to each other.

[*] What is needed to make Hitman 2 a more compelling package?

I feel they should have added some elements from Hitman: Blood Money. Such as having your own secret base and being able to customize your loadout in your base and seeing all your equipment all lined up on the wall. It would have created another layer to the game rather than having to interact with a menu before a mission to equip your loadout. It would have made that process more immersive and engaging. They should have also added the ability to use the money you get from completing missions to purchase guns, equipment, etc. Instead of having to unlock them via playing. I mean, what's the point of being a Hitman if you can't use the money you're getting by offing targets. This feature worked well in Blood Money, but sadly they have yet to add it to the new Hitman games.

Lastly, I feel the story requires some improvement as It's not that good. It's not like the Hitman games had amazing stories, but at least the older games had more charm when it came to its storytelling, and I feel that is kind of missing in the new Hitman.


[*] For the next Hitman game, should the franchise continue in this vein, return to the style of the older games, or try something entirely new?

Well they need to conclude the ""trilogy"" story in Hitman 3, so I'd expect the same from the next game. New, maybe more intricate and interesting levels (new locales, possibly more levels (plus two or three). Some new mechanics like dual-wielding and maybe human shields. Just don't break what works. The disguise system is pretty much perfect. The opportunity/mission stories system is an excellent way for novices to experience levels. The controls and physics are pretty tight. This is basically Blood Money, but much bigger, keep it that way. But they should still include the things I mentioned above, like having your own armory/base and being able to use your own money to purchase items and weapons. As well as giving us CGI cutscenes instead of the static ones that are much less engaging in Hitman 2.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Overall, if you liked the previous Hitman game, its more of the same with some improvements. The locations are the star of the show, and while there could be some cleaning up in the UI and unlocks department, the game is still worth it if you're a fan of the Hitman games or the genre itself.

My rating for this game is a solid 8/10.",1596351266,1596351712,True,11,1,0.624529838562011719,0,True,False,False,76561198001997599,380,14,1151,0,1151,1571824669

This is a pretty ridiculous bug for a game to have and the developers have yet to fix this.

There is a ""Chroma"" option in the options to supposedly fix this, but the options are unaccessable without uninstalling Chroma SDK. However once you have uninstalled the Chroma SDK, you cannot enable this function since the software is uninstalled. This is such an annoying and ultimately meaningless issue for any Razer user (and considering how common Razer's products are among PC gamers it's even worse) and the developers really should just fix this already.

So do you like sneaking into places you aren't supposed to go, listening in on people, doing a bunch of naughty things, and then getting out without anyone noticing? Well If you love stealth, adventure, and intrigue, then this is the game for you.

HITMAN 2 is more a continuation of the rebooted HITMAN game. 
(It probably would have been DLC if the publishers hadn't mucked IO Interactive around)
In fact you may never need to purchase the previous HITMAN because all it's levels and story are included here as DLC.

In each scene, your hitman must eliminate his targets - but just getting access to his targets is part of the puzzle and the adventure. The next bit will be all in the execution. You have a number of ways to murder your targets but each one carries with it a certain amount of risk. Sure, going in guns blazing is also a strategy but you are often outgunned and are unlikely to survive a shootout. It's not very professional. No, your hitman must achieve ""Silent Assassin"" mastery. Slipping into a scene unnoticed, unrecorded by video cameras, silently and cleanly killing your target (think piano wire, poison, or plausibly deniable accidents), hiding the body so that nobody finds it, and then leaving the scene almost as if nobody saw you there at all. Executing the perfect hit is going to be a lot of fun, trial, and error. You can approach the task seriously or you can toy around with the game and really create a scene of the most ridiculous hilarity. Of course, the moment your perfect plan comes unstuck, I can guarantee it will all go to hell in a shootout, complete with a hail of bullets and screaming civilians. You'll get used to that one a lot.

In short, Hitman is an easy to get into stealth action game, point and click adventure, and one that rewards the patient and well prepared player. In fact it's probably the best game of this genre ever. There are so many options and possibilities - they almost seem endless. To make it even more challenging the game can mix thing up for you and give you random people to take out - increasing replayability a thousand times over.

With the addition of the multiplayer ""ghost mode"" and the inclusion of the sniper challenges, this is really a bumper package.

In short, this is the quintessential stealth action game.",1562504347,1595826747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198033719770,246,102,1388,0,130,1599519201

I would say this game will make you a great hitman. who would have thought you would kill your target in many and varied ways.

hitman 2 well continuation of hitman 1. argghhh I have to say this game is very expensive and inappropriate if given at a price of that size. because this game is exactly the same as the previous version of hitman 1. the difference is very little, maybe I can say like better lighting reflections, more varied items and graphics upgrades that don't change much. hitaman series 2 is a continuation of the story of hitman 1 and well it didn't become dlc or season 2. therefore the high price is not worth this game. wait, why did I buy this game? forget it.

map options displayed are also the same as hitman 1. I will not curse hitman 2 because this game still presents good gameplay even though it is the same as the previous version.

side missions like ghost kill and sniper fill this game so that they don't get bored playing the main game. I like this part.

Hitman 2 at first glance is indeed just an expansion compared to the sequel. However, the small changes that IO Interactive gave in the game were like reflections of glass, to hide behind the crowd to make the game more perfect. The lack of cutscene was quite disappointing, lucky, they were able to convey it quite well although not better than the first series. Answering most of your questions about the emotionless bald man who is the main character of the game.

I really recommend you to play the game. Because DLC Legacy Pack can be a complement for those of you who are curious about the previous story. The free Legacy Pack bonus for you who already have the first series is one of the best bonuses given by IO Interactive. Because, it is possible for you to play all levels of the first Hitman with many new changes that have been implemented in the second series.",1595475103,1595475142,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198999379781,15,7,2820,348,1681,1601709911

We take off where we left in season 1( that's what they are called if I'm not wrong). We see Providence is under attack( its a secret org.) They control almost everything and have power beyond imagination. We try to dig out who the shadow client is and in process this game ventures into 47s past as well as Miss Diana's past(our handler). Without revealing much I can say this game has pretty similar mechanics of Season 1 and let me be honest being a long time fan of the Hitman, even though they have tried to change up quite a lot of the origin stories and everything around it, I still really liked this game. Please try not to play this with the old story in mind but take it as a new one ( after all that's what a reboot is for xD). Anyway give this game a go and you will not be disappointed. Although there are a few things that bothered me, for one the cut scenes are not pictures with voice overs rather than what we had in the first part.

 Hitman at it's best. Apart from soundtrack. although, The music isn't bad at all.  its good but its not as good as hitman blood money's score.  It has more of a spy feel than previous titles but i can see why this choice was made.  Cut scenes are very basic in hitman 2 they play like screenshots that move arond a bit. my guess for this would be budget or time. its not by any means a deal breaker. its story is still interesting for any fans of hitman. especially what it suggests at the end. In the dlc which came later they simply use normal gameplay graphics for cut scenes and it works way better so they probably were always aware that people didn't like the downgraded cut scenes. It really is an excellent Hitman game. You can unlock all maps from HITMAN in HITMAN 2 engine as the legacy dlc which is very nice. Plenty of levels packed with things to do and see. patient Gamers will love this. Graphics are fantastic and not as demanding as i expected. runs great on a gtx1060 I7 all maxed out if you lock it down to 60fps otherwise you may see stutter in busy areas. it was very easy to eliminate stutter in this game. its well optimised in 2020. roll on HITMAN 3.

- Update/Reinstall your graphics and audio Drivers
- Switch to Dx12 mode (if you weren't already using it)
- Hard cap your framerate to one where your gpu isn't on max load (30,60,etc.) - THIS FIXED IT FOR ME
- Use debug mode in NVIDIA control panel to use the gpu's reference clocks
- Disable RAM profiles in your BIOS

Hitman 2 has such satisfying, but meaningless rewards. My favorite times in Hitman are always messing with the ai, because part of what is so great about this game is that it is nothing like real life. Most of the logic of the game makes sense, but the video game logic can only be so good. This is not a complaint, I just like being so much more powerful than everybody else in the game. One thing that doesn't really matter but still is annoying is the voice acting. It is okay, but it is really easy to tell that there wasn't many people voicing random people irrelevant to the story or assassinations.

The sound levels are all over the place. I can't hear dialogue even if boosted, but gunshots and explosions are crazy loud. I hope IO fixes the mix and puts in audio options like dynamic range (and/or maybe a slider for the loudest sound effects) in Hitman 3.

+ emerging gameplay
+ dark humour
+ open massive levels
+ replayability

Cons
- story is thin
- in order to master/silent assassin a level you will reload A LOT. Like, A LOT. It breaks the immersion
- too many guiding/handholding elements (Yes, I know you can disable them, but the game was designed with these in mind, so playing without them makes the reloading even more tedious)

***THE HITMAN 1 GAME IS IN HITMAN 2***

Great Game! 

What you need to do is get the GOLD EDITION for HITMAN 2, then buy the GOTY legacy pack, and then the GOTY legacy pack upgrade. What this does, is it adds the entire HITMAN 1 game into HITMAN 2, with all the DLC from HITMAN 1 included. I only recommend you do this when its on sale, like the steam summer sale or any other sale that gives a significant discount. If you don't want to do this, then its up to you.

After the ""absolution"" of his sins 47 is back to his prime form ! Looks amazing, Runs flawlessly and there's loads of content. For 40$ you can get all of hitman 2016 & hitman 2 's content, let me tell you, that's a steal. Especially if, like me, you skipped hitman 2016.

[h1][b][u]GAMEPLAY:[/u] 8/10[/b][/h1]

It's basic and quite rigid be warned, but it's perfect like that. It suits the original Hitman feel we ""all"" wanted back after absolution. Works well.

[h1][b][u]LEVEL DESIGN:[/u] 9/10[/b][/h1]

The maps are absolutely insane, many approaches and opportunities. Unbelievable amounts of secrets and easter eggs. Mastercrafted

[h1][b][u]VISUAL & ART:[/u] 9/10[/b][/h1]

Great overall look, great art direction. So many atmosphere and different vibes through out all of the levels, all quite well depicted. Mumbai, isle of sgail, sapienza, Miami etc... Man that's good work !

[h1][b][u]SOUND & MUSIC:[/u] 7/10[/b][/h1]

Everything is pretty unnoticeable. No major bug or flaws, no unforgettable soundtrack. Just decent.

It is an AWESOME game. Loved every minute of it.

I liked Hitman better than Hitman 2.
In Hitman, he looked tough and menacing.
In Hitman 2, he looks more like a whiny baby than a menacing assassin.
His body looked better in Hitman, and they made his face look less manly in Hitman 2.

What hated most about Hitman 2 is the microscopic text throughout the game.
Every time you pick something up, a little label pops up informing you what it is.
The problem is, it too small to read--and there is no way to adjust it.

My vision is perfect and my monitor is large.
I've never encountered text this small in any game.
It is literally unreadable unless you're a few inches from the screen.

You can adjust the subtitles, but not the in-game text.
There are entire threads regarding this complaint.

     This game would be perfect--and I mean PERFECT:

- If the in-game text were readable or adjustable (the labels for items... and the melee battle text is also small and dances around the screen... I never won one melee fight, despite being the world's best assassin).

26,71935798,english,"TLDR of everything after this: This is an excellent game that you can get your money's worth out of. While expensive not on sale, it's worth every dime, but on sale, every penny is robbery for how good it is and how much time can be invested. Definitely at least give it a shot, as there's nothing like pulling off a perfectly executed plan.



Hitman 2 is an excellent game, and one you can easily get your money's worth out of. There is hundreds of hours of content in this game, if you squeeze every ounce of content out of it, which is very hard to do. The game has many missions with its base game, with seemingly endless variations to go about your objectives. I have not completed more than just the prologue and Miami missions of Hitman 2, but it appears there is a good amount of variation to it. 

However, with DLC content, you get access to ALL of Hitman 1 (2016) with new and improved systems from Hitman 2. The Briefcase is a very small addition to those maps, but make a sniper assassin, like myself, very happy, and can make other playstyles now really accessible and functional (looking at you, SMGs, Rifles, Etc...) They also added being able to blend into crowds and be concealed in bushes, which is a very nice feature. Is this enough to warrant buying Hitman 1 content all over again if you already had 2016? You be the judge, but I find having the content in Hitman 2 very nice to have going into these new levels, and I enjoyed the revisit. If you're new to Hitman, Hitman 1's content is perfect to get you into the levels before Hitman 2. It has a far superior tutorial, and the first real mission is far better for a newcomer.

I've played Hitman 2 and Hitman 2016 extensively on PS4.  It's probably my favorite game franchise.  I purchased the Hitman 2 gold edition and H2016 legacy map pack during the summer sale.  30 bucks for two full games worth of content that I already knew I loved.  I decided to buy for pc so that when Hitman 3 comes out, all my progression and unlocks will transfer seamlessly.  However, after 3 hours on my steam counter, I'm finding a few issues that make this experience really frustrating and poor for me.  The game crashes ALL THE TIME.  It's a known issue with certain GPUs.  I applied every fix out there but it just keeps happening.   Also, this game requires a constant online connection to play, which is beyond me.  However, for some reason, I keep getting disconnected from the server multiple times per play session.  I use powerline networking for my PC, and don't have issues with any other games.  It could be a hardware thing but seeing as how I can play Rocket League (a game where any connection discrepancy ruins the game) or any other game in my library for hours at a time with no connection issues, I'm inclined to believe it's something either with this game, or IO servers.

My first main attraction was because of its [b]colour scheme[/b] used, especially on that significant red, black and white colour.
Great psychology association with Hitman movies. Am a fan of the movies.

[b]Graphics[/b] are modern and sharp.
Not much of 3D aspects in the main screen or pages, but gameplay 3D is almost realistic.
Extend up to a 4K resolution, laid back on my couch to play the game.

[b]Texts[/b] are readable, no stress.

Elements used in [b]images[/b] are definite attraction for eyes.
It created a curiousity feeling to explore within its descriptions.
Surprisingly and awe for me, as Digital Medias is my specialization.

[b]Options[/b] are straightforward navigation.
[i][u]Tip[/u][/i]: Use a controller to play the game, instead of keyboard.
Makes the whole gameplay experience nicer.
And, no jumping in the game.

[h1][b][u]Gameplay Experience[/u][/b][/h1]

Hitman 2 storyline is short but satisfying.

My favourite part of this game was able to use a [spoiler]Katana & Shurikens in one of the missions.
I felt like a Ninja.[/spoiler]

There are other game modes, especially the [u]Contracts[/u], created by other online players.
This made the storyline much more exciting and increase difficulties.
Be aware of some messed up contracts too.

Some of them were not really come across my mind as a ""hitman"".

If you are into strategic gameplay and planning, this game is for you.
I love the idea of completing the missions with so many different ways and methods.
That makes this game is so different than any other games.

Add the Legacy Pack (with all the maps/missions from Hitman 2016) and what we have here is a 150GB+ absolute monster of a video game that never gets old. 

Yes, the story's fascinating and all, but have I talked enough about the sheer smoothness of the gameplay? No, I have not -- so I'm gonna keep drooling over this game. I'm currently going through what many cite as masterpieces, but Hitman 2 is  probably never going to leave my Top 10. All the maps contain secrets and various ways to take out targets. They're gorgeous, well-designed, and *dense* with content (as well as Easter eggs from IO's devs). I don't know how self-serious the Hitman series was at the beginning, but the tongue-in-cheek humor that this game often shows is *perfect* for me.

28,71661088,english,"This was my first Hitman game and it was a great introduction to the series. I bought the Gold Edition and have not yet 
bought the GOTY Legacy Pack. So this review will be strictly focused on the Hitman 2 content. Despite my immediate praise, I do have a few problems regarding the game.

The first of which is the actual purchasing of the game. That was probably the hardest part about this game was just figuring out what to buy. So I will attempt to help people. The gold edition is what you want to buy if you want the full game. That is not counting the Hitman 1 story and Patient Zero. To get that you will either have to buy Hitman 1 GOTY Edition ([url=store.steampowered.com/bundle/4854/HITMAN__Game_of_The_Year_Edition/] Found here [/url]) or the GOTY Legacy Pack found on the Hitman 2 steam page. The gold edition is just the Standard Edition with the Expansion Pass. If that was a bit too much wording, then here's a simpler way of putting it.
Standard Edition + Expansion Pass = Gold Edition
Gold Edition + GOTY Legacy Pack = Entire Game
So I hope I could help untangle that mystery for a few people that need help deciding what to buy.

My second complaint is that the game feels unfinished. Haven Island (the final level) ends on a cliffhanger for Hitman 3. But it doesn't feel like a real cliffhanger. I'll refrain from spoilers in this review. But it feels like they had a long story written out and were handed scissors and told to cut at a random point in the page and the part after the cut will be where Hitman 3 picks up. It feels lazy. However, this could be written off as me not being a Hitman veteran.

Apart from those complaints, this is an amazing game. I did not go for silent assassin on every level. I started out doing that but then began just screwing around come the later levels. Miami was my favorite level. I love smuggling in a sniper and getting to vantage points to shoot at random people. Overall, this is my favorite stealth game. I've never enjoyed stealth. All the games that force them in have really left a bad taste in my mouth. They never do it right with the ""If you're caught then you instantly fail the mission"" BS. In this game, if you're caught, get out of sight, wait for them to lower their guard, find an isolated opponent, and then take his clothes. There's a good amount of depth in this game and was definitely worth the $30 on sale. However, I don't think it's worth $100. I got 18.4 hours out of this game before I finished the story. Of course, that's not how you're supposed to play the game. Every mission is meant to be done multiple times. There is a ton of content to help you not get bored with multiple playthroughs. Challenges, different stories, cycling elusive targets, sniper assassin, secrets, all you could ever want. I could probably get another 25-30 hours out of this game before being burned out. If I do get that, I would say $100 is well worth it. But for the current amount of content, it isn't. Especially if you plan on playing through it once and just finishing the story.

If you do want Hitman 2, I would not buy it for $100. I would buy it cheap on either a key seller website or wait until it is cheap on here. It's an amazing game. Overpriced, unfinished, but fun is how I can best describe this game. Unfinished like this review. To show you what this game

Both 2016 and this version of Hitman were completely different than the previous installments, as the story became more in-depth into the world of assassins and the gameplay being more non-linear.

HITMAN 2 had given players the freedom to explore open ended areas of Miami, Mumbai, the forests of Columbia, a suburban home somewhere in US and a secret island, they all look beautiful and breathtaking with its own caliber of graphics. The graphics are slightly different in terms of colors, lightning and details, but saw them to be very similar to it's predecessor. To be honest, I was underwhelmed that it doesn't look as good as Hitman: Absolution in 2012, Absolution had a lot of detailed textures, lighting due to its caliber of graphics and Hitman 2016 also looks bland and too simple like it. The maps in Hitman 2 are less than Hitman 2016 even with the expansions and the cutscenes is literally non-existent because it looks like a slideshow with dynamic effects, but the good part is that Hitman 2 lets you replay the maps from Hitman 2016 in this game if you own the GOTY Edition.

Overall, it's a great stealth assassination game, but it's a more tactical than the older games like I said non-linear areas, hardcore or not you'll kill with the best style you can come up with.

This is a completionist's dream. Each mission has literally dozens of ways to eliminate each target, and there is enough levity and story to keep you entertained far beyond the ""sneak into x, wear x disguise, eliminate x"" gameplay that you'd generally expect from this sort of game. Each level is massive, and beautifully detailed. The replay value of each mission is extremely high, due to the sheer amount of content to explore.

For those who haven't played the Hitman series before, don't expect a lot of gunplay or fast-paced action. This is more of a problem solving and exploration-oriented stealth game. If you're familiar with the series going in, you definitely will not be disappointed.

I would suggests to any player who has never played the series to go the Hitman: Blood Money and make it to Hitman. Blood Money is no doubt one of the best games in the series.
My only complaint is of Elusive Targets and their availability. Not that they're play once, but rather that if you miss it, it is gone. It will swing back around, maybe, but the ones you do do swing back as well and if you played it before and beat you cannot play it again, you just have to stare at it annoyed.

CONS:
1. Why, IO, WHYYYYY must I be connected to the servers to even see the challenges? What if one day those servers are gone? I could easily replay this game in 10 years, but to know that SO MUCH content (like 90%) is reliant upon authentication with servers tied to your existence? That's...no thank you.

2. There is an issue where I can be looking at a bin to dispose of a body, with the prompt, and instead it opens a door behind or next to me. Very odd, and the only consistent bug I've seen in my 200+ hours of testing....apart from the occasional NPC that sees a body or crime through a literal wall (*cough* haven island spa receptionist)

First I will start off by saying a couple of things: I am a big fan of the game, and thus may not see some bad things critics may see, but I’ll try to cover everything. Second, this review might include minor spoilers, for maps and gameplay mechanics, but not for the story. Third, English is my third language, so you will probably encounter grammar errors along the way. If you want just my conclusion, skip to the end. 

-	[b]Graphics[/b]
You don’t play Hitman games for the stunning realistic graphics, but his game holds up with other games. The graphics haven’t been improved on much since Hitman 2016, but they aren’t bad. If you really look at details, you’ll indeed find that the graphics aren’t insane, and some animations are very buggy. 

-	[b]Audio[/b]
The music in the game is, in my opinion, pretty nice, it works well with the setting and creates a good ambience. The voice acting however, needs some work. I understand that IOI can’t afford tons of different voice actors, but this leads to some small problems. Targets having a different voice when bumped into compared to dialogue or guys all over the world having an American accent. 

-	[b]Gameplay[/b]
Hitman 2 adds many new gameplay possibilities compared to Hitman 2016. They re-introduced the briefcase, which works well with the now highly illegal sniper rifle. 
Hitman’s gameplay is of course based on stealth. While not being the most realistic in some situations, especially on the Master difficulty, it is a fun challenge to sneak through a hostile environment. You can use many things to your advantage: using a coin to distract a guard, turning off the fuse box to lure someone out or leaving a weapon for a guard to find. This system of distracting, and silently being able to subdue guards without any penalty, creates a bit of a problem: Why sneak through if you can knock everyone out, just lure them into one room. This is in my opinion a bit dumb and I would have liked a gameplay element to counter this.  
There are almost unlimited ways to eliminate your targets, and each map has special ones. Going from a sneaky kill with the pistol, to blowing up your target or even ramming several targets with a train.
Hitman 2 continues with the opportunity system, now called Mission stories: a scripted scenario that you can use to your advantage. You can follow these to get close to your target or to set up a kill. They often add interesting dialogue and have you learn more about the target.
With the new maps, many new unlocks were added. To be honest, most of them are weird and rather useless. If you’re really smart, you could find a situation where they could be useful, but in general, I sticked to the old items. 

-	[b]Maps[/b]
The base game of hitman 2 features 6 sandbox locations, with each their gameplay possibilities and secrets to explore. 2 more are added in the expansion pass. I will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each map now:

[u]Hawkes bay - Nightcall[/u]
Hawkes bay is the first map of Hitman 2, a beachside villa in New Zealand. The map is very small, and in the beginning empty. The empty map creates an amazing ambience where you have to look for information. Once you have found that, you target arrives and you go over to the ‘Eliminate ...’ objective. Its only one target, and there are no mission stories, neither are there any interesting things you can trigger. This mission feels more like a stealth game than a creative hitman mission. And thus, it has very limited replayability, but the ambience makes up for that: [b]7/10[/b]

[u]Miami – The Finish line[/u]
This map is a huge turnaround from Hawkes bay, going from a nigh time villa to a sunny racing event. The map is huge and will probably feel overwhelming for newer players. One target is something entirely new, she is participating in the race, and at the time of your arrival, will be found on the tracks, in her car. Overall, a solid map, [b]8/10[/b]

[u]Santa Fortuna (Colombia) – Three-Headed Serpent[/u]
The third map is set in the jungle of Columbia, in and around a village that is ruled by a cartel. All of the cartel areas are hostile and heavily guarded. The map can be divided in 4 separate areas, that are all rather locked off from each other, which I don’t really like. The setting is cool but the map just doesn’t do it for me, but that’s my personal preference, its not a bad map: [b]7/10[/b]

[u]Mumbai – Chasing a Ghost[/u]
The fourth map takes you to the slums of Mumbai: in a huge map with tons of possibilities and something new around every corner. The map is gigantic, and probably hard to oversee for newer players. There are two separate hostile compounds that both have their own ambience. It has, in my opinion, the best kills in the game and the coolest setting: [b]8,5/10[/b]

[u]Whittleton Creek - Another life[/u]
People who have played Hitman Blood money will feel right at home in the fifth map, set in an american suburb. This is the second smallest map but that isn’t a problem, this makes it easier to oversee. There is much more to this suburb than meets the eye which makes it a good map: [b]7.5/10[/b]

[u]Isle of Sgail – The Ark Society[/u]
The final map of Hitman 2 takes you to a small, fictional island in the North Sea. Its a rather complicated map and it’ll be hard to navigate if you don’t know it well. It has its own feel to it but it just feels a bit off, and it doesn’t really do it for me: [b]7/10[/b]

-	[b]Sniper assassin[/b]
The sniper assassin game mode is entirely new to Hitman 2. You, or you and a friend, sit in a sniper nest overlooking the map. Taking out unseen targets, hiding bodies and distracting targets with bullets is the key to success. This game mode is fun to play once or twice, but isn’t very fun over time for most people. One Sniper assassin map is included in the main game and two more are acquired through the expansion pass. 

-	[b]Ghost mode[/b]
Hitman 2 also adds the entirely new Ghost mode. Playable on Miami, Santa Fortuna and soon Mumbai, this 1v1 game mode challenges you to take out random targets as cleanly and quickly as possible, before your opponent does. It is hard to find a real match because little people play it and only really enjoyable if you play it with a friend or are very competitive. 

-	[b]Pricing[/b] 
The main game costs 60 bucks, like any triple A game, and you need to keep this in mind:
[b]If you plan on playing through the maps only once or twice, this is not the game for you. The missions are meant to be replayed many times, only if you do that the game is worth your money.[/b]
The legacy pack is definitely worth it if you like the main game, but the expansion pass is only so if you really want more sandbox locations. 

-	[b] Conclusion[/b] 
Hitman 2 is a good game, but only enjoyable and worth it if you like being creative and have patience. If you do so, there is a ton of cool content and much fun playtime ahead: [b]8,5/10[/b]",1569706364,1592430287,True,39,2,0.778382182121276855,0,True,False,False,76561198312972522,30,1,18851,1572,16962,1601226687

That is: ""You don't get to use your signature weapon or what so ever"". Also, my expectations were really low, since I had gone through 'Hitman: Absolution' and 'Hitman 1'. Oh, I'm sorry. I meant 'Wrestler: Absolution' and 'Wrestler 1'. For this reason I can not in good conscious recommend this game to fellow gamers. The main poster is a false commercial! They will punish you, if you use any guns in game.

+) Beautiful scenery!
+) Optimized gameplay.
+) Clear HUD.
+) Straightforward gameplay like usual.
+) Story has progressed to dramatic state. It was nice to go through with it.
+) Missions are stylish and big just as before but here, because of the story development it feels even more so.
+) Each missions have their own music. They perfectly express the theme of each regions.
+) CCTV vision cone is applied. Good.
+) Should you accidentally skip a cut scene, you can easily access it in the main menu. This was already applied in previous series, actually.
+) Music volume was balanced. You no longer need to lower it down.
+) I don't know if it's me who got used to it, but interface has improved. Main menu was easy to handle.
+) The music that plays when you've accomplished main objectives is cool.
+) Item using have improved as well. Yes, a screen pops up and takes control but you can just use the item you want by select and click. Easy.

-) Third time I write this: You are advised not to use the signature weapon. Same goes to all the other weapons you come across. The only usage for silenced pistol is for breaking CCTVs and such.
-) The moment a subdued mob goes into water, they die immediately. Right then and there. Still.
-) Loading from a save can mess up the trigger time for what happens next. Such as, bodies being found.
-) There's a target that controls all the citizens like they are his hired employee. What the heck?
-) Lazy cut scenes! As in still images. If it was like this in previous series, it wouldn't have been a problem but Hitman 1 had a great looking, moving cut scenes. Although, ironically, season pass missions have moving cut scenes. Well, kind of.
-) There's this one long ladder that has a problem; You can't slide down.
-) When a door is near a closet or something, your character will likely open the door instead of the other. Even though, you are rubbing your nose on the closet.
-) Irritating drill sound can occur when you touch an object during subdues. This happened to me twice. First one happened on the very first mission.
-) Speaking of which, voice recording of the main target lady on that starting mission is done horribly. They should've let her speak outwards instead inwards.
-) Key binding can use some efficiency. Why is interact all divided like that? Opening door, picking up, hiding, examining can all use one key.
-) Some characters were too juvenile. They made me feel like all these ""stern face seriousness"" was a joke. You know what? Actually, there were quite a few times when I felt like this game is childish. I did not feel this in previous serious. Not even in Absolution.

74,70604579,english,"This game is not one that you should pick up, play and then forget once you've completed the story. It's one that really encourages you to play through multiple times and explore a level on various occasions, so that you can discover every nook and cranny. The main motivation to revisit a level is to follow the different mission stories, as well as to complete the sundry challenges, and find anything else you may have missed on previous playthroughs (e.g. rooms, NPC dialogue etc.) The content doesn't stop at just the main missions; some locations may have extra ""special assignments"" (mini missions), and there are ""elusive targets"" (missions that are available only for a limited time, and where you can kill the target just once) and contracts. Contracts are made by other players, where targets different to those from the main story can be killed, often requiring certain conditions to be completed (e.g. wear a specific disguise when you kill a target). In addition to contracts, there are also escalations, similar to contracts except they are officially included in the game and need to be finished on three occasions, each occasion requiring new conditions to be met and/or adding new targets to be eliminated.

One of the most rewarding things about this game is setting yourself a goal to fulfill on the main missions (especially attaining silent assassin) or completing particularly tough contracts or escalations. As you roam around you'll find more items and remember where they are, find quicker ways to get to a target and leave, know where NPCs are and what their routine is etc. Combine this growing knowledge with tenacity and you'll soon learn how to finish off a target and then escape swiftly and stealthily. After all, Hitman is really just a puzzle game; you gallivant around a level and learn every little thing about it before devising a good strategy.

If you want a game that challenges you but also rewards you for exploration, consider this one. It's great fun, and it's jam-packed with content, especially if you buy the DLC and the legacy pack.

edited 6.10.2020:

The title has clearly been updated. I am using the same hardware and all the issues I found concerning (audio, combat 'feel', optimization, crowd clipping) have been completely solved. Very glad I've given this title a second chance- it is everything a successor to the series could be. 

The same lush gamelplay loops in the last entry to this series have been bolstered by even more attention to detail and less weirdly out-of-place numale voice acting than, for instance, Marrakesh in the last Hitman. An excellent entry. I now change my review to 'Recommended,' unequivocally, and will state that this is well worth $60.

FEBRUARY 2019 INITIAL REVIEW BELOW FOR REFERENCE; ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED 
I have played and been a great fan of this series since the very first Hitman game. Unfortunately, this one fell well short of my expectations-- I played through the tutorial and the gamespace was so small that flanking patrols was impossible-- the screen became incredibly blurry as UI elements told me I was approaching the boundary of the world. Everything is incredibly simplified and made casual.

Once I did the tutorial, it was on to Miami. I had a few unsuccessful incursions before I was able to identify what was so bothersome about this title. Graphically, framerate issues forced my robust console to 2K resolution. Even more disconcerting, PEOPLE IN CROWDS, one model in particular, would FLICK into existence from empty space if I turned around too quickly. It utterly broke immersion and seems to be an improperly-implemented character rendering optimization. Combat seems flat and lackluster, particularly in sound design.

I got a refund promptly. I hope this title fixes its issues over time so that I can properly review it.

79,56245333,english,"[b]Should you buy Hitman 2 right now ?[/b]

- I suggest you wait for a sale - if i didn't buy Hitman 2 on sale i would of spent NZ$ 149.95 on the Gold Edition (full game) of the game, that's way too much!

[b]Is the game fun ?[/b]

- it amazing but locking single player content online is not cool IO Interactive

[b]How much content is there ?[/b]

Update 25th November 2019 - After thinking about it, the game is a bit overwhelming in terms of content there is too much content, especially when you buy the game months or a year after the game launched

- Bucket Loads - haven't even got on to the Hitman 2 levels yet am still playing on the legacy levels. (HITMAN™ - GOTY Legacy Pack or HITMAN™ - GOTY Legacy Pack Upgrade or if you have Hitman 2016 you will get the levels)


[b]What did it cost me ?[/b]

- 150 GB of my storage - RIP hard drive space

[b]Is there multiplayer ?[/b]

- Yes its called ""ghost mode"" - I have yet to try the ghost mode, can't be bothered really.

[b]Can you play without connecting to the Hitman 2 severs ?[/b]

Yes but most of the games content is single player but annoyingly IO Interactive decided most of single player content will be tied to the Hitman 2 servers, so to fully enjoy Hitman 2 you will need a internet connection sadly.

[b]What single player parts are stupidly locked to the online ?[/b]

Saving weapon loadouts, End of mission stats, challenges, Unlocking new location starting points in a level

[b]Is there player created content?[/b]

Yes, player can create contracts, basically you can set random npcs in a level to be killed by the player and you can set what ways you are allowed to kill said npcs. - there are some cool contracts

[b]How often does the game get new content ?[/b]

IOI releases monthly roadmap that show you what content to expect during the month, along with the roadmap they releases Elusive Targets which are available for a limited time, Elusive Targets are unique npc with a story, one of the past Elusive Targets was Sean Bean, IOI sometimes brings back old Elusive Targets.


[b]Am i still playing Hitman 2 ?[/b]

No i stopped playing a few week ago and uninstalled the game because i lost interest and it was taking too much hard drive space, might revisit Hitman 2 sometime in the near future. 

Won't be buying any of the future Hitman games if IO Interactive keep forcing single player content only online, The Hitman franchise has been single player why force players to connect to a sever to play a single player game WTF  IO Interactive!!!",1572680129,1591751906,False,3,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198311643436,151,4,3386,0,3386,1567804431

81,47129847,english,"Naturally, its only fair that a game titled Hitman 2 would remain the best entry in the series. 

Contrary to popular belief Silent Assassin is the best Hitman game, well second best now. Although still a good game Blood Money really failed to make any real improvements to the Hitman formula due to most new features appearing in the previous title Contracts. 
Hitman 2 however improves on almost every aspect with better level design, smarter AI,  additional customisation in regards to loadouts, better controls, vastly improved stealth system with the removal of the terrible awareness bar from the older titles and a much bigger graphical improvement. 
However to briefly touch on it, the story isn't much and the cutscenes aren't animated, possibly due to no longer being apart of SE and likely losing development time and money.

I would have liked to write this about Hitman 2016, but its episodic nature drove me away from purchasing and as such Hitman 2 is really my first addition to the series since Absolution.

Unlike previous titles it feels like this entry is less punishing on playing creatively as most of the rewards and cool additions come with completing challenges, rather than a perfect rating although even then it is possible to get a good rating without having to fibre wire someone in the corner of a room and repeatedly hitting the quick load button. 

With future DLC and the possible addition of classic missions being remastered I look forward to seeing what more they do with this entry and also what they can do with the series.

You can't skip the WB and IOI logo at the start without patching a file
Challenges do not pop if you miss < 1 sec of dialog
You can't get spotted after you eliminated your targets
You get spotted even when it says concealed 
Useless online mode
Diana is overbearing 
If you approach a mission from a different angle you risk to lose your rating

A product rushed to market as always WB. Fantastic job.

-5 out of 10 (NO TYPO is is MINUS 5)

In order to create a proper product why don't you guys get a few of the main pillars of the Hitman community to test and break your game before releasing it? The stunt show to allow people to play it for a few hours is not enough. Let people who speedrun the hitman franchise for years look at the product before you release it. Maybe you should contact CJ, Kotti, Pagan, Gaming Gold or others to test your product before.

As a software developer I can only say: You failed your job IOI

The game is out for a while now and honestly it is not getting better. They managed to make it even worse. You now get spotted through ceilings. If you are not 100% behind someone and you want to subdue someone there is a little punch glitch that people turn around 180 degree in a split second. As a CS caster once said: ""Inhuman reactions"". Also elusive targets are copy and paste jobs even occur twice now. The ""undying"" elusive target has now a new feature in part 2: eye patch. Instead of fixing issues a second sniper map came out... WTF? Fix your bugs first before releasing new content

After the last patch all the previous issues are back. You now get spotted through solid rock. In Sapienza for example yo get spotted when you stand on top of people 20 meter plus of solid rock between you and the NPC but they can see you right away. Great makes absolute sense IOI. Also the increase of speed for DX12 left some maps almost unplayable since the game just crashes on you with a DX12 Physics Error. 

IOI Quality control is something you heard about?

Rant:
- If you got stuck on any achievement, look up MrFreeze2244, like seriously dude's got amazing guide videos
- Love the level designs even though I hate certain maps because of how far apart some targets are (YES I'M LOOKING AT YOU SANTA FORTUNA, YOU TOO MUMBAI)
- The Return of the Suitcase
- Really happy they went back to the sandbox approach for gameplay. Gave you a lot more options for taking out targets. Although I'm still sad some strats I thought would work (like [spoiler] poisoning cocaine brick in Santa Fortuna[/spoiler]) didn't
- Main plot is okay. NPC-centric side-stories are fun to listen to. Just maybe spread out 100% achievement of a level. I made that mistake and couldn't stand the fashion show soundtrack anymore
- Some of the achievements are pretty stupid, so be prepared to look up guides if you are a compulsive 100% completionist like me
- Once you learn the mechanics you can do some pretty wacky stuff, like auto-tracking projectile lol
- Now that I finally beat got 100% single-player achievements and just waiting for Hitman 3, I still go back to this game occasionally just to challenge myself to use different tools/weapons (eyyy Striker-only runs)
- It's also really fun to watch speedrunners, I probably spent hours on Youtube looking at those

what I liked
very detailed locations with miami being a particular highlight
an extensive array of options to kill your enemies
options for all out stealth or gun toting in missions
graphics are really nice
interacting with different plot points make replay missions interesting

what I did not like
for me the gold edition is too short, (although it was on offer)
not having hitman 1 with gold edition and working out what dlc you need is frustrating
always online feature can be annoying
storyline needs some work and again too short

what really makes this game worthwhile is the graphics and also you feel a sense of freedom to play how you want within the hitman world.

56,69995078,english,"So with the recent downfalls of the pivotal series in the stealth genre that all have been running since the early 2000s, namely Thief ""Reboot"", Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, Hitman not only still hold up surprisingly well but is arguably at its best ever, just now finally realizing the potential the series has all the way back to its very first installment.

I love Blood Money for what it is, and I feel the need to mention it. It is what at that time I considered a great Hitman game, for how much I despised Absolution that came 6 years after. But now with the release of the 2016 ""soft reboot"", it didn't just uphold the standard well but nearly makes Blood Money obsolete. HITMAN 2 (2018) serves as a second season of the 2016 game, with the core gameplay mechanics remain the same. With all the maps and missions from Season 1 had been ported into HITMAN 2, this is now the ultimate Hitman experience in one package. You can enjoy both games' content with the added benefit of new features from HITMAN 2, like the returning of suitcase (finally!) to conceal sniper rifle or the ability to blend into crowds to name a few. 

I could spend hours babbling about how great the level design in HITMAN is. These are unbelievably intricate, detailed and cleverly designed for you to set up the most creative ways to solve the problem as possible. Take for example Sapienza is one of my favorite levels in season 1, an Italian coastal town which is both extensive in term of scope and chocked full of details to every square inch. It has a main street with optional buildings that you can explore, including a town hall with a clock tower, an ice cream shop, a clothing store, a church and a morgue, a public bathroom and a beach, and none of these contain any of your main objectives, this is all totally optional yet far from pointless. These optional areas contain stuffs that help accomplish the main objectives and ways to play the level differently, ranging from disguises, useful items, keycards, or even vantage points to snipe your targets from afar. The amount of ways to assassinate your targets is bordering excessive but every single option is unique and fun to execute.

There's so much of it, every level is so rich and teeming with personality and opportunity. The first time you play a level, you're just getting to grips with how it's laid out, and subsequent replays are, if anything, more fun, as you tinker with routes and strategies to knock off the trickier challenges.

Bonus: this game is possibly the best critique of late-stage capitalism I've ever played. It asks you to murder obnoxious and amoral slumlords, bankers and software tychoons who, in their unguarded moments, soliloquise on how much they despise ""the little people"".

Pros: Perhaps the first Hitman game with bug free AND well implemented AI, beautifully cinematic gameplay and cutscenes, industry defining world building and map design, engaging music with stellar polish, and flawlessly executed mechanics.

Cons: Oppressive level structure simulates difficulty with wait times accumulating to half an hour per 45 minute run of a level makes extended play a brutal chore rather than an immersive experience. Unless you've memorized the maps and go for curated routes this game is best played in short bursts. What's more, the elusive target maps are soul crushingly boring and a permanent stain on your profile if real life doesn't allow for a ""proper"" play session. After the roller coaster of good and bad game design choices this franchise has been I really thought this was the masterpiece we'd been waiting for. After the worst week of my life ending in a phone call screwing up an elusive target permanently... I really wish I'd never heard of any Hitman title.

There's a big difference between a slow paced, thoughtful game and spending literal half hours without a single control input and the devs still don't seem to know that.

I don't like the game I have to play to get it to run. 
The repetitive startup crashes have reached their limit with my patience. 
Clearly more than just a single issue when trying to launch.
In my case, audio drivers seem to be a problem; I run a Focusrite firewire setup, and the Firewire light drops off and restarts when having an unsuccessful launch. 
Other times, the crash seems to be related to another process running, in this case Glary Utilities (well, actually it's update program) when I shut that down I have much more general success of it launching, and if not, it does the Firewire bullshit again until on one random launch, it just works. 
I shouldn't have to babysit a AAA game into running because it thinks something bad is happening in another process - or doesn't comfortably support my audio setup when everything else in my library can do so.
It's just crap, lazy, unrefined coding. 
Where's the pride you devs are supposed to have in at least providing a stable launch?
How can I recommend it to anyone when I'm essentially recommending problems?

So as the general consensus goes: fix your crap coding and I'll fix my crap review.

Each level gives players the ability to plan their actions before taking out the target. This includes brining equipment, planning additional gear, choosing your starting point and scouting the area. You could use weapons, poison or the environment to your advantage. Each level is rich in replay value, making you go back and play it again for hours.

No cutscenes, only still images. The only good thing about this is graphics, but I do not care much about them. Huge maps and level design, but it feels boring to play.

27,69424740,english,"10/10, would Hitman again.

I love the Hitman franchise because of the stealth aspects of the game and generally how fun it is! I think that Hitman 2 was a near perfect game, especially with the addition of a multiplayer mode to challenge yourself even more. This season was a good followup to the last and the change in cut scene format was an interesting choice(in a good way). The stealth aspects of the game makes it fun to play and the many ways you can win (and mess up) make every game that you play different than the last. The variability allows for a plentiful range of content and you never get bored playing the game. The Elusive Target feature is back and the loot are still different kinds of suits. The Elusive Targets in this game are fun to go after and makes you think. All in all I think that this is a pretty complete game in itself and I would definitely recommend it to new players. 

But if you are a returning player form the previous game you might be a little mad...

The only thing that I was annoyed about was the fact that there wasn't a legacy feature where if you bought the previous Hitman game (2016) the accomplishments wouldn't transfer into the new game. You do get the previous game if you buy Hitman 2 which is awesome for players who want to play the entire story but for fans of the franchise it would have been cool if we didn't have to replay the whole first season again to complete the game.

This is a really fun game and I think you should get it regardless of if you had the previous one or not. It is fun, there is always new content and challenges for you to try and the graphics are honestly really nice. The story is captivating, and the flow of the game is really well constructed. I would wait for the gold edition to become cheaper if you want the full experience but this game is worth getting.",1589900153,1589900153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198209191192,38,1,16367,0,8431,1598391463

Hitman is a very excellent game without a doubt ,actually , this is one of my favorite games.
But the network is too bad that beyond my imagination.

HITMAN 2 is an amazing game. Not only is it a great game, but it also includes the first HITMAN game and the Patient Zero Campaign, which I loved. The weapon selection at the beginning is small, but as you progress, you can get new assault rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, and pistols. I was very excited when I unlocked 47's silverballers from Hitman Absolution. Being silenced and steady, I was able to use them to get higher rankings on levels. I also was excited to get the concealable knife, which allowed me to go through a frisk and still have a weapon if I didn't have another way to get into a secure area. Overall, this game is a 9.5/10.

Having all the episodes from the previous Hitman playable in this game is great, it's a huge quality of life thing and I'm very happy they did that.

The stories is one of my favourite things in this game, so much so that I re-played every mission after completing the game to do every mission story for all the levels.

Voice acting for main characters, cut-scenes and all that stuff is top notch in my opinion. The story is also pretty good, but in the end I don't think most of us play Hitman strictly for the story.
Voice acting on random NPC's isn't the greatest, extremely repetitive lines and the same, very small amount of voice actors are used for every single random NPC. Female NPCs have a few different voice actors, male NPCs have a few different voice actors.
I understand that you can't get voice overs from 1,500 people to constantly have unique voices, but you could also get more than like 5 or 10.

Absolutely recommended on sale.

A thing that I really do not understand is that throwing objects at cameras[i](so a knife or screwdriver for example)[/i] doesn't break them. I think it should.

It gives enough hand-holding options to be accessible, and enough depth to give a lot of replay value.  It's very satisfying to learn how to manipulate a scenario to be in the right place at the right time to take out a target when nobody is looking.

Graphics - good enough to look nice without being so graphic to give you nightmares about what you're actually doing in the game
Gameplay - solid and gives you plenty of options to attack a target

34,68737353,english,"If you are a creative psychopath, this game is for you :) As a silent assassin genre game, this is 10 of 10 in my humble opinion. 
I have never been a fan of challenging games, as I prefer just to relax and have fun after my working hours. And I thought that this game is more a challenge than fun. But this appeared to be not exactly true. It can still be quite challenging if you do a master silent assassin or sniper assassin mode. But you don't want a challenge, you have many-many ways to complete all levels easily enjoying your time in the game.
Replayability. Oh boi oh boi. You have so many options, tools and ways to complete your task, I have spent 160 hours so far and unlocked all steam achievements, but I think I'm still haven't touched 40% of opportunities and kills. So much more to explore (ps. I own the legacy pack, so played through all chapters of part 1 and 2).
For a new joiner I would advise the following approach to get most enjoyment (that worked for me).
- complete a mission passing through all main story lines. It may take 3-4 times to do the same mission, but in a very different way. By that time you will learn the map and should be familiar with the main patters of your targets.
- try escalation contracts for the map. This may require some mastermind skills. If you are not inspired to discover the best approach toward completing the escalation, watch youtubers. I couldn't imagine how creative people are. For some escalation I would never imagined that the way shown in the youtube videos are possible. Escalation contracts can give you good clues how to approach the target and it is a great help for your master walkthrough.
- try the master level walkthrough, you need to plan and know exactly what you are doing. This level may be quite challenging, but you may get lot of satisfaction once you have competed your master contract.
- max your map level to 15-20 (depending on the map)
- try master silent and sniper assassin, if you a hardcore player.
And this is not the end, lots of other regimes and cool features are available. I would tell more, but want to keep it simple. This is a great game for me.

79,68496679,english,"HITMAN 2 REVIEW

Apart from the always Online requirement of the game, which is needed to do challenges or unlock new items Hitman 2 is a solid entry of the franchise.

PROS

+ Player freedom. carry out assassinations in creative ways & finish challenges for for each missions.
+ Game has a lot of replayability. You can play a mission again to complete challenges & get new items.
+ Game seems to be optimised greatly.
+ Contracts is a fun game mode. You can create & play contracts, share your contracts with others.
+ Sniper assassin mode is good time killer.
+ Ghost mode is fun addition but took time to find players.

CONS

- Internet connection required to complete challenges & unlocks.
- Story is just ok.
- No cut scene cinematics, story is told through motion comics.

Rating: 

Gameplay experience: 8/10
Story: 7/10
Graphics: 8.5/10

Recommendation: Buy it on sale with Hitman GOTY Legacy Pack. 
                               You can play missions from H1 if you could purchase GOTY Legacy Pack. If you own Hitman 1 then it will 
                               be added free to H2. I recommend this game if you have a steady & good internet connection to play 
                               challenges.

Agent 47 is back again to solve large interesting 3d puzzles of how to get your target into the ground most efficiently, or just to shoot up places because why not?

Each level has a target but they are massive levels with multiple artful ways to kill targets, and it’s a lot of fun to explore the spaces. This is the second mission in the game, but there’s so much to do in these games, 150 some achievements, tons of challenges, each level has its own progression system which I normally hate, but they work so well here as a way to unlock new tricks through gameplay.

After filming this I went back and played the first mission for about 5 hours trying to unlock everything I could in it, there’s just a ton to do if you want to master the level rather than just beat it, and that’s only for the challenges, there’s a ton of additional modes as well.

This game is perfect for people who want to play a stealth game, a puzzle game, or just an immersive sim. The new Hitman games are unique and worth checking out.

Oh and if you got Hitman 2016 a while back, good news, that game works with this one, and essentially you can play both versions in one game. Don’t know if that’s a huge win as you already have both games, but it’s a very cool feature.

28,67653872,english,"I'm so, so sad this game is what it is.  I played all the original Hitman games many years ago, and I cannot overstate how excited I was for this, but it feels like a gigantic cash grab with sub-par features all around.  6/10 if I hadn't played prior games in the series before, 3.5/10 because I have.  

Summary:  The mechanics and ingenuity of the franchise are almost unchanged after ~16 years.  The larger environments here would be cool, but the awful design means that you end up wandering aimlessly looking for things that hopefully, eventually help you murder your targets.  The game's graphics are underwhelming, yet it somehow takes 100 GB of disk space!  And the various ways in which the game interface constantly tries to get you to buy more things tells a clear tale of what the developers' priorities really were.

Graphics:  I don't usually care about graphics, but these graphics are worse than games 10 years older, and yet this game seems to need a 2018-tier GPU to run.  My GTX 1050 Ti sputters occasionally with the default settings.  This sort of lazy development REALLY tells you how little they tried.  Yet somehow this game takes up 100 GB on my hard drive.  Yes, one HUNDRED.  That's almost twice as large as Witcher 3 and 20% the graphics quality.  Why?  Because reasons.  

Gameplay:  Feels just like the original Hitman games, both for better and for worse.  Lots of cool ways you can assassinate your enemies, but the combat is rather simplistic, and so is the stealth.  In the old games, it was fun to occasionally go in guns blazing, but game mechanics here mean that doesn't work and isn't fun.  The stealth is a bit better than the original games, though it also feels less consistent--sometimes I can walk (not sneak) right behind enemies without them noticing me and other times not, with no reason I can see.  That so many of the mechanics haven't been improved upon, was the first clue that this was a lazy effort.  

The bigger gameplay issue is that the franchise's core mechanic, letting players figure out clever ways to assassinate the target, is now so convoluted.  You either let the game hold your hand with step-by-step map indicators (default settings), or turn these off and spend hours wandering around, trying almost random things to see what works.  You don't get ANY useful intel at the start of the mission, so it's all about just walking around until you, by pure chance, find something useful like a box of rat poison in a break room.  

But you ask, ""Couldn't you just bring poison to the mission?""  Great idea!  Except, unlocking useful gear requires you to grind through the same level over and over and over again, performing ""Challenges"", many of which no one would ever complete if they didn't look at the list because they're ridiculous.  Oh, and you can't unlock about half (or maybe even 2/3rds) of the gear without paying for the previous Hitman game,  whose unlocks are shared.  Wow, that'd be awesome if I felt like spending a bunch more money and wasting even more of my life, otherwise, I'm boned.  Thanks Square Enix!  

Other:  If you were looking for a good story, abandon all hope now.  Not only is it terrible, but the ""cinematics"" through which they're revealed aren't really videos.  People are talking, but all you see are still images of them.  If you don't like intrusive, sketchy system monitoring, then this game isn't your friend.",1587337438,1588185951,False,4,0,0.501901149749755859,0,True,False,False,76561198089842442,123,37,3550,0,2554,1587773204

Let me start of with the performance of the game. When it doesn't crash for once the framerate drops massively when in a crowd.
The gameplay is the most frustrating for me. I don't find any reward in killing someone in another way than just shooting them. And even if I try another approach it's always the same cycle: poison, pushing them off something, dropping something. And when I try something else than shooting the wait is so damn long, the characters don't have any interesting walking schedules and the pathfinding of enemies is something out of a game from 10 years ago.

 This game may just end up being my favorite game of all time. I avoided the 2016 HITMAN title because of the episodic style as well as the ladder. I did play a few of the other HITMAN games like Blood Money, some of H2, and Absolution. And I liked those games, it's just something about episodic games turn me off. But now that it is all complete (aside from contracts and elusive targets- weekly assignments), I figured I would give it a go, especially since it was on sale and I managed to pick everything up for around 25 US $.

 So onto the game itself; This thing is a fucking masterpiece, that just keeps on giving.

 I was concerned the game wouldn't have much content even with all that's been released in the past few years, but oh boy was I happily wrong. There are about 18 maps to be played, some being variations of already existing maps, and a plethora of challenges, and special assignments to be completed. Every single map has infinite ways of taking down targets however you wish. With unlocks that are rewarded on leveling up and map exploration. A large array of weapons for all types of play styles, and a handy arsenal of tools and gadgets. The AI is actually some of the best AI you will find in a game like this. Sometimes it can be buggy but it is extremely rare and I have only seen 1 or 2 instances of AI clipping into something or doing something out of the ordinary out of almost 20 hours of playtime. The AI is also very dynamic and will change what they are doing based on how you impact their environment.

the gameplay 
the gameplay is alot like hitman 2016 but with more element with still heavy focus towards disguises even improving on the enforce system with now they will take a bit longer to spot you making it easier to move past them without basically having a game over,and now adding back something from hitman blood money where you are able to see when something important is happening,a screen will pop up showing you the thing like blood money,level design is fantastic again you are dropped into a giant map minimum instructions or no instructions if you want by turning off guide,which i did to get the felling of the classic hitman games,unique ways to kill targets with more than 100 ways to kill a target,overall what you would expect from a hitman game which is even more impressive knowing what the devs went through making this

the story
one thing i kinda didn't like is now having stop motion cutscenes instead of the beautiful looking ones in 2016,but then i remember what the devs went through making this game and then i don't really mind it,hitman 2 (2018) takes place after hitman 2016 you are recruited by providence to take out the shadow client also known as lucas grey which we find out from the ending of hitman 2016 that he is the childhood friend of agent 47,and this game really tries to shine more light on the past of not only agent 47 but also diana,and building up the relationship between diana and 47 more which i love and their character,with 47 even starting to show conscience over what he is doing

47,67711074,english,"This game manages to hit two niche gripes that I absolutely hate

Before buying anything I had to put an hour of research in to try and figure out what DLC I should get. Every level is cut off and sold individually since they only rolled out so much content at a time. This drives me up the wall. Luckily I was able to dodge this bugbear by purchasing it when the whole thing went on sale for 80% off, buying this game at full price is a scam.

The other gripe is that the whole thing is built on the expectation that you re-beat each level three or more times. 

I -hate- replaying games, especially in more methodical instances where you're slowly meandering across a huge map or waiting for NPC targets to move. The publically available achievements don't lie. A fraction of a percentage of people replayed the final map. People might have been on board for replaying the first couple of maps but that driving force quickly lost it's edge.

I don't like replaying games. People generally don't like replaying games either. Just check the achievement page if you don't believe me. Tons and tons of tracked stats indicate that almost no one is redoing your maps.

Sure they're fun the first time, but the developers goad people into playing this game to death, beyond the point they're sick of it. Escalations are dumb and repetitive, elusive targets are stupid from the ground up, this game is rife with recycled content.

I can -only- recommend this game if you pick it up on a huge sale like I did and only play each map once, very few maps were worthy of any further attention other than your first run through them.",1587419568,1587419568,False,6,0,0.408332169055938721,6,True,False,False,76561197994372073,716,341,3885,0,3883,1587419962

62,67650543,english,"Q: Why I like this game?
A: I have enjoyed the Hitman series since my teenage years. It started with Hitman: Absolution and from then on I knew this series fits my play style perfectly. I don't like FPS that much and neither do I like unplanned fast pace games. I like to take my time in planning and patience in executing. 

Q: What does this game offer?
A: This game has a lot of feature such as: 
1. A great story line 
2. Amazing Visuals
3. Lot of replay value 

Q: What can we expect from the story line and after it ends?
A: A great story really sets up the game and this story pulls you in. Once you complete main story line there are different ways to kill targets. These stories for each mission means after I finish the main story I can try to kill from different approach. Almost every mission has 6-8 stories.

Q: I completed the stories what else can I do?
A: Good for you the game highly recommends you do that because each story introduces to a different game mechanic to eliminate the target. Also Hitman gives contracts and specific ways to kill different targets for each location. For example the contract will be to kill a specific waitress on specific floor with a gargoyle. 

Even if you finished all that there are various difficulty levels. Casual is easy mode. But if you want to call yourself a Master Assassin you can't change from suit, no witness, no saves. It gets very hard very quick. 

Q: What else does the game offer apart from story line? Is there multiplayer I can play with friends?
A: Apart from the story missions you also get access to 2 new modes
  1. Ghost Mode: You compete against another player to kill different targets around the map. 
  2. Sniper Assassin: Single player/Multiplayer, you're at a vantage point and have to take out targets using sniper. 

In summary, I highly recommend this game. I think the developers have done an absolutely astonishing job of keeping the game fresh with regular updates. I would like to see more options added such as more players in multiplayer. So that I can play with more than 1 friend. Maybe a squad in ghost mode and sniper assassin mode. Also the scenes in the game feel so real, the dialogue, the music, the NPC interactions, the attention to detail is all so spectacular that words don't do it justice.",1587332452,1587332452,True,1,0,0.502074658870697021,0,True,False,False,76561198117775735,441,21,7919,0,2004,1600455950

I think I've rarely seen any game with so much replayability as this one. Apart from the normal missions with several ways to follow only the main story and hundreds of optional challenges, there are bonus and special missions and also community created challenges. I think if one really want to do it all, one easily can amount more than a 1000 hours into this game. 

Of course, after a while, the mechanics do not change an remain the same: create a distraction, disguise, lure people away. But it is always such a satisfying experience to complete a level or task that it does not get old, also, as the environments change drastically.

70,67316503,english,"Honestly, i loved the Previous Hitman games, Blood Money being my favorite. so when i saw this on sale i thought, hell yeah, its gotta be good. i was quite wrong. Lets first start with the fact that it is currently taking up 149 Gigs of space on my computer, yet every option, every menu, all have to be fetched from the server. In two hours of game time, i get less than an hour of play time, due to all the loading and connecting. And god forbid you get disconnected mid game, or now you cant do any of the challenges, get xp or unlock anything.

Next id like to mention the fact that all the mission stories come at you too fast, and feel impersonal. why am i doing this? you usually only find out why afterwards, so your chance is gone. everything feels so disconnected. on top of that, to unlock items, you expect me to replay a mission right away, rather that going through the campaign, then back again. if i just did the first mission, why do i have to do it two more times right away before i continue? usually you beat the game first, then go back.

I really think they ruined Hitman. Its all just become about killing people with weird things, like a fish, or doing goofy acts, its no longer about gathering intel and planning your hit. why do i have to do a challenge to unlock extra starting locations?  i have to infiltrate the kitchen staff, so that i can infiltrate the kitchen staff next time? whats the point if i have already figured out how to do that the hard way.

Even at a sale price, this was still a waste of money. if i hadn't tried so hard to enjoy it and take so long, id have asked for a refund, and i will only play to try and get my moneys worth. only buy this if you just want to mess around and kill people for fun.

**EDIT**

After not being able to get a refund of this product, I decided to try and have fun with it anyway. Literally everytime I play this game, I am left disappointed. The challanges are not fun, The mission stories force you to do exactly what they want, holding your hand the whole time, and the whole unlock system makes it so i have to go through, and see which missions i should bother with, just so i have the tools I would like to use.

75,67615252,english,"As a developer myself with a released video game title, I'm amazed at the tremendous amount of work put into this title! Runs smooth, amazing graphics, great animations, crazy amount of movie clips with exceptional voiceover, wrapping up a very nice story. The whole thing is just so together I can only think of the people created this at IO with recognition and respect: devs, artists, modelers, animators... Endless list. FANTASTIC job, people!


Why don't I recommend the game then? It's simple and I'm sorry to say this but this is how I feel about the game: it's boring. Two things make me say that:

1, As of the AI quality / intelligence, nothing changed since the very first Hitman. The AI is dumb, reactions are not natural, don't even try to be human-like, it's just a 2 bit hardcoded something. The whole thing stinks of sloppyness, it feels like it's ""if (ComesClose()) { Reaction(AIReactions.Guard); }"" kind of thing. Horrible, and it makes gameplay super-linear and extremely boring. Playing a colourful video game in black and white. Shame.

2, Stories smashed down one's throat: First, the game wants to force playing the same scene / map over and over again, as they built several ""stories"" for all maps (i.e. ways / approaches to take down the target(s)), and creators want to force the player to grind them all.
This means the freedom is gone, creative ways to deliver that blow is gone, one has to figure out what was hardcoded for him, follow the marks (literally, on the HUD), do the things written on screen and think one played the game - when in fact, the game played the player.
It's like the old Thief games vs the 2014 title. Previously, one was in free roam and the player was unlimited, the 2014 title was a hardcoded ""follow the steps we created for you and you'll win, otherwise..."". Hitman is the same. It's ugly.
If I wanted to play the same map a billion times, I would have done that, but I don't want to be forced to do so to unlock content, I want to do it because I'm keen to do it, for the game being so much fun. Too bad Hitman can't deliver this...

All in all, I'll play through the game (ONCE) but I try to avoid these ""stories"". So my challenge in this game is, trying to stay creative while the game is trying to force me do a step-by-step, boring, hard-coded guide with no fun or surprises.

59,67415846,english,"The various editions of the game are kind of confusing, so make sure you do your research on which pack you get - you'll need to get the Gold Expansion Pass to access all of the content in the game, and the Legacy Pass if you want to also have access to the entirety of Hitman 2016 (which I highly recommend doing if you hadn't played the original as I hadn't). Since I grabbed all of this during the recent sale, it was only like $25 for everything and I could not be more satisfied with what I received for that - but keep in mind that my thoughts are coming based on that fact.

All told what you get is 18 full missions, 6 bonus missions from the Patient Zero DLC that reuses Hitman 1 maps in new ways, bimonthly Elusive Target contracts that reuse maps from Hitman 2 in new ways, and an endless supply of user generated contracts if you get bored of all that. Getting through the two games' main stories only took me about 30 hours for both, which may sound like not very long... however, that was me only doing each mission once. The game heavily encourages you to replay missions because there are multiple branching paths - or ""mission stories"" as the game calls them - to eliminate each target, and every single one is more creative and satisfying than the last, and I for one can not wait to go back through and replay every single mission multiple times until I find each and every one of them.

The levels are intricately designed sandbox mazes that really make you feel like you're a master assassin setting up rube goldberg machines of death like the grim reaper in the Final Destination movies. Figuring out your targets' routines, finding the right disguises to get into the right areas, discovering ways you can alter the world to fit your sadistic whims, it all works to create one of the most immersive, tense, and fun stealth game experiences I've ever played. 

If you're looking for a really good stealth game with a bit of a black sense of humor - and especially if you can find this when it's on sale - I highly highly highly recommend you pick up Hitman 2.

82,67372825,english,"Being a Hitman fan from the very first Agent 47 game, I thought I'd give the reboot a chance while it was on sale. Despite my initial reservations, I found most of the gameplay mechanics compelling (although I must admit the game had some issues trying to quickbind functions into mouse macros). Still, after playing through the initial Hitman and Hitman 2 missions (thanks to the DLC), I can't say I recommend this game. The AI is painfully oblivious to things around it, and players can basically eliminate a sleuth of professional bodyguards by means of a convenient radio / generator / fusebox spam. The levels are diverse and interesting enough as a premise, but the storytelling and pretense on which Agent 47 goes around snuffing people out is weak at best. The lack of proper narrative is compounded in the second game, when the studio apparently felt that they were paying too much for animation and opted instead to cut out even that little immersion by replacing them with still shots and spoken over narration. Insofar as the 'freedom' of the game is in question, there are a multitude of ways to dispose of your targets, but the game makes it abundantly clear it is basically rewarding you for following the set path by the developers by rewarding high XP for following their little dramas to complete the missions, often in convoluted manner instead of ghosting the location and leaving nothing behind. Sometimes you find yourself stumbling upon these forced narratives and I found myself opting for the easy XP instead of spending twenty minutes learning the guard rotas and planning my approach, when you could basically force the scripted event and get the target to abandon all security detail and make them utterly exposed. I found this extremely dissatisfying. Overall, I don't think I'll replay this game, despite the claimed replayability where 'make the world your weapon' slogan boasted by the game intro screen is utterly shadowed by the strong sense of the developers herding the PC to play out their little plays during missions, instead of utilizing their own wits and their surroundings to approaching targets and liquidating them without leaving a trace.",1586963942,1586963942,False,10,0,0.570896923542022705,0,True,False,False,76561198041629662,349,22,1055,0,1055,1586960253

With that said, this game has a lot of replay-ability in that there are multiple missions for each map, in which you have to execute the victims in a certain way. This I think is a great mechanic as it also allows the game to show how you can literally go about the base missions at any angle possible.

1: It crashes. A lot. Hitman can be completely unplayable if you just happen to have a certain type of GPU.
2: You cannot play the full game when offline, entire missions, gameplay elements and even your stats after completing a mission are not accessible when you're offline. So if you dont want to share your data for a single player game, or if your internet provider isn't that good.... Too bad, you'll pay 100% of the price for 90% of the game.

When you think you are done, you discover some new way to kill your target in a non-conventional way (for example causing a massive supercar crash in Miami). More than that, people release custom contracts everyday.
Every contract gives you the chance to kill a designated NPC (even more than one!) in specific ways, and a successful completion means more XP and more items unlocked.

79,67056682,english,"Virtually the same as it's predecessor, Hitman 2 still manages to do a lot more right. It keeps all of the gameplay elements the same as the previous installment. But there are a few pros and very few cons to this.

PROS:
Remastering of the 6 Missions from the first game. These aren't just new graphics, some items have been added into the maps to make them more interesting to people who played the first game.

New items, that make the game much more engaging to people who have already played through. Now you can go back to those same 6 Missions with items that weren't in the first game.

Much brighter graphics and lighting make it a lot easier to see what you need to see.

The introduction of a third difficulty level. This was a major problem in the first game. You either could take 50 bullets and be fine, or killed by 3 pistol shots. This game solves that by having a difficulty which a step between, for those who want a more difficult, but not insanely difficult game.

Ghost Mode. The ability to compete with random people, as well as your friends, makes this a fun game mode to mess around in.


CONS:
Ghost Mode has been stuck with only having 2 maps for a long time, and even though the target can spawn in different places, there's still only a few set locations for him to spawn. 

Story. The story is only okay. For a game about being dropped in an open world environment and eliminating targets, the story isn't that important. 

Cutscenes. A step back from the well animated cutscenes in the first game, they're now more of a comic book with voiceover laid on top of that. 

47. I may be the only one, but I just think he doesn't look as good as he did in Hitman 1. His facial features just seem less defined. 

Very solid game. Not worth the $100 price tag for the gold edition, but it frequently goes on sale for a very affordable $20-$30. So much content for such a little price. And only an additional $20 ($3.99 while on sale at the time of writing this,) for all of the old maps, including the bonus maps and the Patient Zero Campaign.

only issue i have with this game is that you have to be online constantly for score, that's right, if you disconnect in the middle of the mission because of your bad internet, you will have a pop up telling you you're not online and will not get a score or whatever. i beat absolution without having to be online for a score, why the   h e c k   do i have to be online for this? the score unlocks you stuff too and if you're offline then you lose access to stuff, RIP the people that play on a laptop and travel a lot.

there are bugs in the game, but thankfully they're kinda goofy and not game breaking, such as a corpse dancing after being knocked out or bush trimmers still moving after knocking out the gardener.

i love the story mission part of this game. if you hear one specific conversation, the game sets you up on track for a way to kill your target and there's like 3 or more every mission. kinda makes the game baby mode, but i feel like i'm somewhat a genius pulling them off so i don't know.

- Graphics. Not great, just ok. Even with all options maxed out. Looks kinda plastic-ish.
- Fairly well optimised.

- Misssions have multiple objectives/challenges. This is also a negative, though.

The negatives:

- Microstutters. Not sure what causes them, but they appear everywhere, even in cutscenes. Nowhere near gamebreaking though.
- Online mode. I keep getting disconncted with a message saying that the server is busy. In other words, nothing wrong on my side.
- Elusive targets. Just tried the current one. Got detected the moment I spawned into the game world, and failed. Can also fail due to connectivity issues, and you will NOT be able to try again! Who the fck is the retard who came up with this bs?
- Missions needs to be repeated over and over and over again if you want to complete all the challenges. Extends the ""life"" of the game, but also makes it extremely repetitive.

98,67006958,english,"[h1]Hitman 2[/h1]

is an instant classic really. It falls squarely in the category of, ""if I had only one game to play for the rest of my life."" As an added bonus, anything you owned from Hitman 1 is also given as an updated version in Hitman 2. In other words, if you own the previous game, it is also added to Hitman 2 with upgrades in gameplay and such, free of additional charge. That....is pretty awesome as you effectively end up with two full games and another DLC mission when you buy Hitman 2 (if you own Hitman 1). One definite negative however: all the different versions of this game, which are both confusing and inadequately described by Io (although fans have done a good job of breaking down the various versions and additions, in the forum.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Story isn't really Io Interactive's strong suit as it pertains to the latest two Hitman games. There is an overarching story, and that story sends you to the various maps/levels to find your targets and such. In that regard, the story does a nice job of pushing Agent 47 forward in his quest to find his past. However, while the story definitely serves to move the game forward, it's truly sparse. One caveat to the writing is the fact that there are many side stories written into each mission, and these present as goals you can choose to follow, which will net you different assassination and minor story opportunities. In general, the overarching story is pretty lite, but each individual mission is fleshed out incredibly well with background, motivation, and minor variations to the story in each mission based on your assassination choices.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

This really is where Hitman 2 is at. The gameplay is top tier for a stealth/blending game. You can dress up as pretty much everybody (and it's more than a little funny that Agent 47 can fit into any clothing big or small). One especially fun disguise was a ridiculous race mascot (which is tied to one of the side objectives).

Speaking of side missions/objectives, those really provide a lot of replay value in each main mission, giving you new areas to explore and different fun ways to assassinate your targets.

This is made possible by some of the greatest level design to be found in video games. The sheer diversity and options available in each mission to really make the game your own is pretty stunning and wildly impressive. There is pretty much nothing you can't do with a little gumption and ingenuity. 

To accompany that awesome level design, and in addition to side objectives, there is a vast array of personal objectives to accomplish, most of which are tied to fun and sometimes unique methods of finishing your assassinations. In addition to what I've already mentioned, use of environmental hazards will feature prominently in your repertoire as well.

The more things you accomplish during a mission, the more unlocks you will also earn, such as new starting points in each mission, drop spots for better mission gear, and actual better gear itself (including better weapons and disguises).

I feel you could easily replay each mission 8, 10, even 20 times and never really see everything you could possibly do in that mission....and never get bored of the endless possibilities.Between all the Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 missions, plus the Patient X missions, I would imagine you could easily surpass several hundred hours of gameplay with no real drop off other than your memorization of level design, which will of course make things easier for you.

I really can't think of anything negative to say about the gameplay. It's tight, responsive, and perfect for this game.

[h1]Audio and Graphics[/h1]

Graphically, I don't note a huge upgrade between Hitman 1 and 2. There is an upgrade in graphics, but it's not so profound as to have you wanting to compare both side by side. Hitman 2 is a nice looking game, which solid character models and fairly amazing level design from a graphics perspective as well. You won't get any screen tearing and such, and everything really looks just like their real life counterparts.

Dave Bateson does a great job of voicing Agent 47 in that same sort of sterile but masterful Doug Cockle sort of way. I can't help but chuckle at some of the tongue in cheek stuff that is said. I think in general though, everyone really did a great job voicing their characters, and a lot of effort went into humanizing the random people found in each mission as well. You certainly won't hear ""I used to be an adventurer like you..."" repeated ad nauseum lol...and actually, people respond vocally and appropriately to what is happening around them, from primary mission bosses to random Joe taking in a car race. There is no lack for random NPC conversations, and many of those are a lot of fun to just stand around taking in. 

Beyond voice acting, the game really sounds amazing. Everything is so nuanced and it really brings this world to life.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

I mean really....this is a game that deserves to be in your library and definitely deserves to be played. Personally, it's one of those games I actually will be leaving downloaded, so I can dive in whenever I get the hankering. Definitely a desert island game, so to speak. [b]Hitman 2 is an amazing game that should be in any video game enthusiasts library. Full price, half price, in the current Humble Choice...however you get this game, you won't be disappointed.[/b]

17,66882932,english,"Hitman is a stealth game about replayablity in giant sandboxes. You get a little over a dozen huge areas that you can dump hours and hours into, doing things different ways and trying to accomplish different things. The game always plays the same until you intervene, which may sound like a bad thing but it makes it interesting as you have to get to know the map to perform better. There's lots of challenges (like achievements) to get and unlock fun stuff.

Your approach can vary from sneaking around with a classy suit and taking your targets out silently (you will get scored for not being spotted, hiding the bodies, etc) if you want to show off, or blending in like a chameleon by taking disguises. You can also massacre the place which is a pretty good rush. There are 3 very distinct difficulties. Casual means you can do anything pretty easily, professional means you really should sneak around but you can still get out of bad situations without dying if you're careful. Master means you're actually going to be in some legit danger and blasting through enemies is hardly an option.

Actual assassination ranges from an infinite amount of possibilites with the various weapons, and quite a large amount of scripted world interactions or social interactions. For example, one of the easier assassinations is dressing up as a waiter, and serving your target a poisoned drink. Rat poison to follow them into the bathroom where they puke (and you can do as you please), or lethal poison if you can find it. There's also sedative poison.

Along with all this, one aspect I personally really enjoy is the fact you can just load up a map and ignore the objective completely. It's genuinely pretty fun to just toy with the AI. See what people say and how they react to various things. It's pretty funny.

THE ONLY DOWNSIDE... and it's kinda big.
This game sucks as a PC game. It probably sucks as a console game too though if I had to guess. Performance... is *BAD*. And I mean holy crap bad. I have an i9-9900k and a GTX 1080. Pretty decent right? I run 1080p with all my other settings minimum... and in the worst performing map (Mumbai) I struggle to get 50fps. Typically you should be able to get 70 if you have similar hardware.. honestly most the settings don't do anything performance-wise.
The mouse also feels.. bad. I think there's some small amount of acceleration you can't turn off, but I mitigated it by turning the in-game sensitivity UP, and my (out-of-game) mouse sensitivity DOWN.
It makes me not want to play as often anymore, but as you can see by my hours it still hasn't stopped me from having quite a bit of fun.",1586344689,1586344689,True,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False,76561198078982602,161,9,9744,0,9623,1600281978

Each Mission Has Been Carefully Crafted And There Are Thousands Of Ways To Complete Your Assignment. Challenges Will Make You Replay The Mission Over And Over To See More Content And Unlock More For Your Next Playthrough.
Sniper Assassins Give You A Break From The Patience Requiring Main Game To Have A More Fun, Pick-Up-And-Play Style Of Game. It Is Fun To Try And Master And Can Be Played In Co-Op Too.
Community Contracts Return And Are Fun To Play As You Try To Follow The Set Requirements For The Best Score.
Escalation Contracts Made By The Developers Have You Play The Same Mission Over And Over With A New Variable Added Each Time Changing The Way You Would Normally Play.
Elusive Targets Are New Targets In The Same Maps But There Is A Catch. You Only Have One Chance To Complete The Contract. If You Fail, You Can Never Try The Contract Again. This Makes You Play More Carefully And Think Ahead As Beating These Contracts Give You Interesting Rewards Such As Agent 47's Suits From Previous Games.
My Only Complaints Are The Performance And The DLC. This Game Runs Rather Poorly On My Otherwise Capable Machine. Obviously, This Doesn't Affect Everyone And I Can Still Enjoy The Game. Just Not Quite As Much. The DLC Is A Bit More Of An Issue.

But If You Do Buy Them All Then, Again, This Point Becomes No Longer Valid. The Game Also Requires Internet Access At All Times Or Else Progress Won't Be Saved.

59,66478840,english,"I thought this couldn't be as good as Blood Money. I was so wrong, it is WAY better. By far the best Hitman game.

Cons: 
- The story is a bit boring/confusing and some cutscenes aren't fully animated (more like pictures)
- All those versions you can buy are very confusing. I recommend buying the Gold Edition (unlocks all Hitman 2 content) and also either the GOTY Legacy Pack or the GOTY version of Hitman 2016. They both unlock the levels from Hitman 2016 in Hitman 2 (6 more great locations and many extra contracts). They all go on sale periodically so you can get the complete Hitman 2016 and Hitman 2018 experience for like 30€/$

Pros:
- Level design: those missions are just huge and beautiful, there is so much to find and try out everywhere
- Replayability: there is so much you can do after the first playthrough. Different ways to play the missions, challenges, many extra contracts, escalations, Sniper Assassin mode, Ghost mode (online vs other players)

4,65884179,english,"I gave up on the Hitman series and IO interactive after the flaming dumpster fire that went by the name Hitman Absolution graced us with its existence in 2013(?.).

What I didn't realize back then was that it was a mistake. Hitman 2016 reignited the franchise but I ignored the sound around it with a cold, hardened gaze into the distance but with a twinge of regret as I reminisced the good old days where garroting hapless digital denizens was acceptable in the mid 2000s.

Few more years go by and I finally caved in, looking to redeem my lost love for this specific variety of stealth gameplay and I must admit I that I couldn't have been more wrong back in 2016.

Hitman 2 is the true current gen experience I expected the series to evolve into back when I saw the end credits of Blood Money roll. No developer has stepped into the particular niche of social stealth yet the world is richer for it. Without anything to scratch the itch, the payoff was just so much better. Massive multi layered levels along with Agent 47's arsenal of bond-esque gadgets makes for some of the best darn fun I have had in ages.

Hitman isn't a franchise where you skulk the alley ways to perform a series of one button takedowns on unsuspecting foes till the game declares you win. Plans are made, plans are executed, things go awry, you roll with the punches, you learn from your mistakes and repeat till you can play out your favorite James Bond or John Wick fantasy in real time. There is never one ""correct way"" to do things. The only thing that matters is crossing your target off the checklist. You can choke, snipe, electrocute, throw them fools off a balcony, poison, drown, or even feed them to the hippos if the level allows for it and what is left is the feeling of pure bliss. Walking away from the scene of the crime with an air of indifference.

The mechanics convey that Agent 47 thinks quick and reacts quicker. You are a hyper aware modern day assassin who can chart the course of your enemies' demise in the blink of an eye.

If you've played any of the earlier games in the series (bar Absolution) then you will love this game. If you haven't tried any of the games in the series and wished that immersive sims went for a more systems driven approach over a pseudo rpg approach (like the modern Deus Ex games) or a deep narrative approach (Bioshock, the Thief reboot) then Hitman is for you.

-Very replayable.

I thought Hitman 2016 was unique and great but i did play it until i've had enough of the formula and that fatigue was sadly still there while playing Hitman 2 so i have no desire to replay the levels here like i did with that game. They've built these new games for the levels to be constantly replayed because of the episodic structure it used to follow and i'm at the point now where i'm craving a more traditional Hitman experience like Blood Money for example. Blood Money played like a normal game where you just go from level to level and once you have beaten the game you can go back to some previous levels and try other methods instead of replaying the same mission over and over again like these games want you to. I've also stated in my Hitman 2016 review how i wasn't a big fan of the opportunities feature because i felt like they've built the game around that feature which greatly restricts the freedom you're given compared a game like contracts or blood money, and that hasn't changed here sadly. Hitman 2 is still technically a great game just like i thought 2016 was because nothing's been changed however fun factor wise i have to give it a lower score.

Well, the game randomly crashes with no warning. I completed missions 1 - 3 before being unable to complete ""Mumbai"" because the game crashes before the objectives can be completed. A bit of research shows that this happens very often and on seemingly random occasion, on any map.

My real issue is the game is always ""online"". If you are not online, you cannot unlock new stuff (not counting levels). The format of the games levels is kind of annoying. You pay for Hitman 2 itself. Then basically pay for future levels. Don't get me wrong, the levels are VERY well done and fun. But it feels more like they are nickle and diming you for everything.

92,62814615,english,"Edit

I am changing my position from a conflicted to a resolute NO on the review. 
Besides the online-only games as a service BULLCRAP, there's another major problem with this game:

Hitman, at it's core is a puzzle game. 
I spent many many many hours re-playing Hitman: Blood money, finding out every different way to beat all the levels. 

I beat Hitman 2 once, and replayed a few levels. Then I was bored. 

Why?

Hitman 2 is a puzzle game, that gives you all the answers. 

In Blood Money, getting silent assasian was something you figured out.

In Hitman 2, it's something the game tells you how to do and gives you handy waypoints and everything.

It's no fun solving a puzzle that tells you how to solve it. 

It's sad, because there are many things that would have made this a good Hitman entry, good enough for me to have forgiven the games as a service BULLCRAP... but it's just not fun solving a puzzle when you already know the answer. 

/Edit
I am very conflicted as to weather I should select ""yes"" or ""no"" for this review. 

On one hand, this is an excellent entry into the Hitman franchise. 

On the other hand, there is online-only features. Essentially without an internet connection, you can play any level you want, but all your progress / unlocks / etc are restricted. 

I generally have an internet connection any time I'm gaming... but apparently the same can't be said for the game's servers. 

Paying customers shouldn't be punished by your anti-piracy attempts. 

It's a shame, if it weren't for this online-only BULLCRAP I'd have nothing but good things to say about this title.",1580587296,1584527369,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198045989300,201,46,3514,0,853,1581555789

Also, unlike Hitman 1, this title features a crashing bug due to a compatability issue with some NVIDIA cards. Although a fix for this is available online, it is a third party patch and, to date at the time of writing, I/O Interactive have done nothing to resolve this bug themselves.

[h1]The Lowdown[/h1]

EDIT: March 9, 2020. Based on my over 257 hours, i can recommend it. I haven't encountered more bugs, but i did very much enjoy it.
I have to say that i nearly deleted this game because of the game-breaking bugs. And don't anyone DARE tell me there aren't any, or that my 6,000 dollar dual-system rig is at fault, because it isn't. 
That being said [b][i]never hire the testers you had again.[/i][/b] [u]I recommend a good firing squad.[/u] The constant random crashes were too much to bare. I couldn't find a solution, especially to the very first crash i had which showed a specific code: ""The instruction at 0x00000001415EF2C4 referenced memory at 0x0000000000000D33. The memory could not be written."" Would be nice if Google stopped it's Marxist bullsht and allowed us to search for things that we need. I couldn't find any references even with Bing and Duck Duck Go to the aformentioned error code. All subsequent crashes were directly to desktop with no message, and no warning - other than the game freezing for a few seconds, and then crashing.

[h1]The Infuriating[/h1]

One thing that truly p!$$ed me off with the quality of the work, was no animation for the cut-scenes. All they were - for those that haven't played it yet - were basically shots of scenes (akin to mannequin challenges that actors do sometimes) with the audio of the actors. I can understand trying to save money, but this is absolutely ridiculous. As an actor, if i knew that my voice-overs of my characters weren't animated at all, it would be enough for me to do something very bad, to put it lightly. If you kept THAT kind of image detail, and animated the characters, I would gladly give 50% of my income for you guys to do that. You did it in the previous Hitman (albeit without the level of picture quality in the Hitman 2 cut-scenes), so why not this one? The only animated cutscene you guys had, was for the Golden Handshake ""prologue"" after the ending of the main story. And that was done using in-game animations.

[h1]The Enjoyable[/h1]

As far as the good work is concerned the Art Director, and his team responsible for the Mood, and the whole Audio team should be given statues in their honor. And of course the actors - even though we never got to see their animated characters in this game. 

Some amusing points: I don't know if this was the reason for doing this, but using Ave Maria, as was used in the Hitman film, was a nice touch. I don't know if this was an intentional reference, but, for those of us that understood the correlation, it was highly enjoyable. 

Another i suppose amusing - for lack of a better term - the art direction for the chapters in Hindustan were done quite well; the disgusting environment they live in, and the accurate depiction of the Hindu movie director and their attitudes etc.
My favorite location was the last one, on the island. I guess I'm a sucker for castles.

[h1]BUGS[/h1]

Now on to the minor bugs (as many as i can remember accurately): one bug in the castle location is when you are hiding behind a column near the helicopter area, and you're listening to the male and female(?) custodians talk. it seem that at random occasions, when you pant the camera while hiding behind the support column right beside them (the one that is in line with the tail end of the helicopter, the male audio seems to go haywire, and you end up hearing him like he's standing right beside your ear inside a bathroom. Only when SHE starts talking and he makes his last(?) response, does the environmental positioning of the audio go back to normal (as if they are actually outside).

Another bug was the guy reading a newspaper on a bench in Whittleton, near the garbage(?) workers. The guy on bench has his @$$ hanging out the back of the bench.

(Before i forget, as i write this sentence, i started playing the prologue, Golden Handshake. When i tried putting in a body in the laundry bin of the ground floor restroom, the cleaner ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL was alerted (around 50%) to what i was doing. The threat went down as soon as hit the button to hide the body.)

Not sure if this is a bug, but certain NPCs aren't affected by coin tosses. Even if it's two body lengths away. Not sure if certain NPCs are programmed to ignore everything... Same with over flowing a sink. Certain NPCs that are on the same side of a room as the sink will get alerted, but ones on the opposite side of the room, won't be alerted - even if they are directly across from the door that leads to the sink.

Another thing that frustrated me was during Whittleton Creek, if you place an explosive in mole hole in yard of the woman that the target visits, it doesn't count toward the Achievement - it could be because i didn't follow the steps for the mole holes. If this is intentional, then maybe you should put in a separate Achievement like ""Early Mole Gets the hole"" (BTW, the Mood team really hit it out of the park with the whole town, especially the party that one house was having - perfect choice of music and clothing).

[h1]ATTENTION: BUGS 1b[/h1]
RE: NY bank

[b]UPDATE:[/b] I just reached the point where i had a third body in the private chambers, and even though it's  TWO WAY MIRROR, one of the female NPCs is horrified by a body that she's not suppose to see - so i had to subdue her too, adding yet another needless thing that needed to be done. Even so, this ruined the Silent Assassin rating. But hey, needing to save money by not adding animation to the cutscenes, was more important, right?

[b]UPDATE 1b:[/b] just poisoned second target in floor below Athena (unfortunately i only had lethal poison). And when i went even further downstairs, i heard him drop his glass, through the floor. That's another audio bug.

[b]UPDATE 1c:[/b] Audio bug in the employee room on the floor above the ground floor (upper left hand side of the plaque that says 'Safe Deposit Vault'). One of the sentences of the male NPC suddenly sounded like it was coming from a telephone, then in his next response the soundscape of the audio goes back to normal.

[b]UPDATE 1d:[/b] Ruby Red's audio goes haywire and her last response to the guy that recognizes her sounds like it's coming from a telephone. Not sure if this is a bug with the panning of the camera. ""No, No, i'm just not who you think i am"" is the sentence - I reloaded, and did it again, and the audio on that sentence still goes haywire.

[b]UPDATE 1e:[/b] The area on Lv 2 with the locker & propane tank - the metallic gold square object that is suppose to be on the wall, is just hanging in the air.

[b]UPDATE 1e:[/b] You have two white guys on Level 3 with P@ki accents. This is obviously a mistake. But if it was intentional, it's very anti-white.

[b]UPDATE 1f:[/b] gaining access to Athena's room as the I.T. guy gets broken, if you have her secretary woken up by a guard. The indicator is still there, but you can't talk to him. The mission remains unfinished.

[b]UPDATE 1g:[/b] Level 1, second room to the right of the VIP Clients. The door there right beside the two guard guarding the hallway, has its graphics distorted. Like an incomplete grey box where you only see a bright window toward the top. When you enter or exit the room, the graphics in the opposite area are restored, but the graphics of the area you just left become grey boxed again.

[b]UPDATE 1h:[/b] Trying to flood the security room with either Chloroform or emetic rat poison doesn't do anything. You pour them in, and nothing happens. It seems only something lethal poison the room. I think you people get the point, There's  A LOT more, but Steam won't allow more text.

66,64734306,english,"The previous game, Hitman 2016, was such a lovely improvement, both in terms of game play mechanics and graphics, over the older Hitman games. Hitman 2 continues along that tradition, including a host of minor but very pleasant improvements. The new maps are really awesome, and encourage exploration. The new gear opens up completely new methods. Your imagination is the only limit. The inclusion of the old Hitman 2016 maps is also very welcome, and gives us new ways to replay those old maps with the newer gear.

There's also two new multiplayer modes: three new sniper coop maps, and a ghost mode which is available in two of the main maps. The sniper coop is fun to play with friends. Ghost mode is a bit of a missed opportunity, and there are some annoying aspects to it, although it can be fun if you play it with the right people. Either way, I like that IO Interactive is trying to find ways to experiment with different multiplayer modes for Hitman, and I am sure they are learning from this experience to make even better multiplayer modes for their next game. I wish there was also a genuine regular (non-sniper) coop mode on the main maps, which could be really fun too.

The only complaints I'd have is that whilst Hitman 2016 included a lot of different missions for each map, this appears not to be the plan for Hitman 2, which is a real shame.

22,64404203,english,"I've recently completed my first run through of the original main campaign. It was short and sweet - it only took 2 days to finish. The globe-trotting assassin Agent 47 is back. I can say that Hitman 2 is a fantastic game with a great campaign. It's just good Hitman - a lot of paths to get to targets, a lot of stealth, and you can even turn it into an action game if you're good enough. There are so many options to what you can do, and if you fail, you can always reload a save (remember to savescum).

The story is interesting and decently written, especially in levels. The levels themselves are filled with unique story missions that help you uncover the secrets behind your targets and their organizations. Each one has a unique kill that will probably leave you undetected. One will have you dressing up as a member of a Bollywood film crew and accidentally turning up the big fans in one of the scenes to blow the actors off a roof. Another will have you as disguising yourself as a Master of Ceremonies and trapping your target in a burning effigy. The overarching main storyline has a lot of cinematic sequences in between levels that really flesh Agent 47's relationship out with his contractors and his partner in crime, Diana Burnwood.

The levels are intricately designed, with many secrets to find and places to go. There are many rooms you can go in and paths to get to your targets. Tall grass and cover in the levels are well-placed, giving you a means to sneak past enemies to reach your targets. If you know the map well enough, you can practically go anywhere.

Now that I'm finished at 11 hours, what else is there to do? There is a whole lot. Hitman is a game that focuses on *repetition* of its levels. Once you finish a level, you can go back and do it again, this time in a more masterful way. As you unlock mastery levels for a mission by retrying it, you get more options as to where you start, what things you're carrying and where your agency can hide items. You don't even have to repeat levels in this case - the Hitman GOTY DLC has all of the maps from the game before it, but remade to fit the new game. There's also multiplayer (Ghost mode), in which you repeat a level but with other assassins racing with you to get the most kills, and Sniper Mode, in which you stay in a sniper spot and kill targets that way (like the Hitman sniper mobile game).

Hitman 2 is a very well-made game and a good sequel to the Hitman series. It's one of the best assassination games I've played, and replaying levels makes you better, which makes you better at the game, thus making it more fun.

26,64389317,english,"A nice update to the Hitman reboot. New maps, additions to the first game's storyline, new capabilities with tools and the briefcase function, and somewhat better graphics. If you liked the first of this new storyline of Hitman games, then you'll like this one as well. The maps are fun, the story is passable, and the constant updates with ""escalation missions"" and contracts were actually enjoyable. The cut scenes for the story were surprisingly lackluster after the last game, but I didn't care much. The focal point for me isn't the story but rather the open-world nature of the missions. I really enjoy having the freedom to do whatever I want in order to achieve the end-goal of terminating a target. 

The game isn't perfect, and I do have several complaints. The first being that I was frustrated that Square Enix seems to be offering less content for more money (in addition to the 'DLC'). They left everything from Hitman 1 in this game and assumed that they could include it as part of this game that you pay for. As someone who already purchased and played the previous game, that did not appeal to me. Furthermore, you have to buy the whole ""season"" in order to get the maps, and you can't play some of the sniper missions (and the last two maps) unless you purchase the DLC. I would have much preferred a full game with an acceptable price. 

Overall, it's a solid 8/10 game, but don't pay full price for it. I got mine during the Steam Summer Sale of 2019 and it was only $20.",1583119211,1583119211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198263156885,59,15,3044,0,1813,1598572390

But there's more! I played Hitman since the first. I was obsessed with Bloodmoney and I hated Absolution. That said, I find this installment so Hitman, it makes me forget all about Absolution. The levels are open and incredibly detailed once again, and their replayability is unequalled. There's just so much going on in every location. The AI creates a complex simulation where it's just fun to mess around doing random stuff and see what is going to happen. Hitman isn't just some stealth game.

91,64055395,english,"HITMAN 2 is a 3rd person stealth assassination action game. It's a primarily singleplayer game with some minor multiplayer features. The game is set in contemporary times around a forgettable storyline that mainly serves as an excuse to fly a bald man across the globe and have him (you) murder fools in a wide variety of settings. The game plays it mostly straight, although it doesn't take itself 100% seriously.

Core gameplay consists of navigating around fairly large, open levels, and finding ways of taking out your target(s), preferably without getting spotted. Each level is highly detailed and contains many things to discover, including a lot of different ways of killing people. You're expected to replay a level many times to complete various challenges and unlock new tools and weapons. This isn't a bad thing. The levels are generally well-designed and encourage exploration.

HITMAN 2 comes with 5 levels (4 large ones and 1 smaller one). There are also 2 paid DLC levels (1 large, 1 small). If you own HITMAN (2016), then you can play all of its levels in HITMAN 2 free of charge. If you don't own HITMAN then you can also buy these levels for HITMAN 2 as DLC. This is nice because it's a lot of extra content at no (or little) cost, but it also highlights how little HITMAN 2 has actually changed from HITMAN. It's basically the same game, with a slightly more polished experience. HITMAN 2 offers nothing new in terms of gameplay, just new levels. For this reason I feel HITMAN 2 is an expensive game.

My main gripe with the game comes from the way it handles ""online"". For starters, the game has forced always-online connectivity (and DRM). If you refuse to go online, the game offers a degraded experience in which you can only play the main missions and you cannot unlock anything. I can't think of any reason why it should do this. I currently have 150+ hours between HITMAN and HITMAN 2, and I have never used any of their multiplayer features. Forcing me to be always online makes no sense.

My second problem with ""online"" is the existence of time-sensitive content. This is a type of cancer that infects a lot of AAA games, and HITMAN 2 is no exception. The game has something called ""elusive targets"", which are basically just missions that you can only play during a certain (real-world!) time period. It's a cute idea and actually makes sense in the context of the game world. However, this type of content in general is problematic for two main reasons. First of all, it removes your ability to play at your own pace. You can't just put the game down for a month, because you'll miss out on some of its content. Secondly, if you're unlucky enough to buy the game 6 months or a year after launch, you'll already have missed out on a bunch of stuff. You'll pay the same amount of money for less of the experience. Again, keeping in mind that HITMAN 2 is a singleplayer game, all of this online stuff is just a bunch of nonsense.

Still, even though it suffers from some of my least favorite trends in modern gaming, I'll ultimately recommend HITMAN 2 because the gameplay is extremely solid and you can have hours upon hours of fun with it.

Hitman 2 is a stealth action game with heavy emphasis on executing the perfect hit. It represents the seventh entry in the Hitman game series, and has been developed by the company IO Interactive and published by the company Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.

[i] Pro & contra: [/i]

++ Art of murder. Excellent level and mission design provide a broad range of assassination options for the various targets. Some ‘accidents’ allow the player to enjoy the dark humour of the situation.

+ Practice makes perfect. Replaying the same levels for alternate objectives and challenges. Observing patterns of movement is the key to success. Additional modes in form of elusive target, sniper assassination, and pvp ghost enrich the sandbox portfolio.   

o While the plot is not as engaging as in Hitman: Absolution (2012), I actually found myself interested in what is going on. Furthermore, it is a direct sequel to Hitman (2016), and it improves on the story telling.

o The model of an episodic distribution of the game content over several months, as introduced in Hitman (2016), has been removed.

- Extensive weapon modifications like in Hitman: Blood Money (2006) are not possible. I really miss my customized Silverballers.

-- Our benevolent overlord, the superb DRM. I am overjoyed to see that the developer and publisher have decided to shackle the gaming community to those ‘secure’ servers once more, based on the concept of the incorporated 3rd-party DRM called Denuvo Anti-Tamper. Let us rejoice! 

[I] Summary: [/i]

Overall, I enjoy the game in terms of sandbox and varied gameplay. It represents yet another well-executed expansion of the Hitman franchise. Nevertheless, the gaming experience is overshadowed by the implemented DRM. 

Recommended for fans of bar codes and sandbox enthusiasts.

24,54267641,english,"Graphics were very clearly downgraded from Hitman 2016 (despite annoying claims otherwise; check out comparison videos), which I found very disappointing. It's not BAD looking, but I would say sub par for 2018. Colors look more washed out, textures and hair look more pixellated, etc. I would say the gameplay itself was slightly improved upon, but largely unchanged. The cutscenes in the campaign were made extremely lazily, using still images with a voice over in lieu of actual animation, like they used in Hitman 2016. I've also encountered a few crashes and miscellaneous bugs during gameplay, including a visual glitch that causes some reflective surfaces to basically flash bright, multicolored strobe lights capable of hurting my eyes (even with reflections completely turned off).

If you're a fan of the series, you'll probably be disappointed in the quality of the design. Only pick this up if it's extremely discounted.

46,63782692,english,"This is a solid game and I do enjoy playing it. So why I don't recommend it? There are exactly 2 major issues that stop me from recommending this game to anyone. Ever. 

First - online only. This game is a on death-row of undefined date, and shutdown is not a question of ""if"" but ""when"". There is absolutely no guarantee that I could play this game in 5 or 10 years. And ""offline"" mode is a joke, as it disables all and any progression, makes AI behave weirdly for no reason and in general provides inferior experience to online version for no good reason. And let's not forget about servers clearly being not on reliable side, as not once I had them refuse my mission ending of stupidly hard challenge I set for myself and spent 2 hours doing on Master without saves just to see it freeze on the mission ending screen because server didn't answer.

Second issue is timed content. I see no good reason for timed content for a singleplayer game. Elusive target concept in itself is fine, but making it literally one-time for a limited time is horrendous implementation. Simply putting them on rotation is easy solution, but god forbid giving players ability to replay some of content in the game that let's be honest, don't have that much content to begin with and heavily relies on replayability. Bought game now? Welp, see a long string of missions you would never play. I, for example, play when I can and have mood for it, and usually it does not align with elusive targets, so in the end I just decided to ignore entire part of the game as if it does not exists.

Those are the 2 reasons why I would not recommend anyone buy this game. But if you're fine with not being able to play this game in foreseable future and like to see a long list of content you would never be able to play - sure, go ahead. Game is pretty good, story is on a stupid side, gameplay is rock-solid, menus are horrendous, music is forgettable, handholding is real. Missions are a drag.

55,63758492,english,"What should you know about Hitman 2 before spending your money? If you don't like repeating levels multiple times to clear tasks, then avoid this game. If you get easily frustrated by figuring out environmental puzzles to find, reach, and eliminate your targets, then avoid this game. If you're looking for a third-person shooter where you can just blast enemies with no thought, then avoid this game. Hitman 2 is about creeping carefully out of sight (unless being seen for a moment is useful as bait) and finding creative ways to kill the assigned target (and, ideally, just that target). Putting a bullet in their head works well enough, but the best kills are the ones that don't look like kills at all. Naturally, those are often the ones that require the most setup and patience to achieve.

What else should you know about Hitman 2? If you haven't played (or don't have) Hitman (2016), then the GOTY Legacy Pack should be your first DLC purchase for Hitman 2. This will add all of the content from the previous game, but with the updated graphics and gameplay elements (such as finding concealment in grassy areas) of this game. This make Hitman 2 an even longer game with expanded replay value and an uninterrupted story.

They have managed to keep the idea, the mechanism and the dynamics of the previous games but adding some very good improvements and IA tricks.

It is a game to enjoy little by little, trying to get all the challenges (which some are quite complicated) that is completely worth it, no matter the price.

However, this obvious completionist-appeal is also where the game drops the biggest, fattest ball of them all: If you own Hitman 1, you can play all the levels from that game within Hitman 2, with access to the new features such as custom contracts as well as some new gear... but they DON'T carry over your PROGRESS, which means that if you're a serious completionist and already 100%'ed Hitman 1, prepare to have your OCD continuously bug you about those not-yet-filled progress-bars attached to the levels from that game in THIS game. Seriously, how hard would it be to just let you carry over your save?!? Oh, but as a closing thumbs-up, I like how the Escalation-contracts in this game are only THREE steps - they tend to be a lot more reasonable and realistically COMPLETEABLE than the 5-stage Escalations from the first game, which tended to become downright psychotic by the time you reached Step 5.",1581935337,1581935337,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,76561197978797255,391,45,3707,0,1043,1583298189

72,50755641,english,"I have been wanting to write a good review for Hitman 2, for some time now, because I think it's such a great game. With all those hours I have spent completing the entire game, with all it's levels, challenges and achievements, I want to try to share some of it with whoever wants to read this. This review is also based on the full game, with everything included. The first part is mostly about my experience, and not so much about the game, so if you just wanna read about the game check for the headline THE GAME.

First of all. I started Hitman 2 after completing everything for Hitman 1. Every single level achievement, challenge and escalations, so I knew the game very well. I got a bit frustrated first, because all of the levels for Hitman 1, with it's achievements and challenges were also put into Hitman 2. It's not that bad really, if you come directly from hitman 1. For example. The level in Italy, I had spent alot of time perfecting and being able to do on Professional mode (Master for this game), so I knew it perfectly. All in all, I managed to finish everything related to the legacy levels pretty fast, and it was also fun to see how well I actually knew the legacy levels and the game. This is actually a big part of the game to be honest.

First of all you learn the level. The depht of it and how you play the levels depends on how much time you spend on it really. Every level is doable, but completing the levels on master is what truly makes you a master of the game. Earlier I had spent my time doing the levels at professional. It has the right difficulty, it has cameras, and the npcs aren't that stupid either. Later on I realised it was best to just start new levels on Master, because then I could, in my own way, figure out and learn the level, without getting help from the Mission Stories.

THE GAME:
I'm not gonna go much into the history of the game, but more of the mechanics. You are a Hitman, one of the best assassins in the World and your job is to assassinate different targets at different locations. There are 3 difficulties: Casual (Easy), Professional and Master. Depending on how you wanna play, you pick one of those...but as a first timer Professional is good pick.

Casual has not so smart NPCs; their reaction time isn't so good. You also don't get cameras in the level. Proffesional and Master are much alike, but on Master you can only save once per level. It's not that bad, when you get to know a level, but you have to plan much ahead. There have been times where I have been lying in my bed, looking at the roof and thinking about how I should beat one of the Hitman levels. It just comes to you after a while.

For the full version of the game you get all the legacy levels (there are 6 of them) and 6 levels for hitman 2. There are also a few extra levels for most of the levels, including escalations. I'll get to that later.

INGAME:
Your job is to assassinate targets in each level, and there are many ways to do this. When you learn the levels, you learn where different items are, you learn what you can do or not can do, and where your disguises are approriate or not. The hardest way of finishing a level is to do this with a Silent Assassin rating. It means you finish a level without being recognized as a criminal in any way or people has not seen you do anything bad.

The even harder way of completing a level is to do it as a Silent Assassin...a perfect run, in your suit, and without a disguise. This makes the enforcer of the level (guards that can see through disguises) to see you as a criminal almost all the time. There are ofc some safe zones for going suit only, but to complete a level it is required to move into a bit more unsafe areas.

ESCALATIONS:
Gonna explain this really quick. You start at level 1 out of 3/5. As you finish the levels, they will get harder and require more things done, to complete the level. I have felt pretty often the unfairness of these escalations, and can remember alot of times, where I just finished it with guns blazing. It requires alot of patience sometimes, and it's not always easy.

SUM UP:
Hitman 2 has sooo much you can do, and so many different ways of doing it. The game has humour, and sometimes you see hilarious and incredible things. The game has alot of things that requires alot of patience, especially if you wanna finish everything. Many of these things requires pure skills, and the knowledge you have gained by playing the levels.

Playing nicely, and perfectly is a part of this game that can be hard sometimes, and I can assure you that your patience will have a peak point at some point, where your mind just crashes...and you end up just shooting every single person in the level. It sometimes makes you feel a bit better after, even if it's bloody and violent.

I recommend Hitman 2, and all the games before it. I've played Hitman since the first game, and it has always been something that has facinated me. The game works, and even though the old ones has worse mechanics and graphcs, it can still be entertaining. For now, I think the newest Hitman games have been better, because they have the right mechanics, the graphics have been good, the story has been fine, but most importantly. Everything seem to work really good. Ofc all games have bugs in some ways, but I have seen very few of them in the Hitman, and Hitman 2 games.

The level design is really well done and the levels are really precious to look at. This game looks polished and you will notice it from the amount of details it has. I never got bored of playing this game, you always have something to do.

36,62258401,english,"This is a great Hitman game and if you like other Hitman games or the concept of the game you'll probably like this too. I'll talk about the good things right now and the next paragraph will be things I didn't like. The game has good map design for the most part, is challenging on the hardest difficult, has many ways to go about a mission, plenty to do in each mission if you go for the all the challenges, and plenty of tools at your disposal. There are also ""escalations"" where you do a set of missions on a map you've already played but each mission in the escalation gets progressively harder. There are also ""elusive targets"" that come around every once in a while. Should you choose to accept the mission, you will have only one shot (no saves either) to eliminate the target in a certain time frame before the mission expires. DLC also adds plenty of more missions to the game.

While this game is great there are things that could've been better. First, even though I have a solid connection the game occasionally disconnects from the server. Another thing is this game uses way more keys than it needs to. They could've easily condensed the functions for the ""e"", ""f"", and ""g"" keys into 2 or perhaps even one key or at least allow you to assign the same key for multiple functions. Another thing is the sensitivity, it's way too high and doesn't allow you to go down enough. The lowest the game allows you to go is 0.5 in game sensitivity, which was okay for standard movement but bad for aiming with a non scoped weapon. I had to put my mouse DPI down to 200 to be accurate. They should allow you to go lower and have different sensitivities (one standard, one aiming, one for using a scope). My final gripe is that areas where a camera can see you should always be enabled (at least on professional difficulty). When you use instinct you can see these areas and for a period of time you can see it even when not using instinct. I cannot tell you how many times I've done something perfectly just to get spotted by a camera and have to restart because I forgot to use my instinct to check, really annoying. Besides these things though the game is great and the first two aren't so bad once you get used to it and take the extra time to configure your sensitivity.",1579749373,1579749373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198983529448,2,1,8896,0,3057,1597965099

- Simplified graphics (compare this to Absolution and you'll see that for yourself)

A return to a large sandbox style play area that is large enough for lots of exploration and possible execution methods, but not too large as to confuse and overwhelm the player. 

Graphically, it uses the same exact engine as Hitman 2016 with no noticeable improvements, but that's alright because the game looks very solid. The graphics are bright and colorful and the vistas you explore feel full of life. I do think the engine is showing a bit of its age though. Hitman 2016 actually took a bit of a step backwards from Hitman Absolution in terms of graphical detail, but made up for it in the much larger areas and scale. But for the next game, I would prefer a new engine that advances the series forward. 

The new levels are just as great as the first game. Obviously some are better than others, my personal favs are Vermont which is the perfect Hitman setting. Taking place in a picturesque suburbian neighborhood where you can disguise yourself as everyday workers like mailmen. Stuff like that is quintessentially Hitman, subverting what we associate with normalcy and the comforts of modern society. The other stand-out level is the Maldives level which is bright and colorful and filled with rich tourists enjoying their opulent leisure time. Just doing what you do with the backdrop of these vistas is what makes Hitman so magical and wonderful.

Long story short, if you loved Hitman 2016, you'll love this game because it's just more of the same amazing game. I do hope Hitman 3 doesn't follow in the same footsteps however, we do need greater improvements moving forward, because I do think this engine is starting to show its age. However in the meantime, you'll spend countless hours playing and replaying these awesome missions.",1578514213,1578514213,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197965231440,101,1,1027,0,1027,1578512969

50,61252192,english,"This is the closest thing to a James Bond game that the industry has ever made.  You go to huge events your not supposed to be at and mingle around, try to find or eves drop some intel, steal a persons cloths to get into more areas your not supposed to be, and kill your targets in countless gratifying ways.  

Guards actually treat your tress passing in a realistic manner.  They don't instantly open fire but instead view you as some idiot who got lost and tell you to follow them out of the restricted area.  Intel about your identity has to be actually passed on and if things get crazy enough security can go on full lock down and sweep the area in a search party.

If playing this game turn off hints, turn off the x-ray vision you already get a mini map, and turn off the thing that practically tells you how to kill a target in a certain way.  Its much more rewarding to figure it out for yourself and play on professional.  If you want to just go on a murder spree play on the lower difficulty but if you want a real challenge play professional and with what I said above.

Is it the prettiest game? No, Did they have to cut the cut scenes from the first season in season 2 and replace them with still shots? Yes.  Does everyone in Season 1 sound British? Yea.  If you have to make cuts to a game for budget reasons those the best spots.  No Jesper Kyd makes me sad but the new guys music is good too.  

All that good being said the elusive target system can piss right off.  No your not going to encourage me to keep playing the game more regularly with it.  I'm actually going to ignore and pretend it doesn't exist.  Don't tell me how to spend my time with your game.  Your not my annoying Long Island Guild leader from WoW  16 years ago.

34,61005748,english,"I've played all of the Hitman games all the way till the beginning. When Absolution came out, I was just so disappointed of how backwards it felt. Maybe because Blood Money set the bar for the series, that the game following it was going to be worse.

When Hitman released in 2016, it felt like IO knew what their fans wanted : more Hitman Blood Money. And so it was, even more Blood Money where you had complete freedom on how to kill your target.

Hitman 2 is evolution for the series. The game now has a more Spy/James Bond feel to it but I think it works really well for it. You feel like James Bond, sneaking around with the spy-like music playing. Or you can go guns blazing killing everyone in your path (though you will give zero mission ratings). The game is meant to be played multiple times, trying different ways, achieving different goals in eliminating your target. Hitman 2 offers the real freedom that was given in Blood Money and goes even further with new Mission Stories that give you opportunities to get in close to your target. I also like how you have control on how difficult you want it to be, whether it'd be limiting your HUD to difficulty selection. I can't say they have redeemed the series since Absolution was the only bad egg in the basket but they are definitely going in the right direction. As a long time player and fan, I'm looking forward to the future of the series (hopefully next one is Co-op as hinted by the last Haven mission).",1577816017,1577816017,True,2,0,0.518716573715209961,0,True,False,False,76561197995976482,376,99,1265,0,715,1578118496

Is this game fun? Yes.
Is this fun consistent? No.
Buy it on sale, read why below

I got Hitman 2 on sale at some point, then picked up the Hitman 1 missions on another sale so I for sure got my monies worth here, but to anyone who paid full price for all of this as it was coming out I feel your pain. The maps are not equal in quality and you will for sure straight up ignore some maps after you've finished them. I wish this game was made all at once and not as a service model. In theory it makes great sense for this character and setting, but considering how Hitman 2 basically is a fix for Hitman 1 is just feels slimy. I tried playing Hitman 1 after getting used to 2 and quickly uninstalled because this game before quality of life tweaks was just horrible. 

I have 3 general complaints about this game. Two major, and one minor. 

Major: The hand holding 
Hitman is at its best when the game just lets you do what you want and does not try to nudge you too far to do anything. This franchise has a feature where they will essentially point you in the direction of about 3-6 paths you can take to eliminate targets. These result is sometimes fun and elaborate deaths, and others in your typical ""Must have been an accident"" type of scenario. I hate that this feature is turned on be default. It really takes away some of the fun of just figuring out things on your own, and feels more like a carnival assassination ride. What makes it very frustrating is that when Agent 47 is near the start of one of these paths, the game will give you a big pop up and go ""HEY, PLAYER! CHECK OUT WHAT THIS DUDE IS SAYING! IT COULD MAYBE LEAD TO KILLING ONE OF YOUR TARGETS!""  It felt like the game was just encouraging me to do things their way and nothing else. Let me be clear, if this feature was turned off by default I'd have no issue with it. But since it comes turned on on the lower difficulty settings, I have beef. 

I honestly think I would have enjoyed Hitman 2 much more without this feature, in fact I know I would have. How? Because when I bought the missions from Hitman 1 I set the difficulty to master and didn't allow the game to hand hold me until I got tired of trying to figure out the paths myself, and I had a way better time! The last mission of Hitman 1 I was able to figure out an obscure way of killing a target, which wasn't a predetermined carnival ride, and it felt so good seeing that little prompt appear telling me I figured something out on my own but the game recognized as a legit kill they programmed into the game. 

The Maps
Holy god some of these maps are garbage. Some of them are fantastic and have plenty of options, and those maps I have replayed over and over again. When the maps work they are a joy to reply and explore. I probably have at least 10 hours on one of the maps from Hitman 2. But the others? Hot garbage. Looking back at Hitman: Blood Money from memory, the only mission that I remember hating was Murder of Crows. Hated that mission with a passion. The rest I liked enough. Fast forward to 2019, and while of course, overall these maps have improved from Blood Money, some just haven't improved as much as they should. 

One of these maps takes place in Colorado where a milita has taken over a small farm property, and it could not be a more boring map if it tried. Its flat and bland. There's one main building that is a basic 2 story house with a basement and that's it. The only thing you can do on this map are those carnival rides, or maybe just pop your targets in the head as they're walking around. 

Expanding slightly, but some of these maps also have cool little items or disguises for you to find but then nothing to do with them. Maybe I'm asking for too much but if I find a baseball uniform and a bat in the middle of a high security area, I feel like that should lead to some sort of other unique interaction or scenario instead of just giving me a checkmark for finding it. 

Minor: Throwable weapons
In this Hitman franchise, Agent 47 can pick up literally anything and use it kill or knockout targets. Honestly its pretty funny, and makes sense for a world class assassin to be able to go more with a soda can than most people can do with a knife. However it really can take away the challenge of a game sometimes when you can just knock out targets from about 40 feet with anything not nailed down to the floor. This is more of just a personal grudge and not really something that makes or breaks the game but thought was worth mentioning.

56,60660456,english,"A word of warning before accepting my thumbs-up as a go-ahead to buy the game: it requires a constant internet connection. Was this a good idea? absolutely not. In a game that features no co-op multiplayer, there is no reason this game should be always online. If co-op was introduced (all maps are contained, with no loading screens at all, so other than breaking immersion, I see no issue. But then again, when DOESN'T co-op in a game break at least a little immersion?) then I could support always online. But always-online for this game (even though it's a damn good game) is a bad move.

Carrying on: holy crap is this game great. It's not exactly the stand-alone Predator game I wanted, there's no invisibility device or shoulder-mounted plasma cannon, but it's the ""The Most Dangerous Game"" game that I see in my night-before-Christmas happy-wet-dream. A linear story where the levels are non-linear sandboxes full of however much or however little mayhem you could think of. Truly the sandbox of all sandboxes. Guns, explosives, poison, melee weapons galore- when you first boot it up your inventory may be small, but after an hour you should at least have a few cool new things unlocked. 

Let's summarize:
The Good - 
sandbox
elusive targets
sniper game mode
tons of weapons and other items to unlock
making waterfowl scary before Untitled Goose Game

The Bad -
I am completely confused by all the things I can buy. I own everything the game has to offer, but there's still options to purchase?
slightly wonky detection - I often see the detection bar flickering when I'm behind a solid wall
sandbox is sandbox, but like Skyrim's stealth archer, having fun is at your own risk. Stealthy-sneaky stuff is what the entire franchise was built on, but aren't you tired of being nice? Don't you want to go ape-shit?

To expand on the Bad, buying things is far from self explanatory. I don't understand what I've bought. Since I owned H1 GOTY, I got all of that stuff, including the patient 0 story and everything else. But I still have the option to buy the Patient 0 expansion. I bought the standard edition, and, expecting the $99 bundle ($25 when I bought it, thank you Christmas) to have more stuff in it, I bought that. All it did was give me the expansion pass (currently sitting at $12, priced down from $40. Wasted $12 but I ain't mad, it was Christmas money). I still have the option to buy the ""silver to gold"" upgrade, but like... what else is in that? if anything at all? Do I not own everything? Do I own everything? Everything, far as I can tell, is unlocked. Locations, Sniper locations, gear, outfits, etc, it's all there. So why can I still buy stuff for the game?

Detection one IS self explanatory. It is explained above. Bug. Plain and simple. Not a big deal, doesn't happen often, a little wiggle of WASD fixes it in a jiff.

Sandbox not sandy and boxy enough. Whipping out an AR is obviously not the smartest move, and why should it be? You are literally the world's best assassin, people pay the ICA extra to have you specifically put on the job, you specialize in making it look like an accident and never being seen. Well, canonically, that's who you are. But, you're a gamer, you're here to kill and see blood. Sadly, between game mechanics, limited ammo capacities, no combat armor, and other factors, it's obvious that sneaking around is what you're supposed to be doing. And yeah, that's the whole point of the game. But sometimes, just sometimes, after silently taking out a guard, hiding the unconscious fool, and returning to grab evidence, that AR looks mighty tempting. Mighty, mighty tempting...

Personal Preferences:
Now, out of all the Hitman games that would run for me, I've played quite a few of them. Most are so old you need 3 or 4 mod-patches to get them to run. I'm a simple man, and God as my witness, I might be a bit touched, so I can't for the life of me get them to work. But I've played Blood Money (before a crash rendered the game useless and I had to uninstall, reinstall, and then encountered the same game-breaking crash) Absolution, and these two newest installments. Absolution, in comparison to these two BEAUTIFUL games, was hot garbage. Neat mechanics and all, but it was linear, it had checkpoints, and if I remember correctly, a boss fight with some big mechanical pig? Or a mecha-pig? Was that even IN the game? I don't remember, it's a faint memory of a sub-par game. BUT I SAY THIS! Point-shooting? That makes me erect. Now I know, I know, the Hitman series isn't about run-and-gun gameplay. Silent-sneaky, sneaky-beaky like, Bravo 6 going dark, get across that bridge to evade the covenant dropship, ""what was that? must've been the wind"", and other generic ""don't be seen"" lines from Bideo Bames. but holy CRAP is point-shooting fun! I understand purists don't like it, I know it's not ""real hitman"", but it's so f u n. I don't know how it would be implemented with the new ""unlimited focus"" mechanic. Call me a sadist but it was fun to make a guy dance on his way down in Absolution, from a cinematic camera focusing on his death.

I could follow my target all day long but I wouldn't find any opportunity. But if I follow a mission story then the assassination experience becomes simple, smooth and clean. The issue however is that mission stories hold your hand by telling you exactly what to do and where to go. This makes the game just a sequence of orders to follow. The game does offer a way to tune down the hand holding of mission stories by only telling you what to do and not where to go. However that option made them very difficult or rather time consuming to do. This is because the mission story may tell you to go find a USB stick, with no hints as to where it may be. The maps are huge so finding things can be a lot of work and boring.

In summary I found assassinations difficult to pull off cleanly without mission stories. And I didn't enjoy the mechanics of mission stories.",1577290669,1577290669,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198073655928,297,32,653,0,653,1577207867

i've played many Hitman titles, starting with Hitman 2: Silent Assassin and games like Silent Assassin, Blood Money and Absolution are among my favorites. They've been part of my childhood just like the good old GTAs and so on. I passed the Hitman reboot because it didn't feel right to me, something was off, probably the episodical release of the base levels. And then came Hitman 2. I didn't really play that much yet but i can definitely say it is [b] that [/b] one Hitman game every fan of the franchise would love. Fun and interesting maps with fitting atmosphere, bunch of equipment to experiment with and oh lord, all the interactive points in the levels, plus you can even play the previous games' levels too, if you buy the dlc (or just buy the previous game as gold on sale, it's probably cheaper). For me it feels like there are endless possibilities.

Though there are many aspects of Hitman 2 i absolutely love, i dislike the choice of available content. Sure, the maps are really detailed and their replay value is gigantic, but, [b] i feel [/b] like double the base maps would have been the standard for a game like Hitman (in retrospective, it does sound like quite the amount of work if you compare detail to scale from the old games to this one). The Elusive Target mechanic is a fine addition to the game, but, for someone who doesn't play Hitman 2 only it's a shame i'll miss out on some fine suits and so on. Sure, the targets reappear a couple of times after the initial appearance but do i really have to keep track of all of them? Oh and there's also the season pass, that is a big chunk of cash you pay for [i] just [/i] two full maps and two sniper maps, and a bit of side content, recommended to get on sale only except you really just want to support the devs and the franchise.

All in all, i do recommend Hitman 2, especially now after all the content has been released. If you are a fan of the Hitman franchise, you'll probably like this game too. I'd recommend to get the season pass only while on sale, except you're a die hard fan who doesn't really care about the price.",1577186252,1577186252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198083369522,308,8,2186,0,1657,1577304555

Great game!   Hitman is still one of the best games i've every played.  The slow, methodical approach to accomplishing your mission is truly immersive like no other game format out there, and has always delivered.    As a game in itself, it's perfect.     HOWEVER..   There is simply no excuse whatsoever for the episodic release schedule of each of the hitman levels, and NO excuse at all for crippling the system by requiring you to be online to access the main features of the game.   Without being online you cannot unlock content and upgrades, and makes the game useless offline.   Essentially what this means is that you are a paying for a product that is only half complete.   I see no logical reason why the Glorious success of Hitman Bloodmoney, ( A COMPLETE game) can not be echoed with the new series of hitman titles.   For this reason i cannot recommend wholehearted this or any other game that disrespects the gaming community in this way.   The Game is amazing..   The method of delivery is totally wrong, and that it was right in the past makes this confusing, and frustrating",1577086381,1577086381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198059928420,79,4,3250,0,3250,1576558972

No character animations whatsoever, more of a comic book feel, which is slightly off-putting compared to season one's cutscenes, however, I can only assume they didn't have the resources after the fiasco that almost left us without IO entirely.

70,60252831,english,"Incredibly Impressive.

Includes all the content from the previous game, it would appear.

I could see them merely adding content by Expansions, though I doubt WB would want that.

IOI have been a cutting edge company since Absolution (first HITMAN I played) and the visual standards, world complexity and overall quality have not diminished here.  This may be one of the most polished titles ever made, a benchmark for AAA game development.

I liked the design motif from HITMAN: Absolution more, a bit more sex and dirt to accompany the stealth puzzles that each level presents, but regardless of my personal tastes, the last 2 HITMAN games have been memorable, in quality and immersion.  Perhaps there will be an installment in the future that is a bit grittier.

The suspense and tension HITMAN style Stealth game play induces surpasses many other games, though to be fair, the stealth genre has some fabulous titles.  (NOT AC)

I do wish there was a ""Go Nuts"" style of gameplay, where it was more like a straight shooter.  (Kind of how I finished the intro level, Running, hiding and capping anyone who got close, I know...  ""No Finesse"")

All in all though, I love these games, and will likely finish out my weekend playing this one.

Picked this up During the winter sale for $15 USD.  Absolute bargain.  I am aware that I missed out on some elusive targets, etc, but there is more than enough here..

Will likely pick up the season pass after I complete the stories.

I keep getting these long pauses in the game (it locks solid for from 30 seconds to a minute) but does not crash, which is annoying and breaks the flow, but isn't a killer (it doesn't happen that often).  Another annoyance is where one character that has seen me moments before it is killed, but a character who was well around a building, comes around and knows exactly where I'm hiding and shoots me instantly.  This happens fairly often, and I have to adjust gameplay for it.  

I love the complexity of the conversations.  I wish there were more inane conversations (that it was harder to detect whether a conversation turns out to be important to the story).  But the number of choices are quite impressive.

31,60081682,english,"A game for those who love stealth and assassination. I would be lying if I was to say that this is not one of the best Hitman games out there. 
The levels are detailed, pretty realistic and very large so you have plenty opportunities to wander around and do things differently. Also most of the maps are based around different areas of the world so you won't be bored with the surroundings looking alike. The missions are interesting and the stories between characters are sometimes pretty hilarious. I also like that you get to sneak around the mission and even if you have completed the mission several times you can find brand new things what the characters say or do while they are wandering around the map. And I can't point out enough of the details in the game, there is a lot of different clothes and properties and stuff around the maps that really makes it look like its real life.

The missions or the story whatever you call it can be done several times with several different ways that it  really brings you more to play and it is a good thing. But also it creates you so much space around how to do the assassinations that it gives the game a more casual difficulty and that can be a bad thing sometimes. At least few times I felt like I was given a way too easy completion of a mission but thankfully the difficulty rises a bit when you progress to the later parts.

The weapons, the keybindings and movement and all that stuff are pretty easy to learn and if you have played Hitman games before you should be in no problem at all.

The pricing can be a bit much but I think that the levels are so big and time consuming that I wouldn't say they are over the head. But if you just want to do the missions once and never come back to explore more then I would not recommend buying all the chapters/missions.

The game can be completed pretty fast if you just try to do the objectives as fast and clumsy as you can but there is a lot to discover and the most satisfaction from playing this game comes when you do the objectives with the stealth and accuracy of a Hitman. The satisfaction of leaving the area with nobody knowing what happened and why is the boss dead in the toilet or shot in the neck laying on the ground or been poisoned and choked to his/her death.

The temps of my CPU and GPU are perfect and this is literally the only game that I've had issues with. A quick google search revealed to me that I am far from the only one having these problems. I've requested a refund of course and I would not recommend purchasing this game unless you are desperate to play it. Maybe you'll get lucky and the game will just happen to agree with your rig.

[EDIT]: I finally, after much headache and after going through an unconventional route got Steam to agree to refund me in the form of putting the amount I spent on this game and it's DLC into my Steam wallet. While that is better than nothing, it has really opened up my eyes to just how little power we as consumers have on this platform. Two hours is simply not enough time in some cases to know if a game is going to function properly. I ran into a literally game-breaking situation on the first story mission after completing the lengthy tutorial in this game. A tutorial that the game strongly encourages you to do (and play through multiple times) before moving on to the story missions. The first story mission crashed every 5-10 minutes for me and was completely unplayable past that point. That is called a defective product. Yet because I was over the 2 hour mark in my recorded play time, Steam initially denied me any sort of refund and only after playing around with the Help menu for a bit was I able to find a way to get in contact with a Steam rep who told me ""as a customer service gesture"" they'd refund me in the form of Steam dollars. As if it were a favor to me to give me my money back on a completely defective product. That's another thing that bothers me. When I went through the most obvious method of requesting a refund and choosing the correct reason (game keeps crashing) for my refund request from a drop-down box, I was denied totally. It was only after a trial and error session with the Help menu that I was able to get in contact with an actual person. The option that ended up getting me results had no clear connection to refunds at all. It was clicking on ""I'd like to ask a question."" 
I should note that I do live with a special needs relative and I often have to pause my games in order to assist them. This did happen during the tutorial and helped to artificially inflate my play time past 2 hours before I ran into the game-breaking bug. There are many reasons that someone may have to pause a game. After all, they are games and life takes precedence. Or maybe it simply takes longer than 2 hours of play time to run into a game-breaking situation. Should we not be allowed refunds of our real money in these scenarios? Is it realistic to expect me to have had the foresight to fully exit the game when I had to go assist my relative when the game had been functioning fine so far? I get that there has to be some kind of time limit on refunds, but 2 hours is simply not enough time in a lot of cases. Games can have hundreds of hours of content these days. I know Steam has the resources to see how many times someone is requesting refunds. The people who would attempt to take advantage of a refund period longer than 2 hours would quickly be found out and Steam would still be making a killing. 
Anyway this has caused me to reconsider my opinion of Steam and I can tell you that I will be very reluctant to put any more of my money into their hands.",1576217022,1576346847,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198030155946,163,6,284,0,284,1576214748

At the moment, I'm reinstalling the game for the third time so wish me luck. Here are the review.

Pro:
1mb/s dl speed
+100gb game (pretty heavy)
still can't even play 2nd mission
3rd times installing game (in-progress)

79,59807650,english,"This is a review written solely about the multiplayer aspect of the game, for those who love stealth multiplayer.
I love Hitman, I love stealth games, and I love multiplayer stealth. My dream game is an open world Hitman/Payday heist game in GTA5's style.
I was so excited to play multiplayer Hitman, but it's had so little thought put into it.
I'm writing this after having played for a few hours now, and the biggest problem is that once your disguises are compromised, they're done for good, even if you die. Not only that, but if you kill a non-target, your score goes down for every kill. So if you're in a situation where if someone notices your target kill, your disguise is blown, and you now have guards coming after you that you CANT KILL in a firefight. Not only that, in a map like Santa Fortuna, some zones only allow a couple of disguises total, otherwise you're reduced to avoiding absolutely everyone. It's also worth mentioning that cameras can ruin your disguise if they spot you trespassing (forcing you to abandon it for good) and you are forced to claim any equipment from special chests you might not even be able to access. That's right, you can't even pick up a screwdriver from a bench.

The reason this is a problem in multiplayer is that you're in a RACE. Any mistakes snowballing until most of the map is irredeemably hostile (leaving you with no equipment) is likely. Not to mention that the only 2 playable maps are somewhat convoluted, so simply knowing how to get from one place to another is a huge advantage, because travelling from A to B is never straightforward. Better maps in the game which are less maze-like aren't even available.

tl;dr: Hitman hasn't learnt anything at all from games like Assassins Creed on how to make stealth multiplayer amazing. With only 2 maps available and with no options available (forcing you to abide by unfun mechanics), definitely don't get this for the multiplayer.",1576297179,1576297179,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,76561198048119477,220,4,1515,0,1515,1576295155

15,59577142,english,"It’s been almost exactly 2 years since I’ve played and thoroughly enjoyed HITMAN (2016) in its GOTY version and since the updates for HITMAN 2 are finally quieting down I decided that it was time to give it a go as well. Originally intended to be a “Season 2” of a grand always updating title, Hitman 2 (I’ll stop using the intended all caps, but I’m not talking about the Silent Assassin from 2002) is a standalone game. Yet, it retained most of what was originally intended since you can add all of the mission content from the 2016 game to it, with some omissions (like Elusive Targets). And in its fullest form, with expansions and the content from the previous title, Hitman 2 is easily the best game in the series to date. But with the same issues as the previous game that need mentioning.

If you’ve not played Hitman before, and what luck for you since Hitman 2 would be a perfect place to start, the series are known for their free form stealth gameplay, emphasizing “social stealth” over the typical sneaking around stealth. What that means is that instead of avoiding enemies or people that can force you into conflict when performing your tasks (main goal tends to be killing one or more targets), you disguise yourself to be able to move among the enemies, bluff your way in, find an opening and then strike when no one is looking. Over the years, the art of social stealth in the series evolved, apart from the weird detour in Absolution, and by this game it’s working absolutely brilliantly. It’s very easy to guess and tell what disguise might work in which situation, the concept of “enforcers” who can call your bluff is a far cry from the dreadful suspicion meter from the Hitman 2 from 2002 where people shot you in the face for making one wrong move, and the levels themselves are now extremely open and sandbox-y, full of ways to experiment with the social stealth aspects and get surprising results.

All of that was already fantastic in the previous game, so Hitman 2 feels like a simple, but welcome, enhancement of everything we had. There are minor but meaningful additions, like the ability to conceal yourself in the crowd or dense foliage. There’s a return of the concept of briefcases where you can stash bulkier items to carry with you (or use as bizarre thrown bomb cases). There’re lots of tweaks to AI, making their cones of vision more centered on the body direction, yet still retaining the head direction from the previous title. Cameras and mirrors have a bigger gameplay impact, both helping the AI to notice you doing illegal things. The difficulty levels are perfectly selected this time around, giving you a very easy mode, a mode that’s close to the normal mode from the previous title and a harder mode, all available from the start unlike Hitman (2016). The system of unlocks and leveling up your profile, if you’re into that whole thing, is now more unified across the entire experience, since the game is not episodic at all this time around. And best of all, all of the improvements are also added to the missions that you can import from the previous game (or buy as a DLC if you don’t own it).

What was already great was mostly tweaked, the “opportunities” are now “mission stories”, still giving you a more guided way through each level – a huge recommendation for the first playthrough, as long as you realize that it’s far from the only or even “one of the few” ways to achieve your objective. As before, you can have them just give you the general hints as to where you can do things and what things, without holding your hand all the way through, or you can make turn them into a completely guided experience with map markers and the like, something that I would not recommend even for the first ever time players. Additionally, I love that more often than not, these give you an opening, but not hand over the entire solution, feeling even closer to the more scripted parts of the original titles that you had to guess your way through, except done in a much better presented way. And while some might still lament the absence of keyhole peeking, I’d honestly take the see-through-wall instinct mode for a game as Hitman over the way it used to work in the early titles – leave that for purer stealth games like Splinter Cell or Thief where it would fit the pace so much better. Besides, instinct usage now doesn’t even seem to slow down time, just serves the same as the maps used to do since Hitman 2, except without the need to open a map.

Unfortunately, some of the big problems I’ve had with the previous title are also here unchanged. The game remains online-only if you want to have the intended experience and I’m calling whatever excuses IOI says complete bollocks. A game as wonderful as Hitman 2 should be easily preservable and not have any online requirements for anything but the online modes. Elusive targets still seem to me going against the fail-restart core gameplay loop of the game and also hurt the possibility of ever being preserved.

On the more mediocre side of things, the story is still garbage even by Hitman standards since even Absolution was at least bizarre and stupid enough to be entertaining while the one going on here is just boring and leads to the game having far less outlandish targets than what you could get in some of the earliest Hitman games. And the soundtrack, while definitely serviceable and with memorable leitmotifs, still pales in comparison with what Jesper Kyd was doing in the original titles. The menu in the game is still a confusing mess. And due to the fact that this time IOI partnered with Warner Brothers for publishing the game, WB went full stupid with SKUs of the game and selecting the edition you need required complex tables. Not Ubisoft level of stupid, but close. Nowadays, you essentially need to have the Gold Edition (adds 2 story missions in new locations and with new story cutscenes continuing the story) to get everything Hitman 2 and the Legacy pack to get the remastered maps from the 2016 game and it’s little remixed expansion, something that you get for free if you own that game in GOTY format (but only after launching both at least once, because of course that’s how it works). Here’s hoping they don’t live service the hell out of the game in a few months and add more confusion.

But the new maps are some of the best and most inventive in the series, the ability to play the maps from the 2016 game with new abilities is, in my opinion, superior to playing them in the game they are from and there’s just so much fun experimentation you can do if you have time and desire. Hitman 2 is amazing. Online requirement needs to go, two expansion missions aren’t as exciting as they could be, scripted moments still often happen if you’re in the vicinity or actively participating, annoyingly and there are other minor and major things of note. But it doesn’t detract from that fact, that Hitman 2 is amazing. If you’ve never played a Hitman game, start here. If you’ve played the previous one and loved it, you’ll love this even more. If you’ve played the previous one and had some reservations, give this one a go, you might like it more. I wish whatever next Hitman title finally addresses the online requirement and perhaps even tells a good story for a change.

The elusive targets are a real thrill because you don't get to save the game and you can't try again if you die. Elusive targets also act kind of randomly (they perform the same actions but the order varies). My only complaint is that poison syringes cannot be used to poison drinks and food, but you can use pills and vials for that. It makes no sense. Surely injecting food or drink would be easier than hiding pills in them or breaking open a vial? It may seem like a small issue but its the details that take away from the immersion. On the other hand, NPC behaviour is now more realistic. I like that there are ""enforcers"" who will recognise you in a disguise. It's much more realistic compared to previous games where anyone with the same clothes would recognise you if you got too close.

65,59381556,english,"Ok so this is going to be a mixed review. I am not a Hitman fanboy, I just picked it up because I have been wondering about it. There are some real positives and negatives thought.

1. I feel the developers kinda cheaped out. Yes the engine is beautiful, and the game mechanics tight. But there is only 5 missions, that you are just suppose to play over and over. I mean for a AAA game I expect more then that.
2. It is a pay to play game. You want to play the first, ok sure pay here, want more missions, ok pay here. I mean for $60, I expect more than 5 missions.
3. The missions ARE in depth, and they give you lots of ways to eliminate your target. It is not a run and gun, though you can play it that way. More of a stealth assassin game, which is what is advertised.
4. Now this really bothers me...None of the cut scenes are animated, it really killed the immersion. Working with such a awesome engine, the fact that they chose still frame images with voice overs is really a cop out. It almost ruined the whole game for me. I mean even smaller developers do 3D animated cut scenes, and your telling me a choice title like Hitman can't? Sorry that is just bullshit.
5. On the positive side, walking through the mission was awesome, they are large with a lot of content you can pick up from just by listening to conversations. That can open up alternative ways to kill your target etc.

Overall, I recommend for a sale price, but if paying full AAA price, I honestly would feel cheated. There are some cool things like doing missions people create, but I expect that as a bonus, it is not something the studio made.

94,59270418,english,"There's one simple fact that foremost keeps me from recommending HITMAN 7 (fuck you IOI), and thats the item system. For some braindead reason, they've tied essential item unlocks to challenge completions in specific levels. This is not okay. Not within the context of the lore OR the wider context of a reward system.

Rewards are REWARDING, they unlock supplementary content typically from extra game modes added to enhance an already whole experience. For example in Ocarina of Time, you played minigames at a parlor to unlock things like heart pieces, ammo capacity upgrades, and rupies. In Resident Evil 4 you played target practice to get minifigures. These were supplemental to the experience; additive but not required.
Thats not how it works in this game. The best example is probably the very first. In order to unlock the... Well, lockpick, you need to complete the training facility mission. This doesn't seem so bad especially if you're brand new to the series and are just starting out at this game. However for longtime fans or indeed just simply people who played HITMAN 6 (fuck you IOI) there's no apparent reason to play the tutorial mission. Not just because they'd already know how to play the game but because the tutorial mission in HITMAN 7 is lifted WHOLESALE from HITMAN 6. It's a boat level you need to complete 3 times in a row under heavy, light, and no guidance.
So to summarize, in order to get one of the most useful items in the game, you need to beat a lengthy and boring tutorial from a different game no matter how good you are to begin with. The kicker is that they do not inform you how to acquire the lockpick so unless you specifically look up a guide online, the average competent player is going to be going through most if not all of this game without the ability to open locked doors.

This in and of itself perfectly capsulates why such a system has no merit. I could go down the list of item unlocks and explain why each individual one is bad but the overall fact is that requiring me to play through the game several times to acquire the items that I want to play the game FROM THE START WITH is a bad experience. When I finally get to play a level with what I actually WANT to play it with I don't feel relief or accomplishment, but bitterness. The devs dragged me along by a leash to make absolutely sure I experienced all their guided, structured content before finally taking off the collar, patting me on the head and saying ""Alright you've been a good boy, now go play what you paid for how you want to play it.""

Whats especially infuriating is that they already had a system that worked perfectly. Blood Money gave you... blood money depending on how well you did in a mission and you spent it buying and upgrading whatever equipment you want whenever you wanted. There's no legitimate reason to get rid of this system and especially not with what it was replaced by. Blood money's system makes sense both in and outside of the games context. How do you explain not having a lethal syringe or remote explosive in HITMAN 7 (fuck you IOI)? You don't, plain and simple. 47 just plain does not have them and are only given them after an arbitrary challenge is completed. This is nonsense and blatantly displays the devs care more about pumping up playtime numbers than they do about actually enjoying the game.

After a glance at the forums I've seen the general response to people asking how to unlock all items from the start be to accuse that person of being childish and lazy. However the only childish thing is these people's inability to comprehend the difference between Earned vs Essential content.
To help them understand should one be reading, I'll draw another parallel to the game PAYDAY 2. In order to unlock the deathwish mask, you need to complete all the levels on deathwish difficulty. It would be lazy of someone to want this mask without working for it. However, in order to unlock the AK, you go to the store and buy it. You earn the mask because it's supplemental to the experience. The AK is essential because it fundamentally alters how the game is played and thus has no restriction to its access. The devs would be childish to do anything otherwise. The same concept applies to virtually every game ever made. This concept is what makes people pissed off at loot boxes. Realistically the only fundamental difference between a loot box and HITMAN 7's(fuck you IOI) method of reward is you don't need to pay them in order to play the level every time. Trying to imbue ""pride and accomplishment"" into a player by making them grind for an extended period to unlock standard content is what got EA the most downvoted comment on the entirety of reddit. This is the exact same thing.

""I paid $60 for this, give me Darth Vader.""
""I paid $60 for this, give me remote explosives.""

Except of course as explained above, Darth Vader is supplemental content, whereas remote explosive are a fundamental aspect of strategy.

This isn't even touching on other things like the REQUIRED ALWAYS ONLINE CONNECTION which is tied to your save file, missable single player content in the form of Elusive contracts, and the overall lack of grey matter beyond a brain stem present in all the AI. The thing that infuriates me most however, besides the item system, has got to be to dogmatic way in which the devs push you to partaking in the stories rather than just catching the target while they're alone and shooting them in the head. In fact I don't think its even possible to complete the Ark Society level without doing so, as one of the targets simply forever walks in a loop on the crowded party floor. There's also been much more focus from the devs on making levels bigger but not necessarily more interesting. For instance the level A New Life from blood money is compact with only 2 open houses but a girth of options regardless, whereas in this games Whittleton Creek level it could take you upwards of 5 minutes to go from one side to the other but it has relatively the same amount of options as A New Life. This leads to perfect playthroughs of the level being in excess of 30 minutes long as a baseline just due to travel time. In comparison, there's methods to complete A New Life in 4 minutes with a Pro rating.

This combination of story dogmatism and obese level size leads to many playthroughs being not just the same or similar but also incredibly long. When you layer atop that the fact that multiple playthroughs of each level is required in order to unlock basic gear it quickly becomes a chore trying to complete this game. These reasons outlined are likely why only a paltry %2.5 of players have beaten the last level of the game.

Overall I can only recommend this game when its deeply on sale. as unless the multiplayer mode appeals to you there's not much unique to this game that isn't done better in any of the older games in this series, games you can get in a bundle for a price lower than this game on sale.",1575539199,1575539199,False,7,2,0.487540125846862793,0,True,True,False,76561198043775931,1231,49,2301,0,1390,1579512120

The game is crashing all the time and i can't play anymore because i cannot go beyond specific places. At the moment it's crashing on the Island mission when i talk to Sophia and i cannot complete the campaign no matter how many times i restart the game.

System Info: https://imgur.com/a/K5cJkol
GPU Info: https://imgur.com/a/XAae7v2

The game was crashing a lot more when i used the recommended settings. I now use the minimum graphic settings and it doesn't crash like before. I noticed on my task manager that the game crashes for sure when the GPU use goes above 40%. Also crashes on specific game events. Like talking to that target, or entering that room.

I hope there is a fix for that, i have played your whole series, i am a dedicated fan for 20 years now since the first hitman game. If there is any other way to contact you please write a developer response on this review about where to contact you and i will change my rating back to positive.

The controls are terrible , instead of allowing one interaction button for interacting with multiple things like previous hitman games it forces you to use multiple different buttons for no reason and it will not allow you to map multiple actions to one button. I really hope someone gets fired for that one.

One example of bad controls is when you select the fibre wire instead of just being able to use mouse 1 to use the fibre wire like ever other weapon you have to use a separate button , why ? Why the hell would anyone with half a brain decide to make controls like this it is just utter stupidity and then the icing on the cake the game does not give an option to map them both to one button. This profound stupidity really is hard to believe and that is just one thing and there are many other stupid decisions within the controls and this game that are hard to believe and I haven't even play'd for long yet.

This is supposed to be a AAA title game , what a joke.

The briefcase from the old Hitman games has finally returned! This time it may contain pretty much any object and may be reused as many times as you wish. More strangling and poison options. Probably even more weapons and outfits this time, but I'm not really sure yet as I'm far from unlocking everything.

Story missions replace 'opportunities' from the last game and work the same way. This time you are recommended to complete some story missions for the overall story plot before continuing. Various mastery levels on the different destinations with hard to get challenges to multiple replays. Not all destinations are equally interesting, but they all fit into the overall storyline.

Three difficulty levels this time - Casual, Professional and Master with separate 'Classical' challenges like 'no evidence', 'silent assassin', 'suit only' and the like. Completing on Master or Professional will unlock also easier difficulty challenges. The assassination, discovery, and feats challenges may be done on any difficulty level while only the 'Classical' being difficulty separated.

With around 500 hours played on the first game, I guess I'll play this one a fair bit as well, as long as they keep pushing out the promised DLCs along with elusive targets and escalations. Also two co-op options this time, which I haven't tested so far.

For me, this is easily 10/10!

Long ago, I would create my own challenges for Hitman: Blood Money, doing things like killing everyone on a level, or assassinating targets in creative ways. This game takes that approach and actually makes it a part of the loop with the Contract system and challenges/mastery of each level. I'm sure I'll slowly chip away at this until I can 100% it!

Some complain that there aren't enough levels, but the complexity and detail of each level are so incredible that I think it makes up for it. I wish the DLC would've had more content, though.

The only negative about this game is the timed content. I'm not a player that is dedicated to one game, and I wish we able to try elusive targets and get their rewards after the fact.

It goes way back 15 years ago when I first played Hitman Codename 47. The idea of low chaos, high precision, high patience hooked me at a time that I had no precision, patience and was used to high chaos action videogames.

[h1] Hitman 2 [/h1]

It is tough to review it. For one side, it IS the best Hitman game made to date. I do include graphics and immersion into consideration. I don't consider nostalgia, or Hitman Codename 47 would top the list everytime. Get real.

In the other side of the coin, Hitman 2 does not impress on the freedom at taking the targets out. If you get out of the pre made mission flow it feels like you are exploiting the mechanics more than a organic creatively moving assassin by the player and not mission design.

The main missions are fairly challenging but they really could be opened to a more free form mission run.

Maybe there are no technology reliable enough for it, but randomization of things (AI, Items, and even rooms) could make Hitman game series another level completely, departing from the old technology/philosophy, but that's just me.

Regardless of its short comings, both Hitman 2016 and this Hitman 2 are love letter for the old days of the franchise and are done almost masterfully.

I just wish for a departure of linear ""stories"" within missions to a more free form and thought provoking Hitman game, where the levels could be played a thousand times over.

89,46163893,english,"Hitman 2 is an accross the board improvement over Hitman 2016. The user interface has recieved a total refresh that better conveys information, the lighting system looks good in the new maps, and needs some work in the old ones. The cloth and reflection tech is incredible. And the gameplay is still Hitman. The first elusive target hit and they have also recieved a new coat of paint, with this one including a mission story that gets you into the room with them, but doesn't hold your hand to the kill. This ET definitely felt easier than last seasons, but my guess is that is to bring people up to speed with the system. I did like not having to spend the first 15 minutes of the mission wandering around all over the map hunting for the target, although that has been fun in some situations. 

Hooks seem to be in place for this to be the hitman platform going forward (for real this time you guys) so hopefully that is the case. I'm still not sure if new ETs or escalations will appear on the old maps, or if just the new 6 maps will be getting all the love. The new maps launched with No escalations, which was a suprise.

Overall this is a stellar improvement over the last game and well worth your money if you enjoyed the first or think you will enjoy the title.

EDIT: All content for the game has shipped, and while Elusive Targets this time around were pretty sub-par (first game we got dozens, this time, you could count them on one hand, and one map (mumbai) didn't get any.)  That said, between challenge packs, monthly updates, and a higher focus on escalations, I believe they made up for it with content that you can continue to come back to. I still think the game is worth the asking price, even more so given that most of the content created is here to stay. They have also fixed many issues that existed at the end of Hitman 2016 to the first 6 months of the game.

All this is going in so much detail that, beyond the amazing gameplay experience, as a musician, it touched me. It is a very subtle detail that just shows the dedication to the craft.

11,45813752,english,"Hitman2 is the sequel that all games should have: It's more of the same, with some new mechanics thrown in, and it takes into account some of the criticism from the previous game (the episodic content).

The addition of a few multiplayer modes is welcome as well, not because they will necessarily be excellent, but because it shows that they are still trying to innovate and find new ways to enjoy Hitman without changing the core gameplay experience... Which is not a given at all for multiplayer modes of games that have been exclusively solo for a decade.

The fact that all Hitman 1 levels can be played is also a huge bonus since it enables you to try some of the new mechanics (i.e the suitcase) on the old maps. The fans with the most attention to detail will also notice a few changes here and there ;)

However, being a fan of the Hitman games, I regret that the story bits are basically glorified still images instead of actual videos. Especially since the story is actually decent, though it has too many gaps between each sequence, probably in order to move the plot forward in as small a time as possible.

UPDATE (nov 2019) : Very satisfied by the support that the game has received since its launch. There's a lot of new content and unlocks each month, along with bug fixes and small quality of life improvements here and there.

The voice acting is well done with humorous npc banter, though ideally I would prefer region-specific languages with subtitles for realism. For sound effects the effort was made to simulate accurate acoustics that occasionally falls flat versus old solutions like EAX. Sometimes footsteps have the correct reverb in large spaces and background conversations seem to bounce off concrete walls appropriately, and other times audio effects like closing a container sounds far louder than it should while a nearby npc sounds muffled. 

Fantastic visuals with some of the best reflection technology that isn't actual ray tracing. Lots of color and attention to detail in the level aesthetic. Even the older levels like Sapienza are enhanced versus Hitman 2016. Even now, while the new levels like Miami look great, I find myself being drawn back to the slightly enhanced levels of the last game, redoing the old challenges to accumulate more gear to add to 47's bag of tricks. There's tons of content in the form of challenges that award new tools which would have been paid dlc if most other game companies had been in charge.

Hitman 2 is a fun experience in finding ways to start scripted events and eventually breaking them down. The game rewards patience, stalking targets and eavesdropping, yet its even more fun to abruptly interrupt actions with unexpected fire alarms and throwing objects to rip the AI out of the pre-defined paths once you figure out the systems. It's not a quick pick up and play and blast through the levels to see the story type of game but more of a slow burn where you find the best ways to replay scenarios from different angles.",1561795090,1575110650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197967475306,592,25,6193,0,2913,1600653913

It's pretty amazing the amount of stuff you can do in each level. I start off by playing with mission storys on, for achievements and challenges, but it's actually much more satisfying to turn them off and just go by instinct. I plan on doing ALL THE THINGS and see ALL OF THE WORLD, 'cause it's just that much fun. Sure, there are downtimes where you just sit around and wait, but thanks to some funny writing and great npc behavior, it doesn't feel like a chore.

It may look like a rerun of the first season of ""new Hitman"", but i feel that IOI put enough new stuff in it, to make it up. Plus, you can get the whole first season included with the game! I didn't play too much of the first season, and I don't really know why. Maybe because I was put off by the episodic structure, and luckily they ditched that in season 2.

The graphics are really top notch this time, and even in crowded places, I don't dip below 60 fps. And my god, I can even play this game on low setting and 30fps on my shoddy laptop. It's a miracle! Sounds are great too, and the dialogue is silly but great. Actually, the whole game is pretty silly for a murder simulator, and I really appreciate that. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's a big plus.

I might be a bit biased, because this is one of the rare games to come out of my homecountry, Denmark. We've seen a couple come out in the past few years with limbo/inside and A Hat In Time, but nothing quite as strong and with such history as the Hitman series. So yeah, maybe I'm biased, but nonetheless i recommend this game HIGHLY. For fans and newcomers, this is a fun experience to play.

11,58367397,english,"Being a life long fan of the Hitman franchise since Codename 47 was released in 2000, Hitman was a part of my childhood and slowly turned into an iconic franchise over the next two decades. Nothing ever came close for me where stealth games were concerned. The precision, the contracts, the world you are put in and just the feeling of being a truly lethal assassin never felt more fun or surreal. The perfect game for those who thrive on that play style.

I consider myself a veteran in all aspects where the Hitman franchise is concerned. I've played thousands of hours in all their respective titles and came to appreciate the pristine nature of the games. HITMAN™ 2 doesn't disappoint with its follow up from the prior title, HITMAN™. The game offers almost three times as much as the 2016 game does, but the mechanics and grit of the game just feel on par with everything you'd come to expect from a Hitman title.

The foundation of the 'sandbox world' was a huge fan favorite from the 'Blood Money' title. So much so that the developers deemed it necessary to further instill that concept into the recent Hitman titles. The sniping in the game feels terrific, the silverballers never felt more accurate, the characters in the world are very real and the item interaction throughout the locations are honestly something to be marveled at. So many things are offered in this game that setup your approach. From finding all sorts of interesting ways to eliminate your targets, or simply just walking right up to them and firing your gun in their face and running off... the options are truly limitless! Also If challenges are your thing? There are over 1000+ designed specifically within each location and contract. It'll keep you busy for hours on end if you like seeing all the many different ways to approach or eliminate your contract.

The lack of cinematics was definitely a huge blow and disappointment for me. I felt the story suffered to some degree on this note. Being a huge fan of the source material that followed and the story arcs for Agent 47, this was probably the lowest point for me in HITMAN™ 2. The 2016 game came with amazing cinematics that really grabbed you. The music and even the tension in them were astounding to me and I'd always find myself re-watching them. They are replaced in HITMAN™ 2 with a sort of play on animation slides instead of a live, motion cinematic approach. Seeing as how a 3rd title is planned, I hope the cinematics come back.

I grew to tolerate the sort of 'silly/wonky' extras they'd throw into the game. I greatly appreciated the serious tone and dark nature of the game that was generally carried out through the majority of the series. But the prior game as well as this one would sometimes throw ridiculous Agent 47 outfits or even weapons that felt stupid and useless to me. Muffins, burgers and fish for pacification? Not exactly something I liked because I wanted real, standardized equipment for pacification. Then the certain 'Easter Egg' location exits that some maps provided? Overly silly and could just sometimes take away from any decent immersion. Thankfully a lot of work had to go into finding these exits and it was not something just thrown in your face. Exaggerated and sometimes a bit over the top, these things were extremely negligible when rating how great the game feels as a whole.

It may feel like a lot if you're new to the franchise, but for all you guys out there who have played and enjoyed the Hitman games for so many years, there's no need to ponder any further.

Replay the 2016 maps with the new/brought back mechanics, most of the bugs have been completely patched with the only new one being the briefcase glitch which just added to the fun!

All the new maps are great in their own ways! With the Hitman (2016) and it’s DLC there’s 100s hours of context here! That’s what Hitman has always been about, the replaying of levels to master or to mess about with the AI. The story is alright and follows from 2016 game but the gameplay is where it's at!

This is the only game in the last 3 years I have paid full price for and got once announced at E3 for £70!
Well worth the money, 100s of hours of replayability (I’ve done 355 hours on Hitman 2016 alone).

Some aspects of the game are not great, such as having to buy DLC to get the 2016 game's levels if you don't already own that game, and ""Mk2"" weapons being the exact same model as the originals but with a reddish-pink 2 sticker on it.

85,58240077,english,"A social stealth simulator with a plethora of options on how best to accomplish a set of basic objectives.
The maps are sprawling and massive, but filled to the brim with content. The NPCs, unlike the past installment, speak in the native languages and dialects they belong in, helping with immersion. The different story paths are all incredibly well written and amusing, each tinged and infused with the typical Hitman-brand dark humor. And with each story path being distinct in a given level, there's a ton of incentive for replaying past missions to experience more. The controls are snappy and responsive whether you're using a keyboard and mouse or a controller. The visuals range from dingy. dimly lit parking garages to exotic, beautiful locales. The places you'll go...
This is the ultimate Hitman experience that will please both old fans and newcomers to the franchise.

Some will argue it's a glorified expansion pack improving on the existing foundation that HITMAN 2016 laid out; others will say it's a new game that learns from most of its predecessor's mistakes. Whatever side of the fence you sit on: HITMAN 2 may very well be the last good classic AAA stealth series that hasn't gone the way of Deus Ex, Thief and Metal Gear Solid... and that's worth bearing in mind.

Before I delve into pros and cons, and whether you should buy this game, I'd first like to talk about what's different in HITMAN 2 when compared to the previous game HITMAN 2016 (which I'll refer to as HITMAN from now on). To start with we've got 2 new mechanics - pockets of vegetation/grass on maps hide us if we're crouched and you can now escape a NPC's line of sight by walking amongst a small group of people (this system is practically identical to the one used in Hitman: Absolution). There's also a less noticeable gameplay mechanic that's been introduced: NPCs can now see you in mirrors and other reflective surfaces (this change for realism doesn't make things incredibly hard but it will keep you on your toes as bathrooms used to mean a guaranteed unnoticed kill).

Next we have 3 difficulty settings - Casual, Professional and Master. Casual is a completely new difficulty setting aimed at people unfamiliar with the series and those of us who wish to muck around without having to worry about cameras or dying right away (thanks to the huge increase in damage Agent 47 can take in this difficulty mode). Professional is essentially HITMAN's Normal difficulty mode renamed, and with an extra change - cameras that spot you with a weapon or illegally trespassing will alert nearby guards. Master difficulty is HITMAN's Professional difficulty mode but slightly easier in terms of challenge - there's more enforcers, and you still only have 1 save per mission, but most items that are visibly held are no longer suspicious.

In addition to this, all difficulties are available from the start and can be effortlessly selected without having to exit out and access another menu. Lastly 2 new gameplay modes have been added outside of the main campaign: Ghost Mode (a race against the clock killing targets with a silhouette of another online player who you are competing with) AND Sniper Assassin (a mode very similar to Hitman: Absolution's ""Sniper Challenge"" which has you sniping targets from afar and aiming to rack up a nice score - this can be played solo or with another person online).

As you can see quite a bit has changed since HITMAN, for the better I believe. So let's get onto pros and cons!


[h1]Pros[/h1]
[b]1.[/b] The game is no longer episodic
[b]2.[/b] 6 new maps that are of much more consistent quality than those that were offered in HITMAN and the NPCs on these maps have serviceable accents
[b]3.[/b] New gameplay mechanics as well as new ways to play HITMAN 2 outside of the campaign
[b]4.[/b] More unique and creative ways of killing targets
[b]5.[/b] A better story that answers a lot of questions HITMAN raised and even explores some of Agent 47's past
[b]6.[/b] A lot of additional free content in the works and continual live-content updates
[b]7.[/b] The game looks breathtaking at times (try out the Whittleton Creek map and you'll see nice shades of red and yellow that just make your jaw drop)
[b]8.[/b] The briefcase has returned - praise be!!! Sniper Rifles have been made an illegal weapon in this game, regardless of disguise, so the briefcase is now your best friend. Conceal that bad boy, go to a location, retrieve it (complete with an unpacking animation for some rifles) and deliver some Hitman justice 47-style. You can also use the briefcase to smuggle in other gear and even use it as a melee object at close and long-range. Have a rest fans of the Hitman subreddit: you did good, you did good

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1570177950

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
[b]1.[/b] [strike]Denuvo DRM - there is lots of debate on why it's needed and just how much impact it has on a PC but when HITMAN removed DRM years later, the effect on performance and stability was negligible at best.[/strike] This has now been removed!
[b]2.[/b]  Quite a few reskins of HITMAN's items - I understand why this was done but it's a bit disappointing

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[b]1.[/b] 6 maps (the first is arguably more of a semi-tutorial and thus this is a smaller offering than what HITMAN gave us campaign-wise)
[b]2.[/b] Always-online (already unlocked content can be used offline, but in order to unlock new gear you will need to be connected to the Hitman servers)
[b]3.[/b] Performance is slightly worse when compared to HITMAN and many echo this on the forums - it's especially worse on some of the HITMAN maps that were remastered and included in HITMAN 2 as the ""legacy pack""
[b]4.[/b] Stability - I've only had 10 crashes in my 180+ hours of gametime but a lot of other users have encountered frequent crashing
[b]5.[/b] More questionable decisions from IOI regarding time-limited content like Elusive Targets and a Christmas reskin of a map that was available permanently for HITMAN will now be time-limited for HITMAN 2 - this makes no sense!
[b]6.[/b] Gold edition for HITMAN 2 has an unreasonable price tag IMHO

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1595641125


To conclude HITMAN 2 is what HITMAN should've been thanks to its fun levels, extra polish and for the most part: listening to its fans. I do think HITMAN 2 and the series as a whole is often underlooked, and perhaps there's some valid reasons as to why that is the case, but I think the game and IOI is worth supporting simply because it's the last of its kind in an industry where Fallout 76 and Star Wars Battlefront II are all too often the norm. It's a breath of fresh air quite frankly and the game has amazing replay value if you dig semi-linear sandbox maps and the groundhog day gameplay where you're always revisiting a level and looking for another way to approach it and pull off that perfect kill.

With some more patches I believe HITMAN 2 can be a 9/10 game. A game that's incredibly hard to stop playing once you start... but right now I'll give it a 8/10. If you're a big fan of the series you should definitely consider grabbing it though.

I typically do not enjoy replaying the same thing again and again, but with this game the experience is very enjoyable, as there are just so many different angles to approach the objective at hand. Escalations and special assignments provide a completely new angle to already thoroughly explored worlds. And new and original content is still being added!
The world design is absolutely marvelous - huge and varied worlds, secret passages and beautiful scenery. And most importantly, the ""feel"" of the worlds is spot on. If I had to pick a favorite one, it would be very hard, as most of them are just so good.
Assortment of weapons, tools and other items is very nice and provides lots of freedom when completing your missions.
And the challenges, so very creative, truly enjoyable to do achievement hunting.

I find this entry to be a lot of fun, with great wit with the costumes, challenges both hard, easy, and silly, fantastic NPC convos, and an overarcing plot that continues from the 2016 game.  Some folks say they miss a big main story plot, but how many really play Hitman for the story and how many play it for the opportunity to wear disguises and slap someone with a fish?

ETA: It does get a frowny face from me for all the Murderball challenges in Isle of Sgail and for challenge completion being linked to Coop.  If coop doesn't work, you can't complete the challenges, and therefore no game mastery.  

ETA: However, I do absolutely hate that you can't restart an elimination at any point.  Because of occasional bugs - or NPCs magically hearing you break someone's neck behind a wall and a solidly closed door - you don't ever get to complete a challenge that appears only once.  It made me stop playing, as I never will have the chance to reach mastery no matter how hard I try, which had been one of the reasons to keep playing the game.

The games a great time killer and there are so many possibilities in game. Lots of targets and contracts, and many items to unlock.

Nominated for: ""Game of the Year (2018)""
Gold Edition is brought at full price on release date for this review.

IO Interactive did an amazing job on the release of Hitman 2, as it expands upon Hitman 2016 in gameplay without losing the formula of the latter. I have genuinely enjoyed every part of the campaign I have played so far, with new mechanics and items allowing for new playstyles.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Hitman (2016) Remastered: This is a really nice addition for those wanting to replay the HItman 2016 campaign with either items found in Hitman 2, or with minor level changes to make use of new Hitman 2 mechanics. I think there are also fixes which is a nice touch (such as Viktor giving Kurt akward stares when checking distractions instead of saying the corresponding lines). Anything you unlock in Hitman (2016) Remastered will be availble to use in Hitman 2 which is wonderful for those who wants to play the game in chronological order!
+ Soundtrack: Niels Bye Nielsen did amazing on this soundtrack, as I found some of my favorite tracks in an instant while playing this game. The whole set really gives off Hitman vibes throughout the entire playthrough so far, despite the different tone it has. I personally prefer this over Hitman 2016's soundtrack by a long shot.
+ Campaign Level Diversity + Replayability: My favorite part of the game, as there's always a different type of level for everyone whether it's a race tournament in Miami with understandly large people in multiple crowds (Miami is such a beautiful level, and has become an instant favorite for me. Give it a try!), or somewhere not as crowded such as Bagota (but still contains enough civilians to keep players checking over their shoulders prior to attacking targets). Every level is made in a way that encourages replaying the level several times as not everything can be earned in a single run.
+ New Game Modes: Ghost Mode and Sniper Assassin are the two new game modes added into Hitman 2.
[list]
    [*] Ghost Mode's mode is amazing to play with (and that says a lot as I'm usually a type of player that priortizes co-op over versus), as you compete against one other player in parallel instances of a game to be the first to achieve a total of 5 points through unnoticed kills, and avoiding non-target kills. Replacing static placements of items, Ghost Crates are a nice addition as they affect the other player as you take disguises or items that the other player could have benefitted from, encouraging players to scout to be the first one to reach item drops. There are also Ghost Coins which acts similiarly to standard Coins but it affects both players, watch out for coins thrown from your opponent! This is by far my favorite 1 vs. 1 gamemode. (Special thanks to Arn for playing this gamemode with me!)
    [*] Sniper Assassin is also quite a blast especially with a leveling system that upgrades your WA-2000 Sniper Rifle to perform better in later runs as you figure out new ways to shoot down your targets.
[/list]
+ Obviously, the additions of new items that serves it's own purpose.
   = That includes Briefcases, which I recommend in most if not all loadouts, due to it how useful it is in general. Examples include:
[list]
    [*] Being able to hide any two handed ranged weapon without raising suspicion compared to having it on your back and visible to everyone. (Especially Sniper Rifles, which are now considered suspicious regardless of disguise used!)
    [*] As a subtle off-hand melee/throwable that won't raise suspicion from anyone while it's being held unless you're caught attacking with it. Off-hand items are used when nothing is equipped in your main hand (as they take priority over off-hand items)
    [*] However, it does have it's own disadvantages. Such as being automatically left behind on some climbing actions (especially ones involving shimmying on ledges). It also does not bypass frisks if there's an illegal item inside of it!
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Elusive Targets unlock system: While straight forward, I still don't like seeing unique outfits or items (even more if a said item has unique stats of it's own) locked behind limited time events as it leaves those who brought the game later behind (by how much depends on how many items that aren't reskins are added).
- Online-only: While I get why this is required for some things (scoreboards and Elusive Targets are okayish examples), the game still relies too much on maintaining constant connection to both Valve and IO Servers at all times, which could be a problem if you're unable to play at all without your inventory should you lose connection at any given time.

If you previously owned Hitman (2016):
... and expected a brand new game, then it might not be for you.
... and expected a decent expansion pack that brings more to what you already have, then go for it!

If you currently don't have Hitman (2016):
I still recommend this game, even at full price which I had no problem with the expectation of high replay value.

After a few months, I might have easily missed some Elusive Targets and didn't take the time to unlock items (I still need to contact IO Interactive regarding the Measuring Tape that was supposed to unlock for me) but I still enjoy the time I had with what I already have!",1542930694,1574793142,True,2,0,0.552238762378692627,0,True,False,False,76561197988573761,362,3,7682,0,2530,1573070539

Right now it is sitting at a 5/10 and here's why.

Once you get about halfway through the story, you come to a mission where you are in a badass castle and it is a fun freaking mission. As soon as it ends, the story leaves you on a large empty spot and before you can question why it feels like an ending, the credits roll. I was very confused because up until that point the game didn't really feel like it gave you enough information and it almost felt like a filler episode. Afterwards, the game pointed to a a group of missions which were the rest of the story, all of these missions were sitting behind a paywall of $40. 

This game again is great, but the fact that I spent around $40 because I thought I was getting the full game, then I realize that I only bought a single part of it is ridiculous.

This game is great! Not only does it have tons of replay value ( contracts, storylines, etc. ) but it is hilarious as well. The fact that when you kill a target in front of everyone, and hide out for 10 minutes, their partner who is still alive, has no idea that his partner got murdered, its like the thought of cell phones are non existent in the Hitman universe. Besides that loophole, this game is is really fun and lets you be creative in how you manhit through it's many modes.

The strength of both games, i.e. unprecedented flexibility and intuity to access and execute assassination missions, is as well the greatest weakness. The major puzzles are basically to find the right disguise in order to get around and get access to and assassinate the target. It is relatively easy two times around but thereafter it can get heavy. In addition to a lot of patience, I often found that improvisation led to time-consuming and frustrating dead end search of ways out when trying new playthroughs. Savings and reloads are often needed as it is easy to alert NPCs and get caught when trying new routes and it can be a irritating due to online requirement of both games.

60,57573678,english,"""Hello 47, Diana speaking...""

Let's get this straight, with everything that happened between IOI and Square Enix, I consider this game and HITMAN 2016 kind of one and the same, HITMAN 2 just expands on H2016 without the limitations that brought the discord between both companies. But also without the fantastic CGI animations unfortunately. But it's the only aspect that was affected by the split between these two I'd say.

This game is something that I and probably many others dreamt about when we were kids/teens.

With a total of 17 different locations, 6 from HITMAN 2016, 8 completly new places and 3 of them being Sniper Maps, IOI makes sure to bring you around the world, making you feel the vibe, the culture and, after ""some"" criticism, the accents of all these different countries where you will find yourself gazing at the beauty of the scenary.

From the warm and colorful horizons of Sapienza in Italy, to the political discord and riots of Morocco, to the over-crowded racing track of Miami, to the militarized jungle and swomp of Colombia, to the quiet and peaceful streets of Whittleton Creek, and much more you can rest assured we're not left short on exploration and some great eye candy.

Let's not forget about the insane amount of lore and personal details about every targets and most characters.  As always, mixing a serious tone with well made over the top slap-stick and parodic humor, HITMAN knows how to bring its intrigue with its dark story as much as it will make you laugh at so many caricatural situations. You will sure find yourself loving, hating, caring, thinking, about a character or another.
Everyone has their own traits, their own story, their own quirks. Where Absolution was exaggerated and god awful, everything is in place here. It is well balanced and always interesting.

Ezra Berg the chemist.
Dawood Rangan the megalomaniac.
The Delgados are coming back.
Or my personal favorite, Silvio Caruso the broken overthinker.

It's just fascinating how, other than with what tried to be done with Absolution, Hitman has always been more centered around you and your targets rather than a whole and well constructed story but still, IOI manages to pull out some short yet simple and effective plot devices. It's not there to be the best story line ever but it does what it does and it does it well. Which makes it just perfect in my opinion, if you can get what I mean.

You connect the dots with the cutscenes, but the big picture is formed only by your curiosity and patience, by listening to conversations between characters themselves or by collecting intels about them. In game.

Analysing your targets by yourself, as a hitman should do, that's what you do.

The soundtrack is atmospherical and classical.
It will make you feel the vibe of the moment, more relaxed when roaming around freely without trespassing, putting you on your toes when sneaking and subduing someone, or making you on the edge in gunfight. Nothing bad to say about it. Always fits the situations.

Add to that the Escalations, Elusive Targets, the Contracts mode, the multiplayer Ghost mode... This game has just so freaking much to offer. 

Despite some bugs, I consider this game to be the best Hitman game ever made but also one of the best games ever made, all categories included. This is a game that goes beyond it's art to make you feel like you're in there, lost in its universe, different countries in the same world, a fictive version of our world, living the moment, and not playing a game. Immersive is the word.

There's so much to say...
I know there's an obvious lack of negatives in my review, I could talk about some issues with the Glacier Engine, which brings some AI and controls issues sometimes but, honestly, the game is so good that the flaws we could point are pretty forgetful, mostly technicalities... Most of the complains anyone can come with can be explained and/or pretty much excused.

Buy this game.
Now.

The great graphics, the smooth and extremely open gameplay, the utterly incredible worldbuilding, the ridiculous amount of details, the insane replayability, all wonderfully put together in an unforgettable experience. I cannot recommend this game enough. 

This masterfully crafted game will send you on the best power trip in gaming. You are a hunter surrounded by potential prey, in a world you manipulate to make others do what you want them to or to make them suffer the consequences of their carelessness. You can be an unseen shadow or a feared marksman, a killer leaving a message or a bloodlustful man-machine. 

Every time you play on a map, you will discover more and more of the countless secrets, you will learn to know every nook and cranny by heart, you will know some characters better than they know themselves. And even after hundreds of hours of gameplay, you will still be amazed at the level of detail present in this wonderful game. There is always another surprise, a better route to take, another assassination method to try out. 

All of that comes with a wonderful team of developers who will actively interact with the community and will keep in mind the public's opinions when updating the game, much to the delight of players. The price may be on the high side, but the game is worth every single penny, and if it helps the developers continue following their passion, all the better.

I bought this as a bundle on steam super sale. Back when it was just a few missions at full price I thought it looked over priced. Turns out it was.

Something that I found frustrating about this game is that you cannot keep what you find; meaning that you are limited to what the devs have decided are the hitmans weapons. A very limited set of weapons are unlockable through a leveling system. I really miss the old games where if you found a random gun and completed the mission with it, it was yours to use in the future. There is also a startling lack of diversity in your allowed items. 

Most guns seem to use the same ammunition for example pistol ammo, shotgun ammo, rifle ammo, smg ammo. It doesn't seem to get more complicated than that unless you include some of the ridiculous unlockables like the 5mm pistol which can only have 5 rounds. 

The rating system for you missions seems to be completely pointless unless you care about online rankings. Because of this I am completely unmotivated to even try for silent assassin. 

I find it annoying that you can only go into a mission with 3 or 4 items but once you are there you can carry as many concealables as you want. 

FUN FACT: a lock pick eats up as much storage as a pistol, even worse... so does 3 coins...

Recoil on firearms is insane, especially if you consider that this guys only purpose in life is to use these firearms effectively. Some people say its super realistic that way, but If realism was a concern they would not have a coconut explode on impact when you throw it at a persons head. (although I did laugh at that)

Weapon damage seems completely off base. you can put a 3 round burst of what is presumably .223/5.56 into a target and they will either fall over and get back up or shudder from being hit. it's asinine... same goes for shotguns you can shoot someone 4 times and still not kill them.. what are these things loaded with bird shot? based on the crater it leaves in the wall when you miss I would say probably not. 

Unarmed combat is a joke.. Once you enter it you cannot leave and it is completed by a series of button presses picked by the computer. What's even better is that if the computer engages you in melee you can't just refuse and run away; so while you are forced to enter into this interaction you are being lit up by others around you and likely wont survive the encounter. pretty lame way to go out if you ask me.

As far as the levels go themselves, there is a lot to do but it all feels forced to me. For example to get credit for killing people in unique and interesting ways you have to do it exactly how the devs wanted you to. So if you do not follow the script that they have laid out you are out of luck. I found many times that over the course of a play through I had completed steps A,B,C, and E but missed D on my own and did not get credit, but step D was to be wearing a specific costume or something stupid. So you are forced to follow the 'mission stories' to get your experience to unlock the very limited weapons selection and perks of each level. 

FUN FACT: you have to unlock the lockpick. 

The levels are large but honestly mostly feel the same. They are artistically pleasing to look at but just lack something that I can't quite place.

It's not all bad though. They have made vast improvements on the ai over absolution and your ability to blend in and avoid detection.",1574272494,1574279230,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197968948853,225,10,4334,0,4334,1574215111

I have not only played but worked to get the Silent Assassin rating on every Hitman game since Blood Money. I'm at the point now where I simply cannot recommend these games anymore. Not because they are bad, but because they are so stupidly expensive and monetized for how little you get.

Blood Money had 13 missions (about the same as Hitman 1 and 2 combined) and, even at release, costed a mere fraction of what these games do. I bought Hitman 2 for $24 and I honestly don't think I got my money's worth. 7 missions, only the last of which I found satisfying. The story campaign on Professional took me 7 hours to complete. Oh, do you want two more missions? That will be $40. Like hell.

If you bought everything for both games at retail with all DLC, my quick math tells me that'd be roughly $180. Let's be clear, this is not a $180 game. Not even close.

It's disgusting what IOI has done to this franchise and I simply can't support it anymore.

52,57230762,english,"As a piece of software:
Hitman 2 is one of the most feature-complete AAA games you can purchase. It's strongly reminiscent of Left 4 Dead 2 in the way it contains the entirety of the first game (Hitman 2016) inside of it as an inexpensive expansion pack of sorts. For people who have grown tired and cynical of modern gaming Hitman 2 is a breath of fresh air in terms of value and completeness of the experience.

As a sequel:
Hitman 2 is extremely similar to Hitman 2016. If you didn't like that you won't like this. If you thought that was fine but were hoping for more innovation you might not be impressed. If you loved Hitman 2016 and want more content for that this will be right up your alley. Hitman 2 expands only slightly on 2016's mechanics, adding in the ability to conceal yourself in crowds and carry around items in briefcases. It does however add many new locations, most of which are expansive and far larger than 2016's locations, new guns and tools, and more of the elusive targets and escalation missions people were accustomed to with 2016.

As a standalone game:
Hitman is a particular kind of game for a particular kind of player. If you just want to hop into a story, play it through once, and be done with it, then Hitman will probably seem overly short and easy. Even the most casual player can probably ""complete"" (as in just kill the targets and escape) all the levels in Hitman 2 in under 10 hours. Each level of the game is designed to be replayed again and again and again though, allowing you to off your targets in limitless and creative ways and aim for higher levels of stealth and speed while doing so. This is why I consider Hitman to be more of a puzzle game than an action game. The combat is actually pretty awful. The game is not tuned around mowing down everyone between you and the target and in fact not one single target in the entire game can fight back in any way. In the typical case however, in most circumstances though you will probably not fire more than a few bullets from your silenced pistol if any at all. The fun is in figuring out how to eliminate your target with poison, or with a fall (or a falling object!), or making them eliminate themselves in some unfortunate accident.

Final Verdict: If the premise of this game sounds appealing then I STRONGLY recommend you buy this game. It's very well done and offers a ton of content.",1573842224,1573842224,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561197994863173,209,11,24863,0,22800,1597292177

Yes, the game is fun to play. The attention to detail is exciting. And for those who have traveled in the various locations within the game, it is well done. But! I have to add the caveats regarding the gameplay, the premise of the gameplay and the tone set by the developers. First I hated the intro in the previous Hitman as well about how the team who made the game was diverse... Who cares?? yes, its 2019 and you happen to have members of the human species who don't all share the same skin hue and geographical birthplace? Wow, you are really heroes. You mean that it wasn't all xy chromasones who created this game! wow, again heroes. The fact that they mention this at the begining of the games reminds me of sexual harrassment training at a workplace. It is there because it protects the interest of the company not because the company cares about its workers, I.e. when someone complains on social media or in a court of law they can say ""we had an racially diverse cast help create Mumbai!"".  On that note, my wife is Indian and spent a lot of time in and near Mumbai (bombay) I showed her the level ""Mumbai"" and she was impressed as was I. The level of detail is quite astounding and despite my rant I appreciate the work they put into the environment. I can only imagine they put equal work into each environment. BUT!!! after looking for 30 seconds my wife had only had one critique, and is why I am on this rant related to the attitude of the developers, she said. ""there are to many garbage cans"". I let everyone decide what that means on their own but suffice it to say, it is telling to what depth they are willing to delve into ""multi-culturism"". The game is fun and well made so Kudos! But, don't give me that crap about a diverse team. There is an element as with most open world games of, I walked 20 feet and no one remembers me.

The only really new adds are the maps and some UI improvements? 
The sniper missions are definitely a lot more fun. 
They did a good job on those!
Was one major improvement worth the price I paid though? 
Nope.

The most annoying shit on the planet:
If you accomplished a lot in Hitman 1, all those challenges, achievements you spend hours on, don't bring over to Hitman 2. It's a lazy developer gimmick ""They can just do it all again!""  (If you open Hitman 1 however, all your stuff is still there, say whaaaat?).

A big kick to the face is also how confusing AF all the DLC content / locations are. It's very sneaky and I know people who've mistakenly purchased the same thing multiple times (They are just vague enough about everything to convince you that you THINK you know what you're getting). So definitely do your research before purchasing something that you thought was all inclusive.

I would recommend this game simply because I thoroughly enjoyed Hitman 1 and how it was just a Hitman franchise game changer, but be aware that Hitman 2 doesn't really play like a stand-alone game at all, it's more like ""Here's a crap tonne of DLC on Hitman 1, but they're also not related...""

86,57079844,english,"Well, everything was going great for the first few missions, when towards the end of the Mumbai mission and with just one person left to kill  the game crashed. After checking for driver updates and minimizing all my graphic settings, nothing worked. The game crashes about every 2 minutes and I've re-loaded around 25 times, with the same results. I have a high end computer too. 

I also went online and found out that this  has been an issue for many other players. I'll test it again by starting a game in a different location to see if it's due to me spending too much time in a location. I'll also try it on casual mode to see if that helps any? Anyway, great game, but once it becomes unplayable like it is now,  the game goes from stud to dud. And I spent a lot of money on this game and got everything.  Who knows if technical support will hel or even contact me back? I shall find out. What a shame!

UPDATE: After further testing, I played the ""Another Life"" episode with no crashes, so, apparently it's my processor that needs to be upgraded. It seems that Mumbai and the ""Chasing the Ghost"" mission is just too much for my current processor to handle. I doubt that it's anything else. I'll just upgrade my processor and hope for the best.

90,57079574,english,"What's great about Hitman 2 is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. On one hand, it's a stealth-action game with incredible systems where you use whatever is at your disposal to assassinate some terrible people. 

On the other hand, it's a game where you go to a race track in Miami and slap people with a fish while dressed as a giant flamingo. 

Pros: 
The sandbox worlds built into the game are expansive and detailed, where if you think of a way to do something, you can probably do it. There are countless ways to complete a mission. You can be as stealthy as you want, only taking out the targets, hiding their bodies to ensure they're never spotted, and do it all in your suit, OR you can shoot everyone you see, kill your targets, and leave the location after a huge bloodbath. You can take the game as seriously as you want to or just knock everyone out with a didgeridoo. The choice is yours. Both methods are fun and nothing is better or more satisfying than the whelm of trombones as the successful mission theme plays while on your way to leave the area.

Cons: 
The game isn't perfect. The story is convoluted and dense, with too many actors competing for the attention of the player. It does a good enough job of explaining to you why you need to kill certain targets, but most of the time ends up feeling completely separate from the overarching story at hand. Some levels are too expansive and some of the extra content, such as the escalations and elusive targets, are a bit tedious at times. The main drawback of the game is that your online profile and your offline profile are separate. This means that if you can't get an internet connection, good luck trying to make progress on the game. For a single-player, full-priced game, it's annoying. Additionally, the sniper assassin mode is a boring addition that takes the worst part of the game and makes it the only thing you can do. Of course, this is an optional mode and can be skipped unless you're going for 100% completion

DLC: 
The Legacy Pack adds everything from the 2016 edition of Hitman, which is fine enough. Most of the levels are interesting and fun, but there is a definite decline in quality after the first few levels. The Expansion pass adds two great levels in New York and the Maldives, along with some lazy attempts at special missions. The first game delivered really over-the-top, interesting special missions that completely changed up several locations, whereas these just add very small changes and feel tacked on. The new sniper assassin maps are better than the one in the base game, though the sniper assassin mode as a whole is still underwhelming.

Overall:
Despite its flaws, Hitman 2 is a game that although I've beaten every level numerous times and have achieved Silent Assassin, Suit Only on every level, I still come back. The devs do a good job of adding to the game and although the online-only factor is annoying, it's still well worth the price tag.",1573615873,1573616143,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198069555544,275,1,6481,0,6038,1595893491

从这个角度来说的话它可能是最独特的解密游戏：作为解密游戏它的关卡可以做叙事做探索，而且所有的谜题有着统一条件的不同难度的挑战，谜题可以根着场景和角色无限的做下去。

技术上来说的话我总觉得 hitman 代表着开放世界游戏的终极形态，虽然说 npc 并不真的很聪明而且很多脚本，但实际上能做的东西实在太多了，你可以看他们走来走去吃喝聊天相互聊天，可以作伪装跟 npc 交互甚至说话，我估计能够想象的到的游戏内 npc 行为这个游戏都是支持的。牛逼的是具体到实现上 hitman 2 做的非常叼，游戏脚本多但是可以随时存档，比如 npc 讲话讲到一半你读档回来它就会说一半；npc 所有脚本化的行为都可以被意外和玩家操作打断，绝大多数情况下也会正常进行。

我之前一直以为这个是 mgs 的跟风作品，现在真的打下来来说的话，hitman 重启的这两作种种方面来讲真的是独一无二的作品。而且其实现在买 2 代里面加 dlc 可以体验 1代的所有关卡，所以可以直接买2代就舒服了。",1573568343,1573568343,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198027901054,419,38,6070,0,6070,1572433546

Gameplay wise, it's Hitman 2016 but more, and that's good. Hitman 2016 was the excellent result of 20 years of game development all leading to one perfect title that combined all of the best gameplay elements from across the years of hitman. Hitman 2 is just a refined version of that. All the good level design stuff from Blood Money with all the good and satisfying game design stuff from Absolution(with none of the strange grindhouse aesthetic).
I guess I should mention a few of the improvements over 2016...

The soundtrack was pretty lazily done for the previous title, but the composer seems to be coming into his own a bit more this time around. Still nothing to write home about, but I didn't want to turn it off at any point so it must be doing something right.

The crowds and grass act as cover now which is nice fun improvement that changed the way I looked at the older levels and is well capitalized on in the new ones.

There are no Colorados in this one! All of the levels have at least some public space, and even the private spaces come across as fun and interesting. Always glad to see designers learning from their mistakes.

The moment to moment writing is vastly improved. It feels like they actually hired someone to do it this time. I found myself stopping to listen in to conversations and reading target descriptions at higher frequency than previous. By the end, I was even invested some in what would happen.

So yeah, Hitman 2 (2018) is a must if you've played or liked any of the previous games (or just want some stealth action fun). It's only a shame that WB are the publisher.

The combat since Blood Money has continued to take a backseat; the AI in that game had civilians picking up weapons off dead guards in a last ditch effort to keep you from killing them (you know like real people would...), In this modern rendition not only are pedestrians defenseless mindless simps; the real lazy clincher is that bullets from guards seem to phase through crowds and only hit you.

Not much has changed since the earlyer days of the franchise in terms of core concepts, and that is broadly a positive thing. Instead of any new revolutionary concepts or quantum shifts in direction we get refinements on the things that made the series great to begin with. More enviromental deathtraps than you can shake a stick at, larger levels than ever before and a grand arsenal of weapons adn gadgets, although admitedly a lot of the unlocks on offer are simply cosmetics variation of eachother.

All of the maps from the previous entry have been ported over, including DLC content, meaning that there are   more maps to play and perfect than in any of the previous games. Each map is has a large list of challenges to complete and various scripted opportunities for setting of a kill, like previous games most of the replay value comes from returning to allready completed maps and trying different approaches, to help add some spice to this the contract mode introduced in absolution makes a return allowing for user made missions utilizing the existing maps in adition to IOI made challenges set within existing maps.

3,56791904,english,"I would like to start this review off with some scathing criticism of the shoddy, shyster marketing team for Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Before I do though, I must first direct scrutinizing eyes to the naysayers who no doubt exist as an insignificant but outspoken minority. 

""ThEy GoT yOu To BuY iT dIdN'T tHeY?"" or, ""ThEn WhY'd YoU bUy It?"" or, ""It'S oNlY fIvE dOlLArS!""

To such dull sentiments I respond: Nothing about the marketing of this game enticed me into buying every DLC for it. In fact if I didn't work hard in order to spend my money on frivolous endeavors, I'd continue to wait for the price of the game to drop even further in order to sate my oft-frugal desires. However, I was feeling frisky today and decided to drop some scratch during the sale only to start the game and find out that what they recommend for new players is locked behind a pay wall. 

I shall admit that despite this slimy, disgusting example of the most degraded parts of the gaming industry I can respect their technique; I mean I was so angry that I bought the game in spite. Spite against the developers, the company, or the game itself? No, just plain spiteful purchasing against the marketing technique. Perhaps this was their goal all along, to upset people into buying the game on a relatively nice sale, and all subsequent pay walled DLC? Perhaps I am simply losing my mind slowly and am actually ranting to myself...?

Nonetheless, this game has been enjoyable through the short tutorial missions that led me to discover their recommended mission play order for newcomers that is in fact locked behind their self-imposed pay wall. I purchased the extra DLC in order to get the remastered missions and I type this as I await the completion of said DLC downloads. My palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, and there is vomit on my sweater already, mom's spaghetti. I am nervous, but on the surface I look calm and ready... and in fact I am calm and ready for this product I just purchased twice over not realizing the most expensive edition was still lacking all the content to be done downloading.  

I advise not buying it until it gets cheaper, just to maintain some sort of moral superiority over the dregs so addicted to games they spend their money on gaming rather than food all while supporting the decay of modern gaming as a whole.",1573252993,1573253568,True,1,1,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False,76561198119338485,56,62,1516,0,146,1573667318

Even better than the fantastic Hitman (2016). A staggering amount of content (all of Hitman 2016 content is playable inside this game). Tons of unlockables that change the way you can play. Endless variety, incredibly replayable, filled with secrets and easter eggs, more challenges than you would ever even want to complete. Getting a suit-only/silent-assassin on every mission is extremely challenging (and optional). Plenty of firepower in the game if you want to blast your way through levels.

There are some downsides. The game needs an internet connection to play properly which is just total crap for a single player game. There's no technical reason for that, the game could just as easily download the current content and allow for it to be played offline. Elusive targets still suck, don't worry about having missed them or anything like that, they are less than 1% of the game's content, and among the worst of it anyway. No fully animated cutscenes (unlike the last game), but that was kind of an obvious budget-saving move due to IO's financial woes at having to buy back their IP from Square Enix.

Even when you try your best and plan out a hit methodically, even when you've found a seemingly foolproof plan, sometimes things will go wrong. For some people, that'll be the end of it. They'll either just pull out whatever weapon they have and start blasting or give up on the game.

However, for some people they'll want to figure out what other approach might work. They'll see the game for what it really is, which is essentially a sandbox game that gives you all kinds of tools to use in your assassination attempts, and it's up to you to decide how to use them.

If you can accept that the game can mess up, that some things will be wonky, and that you might be mad at the game once in a while, I think you'll experience all the positive things the game has to offer and you won't regret giving it a chance.

Absolutely, positively, 100 %, wholeheartedly recommended purchase.",1572812107,1572812107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198049937017,260,22,13021,0,12855,1576607017

I have disabled Autosave. I've updated DirectX. I've played with memory allocation, even though the crash doesn't seem to be associated with a shortage in memory. I've played on minimum graphics with no success. I have found no solution to the problem, and the problem is a year old. It's extremely frustrating. I'm plagued by the ""Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered."" error.

EDIT: Launching the game with the setting ""-dx12"" (to force the game to launch with DirectX 12) seems to have fixed the problem on my PC. I finally found a thread on the Steam forums which seems to have thoroughly investigated the problem.

Hitman 2 continues the story and delivers the same great stealth gameplay in overwhelmingly large, highly detailed environments. This game brings many improvements, like being built on a new engine and adding sniper challenges. New gameplay elements have been added that make the experience very reminiscent of Hitman: Blood Money. And you can play Hitman (2016) in Hitman 2 by purchasing the Legacy Pack.

Unfortunately, Hitman 2 also suffers from the same problems as the previous game. A constant internet connection is required, meaning the game is completely unplayable if you are forced to go offline. The game heavily relies replayability, which is actually just playing the same missions over and over again only doing something slightly different each time. Anyone who says you can get 100+ hours out of this is either really bored or lying. And they are still selling these games using predatory marketing practices.

Once again, the Hitman team created a masterpiece that was soiled by a few major issues that should have already been fixed. If you played and enjoyed Hitman (2016), then Hitman 2 is definitely worth it. Even if you didn't play the last game, you can play it here on the improved engine (requires Legacy Pack) and get a more complete experience.

You can't buy the gold upgrade if you don't have the silver already and you can't buy the silver separately anyway, so this only really applies to pre-orders, which had a different selling system to what is being sold right now....

Sniper level guns/unlocks you can't use in the main game anyway, so they're pointless, unless you really like sniping.

Believe it or not though, this is better.  The new mission unlock rank method does seem inferior to the cash payouts and the hideout from blood money but EVERY single other thing in the game is an improvement.   Theif, Splinter Cell, and Hitman remain pioneer franchises in stealth that show many others how it is don even after all this time.  Maps are varied and interesting, as are your targets, ESPECIALLY some of the elusive targets.  Chasing down Gary Busey as he runs off yelling, ""you'll never catch me, I have the power of invisibility!"" is beyond priceless.  Sean Bean makes a great target as the undying as well, very clever and funnny. 
 Agent 47 is as hilariously threatening and deadpan as ever with his targets who never understand his comments are literal and not figurative.  Levels are more layered and replayable than ever & there are well over 50 hours of fun thin this game if you get the legacy package with the last games missions and another 10 hours at least for the DLC.

Actually, this isn't much of a ""game"" at all in my eyes, it's more of a barebones tech demo. 

You will play levels over and over again, first to find out where targets walk, where items are, etc, then again (and again) to carry out the mission and complete optional challenges. Long stretches of time will be spent crouched in a corner, literally just waiting for a series of events to transpire so you can anticlimactically walk over and whack them over the head before walking to an exit and ending the level. It felt more like the game was testing my patience rather than any sort of skill.

The idea, is apparently, to allow players a big beautiful sandbox of things to mess around with, but for me, I just wanted interesting and fun challenges.

The attention given to the story is to be commended, as well; it is not at all unusual to hear two NPC talking about something that happened in the last game, or to run into a character from several episodes earlier. The way it all fits together is really impressive (the slideshows that have come to replace most of the cutscenes between the episodes, much less so). As a game, as something that is supposed to challenge you, however, it utterly fails. The AI has not only seen no improvement since Blood Money, it may have actually gotten worse. The enemies are borderline deaf and blind, have the reflexes of a turtle and no brains whatsoever. Want to get rid of all the guards on a level? Just kill one, hide nearby, wait for someone to find the body and bring more guards, then kill them too. Repeat until all of them are dead. Yeah, that STILL works. Not that it's needed; I got the Silent Assassin rating in a couple of episodes on the first playthrough, and I wasn't even trying. The elusive target missions are more difficult, but not by much; basically, they are about taking the time to follow the target around and learn all of their movements, formulating a plan, testing it by stunning the target first (as long as the target is alive, you can restart), then, if it works, putting it into action. They are not challenging so much as they are time-consuming, which is not to say they are not fun and rewarding.

32,51173988,english,"I would love to give this game positive praise, and it is actually a really great game so far. My problem is the shady marketing method they are using to market this game.  Essentially what is happening here if you do not buy the Standard edition which gives you the license for the whole game and you buy the Miami package you're paying for a demo at 11 dollars. Lets say you really like this game, instead of having something that sells you the rest of the maps in the standard edition if you bought the miami package you now have to buy the standard edition at full price, so essentially at this point you've spent over 70 dollars on the game, ontop of that their season passes are deceptive as hell. One pass sells you the first recent hitman game that was Dev'd in 2016 for 19.99 and isn't all that clear that that is what you're getting, so if you bought that, plus Miami, plus the standard edition you're spending upwards of 90 dollars on this game which is outrageous. The game is great, the shady Business model is not. At least CDprojket respects their playerbase enough to not pull shit like this. 
I mean their model is so shady that even Steam is trying to prevent it, you get two warnings leading up to purchase of the standard edition that you actually technically own this game and that steam isn't providing you with another copy. They are making you pay for a license twice essentially is what's happening, they are cashing in on the poor consumer twice. Anyone who has money to spend isn't gonna care but any gamer who is looking to get value out of their money on this game, should just buy the standard edition. Go in feet first and don't get ripped off like i did and you'll likely super enjoy the game. It's just bitter sweet cause I feel like I haven't been ripped off by a game company in awhile, guess I just avoided the ones doing it until this point.
I've put a decent amount of time into the game at this point and it is very fun, even pretty much 100 percent the first 3 missions. 
I have once again edited this review to ell people not to buy the 11 dollar editions of this game (they started changing the names of them to try and make it look like the people who gave them bad reviews are lying) I see the people struggling like I did saying they've bought this game 3 times.

33,55613187,english,"Such a fun game. If you like the premise of planning out an assassination and spending hours exploring large maps to learn their ins and outs, discovering all the creative, tricky and fun ways of eliminating your target; you'll love Hitman 2. They've improved on a lot of things since the 2016 Hitman, adding more content, maps and features. You can also play all of the Hitman 2016 content in Hitman 2. Hitman 2016 was one of my favourite games to play, yet I was able to uninstall it because all of its content was available on Hitman 2. It offers so much and if graphics are a big deal to you, it looks outstanding. There are so many different ways to play the game too, offering dozens of play styles. There are hundreds of challenges you can achieve across all of the maps, completing these give you mastery for each map and rewards you with cool unlocks which you can then take into missions to help you as you travel around the world in each sandbox map. You may not even spend time actually assassinating your targets, you may just explore and enjoy that. There are community challenges and escalations as well which are really fun, along with the Illusive targets which add stress because you only have once chance to eliminate a new target. If you get it wrong, you fail. All of this is well worth the price and there's more to talk about, but I'll summarise below:

+ Great Diverse Maps
+ Excellent Visuals
+ Loads Of Challenges
+ Good Unlocks
+ Very Good Appeal To Replay
+ So Many Ways To Play How You Want
+ Improved Voice Acting
+ Better Than Hitman 2016

+ Combat Is Good Overall
+ Many Extra Challenges / Content That Are Still Being Added Currently
+ Ability To Compete With Friends In Leaderboards
+ Very Good Scoring System

A race track in Miami, a small town run by a cartell in Columbia, the slums of Mumbai a small suburben vermont town, and a castle that the 1% gather at once a year. Each level has a couple of targets that you are tasked to eliminate. It is incredibly open ended. You can burst in guns blazing, quitly elimite guards as you make your way to the target or set up intricit accidents. The targets have their own personalities are intresting to learn about. The levels feel like a living, breathing world that you are dropped into. 

One of the best parts of the game is the atmosphere. The music, lighting, and massive set pieces make the game so much better. Even levels that are not as good, such as the Isle of Sgail, are amazing to walk around in. As you play more and more you unlock new items. These can include explosives, poisens, knives, guns, new suits, and more. 

The game also includes many side activities. The devepers often add in bonuses to existing levels. Escalation contracts being the most commen. In these you will have to complete a new contract in a pre-existing level, each time you play a new complication is added in. They also add in Elusive Targets. Elusive Targets are a new target in a pre-existing level. They are only around for a couple of days and you get one shot at them. If you lose, you lose forever, but if complete the contract, you are rewarded with new suits. Finally there are also player made contracts.

54,55456551,english,"I would love to recommend this game, but with every new update it gets worse and worse. Let me keep this short by just mentioning two of the regular occurrences in this game.

1) You sneak up behind someone while they are having a smoke or something. Nobody else is around. You smash the back of their skull with an object of some sort. You are instantly in ""Engaged"" mode. You look around in and out of instinct mode trying to figure out who could have possibly seen you. There is nobody there and no noise. After a short, but not that short, time someone runs around from the other side of a bush to combat you. So the enemies can see across the map and through foliage. Fun.

2) You sneak up behind someone while they are having a smoke or something. You proceed to attempt to smash the back of their skull with an object of some sort. They whip around, pulling a 180 at a rate that should snap their neck from the whiplash. Due to this inhuman superpower you are now ""Compromised"" because they saw you before they went unconscious. Fun.

These were always problems, such as being spotted from the 2nd floor through a seam in the textures when you are in the g-d basement, but they were relatively rare. But with the latest update it is almost constant on the newest map. It's lazy development.

Edit: Sorry, I lied about the two. I have to add a third. Somehow they fked up the physics so a good 20% of the time you toss something it bounces like a flubber-based superball around the room in a comical way.

My first hitman experience was Hitman 2: Silent Assassin (2002) on ps2 i think, i spent days on grinding silent assassin on all levels. 

And it was glorious. 

Contracts and blood money continued giving good gameplay and value to the series. 

I thought whole hitman was ruined when i tried absolute mess that was absolution. 

Now, onto hitman 2, you can play first ""season"" on hitman 2 engine, and i have 0 hours on Hitman (2016) even tho i own the game, but for that reason, solely.

 And hitman 2, melds not only both games, but previous established lore too, as a complete continuation of story. 

Story is executed good, and its tbc at the time of writing this. 

 The gameplay itself: its very much of perfected style mixture:
 bloodmoney/contracts/ hitman2: silent assassin and bit of absolution

Plus frame stutters and very poor performance. When i played on the 1060 i got none of those issues. 

But with the amount of the game i have been able to play (first 2.5 missions) i love it. It brings me back to the days when i would play Hitman Blood Money. You really have to think and plot ahead for your kills and i love that about the game.

95,45800705,english,"Rarely are the words ""More of the Same"" a compliment, but today they are.

Hitman 2 is an example of ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" and with that in mind it's pretty much exactly what they did. This isn't so much an entirely new game as it is ""season 2"" of the previous game Hitman(2016).

If you were a fan of Hitman (2016) this is a must-buy, it's everything that made that game functionally good along with quality of life improvements, more maps and two new game play modes.

If you were not a fan of Hitman (2016) this will NOT convert you into being one. 

----EDIT:  post release----

Specific notes: 

The story is absolute garbage, this is Absolution level of bad when it comes to story. Thankfully most of us are not really playing for the story and the game play is solid, fun and ""more of the same"" from Hitman (2016). Contracts mode will ensure true fans can get 100's if not 1000's of hours of replay from this.

Sniper Assassin mode and Ghost mode are still being expanded. Ghost mode is receiving regular updates and more maps. Sniper Assassin has two additional locations from the expansion pass.

The main game is short (like the last one), if you are a ""one and done"" player, go away, this isn't even the franchise for you let alone the right game within the franchise. All of the value here is in the replay, there's 100+ hours of challenges already in the game and 100's more hours in contracts mode. 
----

Also if you own the previous game you get all of it's content remastered here for free with the quality of life changes. If you don't own the previous game you can purchase the legacy pack for a discounted price (cheaper than buying the last game).

One of the best parts of Hitman 2 is replaying the old levels remastered.

If you want a total content list, versions legacy and DLC explained, road maps for monthly and yearly content or even just an unlock list, I manage all of that information in these guides as best I can:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1580201161
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1581951243
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1564548508

And if you're a contracts player, this might interest you:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1582003916

This isn't just single player, it's single player with a community and monthly content updates. Though you may want to join the Hitman Forums and not just steams forums if you really want to be part of it.

-----

Bottom line;

Don't buy this for the story, don't buy this thinking it has real coop, don't be an idiot and pretend this is a pure shooter.

But if what you are looking for is season 2 of the last game (which was season 1), this is more of the same clockwork-puzzle-stealth-assassin-game-play with some quality of life improvements and for those of us into contracts, that's enough for me.

I have only found one game breaking bug which was introduced in an ""elusive target"" mission which are weekly(?) special missions that appear and can be completed only once. The target is generally one of the NPCs of the levels or an extra NPC dropped into the level so using a wrong method of killing them may cause trouble.

98,54877991,english,"This review here is for HItman !. I wanted to post this under Hitman 1 but I didnt play the game through there, I used Hitman 2 to play this. I plan on coming back later and adding review for the hitman 2 campaign and dlc.

HITMAN 1 -18 hours of great gameplay to complete the main campaign and Patient Zero campaign. I played this as the GOTY edition, and did it through Hitman 2, so I was playing with any enhancements I got through HItman2.

Overall it is much like the rest of the series, not too different. It does have what are called Story missions, little stories inside of the mission that you start out by over hearing conversations. One you click on follow, you get prompts to go places and continue. If you do that, it helps you assassinate your targets in really creative ways! I think you can turn off the markers that tell you where to go if you like more of a challenge. I really liked this feature, and it provides a lot of replayability since you can redo the mission and play through them all. I did that on a few of the missions when I found some really neat ones.

Graphics and sound are top notch and it even has a simulation setting that makes use of your 6 or 8 core processor! Something I have never seen. I played it on UWS 3440x1440 right out of the box and it was wonderful. I used a sound card with dolby 5.1 surround and that was great too. You wont be disappointed, i can assure! I did play it though through Hitman 2, so not sure if some of those features were enchanced.

If you like the rest of the series, then this is a must buy! If you like stealth games then you will like this too, so you could play this as your first Hitman game. It does build on the character we know from the rest of the series, and i played through it in order myself from the very first hitman. You dont have to do that though to enjoy this. The story in this game can stand on its own.

Ok, played through the HItman 2 campaign and enjoyed that as well. Not sure which one I liked more. Both were very challenging for me. The ending of this is very anti climatic though because it leaves you hanging until the next Hitman game I think, unless there is another episode due out but that seems unlikely. Took me about 17 hours of play to get through all of the missions in the main storyline and do a couple of side missions on the main menu. I did replay a few missions too to get the other stories.

The 2nd game has a lot of replayability as well. I replayed a few missions to get the different stories and there is another mission mode that has unique targets but uses the same maps as the campaign. Those were fast and fun to play through. There is a multiplayer but in the lobby I didnt find anyone to play against. i didnt wait longer than 1 minute, maybe someone would have come along.

I recommend picking up the package I have that allows you to play all of the Original Hitman missions as well as Hitman 2.

It appears that there are some ""bonus missions"" that I havent played yet.Just did a couple of them. Going to do all of those too, so there is more than 17 hours of gameplay to finish all of the missions you get in the package I have. i have all of the DLC. The bonus missions dont have a new map but they do have new targets with a developed story behind them. One of them is a movie star that plays a character like Iron Man or Robocop.

So you may or may not have been triggered by the title of this review to read through here.
And good for you because I have valid arguments as to why HITMAN™ 2 is the game for your Steam Library.

[h1] WHAT I ENJOY [/h1]

The game is very similar to its progressor HITMAN™ however the game does supply us with new maps, a new storyline and more smaller additions. [b] If you have always wanted to be a sneaky hitman going about his job silently and in a tactical manner, this is the game for you! [/b]

The gameplay is very broad, there are different ways to play through 1 map. [b] ATLEAST 3 EVERY MAP! [/b] And more for your creativity to figure out. There are not any bad points I could mention regarding the game, if it fits your game 'style' preference then you will be pleased. If not then not, simple as that.

All in all, the game is worth it at it's price, making for hours of great entertainment.

Hitman 2 is an iterative rework of the formula set up by 2016's bold Hitman reboot. It's the best Hitman game so far, and I'd absolutely recommend it wholeheartedly. It's just a bit of a shame that they didn't take some more chances, in favour of offering up a slice of the same excellent stealth gameplay.

Pros
Tightly designed levels
Fun stealth gameplay
Not as punishing as before
Cons
Not as punishing as before
Lots of gadget repetition

Death has come in many forms: the barrel of a rifle, a barber’s razor, a tattoo gun, a faulty gas valve. Death has come for every one of 47’s targets, several of their guards, a few police officers and, ok, a couple of innocent bystanders too.

It hasn’t always been clean or efficient, but I’ve finished Hitman 2 over the course of the last week. This means that I’ve only just scratched the surface.

There are six new locations in the game, in addition to a reworked tutorial segment that is largely identical to the first game albeit with some minor alterations. In addition, every mission from the first game can be played in Hitman 2 via the game’s legacy pack, with the addition of the most recent game’s new bells and whistles.

Each of these locations is like an onion, inviting you to peel away at its layers. One map, which dumps you into American suburbia is a great example. at first glance you’ll see your targets fortified house, and the nearby security hub of his dedicated protection team. Look closer and you’ll see a mailman, garbage disposal guys, a cake business.",1567429594,1567429594,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198844404714,93,5,1049,0,837,1578409951
34,54925868,english,"Hello my fellow legion, 

You're probably wondering whether or not I like this game (or not wondering at all). I think that it is a phenomenal game and here is why. The direction they took with the recent Hitman games is vastly different than Absolution and for what it is worth is absolutely the right move. The gameplay is fun and smooth with the added enjoyability of the individual stories you can find within the game to complete your mission. Is it easier than older Hitman games? Yes. That is not necessarily a bad thing as previous Hitman games had a broken detection system that struggled under its own weight. The exception though is Blood Money which is still arguably the best game in the series.

I feel that the atmosphere with Hitman 2 is perfect with so much going on around you that there is a large amount of replayability. The added challenges and timed targets also add substance to the game. My only gripe, however, is the cutscenes. They are a downgrade from the Hitman reboot prior to this game and I feel they don't add much impact to the game. This is a personal preference and is in no way an attack on those who like the cutscene style.

All of this being said I 100% recommend this game from the short time I have played with it. I recommend if you have it or are planning to get it to take your time and honestly go after the challenges. You can always up the difficulty which I believe significantly increases the difficulty (I played on the midrange professional difficulty for my current playthrough).

Now, get out there and enter a world of chaos, conspiracy, and assassination for our favorite bald-headed killer clone, Agent 47.

37,54906398,english,"Average game, but still very enjoyable

Hitman 2 follows on the success of the first installment of this reboot and has many of the same mechanics and feel of its predecessor. The game-play is smooth and offers some little surprises and the graphics too feel a bit improved from last time around. But the stealth aspects are made even tamer this time which was a bit disappointing as it starts to feel very processed.

I've mostly played single-player and don't have any of the DLCs, but the multi-player is pretty terrible at least for my tastes cause Hitman needs a really advanced system for it to really work and CoD style matchmakings and clocked kill sprees are not really suited for it at all. Same with the ridicuilus sniper mode as it's the worst yet, with no freedom to do anything other than to point and shoot.. but it's not a shooter game, laughable. 

However, where the game really fails is in its story-line. Granted, the thread of the shadow client is still interesting and it's a good plot, but it's just not enough this time around. This just feels like point A getting to B without much ever happening and much of the potential is squandered on fulfilling tropes and genre thrills. And the absolutely horrific cut-scenes does not help this score one bit.

Still, it's a good game and even though it's one of the weaker Hitman installments, this new series still has more than enough potential and it's engaging enough that we fans should follow it with enthusiasm. Here's hoping that no 3 will be truly something to kill for.

41,52675071,english,"Hitman 2 is the successor to Hitman (often referred to as Hitman 2016 to avoid confusion with the original Hitman game released in 2000). Hitman 2 manages to improve on a number of factors but at the same time includes a few missteps of its own.

PROS:
+ Huge maps.
+ People behave far more intelligently and talk like real people.
+ Story continues from Hitman 2016 and seems far more cohesive and interesting than it did in the previous title.
+ Slight graphical improvements in many areas.
+ Extremely varied locations to visit. 
+ Tons of weapons and gadgets to unlock.
+ You can now take a briefcase that hides an item, such as a sniper rifle.
+ Includes campaign, contracts mode, ghost mode, and a sniper-only mode (which can be play co-op).
+ Lets you play Hitman 2016's missions if you own that game OR you purchase the Legacy Pack.
+ The developer keeps adding new missions all the time. Usually these are time-sensitive contracts, but they're still releasing campaign missions as well. On June 25, they released a mission set in New York, so presumably there's still more yet to come for this game. 

NEUTRAL:
+/- Some people have said that Agent 47 talks too much, and compared to previous games he definitely does speak more. However, he's nowhere near a chatterbox. He just seems somewhat closer to a normal person when speaking and personally, I like that. Obviously, opinions can differ, which is why I've left this comment in the ""neutral"" category. 

CONS:
- Everything you unlocked in Hitman 2016's missions is once again locked. You can't migrate your experience and unlocks from that game to this one. 
- Your offline and online profiles are separate and all of your unlocks are tied to your online profile. What this means is that you need to be online in order to access your unlocks. For many people this isn't an issue; perhaps a slight annoyance, but nothing too bad. That said, if you don't have a reliable internet connection, you might want to consider this before buying the game.
- Unlike Hitman 2016's CGI animated cutscenes, Hitman 2 has pseudo-still images. The images move in an odd, almost ""live comic book"" fashion, so while they're not really animated, they're not entirely still either. It's a weird look. The newest mission in New York returns to the fully animated cutscenes seen in Hitman 2016.

VERDICT: I really enjoyed Hitman 2. I thought it was a lot of fun and I'm still discovering new ways to take out targets. I know I wasn't a huge fan of Hitman 2016, but I honestly feel that they've improved on the formula with the sequel. 

If you own Hitman 2016, just purchase Hitman 2 and you'll automatically get the missions from Hitman 2016 added to Hitman 2. If you don't own it, then purchase the Legacy Pack if you want the full story (which isn't finished yet). 

If you enjoy stealth games, a huge degree of flexibility on how to complete your objectives, and like massive mission areas, I'd strongly recommend Hitman 2.",1561941117,1567177823,True,2,0,0.554140150547027588,0,True,False,False,76561197998348465,2680,73,4723,0,3263,1590119969

Summary:
Truly a Masterpiece among the Hitman games. Detail in each level and numerous ways to take out your targets. Mainly single player, but there are missions you can attempt with other players (I haven’t done these). I would suggest a gaming PC to play this. Each zone is HIGHLY detailed and during my gameplay, I did not encounter any bugs that were truly game breaking or chances to blow your cover. Sometimes a body would clip into the ground or objects causing them to spaz out. Usually dragging them to a different location fixes this. I encountered once where a weapon clip into a car when i took out an enemy and it was creating a constant clatter sound when in the area. Music doesn’t play a whole part into this game, but the sound effects are very well crafted. Generators, gun sounds, car sounds etc. are all spot on and timing is accurate as well. The main story is really only a few missions and could be completed in a days gameplay. But each level also has many many many ways to complete them and find locations and objects. So the grind will be real when it comes to completion. Also if you mess up you can revert to a save which is nice, but some challenges can only be completed if something else happens, which makes multiple playthroughs a must. The game also has weekly challenges that players can complete for minor rewards but also they have a fair challenge to them as well which requires tactics and the ability to revert a save if you fail is absent in these. If you mess up on the first day of the week. You need to wait till the following week to get a new contract. These are fairly fun to do. The biggest draw back I found was that a lot of the Hitman 2 campaign missions are actually locked behind a paywall. You need to basically buy the campaign for Hitman 2 after buying the game itself. Stupid yes, worth it? Possibly in some players eyes. I could not complete the final campaign mission for the game as i could not justify currently in buying it. I would HIGHLY suggest getting this game on sale and not paying full price just because of this format for the game that have. The game is very entertaining and is a must play if you enjoy tactical gameplay and the Hitman franchise.

50,54777128,english,"Introduction.

The New Hitman series Is very weird to me. It's fun and replayable but It doesn't have that Original Dark and Gritty Vibe that the Old ones had. Infact, This new Series Has a more 007 Espionage Feel to it. Which makes the new hitman feels closer to a James bond game. I mean I know Hitman not just for it's level design, But for its Dark and Violent atmosphere and also it's Haunting soundtrack.  And we gonna talk about Jesper Kyd very soon. Also i Gonna review Both The new Hitman Games Including the Season 1 of Hitman. But other than that, Let's start with the Narrative.

Story
The story is honestly not that important for you to care about. it just tells Agent 47 and his handler Diana Burnwood to just kill or assasinate a bunch of Powerful Shadowy people. Agent 47 in this game is very tame here in my opinion. Not as tame as Absolution but compare to blood money where in that game he's more of a Dick. There's one cutscene in blood money where he kills an innocent mailman. Like damn. And apparently he has more dialogue in this new Installments. I know 47 for his Cold nature, He's the Silent Assassin afterall. i think this is more for the Gameplay purposes which we are gonna talk about next.

Gameplay

If we gonna talk about Hitman other than it's atmosphere, It's always gonna be the Sandbox and choice. And Thankfully This New Hitman Is probably the best at it. The level design is the best that is ever been. Even making Blood money Levels Obselete. There are some stinkers like Colorado but for others like Sapienza, Mumbai, Miami Are just downright insane. These Places are Huge and Demand Replayability. Different plannings and Different Assassination Makes this game a Close equivalent to Groundhog day Which is Amazing. Other than the Expansive Level Design. It introduce Mission Stories/Opportunities. This is where My complain starts to shine in this category. These Mission stories are a collection Of Handholding experience for you to Assassinate People Differently. This Makes some of the Creative kills Easy to do and Discourages Exploration. In Blood Money. When you are dropped into the location, You basiccally have to figure out and explore plus experiment with the level design to achieve creative and satisfying assassination . In here, Because it's navigated you shouldn't be worry to much. I highly reccomend You to turn the Mission Stories navigation to minimal or off because it detracts from the experience. The shooting feels kinda off too In my opinion
If i have to quote from someone, It would have to be From ""MAMAMAX"". He said ""Dumbing down makes the game easier to play, but is much less fun and vice versa for the opposite. Intellegent games are harder to play, But they way more fun"".


Soundtrack
Because this game have a 007 Ambiance to it, It mostly packed with this Spy / EspionageComposotions. Which is fine But Compare to Jesper Kyd's Score, It's Just Weak. In contrast to Hitman : Contracts, The Soundtrack very Varried Compare to this. Here's one of the Songs From that game Named Sanitarium.
.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuHNKfWtffo&list=PL9087047C1887C20A&index=12

Hearing this While playing, Makes infiltration and Assassination very Tense and Suspenseful. And that's one of the things i like previous hitman games. It gives you this feeling of dread of Trying Your best to not get Exposed. In short though. The Soundtrack are not bad but they could have been better.


Conclusion
 Hitman 1 And Hitman 2 are Really Great Hitman games. But They're Missing the Elements that Made Hitman Special In my eyes. It's Missing Those Art Direction And they Dumbing down the experience For Newcomers to the series. the Point in this Review is that I'm not being Biased here. I try my best to Write an Honest review of a game. And My messeage to The upcoming new and young Developers who have a heart in Video games is that When you making a game, Avoid game design that resulted in a Dumb down experience like giving  players navigation of what to do. Instead, let the player do what they do. Make them experiment yet Challenged them because the Fun value is Astounding.

60,54711273,english,"Since this game basically contains the entirety of Hitman 2016 if you get the legacy pack, think of this as a review for both.

Hitman is a series that has continuously made marked improvements in each iteration. Even Absolution, which didn't really feel like a Hitman game added some things like the revamped body storage, tossed coins working more akin to how they should and the cover system. When Hitman 2016 came out, it brought the series back to form by taking the basic idea of Blood Money, adding the good stuff from absolution, and putting it into some absolutely massive and intricate levels. Absolution tried to address the meme of ""Why doesn't anyone realize they've never seen 47?"" but overcorrected by making [i}everyone[/i] wearing your outfit realize you don't belong. Hitman 2016 acknowledged that people seeing through your disguise is a good idea, but refined it with the enforcer system, where [i]certain[/i] people would see through you, but not all of them. Hitman 2016 was indeed one of the best stealth games ever, but it was missing certain things like the picture in picture and being able to use 47's trademark briefcase.

Enter Hitman 2. Just as Blood Money added a whole layer on top of Contract's refined take on the formula, Hitman 2 adds a new layer of systems and mechanics on top of the super refined Hitman 2016, along with heaps of content. Hiding in crowds, being able to see where a camera is looking, taking things in your briefcase, etc, all add a tremendous amount of depth to an already deep game. There is a staggering amount of not only main missions, but also challenges and of course Elusive targets, and new content is constantly being added. This is one of the few games that truly deserves the designation of a ""live service"" game and it's always a ton of fun to see what IOI comes up with.",1566285675,1566285675,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197997934524,1950,167,2934,0,2280,1587029195

64,54647216,english,"Another great addition for the Hitman series. 

Gameplay: They give you a big sandbox with lots of options and off you go. There are some setups that the game will hand hold you through if you want, but they are optional and can be changed around if you like. Lots of guns and gadgets to get the job done. The only real downside of the game is the AI can sometimes just fail horribly, especially when it comes to combat. 

Visuals: The game looks great, and runs super smooth, so no complaints. 

Story: Eh, there is one but it’s not terribly interesting. All the targets are bad guys so you never feel bad about killing anyone. 

DLC: So they release free content on a fairly regular basis plus fan made stuff which keeps the game fresh. They also release ‘new’ elusive targets monthly, unfortunately there have only been a few ‘new’ ones this year. Most are just recycled from last year, which kinda sucks. 

So far they’ve only released one map from the season pass, ‘the bank’. Whilst it was fun to run around in, the level doesn’t really compare to the rest. Hopefully the next map is better. 


So overall yeah it’s a good game which I would highly recommend. The season pass however I would not, only buy that when on sale.

The game was challenging but immensely satisfying to play, and the world was amazing. The sheer amount of detail packed into every level was amazing, but also crucial to the core gameplay. Everything seemed to flow together and have an underlying purpose, bringing a good amount of immersion into the game.  Hitman 2 does all of this in typical Hitman sandbox-y environments, but with slight modifications to mechanics.  It stays close to the Hitman formula, and delivers an equally great experience.

71,54566684,english,"I am a huge fan of the HITMAN franchise but I cannot recommend this.

Pros:

- Graphics are very good.

- Can play HITMAN 2016 with the new updated gameplay mechanics. 

Cons:

- Frame-rate is unstable as f*ck on most maps (Miami, Whittleton Creek, the Bank and the two DLC sniper maps). Even setting all graphics settings to low, medium or high, I tend to get the same FPS. I don't know much about tech sh*t but I am guessing it's an optimisation issue.

- Boring gameplay. NPC's have the personality of a stone wall, detection system is never consistent, they keep changing how Silent Assassin works in every few updates, the maps may be bigger than ever but are are bland as f*ck and at least three quarters of most maps are never really used unless getting the challenge to explore all areas. 

- Same sh*t as HITMAN 2016. All the challenges are pretty much what I did on the Xbox and PC version of HITMAN 2016 and HITMAN 2 has the same sh*t. Not improved at all. Alongside that, the game is constantly online so if you are in the middle of doing a run on Silent Assassin, Suit Only on the hardest difficulty and their servers go down. You lose all your progress. They have still kept with the boring Elusive targets and added so many crappy escalations and keep on releasing them every other week.

- They added Absolution's sniper challenge into this game but segmented the maps off to ONLY snipe the targets and all but one are paid for. 

- Crappy 1v1 competitive mode that literally anyone who has played the previous games doesn't give a sh*t about. 

- DON'T BUY THE DLC!

To finish this off, don't buy this game. As much as I hoped this would have been an upgrade from 2016. it isn't. Same sh*t, different maps. Also, I had that much trust in the devs that I bought the Gold edition (on release day) which cost £80. And for the extra I put in, all I get is sh*tty sniper maps, unoptimised small DLC maps and they release most of the game  free for everyone anyhow as the sales weren't so great.

9/10 

Honestly in my opinion the game is a really good game and I have a lot of fun doing all the challenges. It's also fun to just go on rampages and kill everyone *cough* Bigmooney kill everyone challenges *cough*. 

The game in itself is medium leveled, even at the hardest difficulty. As long as you have a few hours on the game and know what you're doing (knowing map layout would help) silent assassian and suit only is very fun and quite easy, I've completed all of them without the use of any guides.

The story is also very intriguing with very fun levels and even more to expand on. Also the controls are very easy to develop muscle memory for. The game also somehow improves my reaction time and aim.

I have on issue with the game that may not be an issue for others, its pricing. The base game is $60 which is fine, most good games are, but the expansion pass is $40 for a couple extra maps and some sniper assassian is not worth it. Legacy pack for $15 is worth it in my opinion.

The game also has a wide variety of suits, disguises, and weaponry so you can go at any angle you choose. If you can't buy the legacy pack which offers new suits that okay. You can get up to 8 suits from doing elusive targets (targets that happen around twice a month) and a Classic-All-Black-Suit from completing the challenge ""The Classics* for Hitman (2016)

This game is also a better buy than Hitman (2016) because it includes all the missions from there and has better graphics.

I discovered this game at a friends house who was a longtime fan of the series, I was vaguely aware of Hitman as a franchise but knew nothing about the new games, which is a shame because they are really great. The new games deserve a lot more attention than they get, especially in today's current market of AAA single player games. 

The game has both intrinsic motivation to play because you yourself want to go and complete challenges and kill targets in fun and crazy ways, and extrinsic motivation by rewarding you for doing challenges with new gear to take into missions and do it all again. 

The levels are all very detailed and varied, some are better than others but I don't think there is a single level I hate.

You can get hitman 1 and 2 and all the DLC for the price of one game during a sale, but I'd go as far as to say it would be worth it full price. They have events, new items, and new missions out all the time all for free.

Hitman 2 is the follow up to 2016’s Hitman reboot, developed by IO Interactive. If you’re somehow unfamiliar with the Hitman franchise, this is a series that’s all about assassinating targets and doing it in interesting ways. As the trailer says, you make the world your weapon and there are countless ways to kill your targets in each location. It’s an assassination sandbox series and Hitman 2 is the best entry into the franchise yet. I went into this game expecting to play through each level once or maybe twice, and I’m now 20 hours in having not even finished all of the levels yet. This game is so incredibly compelling, and the replay value is excellent. 

[h1]Positive: [/h1]
[list][*]Hitman 2 doesn’t seem to have much of a visual upgrade over Hitman 2016, but it looks fantastic either way.

[*]The locations in this game are incredibly well designed, personally I think they’re even a step up from Hitman 2016. The maps are all fairly large but remain incredibly detailed and there’s so many different things to discover and use to your advantage that it’d take a dozen hours just to see everything in one location. 

[*]There are so many crazy ways to kill your targets in each location. There’s obviously the regular stuff like the pistol you carry or your garrote, but there’s a wealth of stuff in each level for you to really get creative with. In one of the locations you can even get someone else to kill the targets for you, which I thought was really neat. 

[*]The AI is great. Most characters have a set schedule that they follow if they’re a mobile character (main targets or other people of interest) and guards or janitors etc. have small areas that they operate in. Following around targets to figure out what they do when is surprisingly enjoyable, especially once you figure out that perfect way to isolate them and take them out.

[*]The mission stories in each location are really good (much better than the ones in 2016 in my opinion). They’re really fun to play through and offer something of a tutorial for each location, they help you get a feel for the place that’ll help you later when you go freestyle. They are completely optional though, so don’t worry about being forced into doing anything. 

[*]Each location offers a huge number of challenges that are really what drives the replay value. For the most part, challenges are unique to that specific location and involve things like getting a certain disguise, or killing someone with a specific object. There are also the standard ones like suit only or silent assassination. There are also some off the wall ones which are a lot of fun too, the Hawke’s Bay level has some really fun ‘Shinobi’ challenges. 

[*]I found the story surprisingly compelling after not caring at all with Hitman 2016. The dialog is where the writing really shines though and its delivered with excellent voice acting. One of my favorite little things about the game is that 47 will often openly talk about his line of work in a way that seems innocent, often to the targets themselves.

[*]Having Hitman 2016’s content available in Hitman 2 is awesome, and has encouraged me to go back and play those levels again. It makes it feel like a much bigger game and it’s just really nice to be able to access all of the content in one place now.

[*]There are multiple ways to play outside of the story missions. Some of the locations have bonus missions with different targets and mini-stories. All of the locations have escalation missions that I’ve been enjoying, essentially you start with just one target and you play through it three or five times with different stipulations being added each time. There’s also a contract creator and community levels available as well as the sniper levels. [/list]

[h1]Negative:[/h1]
[list][*]Really the only thing that bothered me was that I couldn’t take more gear with me. You only have two slots for gear and you can also have something left at a drop-off location. This just didn’t always feel like enough to me, there’s loads of cool gear available and I wanted to be able to take more stuff with me to mess around with. [/list]

[h1]Verdict: [/h1]

Hitman 2 is the best Hitman yet. The levels are incredibly well designed, the challenges add huge amounts of replay value and there’s so much variety available in how you take out your targets. This game is absolutely excellent, and I’d consider it a must have for Hitman or stealth-genre fans.

36,51177128,english,"This game is just so fucking good. HITMAN 2 came out in November of 2018 and it's already one of my most played games on Steam.

This game was made to be played over and over again, and my god IO Interactive have succeeded at what they wanted to do. All of the levels in HITMAN 2 (as well as the season 1 levels, aka HITMAN 2016) are jam-packed with detail to the highest degree. I am still hearing dialogue that I've never heard before and still discovering little details in all the levels.

You start out without much tools or weapons, but that quickly changes as you complete the levels and different challenges that help you level up your ""mastery level"" for a specific map; which unlocks all sorts of different tools and weapons. This creates a huge snowball effect of replayability because you discover different killing opportunities in a level, in combination with unlocking new items. You also get to unlock different spawn points that already might have Agent 47 in a disguise, which offers even more ways to play.

In addition the main campaign levels, HITMAN 2 comes with a Contracts mode. This mode lets you assassinate different NPCs on a level that aren't the targets in the main campaign. This also adds a ton of replayability, because anyone can post a contract for anyone to play. You can even add backstories to the targets in the description boxes in the planning phase, where you can of course bring any tool, weapon, or spawn point you've unlocked.

HITMAN 2 comes with a competitive multiplayer mode and a single-player/cooperative multiplayer mode: Ghost Mode and Sniper Assassin. Both modes are fun in their own rights and are a nice addition to the main single-player portion of this game. I've spent a good amount of time in Ghost Mode and it's quite fun if both players know what they're doing. Sniper Assassin is decent and is a nice change of pace because you're sitting in a sniper's nest instead of running around in the main levels.

This is a ever-evolving game, there's always things being balanced, changed, and added.

If you're a new comer you play as a hitman and you get to come up with convoluted ways to kill your targets. You could hide behind a wall and pop them in the head with a pistol.. OR you can pick up some dirty frog juice and put it in a muffin and let him eat it..

Or you can throw em in the oven. place a bomb in the bathroom so he has an explosive accident. Yeaaaa shooting em in the face doesn't sound so appealing does it?

The instinct system lets you see people before they move around the corner so you can sneak past them. Adding even more options on how to get to your target.

The only draw backs to the game are the lack of missions and to a lesser degree the massive map size.

While HITMAN 2 does not have a really complex story I do like what they did with it here especially the twist at the end. But of course, you don’t play these games for the stories but for the gameplay. Being a Hitman (like it says in the title) you are given targets to kill these can be celebrities or drug smugglers, how you kill them is all up to you. Wanna draw your target to a food stall and poison him go right ahead. How about disguising yourself as a doctor and giving your victim a lethal injection that works too. Wanna go in all guns blazing you can do it but I highly go against. I think the “Make the world your weapon” in the title of the game really means what it says.

83,54090397,english,"I have played a variety of stealth games such as Mark of the Ninja, Shadow Tactics, Dishonored, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and Assassin’s Creed.

Hitman 2 has the fundamental mechanics that most stealth games have such as using the environment to one’s advantage, distracting guards, hiding bodies, etc. However, what truly sets Hitman 2 apart from all those stealth games I mentioned above are the actual assassinations of your targets. The player could straight up shoot the targets or knock them out and snap their neck, but there are usually around ten different ways to kill any given target on any given map. However, the best part of assassinating the targets is when the player makes the kill look like an accident and slips away while the NPCs are clueless of what truly happened. While one has to be patient to pull off the unique kills on the targets, the sheer satisfaction of executing the assassination successfully more than enough makes up for the efforts spent.

One mistake that I made while playing Hitman 2 was using a guide, and I should advise against using one to newer players. Guides are often tempting to use to facilitate the processes of some of the more contrived assassinations, but in the long run, it compromises players of potential fun in the game. One of the main sources of fun in Hitman 2 is to explore, learn the maps, and work independently. As a result, the use of a guide will have a detrimental effect on a player’s experience in the game because it prevents them from genuinely taking full credit for their efforts in the assassinations.

As much as I have enjoyed this game, this game is not flawless and I can’t pretend that it is flawless. For example, as something that has been complained about, players must be online to play any part of the game, even if it doesn’t involve another player in any way. This has not been much of a problem for me, but I could definitely see it as a problem for other players who may have an unstable Internet connection. The game also takes up a lot of space (around 60 GB with no DLC, but around 110-120 GB if you add DLC and the Hitman 1 maps). Obviously, this is a trivial issue for players with gaming PCs, but I use a laptop, which has much less space (I do plan on building my own gaming PC one day). However, this problem can easily be solved by using an external hard drive, which is what I did.

Lastly, if you are not able to afford Hitman 2 or you are skeptical about whether you will like the series or not, I recommend playing Blood Money (2006) and/or Absolution (2012) first.",1563101254,1563101272,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198310992849,168,7,14876,0,4105,1578698360

90,54058905,english,"Before I begin and you question my playtime, I'll have you know that I have made multiple playthroughs of the game through, let's just say alternative platform prior to purchasing it here on Steam.

My prime reason for giving a negative review is that contrary to the seemingly positive feedback I see from everyone, I can't help but feel it comes from people that never played the old games, or from people that fell for the ""New Coke"" tactic that was implemented in this series by way of Absolution and Hitman 2016.
For those unfamiliar, New Coke refers to a marketing tactic employed by Coca Cola in the late 20th century where they changed it from Coca Cola to ""New Coke"". New Coke had radically different, much worse taste and was extremely negatively received by people. You can think of Hitman Absolution as an equivalent of that, a radically different game from previous entries, hated by the fanbase that wanted the series to return to previous style of gameplay and likewise same happened with the whole New Coke ordeal.
So New Coke was shelved and ""original"" (I say it quoted because it wasn't, but I'll get to it), brought back on the market.
Except it wasn't the original Coca Cola, the formula was still changed, sugar replaced by a cheaper, artificial solution that tasted differently and other alterations to the formula that would be immediately picked up by people normally, but since they released the vastly inferior ""New Coke"" first (fully expecting people to hate it), when they brought back the seemingly ""original"" (but in reality altered) Coca Cola people didn't notice it's not the same original formula that's actually inferior to the original.
This is what Hitman 2016 (and this, nuHitman 2) effectively are.

Touted as Blood Money 2.0, the reality couldn't be farther from the truth.
This is still very much Absolution, just less offensively horrible.
For starters, the instinct system from Absolution that trivializes the game is still present here (and don't give me the ""you can turn it off"" excuse when the game's core systems depend on it) in full force.
The game also didn't have such basic features like a briefcase and looking through keyholes in its 2016 iteration which were only restored in this one, but that's beside the point.
The biggest issue, by far, is that the AI works exactly like in Absolution but is generally even more lobotomized by the obscene buff to the disguise system.
For those unfamiliar, in pre-Absolution Hitman games, the AI was ALWAYS active 24/7 throughout the level, no matter where you physically were on the level.
In Absolution, 2016 and nuHitman 2 the AI has an activation range of roughly 20 meters, what it means is that the AI is literally frozen in space and time, doing literally nothing but playing its idle animation, until you come into its activation range upon which it ""wakes up"" and starts going about its proper, scripted routine that will eventually let you carry out your assassination.
This core design flaw cannot be fixed either as it's apparently integral part of the engine used for the game since Absolution.
For me, personally, this major flaw alone completely disqualifies the game for me as a proper entry in the Hitman franchise which as far as I'm concerned, ended on Blood Money.

Unfortunately this is not the last of the flaws in the game, the next one I'll come to is just as serious especially if, like me, you consider game preservation, ownership and accessibility to be of extremely high importance.
I am, of course, referring to the Always Online DRM employed by this game.
To put it simple, ALL of the game's progression systems are tightly locked behind an Always Online DRM functionality so despite being able to technically play it offline, you will not be able to do any gadget/weapon/suit unlocks and you will not be able to save them either, obviously. This is highly unacceptable and frankly unethical in a completely single player oriented game.
It serves literally no other purpose than to, of course, combat piracy at the expense of paying customers getting a radically inferior experience as a result.
The Always Online DRM aspect of the game also extends to the ""Elusive Target"" system which are time limited, one attempt only, always online restricted, completely unique missions with their own unique targets, scripting, briefings and so forth.
Missions that are only available for a very short amount of time (roughly a week, used to be only 48 hours), only when you're logged online and giving you access only to the mission that's currently being ""unlocked"" by the online system.
All those missions were one-time-only, some of them also being re-run ONCE but that's it.
What it effectively means is that if you were to buy the game now, you will never EVER get a chance to play those missions that you ""missed"" despite all of their functionality and assets being inside of the game files right now, blocked merely by an intrusive Always Online DRM that just says ""I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"". For what reason? Absolutely no logical one that I could think of other than just showing the player a giant middle finger. This system by the way was also present in Hitman 2016 in equally nonsensical and customer insulting manner. 
There used to be a tool called ""Hm2ElusiveTargetProxy"" which allowed players to play those missions at any time, freely as long as they bought the game (meaning you couldn't use it on pirated copy, for example) and without being able to submit scores to the online leaderboard (thus completely harmless as well) but what do the developers do?
Why, instead of fixing various bugs, the heavily downgraded visuals of returning Hitman 2016 maps, the broken physics of things such as the coin or various other issues, they instead decide to tighten their grip and make the Always Online DRM system even more intrusive basically completely killing the aforementioned tool.

So ask yourself this, do you want to support a studio that WILLINGLY will give paying customers a limited experience, ever under the watchful eye of their draconian Always Online DRM system that might as well be HAL9000. A developer that cares more about making that DRM as strict as possible instead of actually fixing various issues related to the game? A developer that CONSTANTLY misses its promised deadlines for content releases? Well, do you?
It's a question you will need to ask yourself, but in my personal opinion this is not a developer worth your time or your money considering all of the reasons I mentioned above.

97,54026085,english,"Update: Reducing the resolution to a single 1080p fixed the issue. The game still uses over double the RAM it says it is (around 10gb) but no longer crashes but it does slow down the game after a while of playing. Im still leaving this as thumbs down since this should no be an issue (I wish i could leave it neutral). The game natively supports surround resolution and doesnt seem to use more than half my VRAM when gaming at 5760p so im not sure why reducing the resolution should fix this issue. Maybe it needs to render more NPCs at once with the higher FOV? But I figure that would also increase VRAM usage. No idea. 

Old:
If you have a RTX card and Windows 7 and use ultrawide resolution then this game is fundamentally broken. It has serious memory leak issues (task manager says using around 4-5gb but is actually using around 10+bg with nothing else running) and constant crashes to desktop with a couple complete lockups. Not to mention the pretty shotty optimization at times. The crashes, which occur seemingly unrelated to the memory leak, have been a known issue apparently with RTX cards for the past 5 months but no fix has been made. I've tried plenty of fixes like updating drivers, registry tweaks, increasing virtual memory sizes, turning off GPU OCs, turning off graphics settings, etc but no use. This is pretty disappointing since its a really really fun game that I was really looking forward to playing. Will definitely change this to a thumbs up once its fixed.

98,52125442,english,"This game is highly detailed and immersive, and there are several reasons why.

1. Each mission has several ways to go about completing it, and the immense size and detail of each level adds to the immersion and overall satisfying feel the game presents. 

2. Each mission has special challenges that can be completed, which give them reasons to be replayed. From different assassination methods to various challenges like wearing a certain disguise, killing a certain NPC, or some environment-related task, there is plenty of satisfaction for replaying. 

As for the price, I was lucky enough to purchase this, as well as other HITMAN games, for $60. At this price, I got HITMAN 2 Gold edition and the legacy pack, HITMAN and all of the episodes, HITMAN: Absolution, and HITMAN: Blood Money. To make it even better, the original HITMAN levels are playable on HITMAN 2 with all of the bonus features that come with it.

[h1] Review:	[/h1]

[b]For sure the most satisfying game I've played in a long time.[/b] I finished this game in about 5 or 6 hours along with the bonus missions. In my opinion, you should only purchase this game if you have enough spare money to do so. I bought the gold edition for CDN$ 51.99 during the steam summer sale and ended up refunding it hours after. Prior to this, I had bought the Starter Edition to try the game and had to permanently remove it from my account before I could buy anything else, pretty much wasting 11 dollars. Gameplay wise, the game is very good with a lot of different themed maps. It offers plenty of opportunities to assassinate the targets with almost all of them being very satisfying and enjoyable. In general, I would recommend this game only to people who have enough money for the full game instead of the starter pack.",1562643896,1562643896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198170833443,191,2,2414,0,1755,1598333881

If you are a fan of the idea of being able to go about a mission how you want to, with multiple paths to succeed, and being able to play the game the way you choose, this is the game for you. The game will push you in the direction of certain methods that will allow you to follow little mini stories within a mission that can help you achieve your goal, but you can if you wish, choose to completely ignore those and find your own way to do things. 

The graphics are honestly pretty great quality and I'm constantly amazed by the sheer amount of assets created for this game. 

The game is challenging, and it's satisfying every time you figure out a way to take down a target and make it look like an accident. There is just something so... unsatisfying about sitting in a bush, pulling out your gun, and shooting a target. It feels like you cheated the game, and sure enough you lose score for that.

35,53918442,english,"I'd only recommend this game if you're a fan of the series but make sure you understand that IO Interactive has chosen to take a different path starting with their 2016 release and have decided to double down on it in this release. I'm very disappointed in this new direction and I'm not sure if I'll continue to support the franchise as it seems like it has become a cash grab. Here is what I don't like:

[u]Missions as DLC[/u] 
First off, you can't just buy the game. You have to buy groups of missions. You can get the Standard Edition, or the Gold Edition and then there's Expansion Passes and Special Assignment Packs. What content do these Editions and Packs include? Who knows! IO Interactive is purposefully vague about what you're getting. They just say that each pack contains ""new locations, missions, weapons, and outfits"". Why not just sell the game as, you know, an entire game? It's because they can charge over $100 for the ""full"" game without people realizing it. Trust me, the game isn't worth that price tag.

[u]Always Online[/u]
Just like in the last release if you want to unlock things and progress through the game, then you need to be connected to the Hitman servers. If you think that isn't a big deal because your internet is fine, then be aware that the Hitman servers routinely go down for maintenance or have connection issues. During that time, [b]you can't actually play the game[/b]. If you're playing and there's a server issue or maintenance you will be kicked out of your game. This is an anti-piracy technique that hurts legitimate players.

[u]Easy Missions[/u]
Obtaining a Silent Assassin ranking in the older games was actually a challenge. In this game it's ridiculously easy. You can see where everyone is, even through walls, in ""instinct mode"". Enemies are also seen on your minimap. These two things make it trivial to sneak through areas. If you're wanting to challenge yourself you can disable these, but using them doesn't affect your score or ranking.

As you walk around the maps you'll come across people talking about what your target will be doing, who they are meeting, etc. It's not just one or two people. It's basically every second NPC having a very loud conversation about how your target really likes to eat chocolate cake, and there's a chocolate cake in the kitchen of the house, and also the house has rats so there's rat poison in the house too. And then the Diana will come on in a voice over with ""Hey 47! Sounds like you could probably use that rat poison on the cake!"" And then the game will pop up a waypoint highlighting the rat poison and cake. Again, you can disable the waypoints but you'll still hear every NPC in the game loudly talk about possible ways you could kill the target, and using the waypoints doesn't prevent you from obtaining ""Silent Assassin"" on the hardest difficulty.

[u]Replay Boring Missions[/u]
In the old games, I often replayed missions dozens of times trying to figure out how to get that Silent Assassin ranking. In the new games you're expected to replay the missions over and over to unlock items and gear. Except the missions are so easy you probably got Silent Assassin on your first try. The devs expect you to continue replay the mission but to kill your target in every possible way they've imagined. Kill the target by poisoning their cake! Kill the target by putting an explosive in their cake! Kill the target by pushing them down stairs! Kill the target by putting water on the stairs so they fall! Kill the target by...etc... I found that replaying the missions seemed more like a chore.

With that out of the way, here' s my subjective opinion. First and foremost, it's fun and to me that's the most important aspect of any game. I love the exploration and finding new and creative ways to complete the contracts. Once I got done with most of the story missions, there was still a lot to do. In fact, I would argue that's what I love best about this and Hitman (2016). You're not bound to the story missions. You can complete each contract any way you want (after the tutorial, of course).  

Do I feel like the game is easier? Well, there's a casual mode. But, there are also Professional and Master modes, so it's only easy as you want it to be. I've done everything in casual mode and I plan on upping the difficult in subsequent playthroughs. That's right, I feel the game is definitely worth playing through multiple times.

Apart from that, the devs are still releasing content on a regular basis through challenge packs and ETs and feature contracts.

There are a few issues, however - 

- Hawke's Bay (the first level/map) is far too small. Other players brush it off, because it's meant to be sort of a tutorial level. However, it's not. The devs fully knew they would be re-releasing the tutorial levels from Hitman 2016, so there was no reason for the first map of this new game to be this small.

- Often the challenges/achievements within each level aren't that good or challenging. Just a small pet-peeve. They just have the aura of ""oh, do this"" and that's it. 

- Some targets don't have proper depth (like Caruso did from H2016) or even breadth (like the new Bank level target, which is too similar to some previous targets in both games) in terms of character detail.

- The devs are running out of ideas on what to offer as new and interesting items.

21,53715407,english,"About time I finally wrote a review for this game. I am a massive fan of the franchise, in particular, Blood Money, a game I played so much back on Playstation 2 that I still have every mission completely memorized. Its burned into my brain.

And as a fan, I saw how Absolution bombed, and how the previous Hitman game was being mismanaged by Square Enix and had a lot of cut corners. And both times I was afraid for one of my favorite franchises, that IOI would get the EA treatment and we would never see it again.

But, here we are, its still here and I am so happy for it.  And on top of that? Hitman 2 is a fantastic experience, the mechanics work well, the levels are great and there's tons of content to keep you busy. I'm almost at a hundred hours and haven't even touched escalations beyond earning the unique weapons from them, or contracts beyond using them to complete challenges.

I could go into each level individually and dissect whats good about them, but the character limit won't let me, so I will have to keep this brief: They are good. I like the levels in Hitman 2 more than the ones in the previous Hitman game, which are also playable within Hitman 2 if you own them. And that's not to say those levels are bad either, these are just even better.

The gameplay is almost identical to the previous game, only its mostly been refined. The AI is still fantastic, making even a run-and-gun approach exciting, as guards attempt to flank you, or do combined assaults. The game harkens back to Blood Money, every level a sandbox. It keeps to one of the core principles of hitman I always loved, in that Hitman is a puzzle game disguised as a stealth game. Everything is predictable, has patterns and runs on a schedule, the only variable in every level is 47, its up to you to figure out where best to disrupt this machine. Experimentation, what different methods cause different results, is the key and the fun to a good Hitman game.

One of my biggest complaints is the unlocks. Thankfully I went and unlocked all of the Hitman 1 content before touching Hitman 2, hitman 2 retreads a lot of the first games unlocks (understandable as its necessary gear if people dont own Hitman 1) but instead of giving you new versions of the same stuff, they gave you the exact same items with a ugly ""2"" plastered on them, making them pointless even as a reskin if you have the first games content unlocked.

The other big complaint is the always-online DRM is still present, locking away your ability to unlock content unless always connected to a server. I have a stable internet connection the servers rarely go out, but I still hate this. Why? Because it slaps a big expiration date on a singleplayer game. One day those servers are going to be switched off, and most of this games content will go away with it.

The game also has no animations in its cutscenes, however I do not mind this, Hitman has always had a relatively niche audience compared to other AAA games, and throwing a AAA budget at it is a good way to not see much of a return. If compromising all the shiny cutscenes they could have shown off at E3 in favor of that money going towards the gameplay and levels? I will take that any day of the week.

I still dislike elusive targets (however I dont consider them part of the core game, just bonus content, so this doesnt reflect on the game itself) as many of them are actually very well made and fun remixes of levels...that I never get to play again. It feels like a waste. I hope one day IOI just releases all of them as bonus replayable content, perhaps when Hitman 2 has reached the end of its support cycle and they begin working on their next game, but I doubt it.

And because it comes up, I will talk on the performance of the game. While I cant offer insight on how well it takes advantages of high-end machines, I am running it on a GTX 950 (The budget card of the 900 series marketed and aimed at League of Legends players, its far from beefy, but runs many modern games respectably.) And it runs...perfectly fine, I rarely have frame rate issues, it doesn't crash. I cant say its amazingly optimized and has impressive performance, but it plays the game absolutely fine, and that's all I need.

To cut my ramblings short, because there's so much more I could say about every intricate mechanic and throwing hamburgers at CEO's, if you like Hitman games, this is a good one.",1562362006,1562362006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198019391588,358,31,10607,0,5002,1579278942

With all existent and upcoming content this game feels completed, full experienced: prologue and 12 locations from Paris to Isle of Sgail (including Hawkes Bay), and later it would be 2 more locations, plus maps for Sniper Assassin. 
All these locations are great, full of possibilities and huge, sometimes too huge, and it's fun to play and replay them, bunch of content such as Featured Contracts, Escalations etc. 
Sniper Assassin is also fun, but for most of the people got bored after few playthroughs.
This game is not great in every aspects, of course, but still, this small Danish studio tries really hard to support and upgrade this complex game.
When developers will fix all existing problems, such as bad DX12 optimization, gameplay mechanics in general, and DRM (come on, it's Single Player game mostly), this game would be perfect.

61,53629428,english,"A Game that keeps on Giving. That's the way I'd describe Hitman 2. A true sandbox for the ultimate assassin, it truly emphasises on Player choice, over any other aspect. Along with the numerous and wonderful references and Easter eggs from not only the older Hitman games, but also subtle references to other media, such as THE IT CROWD reference in the latest Bank level set in New York. The replayability is insane. There are also mini story arcs between the NPCs that one can follow, but only by listening in on conversations, and sometimes having to get involved to get some specific event to happen, in order to progress these mini side story arcs, just gives that inner satisfaction that one;s actions matter to the story! It truly is like a puzzle game, where there are many different  solutions, not just one. 

Pros:
-Gameplay
-Player Choice
-Mission Stories
-True Stealth game
-Monthly content updates[Really keeps the replayability factor up]

Cons:
-Does tend to crash randomly, I've had this happen on more than one occasion, although  the auto saves can help in the lower difficulties, when I play on Master difficulty, there is no auto save available, so it can get frustrating.
-Although most in-game actions are repeatable in order to get the same reactions, sometimes the AI can suddenly behave differently. 
-Elusive Targets, and how they just keep recycling them, they should've just let them stay there, instead. But I guess that that would contradict the fact that they are ""Elusive"".

80,53585525,english,"I would like to give this a positive review but I honestly can't. The gameplay is awesome, slightly better than the previous season (Hitman 2016), but it's not enough to compensate what I see as the major problem with this game: once you have finished it gets boring; which it wouldn't be a negative point if we were talking about a story-driven single player game, but it isn't. This is 10% story and 90% gameplay + dlcs. It's like they add a narrative element each season just to keep you on the hook and then buy the next dlc/season so you can discover more about 47's past. Making seasons of Hitman was the worse idea ever.

I loved Absolution especially for its cinematic story and the cutscenes after each mission. Everything was well balanced in Absolution, you had 20 different missions with meaningful targets and less help on how to kill them. Sure, maps were smaller and you didn't have such freedom, but it never got boring 'cause the story was holding everything together. Hitman 2 fails because its TV-series season narrative sucks.

Going into the details:

GAMEPLAY: Gameplay is the best thing about Hitman 2, although there are too many tips that make it very easy. The real problem is that after you finish the game and complete all the story related objectives it gets boring and repetitive. Yes, you have multiple ways of killing your targets, but what's the point if it becomes boring?

STORY: None. You have an input (prologue) and a climax (fake ending). Everything in the middle it's a filler, just like some of the targets they give you. ""Hey 47, since you're there why don't you kill the bodyguard and some random targets too? It would be great so the game lasts longer."" They even don't have real time cutscenes for the story, just some cheap animated art.

MAPS: Last season had 6 maps (tutorial maps excluded), this one surprisingly has only 5, excluding Hawke's Bay which is just the tutorial map and it's a small house in the middle of nowhere with a few npcs. Asking 60€ for 5 maps it's a shame, especially after you lock new maps behind a paywall. You don't do that in a game with such a lack of content. Also, some maps have re-used dialogues, voice samples and assets, for example Whittleton Creek home interiors are all the same, same bedroom, kitchen, bathroom position, design and decoration. That's disappointing.

DLCs: That's right! You want a new sniper map? Buy it. Wanna know how the story continues? Buy the new New York map or stop wondering what happens next. They even have two expansions 'cause one was not enough! IOI politics is simply disgusting.

PRIVACY POLICY: I am not paranoid about privacy, but there's a privacy policy you're forced to accept once you start the game. Otherwise you can't play online. If you read the terms you will basically discover that IOI tracks you for ads and if you sign a IOI account it's even worse. I think it should have been mentioned in the EULA, so people can know that before purchasing the game.

ONLINE/OFFLINE: I am lucky to have a good internet connection right now, but I would not recommend this game to those who want to play it offline, 'cause you don't get anything (no contracts, no escalations, no additional equipment, nothing). I still don't understand why they didn't fix the offline mode yet. It's a shame.

MULTIPLAYER: The 1vs1 Ghost mode is a cool idea on the paper, but I don't know why I always get the same two maps (Miami and Santa Fortuna) so yeah, already got bored of it. It would be funnier if it was 1vs1vs1. The multiplayer needs a lot of work, but I would prefer they fix the single player first. The Sniper Mode is just one map you will probably never play again.



CONCLUSION: Hitman season 1 + 2 should have been sold as a single game 'cause they both have a huge lack of content for the price they ask. Despite this, it's sad to see that the rest of the story is locked behind a paywall. I will buy a new Hitman only if IOI stops being greedy and makes a complete story-driven game instead of this terrible game-as-a-service.",1562279553,1562288197,False,5,0,0.550181388854980469,0,True,False,False,76561198167337703,583,45,2442,0,1812,1577054374

11,53544054,english,"I'm reviewing this game based on my 300 hours of play time on Playstation.

The fact alone that I've now purchased it on PC as well should say a lot.

So, what is there to say? First and foremost, I will assume for this review that you are familar with Hitman 2016.

HITMAN 2, and by extention HITMAN 2016, is the closest thing to a perfect Hitman game. In comparison to 2016, this game is now firmly built around the idea of replayability, which, for a Hitman game, seems like the correct path. You can easily sink 100 hours into the game, and if you're a completionist... Well, good luck.

The core concept of replayability unfortunately means multiple negative things (rest assured, there are many positives too):

- The story leaves a lot to be desired.

- The neatly animated cutscenes in 2016 are gone in favour of slideshow storytelling (pictures).

- HITMAN 2, in and of itself and story wise, is very short. Like 4-6 hours short for a competent Hitman player.

- The pricing for the various extra content (season passES) is steep. I recommend you grab the game on sale. Even if it's 40 Euro for the Gold Edition, it's a solid purchase then.

-+ The maps, while extremely open-ended and damn well crafted, can be EXTREMELY overwhelming for new players, or even veterans, of the series.

- You need to know the game to get the ""full"" experience, as a lot of the unlocks hinges on you completing maps Silent Assassin style, meaning there is little room for an adaptive playstyle when things go south. You typically just need to restart or load a save.


The way the game has been crafted in favour of replayability means that it's difficult to get the full experience without playing extensively and learning, or looking up guides. Some might find this to be a plus, due to its initial challenge (like I did), but I believe it's fair to say that some players will be overwhelmed. With that over and done with, let's talk the positives of the games.


+++ Content, content, content ... While I am not personally a fan of the roadmap style of development that currently permeates the industry, IO has managed to do it right. There is ALWAYS something to do. Challenges, contracts, escalations, Elusive Targets, etc. The game has so much content it honestly borders on content overload.

+++ Replayability. Much like with the content, this is where the game really shines. It is a game you can play daily for a very long time, and most likely still have content to play.

+++ Unlocks. The fact alone that you got so many different variations of gadgets, suits, and weapons really help alleviate the feeling that you're just redoing the same maps with different objectives. It also gives off an almost RPG-like sense, when you're picking your loadout and suit of choice, which, for me personally, is wonderful.

+++ The maps. With the GOTY 2016 package, you got some of the most varied, amazing, and honestly, breathtaking (Keanu approved™) maps ever seen in a video game. There are so many small surprises that I still to this day find new things I didn't know about: Be it a small funny dialogue exchange or some special NPC interaction. It lends to the feeling that IO knew that players most likely wouldn't see everything, but they still did it, and the game is all the more richer for it.

+++ The options. You have never had so many options as 47. The game reminds me a lot of Blood Money in that if you think you can do it, you most likely can.


This game is the closest thing to the definitive Hitman experience, and I can only recommend it. I do think the pricing is steep (for what you get exclusively with HITMAN 2), and I recommend grabbing it off a sale with the Legacy Upgrade in tow. If you end up throwing 40 - 50 euro for all the content of both games, I honestly think it's a good deal.

Go buy it. Support Danish IO so they can keep enjoying their flæskesteg and rød grød med fløde. :)

Only (minor) problem I have with it is that the store page is a bit of a mess and might require some research before deciding on what to buy. As someone who has already done this research, I'll just post my findings here in case it helps anyone.

[u] Starter pack [/u]
This free pack only allows you to play the first (prologue) mission from Hitman 2. Not the prettiest or most challenging level but it gives you a general idea of what you're going to get. [b] Be advised: [/b] If you download this before buying the full game Steam will give you a warning that you already own the full game and that you won't receive another copy. You can ignore this warning, once you pay for the full game all Hitman 2 content will be unlocked automatically.

[u] Standard Edition [/u]
Gives you the prologue and 6 other missions/locations. Aside from this there are a lot of extra missions in each location and you can play contracts made by the community. Some of these player-made missions are great... some less so, as expected. Lot of replay value even without the player-made content.

[u] Gold Edition [/u]
Same as the standard edition plus you get access to Expansion 1& 2 and some extra in-game items. You can play without the extra items but they can be fun if you're really into collecting everything the game has to offer. More about what's in the expansion passes below.

[u] Expansion pass [/u]
Includes expansion packs 1 and 2, you can only buy this if you already own a copy of Hitman though it's automatically included if you buy the Gold edition. There is still content coming out for the expansion pass so it can be a bit vague on what's included but basically you get: 4 small special assignments, 2 new locations, 2 sniper assassin missions and a few new weapons and outfits.

[u] Hitman GOTY Legacy Pack [/u]
Grants you access to the entire first game plus all the DLC that came out for that. Hitman 1 gives you a prologue and 6 other locations, with extra missions on all those locations. Basically perfect if you want more hitman in your hitman. Blends in nicely with the second game and you can use all tools you unlocked in the second game in this one and vice versa.

[u] Hitman GOTY Legacy Pack Upgrade [/u]
[b] ONLY [/b] gives you access to the DLC from the first game. Mostly made for the people who already own the first game but never played the DLC for it.

Still, I wasn't gonna let game size deter me, so I entered the game with hopes and aspirations of a grand, amazing game reminiscent of the old, badass days of Agent 47 when I was a teenager.

Boy was I disappointed.
First and foremost, you can't even get through the first trial mission without there being bugs present. In 1 playthrough, I ran into two:

1) When pouring an item, like to poison something, the bottle was held upside down, as if he was pouring it out of the bottom. Small, but incredibly piss poor bug that shouldn't exist in a game allegedly this good.

2) When the target drank the poisoned tea, she got sick, and then started just randomly walking in one direction. She walked across the table/chairs, through the wall, out into the field, and then teleported to the edge of the map, where she T posted. I ran over to her and shot her in the head. No reaction. She was invulnerable. Game breaking bug.


That was just on one playthrough. I also had her do summersaults when I tried to drown her in the toilet.
I had one of the guards' ragdolls freak the fuck out and crash my game.
I had 2 randoms CTDs happen for no apparent reason, in different places.

This all happened in less then 1 hour of gameplay. Unacceptable, even at a summer sale discount.
I don't know why this game has this massive amount of positive reviews, but I'm definitely not impressed. In fact, I'm downright appalled.

Refunded the game. Never buying another Hitman game. They've turned into complete garbage.",1562224225,1562224225,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,1,True,False,False,76561198033807841,771,65,38,0,38,1562223769

97,53341303,english,"A return to form for the Hitman franchise, improving on the previous game in many aspects, would be an excellent game if not for the always online feature that locks player progression and access to many modes.

Cons aside, which doesn’t make them any less annoying, Hitman 2 is a well-crafted stealth game featuring even more of what made Hitman great: 
The sandbox maps are even larger than in the first game and packed with even more events, from off hands comments revealing the position of key cards, to opportunities, now renamed mission stories, to eliminate a target in either a quiet or spectacular way, granted the game is not very subtle in the way it presents itself and sometimes it might feel overwhelming when exploring a new map, but on the flip side, just like in the first game, each maps offers hours of replay ability and even after all the mission stories are completed there are many different challenges that reward the player with even more ways to eliminate a target, in the form of guns, throw able object or explosive, as well as poisons.

Once again a quiet approach is rewarded, the stealth system hasn’t changed much from the previous game, but the new ability to use crowds for cover does help sneak past certain places and more an even greater variety of objects that can be used to create distractions or thrown to knock out guard offer even more tools to sneak in and sneak out quietly and with the minimum amount of disturbance to the NPCs daily life; of course should one prefer a less quiet and more pyrotechnic approach the new briefcase allows the player to bring all sorts of fun weapons to point where they might have the best effect and a rather solid gunplay for a stealth game makes sure that, even if it’s not recommended or rewarded, the loud approach to assassination is still fun.

Finally the game offers a lot of extra content past the main missions: escalations are small self-contained contract that come with extra stages of progressively increasing difficulty, sniper assassin doubles down on the second to last mission from the patient zero campaign in the first game offering new maps to play on that have to be completed via the use of a sniper rifle and finally elusive targets.
Elusive targets are timed challenges that can be completed only once, there is no way to save the game or restart after said target is killed, on one side the pressure they put on the player can be seen as an extra challenge to overcome, on the other they come package with quite interesting gimmicks that is a real shame not to fully experience due to the time limited nature of the game.

In conclusion Hitman 2 is a great game, it certainly has its own share of flaws, mostly related to everything that works around the game, rather than the gameplay itself, but at the same time it’s one of the best stealth game in the recent years and there aren’t many stealth games around in the first place.

31,52893833,english,"Hitman 2 expands on the already great first game with more immersive levels and extravagant kill opportunities. While the game requires you to always be online to unlock new gear/weapons, this allows the game to add time-limited content and missions for the player.
This can lead to the game becoming a little annoying as you tend to have to juggle it around your life as to have enough time to catch the time-limited content before it's gone. There's a lot to do in this game (despite what it might seem when you get into it, each level has loads of secrets and challenges) which can make it a bit of a completionist's nightmare.
If you don't mind missing the time-limited stuff or you are able to work around when this game has new content (which is about every 2 weeks for limited-time stuff), then I cannot recommend this game enough.
If you don't have the time to invest into this game, I still highly recommend it. The time-limited content will sometimes have time-limited unlocks, but I'm 99% sure that everything has just been a reskin of existing weapons bar one - Sean Bean's exploding pen. 
I feel like I should mention the multiplayer mode of this game. Hitman 2 features a sort of versus that comes down to who can kill a target the quickest. If you weren't noticed doing anything illegal, you gain a point. It's fairly simple and at the time of writing it's only available on 2 maps (which are to be fair pretty massive) and so it can get repetitive and boring fast. There's an unlock behind this mode as well however it is 100% not necessary and does not give you any advantage to normal gameplay - it's purely cosmetic.
That being said, there's a lot of other explosives here so don't feel bad if you're joining the game later than it's release.
You can also play adaptations of the levels in the game that have been designed by players, called contracts. Contracts are set on one of the levels already in the game and just have different targets and/or restrictions both chosen by their creator. They are also not necessary but add near infinite gametime to the game.
In the end, 9/10 a very fun game with lots of bang for it's buck, but surprisingly time consuming for what is generally considered a single-player experience. What multiplayer it has is generally repetitive but is purely optional, bar the feature where you can design and share your own levels which can be a refreshing change from the few missions the game actually has and is the real meat of the game once you have gotten through the story and seen most of what there is to see.",1561994896,1561994896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198248845038,47,2,7109,0,4367,1596224866

Hitman 2 whilst annoyingly still uses Always Online. The missions, story, graphics, character arcs are fantastic. I/O Interactive have really made their mark with this sequel. Coupled with the fact they regularly release updates, patches and Elusive Targets makes me come back for more.

5,52744511,english,"Hitman 2 is the latest assignment for everyone’s favourite bald assassin, Agent 47, and directly continues the story from the previous game.

The Good

•	Stealth focused gameplay will feel familiar to fans of the series. Use a variety of environmental distractions to lure NPCs to areas where there are no witnesses, incapacitate them, hide the body and disguise yourself with their uniform to gain access to restricted areas without raising suspicion, eventually getting close enough to eliminate your target.
•	Every mission has been designed with multiple ways to assassinate your targets. Explore the area and listen to conversations to trigger story missions, where you can acquire a unique disguise from a character your target plans to meet alone, or find an opportunity to sabotage the environment resulting in an accident. Or, just watch their routine, identify a location where they’re vulnerable, and ambush them with a remote explosive, poison their food, or simply shoot them and run away.
•	I really appreciated the amount of player freedom built into the level design when I replayed each mission. This includes unlocking different starting locations and items as you gain XP from completing challenges.
•	Every location feels alive, with so much detail in the environment that isn’t even connected to the story, from large crowds at a sporting event to just a random jogger in a suburban area.
•	Voice acting is mostly good.
•	Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.
•	If you already own Hitman 1, those missions are added into this game for free.

The Questionable

•	There are lots of bonus missions like Escalations and Contracts, but whether they’re good or bad depends on your point of view. I personally don’t enjoy them because they usually have restrictions like killing the target with a specific weapon or while wearing a specific disguise, or there might be a time limit. Basically the exact opposite of the freedom you get in the main story missions.

The Bad

•	Cutscenes are just still images with dialogue, which looks weird if you play Hitman 1 and 2 back to back because the previous game had fully animated cutscenes.
•	Elusive targets are still time limited. I agree with only having one chance to play each mission because its a test of your skill, and completing them is like a badge of honour. But we should be able to make that attempt at any time. And its not fair that if you wait to buy the game, you’ve already missed several elusive target missions.
•	You have to be online at all times, and if your connection to Steam drops even for a moment, the game pauses and threatens to return you to the main menu unless you reconnect. Fortunately there are frequent auto saves and you can manually save at any time (depending on difficulty level), so you won’t lose much progress if you can’t reconnect, but its still annoying to suddenly have this message pop up, and we really shouldn’t need to worry about this in a singleplayer game.

The Recommendation

Hitman 2 is a fun game with high quality production values, which you should definitely play if you’re a fan of the franchise, or enjoy stealth games in general. However the standard purchase price is really high, and of course there’s a season pass, so perhaps wait for a sale.",1561961855,1561962116,True,17,0,0.687716543674468994,0,True,False,False,76561197969417125,379,258,2210,0,1466,1579455106

37,52690537,english,"I love the Hitman franchise. Granted, I first dipped my toes into it with Absolution, but since then I've been fascinated by the story of Agent 47 and the sandbox world of assassination that he inhabits.

Hitman 2 continues the story that began in Hitman 2016, a kind of reboot of the series (so I'm told). After receiving a tempting offer of invaluable information into 47's past, he and Diana set out to put down the threat to Providence, this universe's version of The Illuminati. Along the way, the player will learn more of the agent and his handler's past, and find out who their real enemies are.

I got the Hitman 2016 levels for free and replayed them with the Hitman 2 changes. It improves the levels in several key ways, such as adding the ability to blend into crowds and hide in bushes. Anyone who also decides to replay those levels should be aware that while the level layout is generally the same, some NPCs and objects have been added/moved around. Don't expect to get everything done in the same way you may have memorized from the 2016 game.

I am most in love with just how vast and richly designed the levels are. Walking around the level is often a treat, because you'll find interesting details and dialogue in areas you might not have gone by if it wasn't part of the mission. On the other hand, it's pretty easy for those levels to feel linear because there are some very obvious ways to succeed in your goal, and deviating from those pathways aren't as swift or rewarding.

Dark humor is everywhere in this game. From punching someone in the face with a muffin to muffle the knockout, to tricking an actor into killing himself by jumping into a mechanical spider's teeth, there is something morbidly humorous about the different setups provided for Agent 47's assignments.

38,52520329,english,"ive always loved hitman and it remains one of my favourite games series to this day and im proud to say after playing hitman 2, that solidifies my love for this game. this review is spoiler free.

lets start with the pros:
- countless ways to kill your targets
- wide range of weapons
- great story
- you can replay it a million times and still be left with challenges to complete
- forces you to think instead of prompting you and babying you the whole game
- graphics are sexy
- easy to pickup and play
- rewarding and fun

CONS: 
- the same guy seems to voice all the civilians, while this is understandable, it would have been nice to have some more variety
- progression system forces you to be online or you will not be rewarded with rank and completion 
- some missions are kinda long for absolutely no reason

apart from the cons i love this game and its replay value, i highly recommend it even if youre someone whos never even played the other hitman games (although i suggest you become familiar with the previous games first)

Have you ever wanted to constantly get seen through walls? Do you dream of being on 99% completion because the developers didn't add all challenges at once so you get softlocked on the discovery challenge? If your answer is yes, then this game is for you.

If someone tells you, that ""Hitman is too linear, there are not enough options to kill targets and complete objectives"", then you can piss (urinate) on his fucking (bad) face, because in Hitman 2 you can get drastically different results doing the same thing. And the unique thing about Hitman 2, that you can do the exact same thing for hours, WITHOUT ACTUALLY GETTING THE WANTED RESULT. You will get spotted through every single surface imaginable, shot from behind, when there is actually no one behind you, the NPC you distracted will walk anywhere but the place you threw your coin to, NPCs will not hear shots from right under their legs, but will hear shots from 20 meters away.

[h1]MAP REVIEW:[/h1]

[b]Hawke's Bay:[/b]
A good tutorial, and a fun map. It looks pretty good, the only ""meh"" part about it is the lengthy run to the house, if you choose to spawn in the default location. Instead of wanting to never return to the map again after completing the tutorial, like in hitman 2016, you can actually have fun completing all the different challenges and stuff.

[b]Miami:[/b]
Quite a large map, but not too big. Moving between the stands and the big Bayside center building can be quite a distance, because there is only a handful of passages between them. Only 2 targets, and I think that is a good thing. This map can offer a lot of different interesting contracts and escalations.

[b]Santa Fortuna:[/b]
Not really the best map, mainly because of its size. The map is too big and its parts are too disconnected from each other. Also, the ""Three Course Dinner"" challenge is just not fun. At all. Dragging bodies from one part of the map to the other for half an hour is not the kind of gameplay people buy this game for. Targets are too far from each other, Jorge is WAY too inconsistent, too much hostile areas in suit. Looks good tho, and the soundtrack is awesome.

1. Someone who DID NOT play Hitman (2016)
This game is awesome for fans of the old Series (SilentAssassin,BloodMoney...) as well as for players who never played the Hitman Series. Graphics, Gameplay and all that is just great and it´s a ton of fun for people who like to feel like a professional Agent Killer and stuff. You are going to have hours and hours to explore different ways to finish the contracts. Plus you get the whole Hitman(2016) game remastered, which for some of you means +40 hours gamecontent! Nice move IOI ! 

2. Someone who played Hitman (2016)
The game didn´t improve in my opinion. Hitman2 feels more like a dlc to Hitman(2016) which is way overpriced for the same game you already have just to get new maps! Don´t buy it fullprice, you are going to regret it!
What´s an extra punch in the balls is that you are probably not be able to import your progress from Hitman(2016) which means if you want to get your rank plus unlockable ingame content from the first game you have to play it from beginning. ( I didn´t figure out how to import my progess )

Overall, each level ends up with a large variety of ways to do everything, and it's that which allows you to sink hours into just a single level, trying out all the different challenges and methods and attempting to get to the top mastery level in each.

The levels are almost like stand-alone sandboxes - open and you can pretty much take the targets out how you please. Run and gun? Do-able on any level - although - it will never, ever be easy (you are a hitman - not Rambo). You can replay the levels a number of times, and STILL discover new ways to get objectives completed.

The game even sports some nifty multiplayer options - Ghost mode - which is essentially you versus another player on one of two story levels (mind the COMPLETE levels) where you race to take out the designated target before your competitor and try to reach the set score before your competitor. And Co-op Sniper mode - where you basically play the sniper (on two levels) taking targets out from your sniper's nest.

The main story just stops there is a build-up...  but then it ends before the end - if you want more - just buy the DLC. Yeahh - a crappy way to make money is to sell people a demo of the full game. That's what Hitman is about, it's not a full game for €60,- no, it's a €60,- demo with and additional ~€40,- for the full game.

Mechanics are the same as Hitman 1 - however the cutscenes have been replaced by cheap renderings. Overall feeling is that of a poorly done indie-game, even though the level design is done fairly nice.

17,52349530,english,"[h1] For Reference, I own Hitman 2, Gold Edition, and Hitman 2016 [/h1]

Now you are most likely wondering, what does that have top do with the base game? Well unfortunately, the version you purchase has a lot to do with the experience you have with this game. Is it comparable to the shit that Rainbow Six Siege makes you put up with? No, but there is still a lot of consideration that is needed when going into buying this game, which is a little more than annoying. 
[b]So, is Hitman 2 worth it when viewed as a stand alone experience?[/b] That really depends on how much you like the Hitman formula. If you don't find playing massive levels with multiple story lines and endings, you aren't going to have much fun here. However, if you know that you like the Hitman gameplay, this is a very fun game on it's own. Is it fun enough to cost $60? I think so. [b]So where does Gold Edition come in?[/b] Gold edition basically means you get the DLC as it comes out. The only DLC map that is out currently is ""The Bank"" which I have only been able to play a small portion of, but it was more than worth the wait. With another DLC map in sight for summer 2019, Gold Edition is a pretty good purchase. Is it worth $100? Fuck no. There is no way I can justify spending $100 on a single game and much less Hitman 2. Is it worth it on sale? Yes, in fact I got the Gold edition when it was on sale. So If you are looking at picking up this game, go for it. If you want more out of the game, get Gold Edition on sale along with ""Hitman GOTY Legacy Pack"" It's very confusing, but hopefully this review clears the air slightly.

Hitman has a flow to it. Punishes you for rushing in at the highest difficulty without doing actual preparation like, say, going for high-level challenges w/o enough experience or inventory to accomplish the task. But it also rewards you through items and locations unlocked through special circumstances, and exploring new areas with secret escapes and impulsive, yet rewarding assassination techniques.

17,52162779,english,"As of writing, this is my absolute favorite game in the stealth genre. IO Interactive has hit some rough times funding wise but they seem determined to give us our money's worth with the season pass. So far I'm happy.

Pros:
- Stealth matters.
A lot of stealth games have stealth as optional, if you can blaze through and kill everything. I admit, I've done that in this game, but I had to be clever.
- Lots of content.
There are... almost twenty maps? With some of them having different events (like a movie shoot) that change the layout of the area quite significantly. More maps are coming and more alternative missions are coming.
- Multiplayer and single player.
The multiplayer is pretty simple, unfortunately. I'm very much a multiplayer game person. The sniper assassin co-op is challenging and fair, and a lot of fun to try and figure out how to abuse the scripts of the characters in the setting. The ghost mode, I'm a little less keen on, and not because it's competitive. It almost seems like a last minute addition, as you both are basically in a single player game, but there are a few wrenches you can throw at each other. I'd be very much into a full co-op in the normal game mode, but that would almost definitely completely break the engine (because of the way alerts and suspicion are scripted and various other things that make it feel very personal to the player, adding another player would make these things need to have more states (about a squared number of states) and the effects of mixed states would be odd, in my opinion). Other stealth games can add co-op much easier due to the more lax nature around stealth and suspicion, but this game has a very strict state machine in the back, as far as I can tell.
- Fun!
There's always something new to try and beat with the rotating content and limited time challenges. If you get too good at a scenario, there's more with more twists to play with, and you can make your own custom challenges. I have a weird challenge up there with what I think is a close to optimal path's time limit, and I'm excited to see if someone can sequence break it and beat my score. But it's not just about getting good, it's a game you can also take slow and explore. There are a lot of interactions to play with and learn.

Cons:
- The first game (Hitman 1, which is included in this version if you have/purchase it) clearly has better budget. The animations are cleaner and the cutscenes are much more polished. I admit to being extremely disappointed when the first Hitman 2 cutscene came up, and it felt... Flat. Visually at least. The story is a clean continuation of the first and comes to a satisfying conclusion, in my opinion, and the game itself, though some of the animations are still odd (looking at you cutting board animation), the gameplay itself is clean, mostly obvious, and well thought out. The places where it's not obvious are usually part of the puzzle, not a miscalculation of the creators, in my opinion.
- The multiplayer is shallow. I mention that above. It's still fun, it just clearly is a single player game.
- If you're highly critical, there are some obvious problems with a few of the animations. But the general ideas behind them are more important than their actual animation.
- Some of the interactions are pretty dumb. The enemies have goldfish memories. Not as bad as in some games, especially with the blown cover mechanic, but it's pretty easy to abuse the suspicion time out to explore where you aren't supposed to be before getting the right outfit to pop in. But that's why the ""Do It All In Your Suit"" challenge is there. It is still a challenge, and it gets much more challenging on the higher difficulty, but it makes it feel a lot more mechanical and less organic. That last step from a well polished state machine to an organic experience is hard, and likely unsatisfying (real life is boring, yo).

All in all, I am happy with my purchase, and I would purchase it again in a heartbeat. I feel a little bad that I waited for a sale for some of it, as IOI deserves the price they set on it, in my opinion. It's flaws give it a character that is amusing and fun.

41,52122158,english,"TLDR: If you enjoyed HITMAN 2016, HITMAN 2 improves upon that entertaining formula with ambitious locales and unprecedented scale.

For those unfamiliar with the way HITMAN 2016 played the basic premise is that you arrive at a location with the goal of assassinating a target or targets and escaping without alerting the authorities. This is achieved by utilizing disguises stolen from NPC's or found in the environment to get close to your target. By understanding the areas of the locale your current disguise can access without suspicion, and observing NPC conversations and patterns, you can experience many creative ""Mission Stories"" IOI have created. 

This game builds upon the robust mechanics which HITMAN 2016, and improves upon the formula with locales which pushes IOI's tech to the limits. The writing of the scenarios, side dialogue, and dark humor bring the world of assassination to life. The locales are the standout of the experience, and are richly detailed. The difference is that HITMAN 2's locations nail both scale and substance. HITMAN 2016's weakest map was Colorado, which was also the largest. I think that IOI took their audience's criticism to heart, and and provided a quality experience at a scale we have never seen before in a HITMAN game. 

The progression of HITMAN 2 is identical to HITMAN 2016, which revolves around replaying missions with different equipment and with different challenges in mind. In any other game, this may seem like a weakness, but it's a way to experience the wealth of content which each of the locations has to offer. One thing IOI changed was to stress to the player that the missions are meant to be replayed, and but extra emphasis on the Mission Stories mode when you complete a mission. I agree with this emphasis, since the last game wasn't clear about its structure. 

IOI has really knocked it out of the park with this game. Its certainly the best of the franchise, and offers the most compelling HITMAN game to date. It owes a lot to its predecessor, but I think its worth purchasing on its own.

56,52081506,english,"I played all of the previous Hitman games (except for Contracts but I have it in my library. Just too lazy to bother with it). I'm going to mention what this game did right and what it did wrong. 

First off, is it better than Absolution? Absolutely. Absolution was more of a linear cover shooter, with the maps being more of a small playground that simply limited you to certain choices. It had that ""Splinter Cell Conviction"" feel and look because of how its stealth mechanics worked but that's not Hitman. And so you can rest easy knowing that this game went back to the roots of what Hitman was all about: large open maps with several different ways to execute your target, and you're simply given the targets' names, info, motivations, and the tools, gear, and weapons you need to take them out. 

With that in mind, there's no customization like Hitman Blood Money however. You can unlock, however, different variations of certain guns with modifications by beating the Mastery levels of each map (it's not hard really. Just complete every challenge for each map for the XP. Complete most of them and you'll reach level 20 mastery (highest mastery level for any map except for a few exceptions). In the process, you'll also unlock other equipment and gear, as well as new starting locations and ICA smuggle locations (basically, you can smuggle one item into any of the locations on the map once you unlock them). 

For those who already played Hitman 2016, this is probably nothing new and the improvements over that one in this one is that you can now blend in crowds (like you could back in Absolution), and hide in tall grass and or anything else that acts as a blending cover. Mirrors are functional (so targets and other NPCs WILL see you sneaking up behind them unless you crouch), and the briefcase makes a return, finally allowing you to carry that sniper rifle, that's illegal to carry openly with any disguise, with complete impunity throughout the maps. Just don't try to smuggle it through a frisk checkpoint. 

Oh, and the lighting has been changed, which may or may not suit your tastes. If you're a newcomer to the series, you may not notice the differences between Hitman 1 and 2 in terms of lighting, but if you choose to get the Legacy Pack and/or play Hitman 1, you will. That said, if you do get the Legacy Pack as well, don't bother with Hitman 1, cause this one will have ALL the maps from that one in this one. Oh, and your progress from Hitman 1 does not carry over into this one.

Now, you may be wondering what it did wrong since I mostly mentioned what it right. Well, elusive targets unfortunately, by their very nature, are usually only available to play once (if you die, you can't try again), and despite IOI usually recycling them for those who missed them, some will be permanently missable, especially if you're entering this late into the game. For new comers to the series, the enforcers may or may not be likable. They are NPCs that can see through your disguise because they know who's supposed to be on the staff. 

They're not littered throughout the map like in Absolution, but depending on the disguise you take, they may or may not be in large numbers. Some enforcers can actually see through ANY disguise (including your default suit) because they're meant to make you take advantage of crowd blending. They were mostly likely added because people complained that in Absolution, EVERYONE was able to see through your disguise if you wore the same one as theirs, and you had to use instinct to blend. Thankfully, instinct is now simply being able to see the environment's objects highlighted so you don't miss anything and to know the status of an NPC's state of awareness as well as to see where your targets are at all times.

Now, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. It's fun, but you'll be disappointed if you expect its shooting to be as good as Absolution. There's no point shooting, but on the easiest difficulty (Casual), you're a tank. On Professional, you're encouraged to use stealth. If you do get in a shootout though, you can regenerate health provided you don't keep getting shot. It's advised to change into another outfit and leave the immediate area if it comes to that. So, you can still salvage the situation, but you'll definitely lose your SA rank. Also, unlike Hitman 1, this game's highest difficulty is now Master as opposed to Professional, which is the previous game's Normal difficulty.",1561828331,1561828331,True,0,0,0.491082489490509033,0,True,False,False,76561198013952594,148,7,6397,0,5512,1570600446

If you have Hitman 2016 and just want the improvements, just download the free starter pack, launch it once, close it, and Steam should download all locations from that into Hitman 2. You'll have hours of fun without paying an extra dime, though you should.)

This is a brilliant game. You get many challenges to complete, open sandbox levels where you can plan to assassinate however you like, and as easy or as difficult as you like, for however long you like. It's the general Hitman formula taken to the nth level. This is probably one of my favourite games of all time, and it's the first game that I've ever played that I loved without having a deep story like an RPG, a skill system integrated to it like any of the Fallout games for example, or a genre tag like Sci-Fi for Mass Effect. I loved and still love every second of this game.

(EDIT: Okay. I may have made an error here, there is another series that I've loved for these same reasons: DOOM)

The game breaks down to:
1. The main missions, which are the huge open sandbox missions centred around different locations from across the globe. These are offered in Casual (Easy), Professional (Normal), and Master (Hard) difficulties, with challenges associated with each of them.
2. Escalations which are tiered sub-missions within the world-spaces from those levels but they stand on their own (e.g. You kill a security guard, then maybe you kill 2 guards, then you kill them but have to hide them before anyone sees them, or there are more cameras, and so on.)
3. Special Assignments/Side missions/Bonus missions: These take the world-spaces from those main missions, replaces the targets with new ones, and modifies it in one or more ways giving you more new challenges. For example, you have to kill two targets during the day in a city, now it's just one at night, or it's still two but you also need to collect something from one of them.
4. Contracts: Players use the world-spaces from either the main missions or the side missions, set the targets to kill, ways to kill them, or the speed at which you need to kill them, etc. and you can fulfil them if you like. Some of these contracts are picked out by IOI on a monthly basis during themed events and feature them as their favourite contracts.
5. Elusive Targets: These are kind of like side missions except they are also timed, and if you die, you cannot retry them, and you can't save. They're good challenges, will go away after a while, but may return in the future. IOI did this in Season 1, and is currently offering both new elusive targets and re-opening previous elusive contracts again every month.

Pros:
1. Your prerogative, your pace, your rules. Run and gun? Sure. Massacre? Alright. Stealthiest assassin in history? No problem.
2. World-spaces are beautiful. There's a lot of detail and a lot of fun to be had even if you just follow NPCs around whether because of their dialogue, or because of what they do, and some of the challenges may deal with just going after NPCs. Maybe you'll save someone's life? Or maybe you'll end up killing them. Who knows!
3. There is a story, and there is lore. You can skip it. But you'll miss out on stuff that gets mentioned whether from the briefings or from within the level. Maybe someone you meet in a hospital will be talked about later. Or maybe someone you may have met in a previous Hitman game might show up. Or not.

Cons:
1. HUGE game. As I type this, I have all of Season 1's content, Hitman 2's base content, and 3 missions from the Gold Edition. It's 127 GB. Have memory and horsepower to spare to play this game.
2. You MUST be constantly online to complete challenges and targets. If you complete anything offline, those saves are kept offline, and you don't unlock anything. Can definitely be a pain. Although at least it doesn't hog your bandwidth, so AFAIK, you don't need to worry about data caps for playing the game itself.
3. Piecemeal content: Though this is FAR LESS of an issue NOW for Hitman 2 compared to Season 1. Just get the Gold Edition and the GOTY Legacy Pack (YOU DO NOT NEED THE LEGACY PACK UPGRADE, JUST THE PACK), you'll have all content available from Hitman 2016, Hitman 2's base game, and all current and upcoming content from the Expansion Pass.
4. The AI can be a bit wonky at times. For example, you might throw a coin on the floor a few steps away from a guard, but guess who's coming? The employee that was standing in the floor below a room away! But it's a huge game, you can't really fault IOI for it with how many NPCs are in each level, the different routines that they follow AND the different interactions that each ""class"" of NPC has to follow.

Why can't I work hard to get into a position on the other side of the map to kill them from range? Why are there no time limits or limited opportunities?

Hitman 2018 is a niche game, but if its your thing, it is hands down the best in the genre imo. For someone who really loved 2016's Hitman and was eligable for the free game of the year legacy upgrade, im really happy that all of the old missions are back and improved with the new mechanics and few small changes here and there, just gives me more of a reason to replay them with the new features from this years edition. The new locations, with maybe the exception of the first tutorial-ish mission are very good. There are so many small additions like 47 talking more to random NPC's to make the world feel alive and so on. 

I bought the gold edition for £60, and i feel like i definately got my money for it. Depending on the future support and DLC i think the game will do very well after a year or so, like the last one. The online support like bonus missions, escalations, featured contracts and elusive targets do give you reason to come back even when you feel youve mastered everything. Hopefully the 2 expansions will feature a good ammount of locations. Strongly recommended for anyone who likes this genre / the previous game. 

There are some complaints which you could still make like the DRM and always online requirement, frankly it means absolutely nothing to me, the game runs more than fine on max settings (2.0 resolution scale) on a GTX 1080. My internet works as its intended so ive never been kicked out or anything. If your service provider is trash, maybe you should think about fixing that before complaining about the always online, if your net is that bad just play fully offline.

June 25th Edit:

Took a break from studying and saw that ""Hitman 2"" was only $15.99. I thought ""wow, that's a great price, not sure when it came out but I love Hitman so let's make the purchase."" 

Put ""Hitman 2"" in my cart and paid the $15.99 for it. 

Installed the game just fine, played the first mission and tutorial, great fun. Have to close the game and allow steam to sync up with the game and download the next mission. Okay, weird, but whatever maybe it's more efficient that way. 

Okay, now i'm onto Miami level, sweet!  Watch post-mission cinematic, cool! Try to play next ""Santa Fortuna"" mission. Unavailable. Okay, maybe I have to close the game and let it sync and download the next mission. 

Close, it syncs, downloads something (*spoiler: it wasn't the mission*). Great, let's roll! Boot up the game, nada. Still the mission is red and it won't let me access. 

RInse and repeat for 40 mins, go to multiple steam links, see some sort of Miami edition? Is this the Starter edition? Is it the Miami pack? Did i really just pay $15 for a demo? I'm not even sure what version I have now and frankly I've wasted enough time already trying to figure it out. 

Whelp IOI, you lost me. Been playing this franchise since the beginning. I don't usually write reviews or refuse to purchase games, but I feel so thoroughly mind-fucked by this Steam & IOI doubleteam that it's incredible. Hats off to both of you. And Steam, you might want to try not making the generic $15 price be named ""Hitman 2"", maybe highlight that it's the scuffed version of the game. 

Anyways, done with this franchise for the forseeable future and will just play the older games to get my fix. To everyone looking to purchase this game, it seemed fun, but with all these DLC's and extra purchase options it was confusing and I'm not risking getting ripped off again.

21,51219618,english,"Although the marketing for this game is a little bit of a mess, the game is absolutely awesome. 
You play as Agent 74, a highly skilled assassin, and follow a strory (that clearly isn't the main appeal of the game, but if you're into that you'll certainly like it) on many different destinations. 

This game is meant to be played and replayed the way you want. There are many challenges to unlock new items and suits (yes, suits are a big part of the game haha, you'll see). 
The goal is always to eliminate between one and 4 targets, and sometimes there are side objectives like destroying something or gathering documents etc.
You can also play freely and make your own targets through the contract mode option which is available to everyone who owns the game. (on the locations they own). 

The locations are where the game really shines. They're all non linear, offer an infinite amount of ways to approach them and open up for ANY playstyle. The amount of unlocks, the continuous support of free content and the perfect level design are what will keep you playing for hundreds of hours.

You can pretend to be in a James Bond or John Wick movie, or simply speedrun a level, learning all the opportunities, all the AI paths, all the dialogs. You can try to be as stealthy as possible and only eliminate your target or you can infiltrate buildings by shooting everyone with a silenced pistol, a sniper rifle or a shotgun. Everything in this game is yours. 

About the unlocks:

You can unlock many many different unique items. There are of course Agent 47's silenced pistols (different sorts, different perks and looks), but you can go loud with Shotguns, Assault Rifles etc. There are Sniper Rifles, Explosive devices (C4 bombs etc.), gadgets (an explosive phone etc.) and really stupid/ out of place items (explosive rubber ducks etc.). 
There are ways to be stealthy (poisons) and ways to be loud (explosives). 

About the game mechanics:

One of the most important mechanic in the Hitman Franchise implies disguising. You can knock out someone and disguise as him to access previously prohibited places like a Town Hall or a Security Room. You can disguise as a bodyguard, a flmaingo mascot, a carpet seller, a security agent, a police officer, a ninja, a tourist, a priest, a doctor, a scientist and so many more. (Not a figure of speech.) 

About the locations:

All the locations are beautiful and unique, especially if you get the Legacy pack with your Hitman 2 game. (It has all the revisited missions of Hitman 2016 with new game mechanics and graphics: A palace in Paris, A little village in Italy, Marrakesh, A luxurious Hotel in Bangkok, an apricot farm in Colorado and a hightech medical facility in Japan.).
They are all very well designed and you can approach them the way you want.

The base Hitman 2 Game (Standard Edition) has the Free New Zealand Mission, Miami (Big racing event), Santa Fortuna (A little village in columbia with drug cartel leaders etc.), Mumbai (a giant map in India), Whittleton Creek (An american suburb) and Isle of Sgail (a fictional big Castle in the Atlantic Ocean), plus a Sniper map (which is a mode within Hitman 2).

The gold Edition of the game has the base Hitman 2 content, plus all the supported content that have come or are coming to the game (There is currently a new sniper map that is out, and an entirely new Sandbox location is coming out at the end of the month and is called The Bank so far. Alongside this Bank will come two new missions on existing locations. Another sniper map in a prison, and a brand new Sandbox location in a Resort Facility with palm trees have also been announced and will be out by the end of 2019, alongside with two other new missions in existing locations. You can find the Hitman 2 roadmap online.) 
The game is really active.

About the continuous support and the multiplayer features: 

There is a multiplayer mode but it is not coop, it is some sort of competitive ""who kills the target first thing"". It's alright but not my main interest so I cannot quote it as a major draw to the game. It is mostly a single player experience, but with the continuous support of new content, new challenges, new missions and events of a multiplayer game. (There are monthly updates and new content is added weekly. The team is really engaged and you can expect free new items every months. 

Only thing I dislike is that some of the content so far (especially at the beginning) have been time restricted content: Missions that would only be available during the holidays. I do not agree with this way of doing things as it is a single player experience that should let people enjoy the content whenever they want, but there hasn't been anything like that in a while, so I suppose they won't do time limited content anymore. Finally there are Elusive Targets which are updated every month too and are missions you only get a shot at (I don't like the idea, but you might like it.)
Basically you cannoy restart once you have completed an objective and you are forced to play carefully if you don't want to mess it up. But if you manage to get it right, you can get a new suit. There are new suits for every first elusive targets on a location, so that's a good way to get free suits. If you're scared to mess up you can follow guides on the internet and it's all good.

About performances, glitches, Ai and graphics.

As I said, the game is really pretty. Maps are vibrant with colors and the feel of the destination is really well conserved. I've found myself feeling cold in Paris' kitchens and hot on Italy's beaches. Miami made me want to wander around and look at stands and Marrakesh made me feel oppressed with all the crowd. The sound design is especially good and helps with feel of a location, and a room. Most maps have very different rooms and places that have very distincitve feels. 

I have slightly less than the recommanded PC specs and can still run the game in ultra, with between 40 and 50 fps (which is good imo for a single player game.) There would be ways to lower the quality if I wanted to but it has never been an issue.

Finally, there aren't any game breaking glitches to my knowledge. All of them seem to have been patched since launch. Most of the glitches are insignificant and mostly funny from what I remember. But I cannot recall any of them so they're sporadic. Usually if something messes up in this game it's because the player haha. The game does what you ask it to do.

The Ai is quite well made in my opinion. They have paths and they react correctly to your behaviour. If you bump into them they turn around, if you shoot in public they get on the ground or run, they go report your behaviour to the nearest security staff member. There is a lot of NPC's on every map. You can interact with all of them and disguise as most of them (except the onces with no particular disguise like a tourist.)
The Ai reacts to you throwing a coin or a birck for instance. That's a way to get to someone who's in a public space. You can also turn on faucets or radios (and so many other options) to get an NPC's to come and investigate. It's up to you. You can interact with a lot of things. (e.g. shoot a chandelier so it falls on someone, open up a valve, shoot or ring a bell, put bodies in a closet, flush the toilet, open up a watering hose etc.) 
The dialogs between NPC's are quite funny, you can follow them, listen to them. Sometimes they'll give tips on how to access a place (""Oh s**t, I forgot the keys to the garage in my appartment"". That kind of stuff)

Hitman 2 is a sandbox murder simulator where the player is tasked with assassinating high profile targets within its missions while at the same time tying into its main story. I will not spoil the story but do note the game has not a lot of lore but the lore that exists is interesting to be honest, however story is not the main strength of this game the strength of this game is its amazing replayability. You can spend tons of hours playing one level if you were to finish all the challenges and mastery and different runs. This isn't even mentioning ghost mode and contracts mode. Two multiplayer modes that let you race against an opponent (basically) and design your own missions respectively. This is not mentioning the time limited exclusive targets and bonus missions all paired together I cannot recommended this game enough. Thank you!!!

Hitman 2016 had 10 levels, this only has 6. This gets to why i'm extremely disappointed in this game. Essentially the budget for the game was slashed. Which is why characters don't move their lips in cutscenes. This truly is a game where they made the best with what they had and for that my hat is off to them. However I've apparently finished the game in 5.2 hours. I may replay it from time to time but overall this game was a letdown. Even the locations were disappointing. Paris, Italy, Japan, where do you go in the sequel? Miami, Mumbai and the suburbs. Bleh.

Again, it's a shame because I understand why this game is bad. The budget was slashed and IO interactive doesn't have any other noteworthy IP to make a sequel to. It's just I think I might've been happier if these levels were released as DLC instead of a full game.

So what is happening is that i have a full racing and flight sim set up. As I have begun to play those kinds of games more. I have a Logitech g920 racing wheel with pedals and a thrustmaster joystick and throttle. It's crazy but I've encountered a few games that freak out when these controllers are plugged in and hitman 2 is one of them. The game accepts input from my pedals as if I was pushing up or down on a dpad. If i push the pedal just right I can get it to let me navigate the menus but the game is not playable, even with an xbox controller plugged in the other controllers freak the game out. The sad thing is this also happened in hitman 2016 the official forums have several threads that are three years old at this point where a community manager promises to look into it and yet the bug persists. The racing wheel is plugged in on the back of my computer yeah I could crawl back there and unplug them or I could get into device manager and disable them but really? I work in IT for a living and don't want to IT for my games every time I want to play and i'm not going to. I set up my game space specifically to cater to the flightsims and racing sims. I still paly plenty of non sim games and almost none of them have this kind of issue sadly hitman 2 is one of them.

HITMAN 2 is a game developed by Io-Interactive and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. HITMAN could be described as an “assassin sandbox” where you are free to kill the target in your own way and is the sequel to the re-booted HITMAN game

You play as Agent 47. He is a high skilled assassin, who works for the mysterious agency ICA

Most levels in this game work like this: you are set loose into an open world environment with people doing their jobs and things. Among those people there are your targets, that you have to kill. Observing patterns of movement is key: each NPC usually has a routine of places he/she goes and things he/she does

Agent 47 follows some kind of “perfect assassination honor code” where you are supposed to try to kill your targets in what is consedered the “perfect way”. So, there are some rules you should try to follow, such as: only kill the targets and no one eles, not being seen, destroying evidence and so on

Every time you violate one of these rules, you lose points, which reflects in losing potential unlockable stuff in the end of the mission

Everything is fine and dandy, so what went wrong?

Well, for starters, the abrupt announcment of an episodic model caught many off guard and turned a lot of people off. Many people, myself included, didn't want to get absorbed by the first level only to have to wait a month afterwards for the second, third, fourth, etc

We just waited for the game to be released fully. A game's release is the most important part of it's marketing blitz, so staggering that out over a year killed the hype for casual gamers eyeing the game at a glance

HITMAN 2 is a fun assassin sandbox and very fun to play, although not perfect, it's certainly entertaining...

DO NOT BUY!!! It crashes all the time. 

There seems to be a problem with users that have RTX2080's or similar. It has been like this for months now. I tried every fix I could find and some of them seems to work, but only for a while.

It almost seems like the devs is using some strange gfx functions or something, because after Nvidia updated their driver I (and several others) got black squares all over the screen that made it unplayable, this was the only game suffering from this. Then Nvidia released a fix for the black squares and then it worked for a while before the crasches started. 

One fix was to set page file to a static high value (I set it to 30GB) and it fixed it for a while, but then other games (The Division 2) started to crash because it wanted a larger system managed page file (default setting in Windows). Sure the Division 2 is faulty because it shouldn't require such a large page file, but at least it works with system default settings while Hitman 2 doesn't. Even with the static page file Hitman 2 crashed sometimes.

I've had fun with this game, don't get me wrong. Even when I noticed the ridiculous menu layout (it makes sense for a console, but it's just STUPID for pc) and some questionable controls, I enjoyed it.
But then the game started crashing again and again, and I discovered that the program had multiple instances open at the same time and each one of those kept using between 1 and 4 GB of ram!
So I uninstalled the game, but even after restarting the pc my ram usage was at 11 GB out of 16. There seemingly was nothing using the ram (nothing showing up in task manager!), so I downloaded a program that shows everything going on, even hidden stuff, and of course I found multiple instances of ""hitman2.exe"" still there, using my ram. 
[url=https://imgur.com/8qqXOLf] Here is the screenshot [/url] of that, mind you at that point I already UNINSTALLED THE GAME and tried to RESTART MY PC multiple times.

Long time fans who were disappointed with the Blood Money and Absolution games will be pleased by the gameplay.  The idea of custom contracts takes things to a whole new level, as does the intricacies of the detail.

This game gets a thumbs down and a highly unrecommended to purchase from me.  Despite being one of the best games ever made, the fact that my single player game is preventing me from using smuggling zones and leveling up to unlock new weapons because SERVERS are going down for maintenance (AND FREQUENTLY) is a major deal breaker.

The dev team has recognized this issue but have failed to fix it. Though this game is just really really fun

One of the main features of the Hitman series is how it's not in a genre. It's a genre of games in its self. There is no other game like Hitman. While some try to rip off Hitman none have the skill that IOI does to make a great game, and now that IO's free from Square Enix's control, they can spread their wings and show us what a great game is, and they sure as hell did. HITMAN 2 is the second best murder sim to date. Considering the only good and possibly only murder sims are made by IO, so the competition is small. None the less The only game to beat out this game is Blood Money, but i doubt a game will ever be as good as Blood Money. Though if you thought HITMAN 2016 was Blood Money 2, then you're gonna be blown away by this game. Seriously though this game is killer. You have some awesome creative kill to play with, but if you're like me you'll end up just rushing someone and gun them down and GTFO as fast as possible. In all honesty though I can't put into words how endless the options are. I mean if you want a game with replayable maps. Then you found your game. Take it from someone who on HITMAN 2016 did over 100 runs on every map. The reason is this game is the opposite of linear, because their are pretty much no scripted events what so ever. Every run is always different. Every weapon also has their own little i guess niche to fill. You got explosive tripwires, rubber duck bombs, knives, guns silenced and non silenced, batons, fish, poison, strangling wires, sensor enabled bombs, and so much fucking more. I can't stress how good this game is. It is well worth sixty dollars and i'd even say the one hundred dollar gold edition is worth it. Literally the only gripes I have is that you can't import data from 2016 to this game, and that's not even their fault. IT'S SQUARE ENXIS. Though one major detriment to any RTX owning gamer's like myself is that this game will crash to desktop fairly frequently. Though this isn't a deal breaker for me.

All in all this is a game like no other with replay value off the charts and hours of fun ahead 9/10 this game is actually amazing.",1553144886,1556167827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198359327514,199,36,6077,0,1700,1598739160

Hitman is in good hands while IOI follows this current design.


My only criticism concerns the sniper-aspect of the game. If you are like me, and you're mostly interested in the gunplay and roleplaying a 'Sniper Assassin', you will be disappointed. I hope IOI improves the locations and mechanics regarding sniping in episode/Hitman 3. An example of this is having to ""snipe"" at 10yd because the level wasn't designed for sniping. Easy fix if IOI is willing to spend more time planning the locations with a sniper in mind.",1556098408,1556098408,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198798890585,41,12,11106,0,5833,1589052828

The game has a tutorial mission and 5 real missions which is less than Hitman 2016, but maps are much larger with WAY more options! Each mission after the tutorial is about on the same level as “The World of Tomorrow” from Hitman 2016, which is good because that was that game’s best mission. You also have the GOTY Legacy Pack if you owned Hitman 2016, which gives you improved versions of all of that game’s missions.

Hitman 2 (2018) might become my favorite Hitman, taking into account it merged with the levels of the Hitman (2016) game. The amount of content and level design within this single game is awesome. 

My only issue with these new Hitman games is the fact you have to grind playing these challenges to unlock items. It depletes the point of having a massive assassination sandbox if you're forcing the player to play this very particular way. A weapon purchase system would have been better, like Hitman Blood Money had. However, after unlocking the essentials you are very flexible. 

Contracts mode adds an insane amount of replayability to these latest Hitman games. Personally I'm not a fan of the multiplayer ghost mode since it relies on racing eachother. I don't play stealth/Hitman games to run around like an a$$hole.

I've played every Hitman game. I used to view Blood Money and Contracts as my favorite. But I think these new missions are so well designed that they win overall.

If you've never played a Hitman game before, think of it as a sandbox game, with some similarities to something like MGS5 or even GTA. The levels are actually enclosed, but they're really, really big, with tons of places to explore in each one. Watch some videos if you're not convinced of just how massive these levels are.

To eliminate a target, there are multiple ""mission stories"" where you follow a set path to eliminate the target, which usually involve doing a set of objectives to get a target alone or into a compromising situation. These are all quite well done and often fun to do. However, the meat of this game is exploring and finding your own, unscripted ways to get to the target. You can also often do some parts of the mission stories in an unexpected way (ie doing something in your suit instead of following all the prompts to get disguises). The interactions between the different game elements and the unexpected ways to cause chaos are always fun to explore.

There only 2 criticisms I can lay against this game are the sniper assassin/multiplayer levels are basically just a minigame that gets boring fast, and the between-level CGI cutscenes are kinda lame (because they spent their budget on the level design). If you're someone who really, really cares about story, you might not like that aspect.

If you were expecting change there isn't alot which is fine but the new mechanics such as the mirrors are useless since enemies can easily be distracted away from them and the crowd feature isn't really useful either. The addition of foilage isn't too useful on the legacy maps but in colombia it is a great new way to sneak around.
PS: For those other bad reviews calling this game boring they can go fuck themselves

-Honestly for the price I paid, and the time I waited... I don't think this was long enough, it took me about 40-50 hours to complete the entire game on master difficulty in silent assassin, as a MAJOR hitman fanboy I'm going to go completionist on this game and unlock every item and outfit. It's really fun to play, don't get me wrong but the ending was a little unsatisfactory, I didn't get to get the ending result I was looking for, I mean... seriously it was just kinda stupid.. Sure we get a big secret revealed, a nice ""Ohhh sheet"" moment, but it isn't really what I was looking for. I've been waiting for this game since hitman 2016 and I must say.. I expected more. Again, game was wonderful to play just didn't last long and didn't have a really nice ending.

-I don't have a high-end pc, I'll go out there and say that; I get 25-40 fps all the time but my love for this game didn't stop me from playing on, I feel like the game should've added some more optimization such as:

-- Lowering all the effects and so much of the flare
-- Lowering resolution scale
-- getting rid of extra things on the floor (In miami people would throw a bunch of shit in the air) like garbage and stuff you can't even pick up.
-- If we can't get rid of npcs completely cuz it makes the game kinda stupid, at least get rid of a lot of features. They have too many features that aren't necessary at all.

The good sides

- Super engaging and difficulty game for the first time through. Really fun to see how creative you can be with the game.
- Really cool dialogue from random civilians, fun to listen in on conversations.
- Doesn't crash at all, had no problems on that end. No technical problems (Except running problems) at all.
- HUUGE variety of items and unlockables, really challenging and fun to do them
- Really hard (But i'll admit they're a little boring) Challenges.
- Un-forgiving gameplay (I like that in games)
- Ghost mode, honestly my favorite part of this game besides the actual main stories and missions is Ghost mode, that was a genius addition and is really fun to watch people ragequit when they keep losing to me. Just wish it were more alive.

Hitman 2 is built off the same platform as Hitman 1 but it takes it to a whole new level (no pun intended) with maps with layers and layers and layers of stuff to explore and of course, ways to kill. I found that i spent half my time playing the old missions in order to unlock all that sweet loot. The level up system is nice and gives a player some sense of reward/progress (im level 202). My only issue was the lack of over missions. Yes i understand the levels are ""deep"" but i want the same amount of levels as last time. i felt cheated. Players with the expansion pack will be able to ""future content"" for free but im not paying $50 CDN for a promise in the future. 

Because of the lack of levels the player is forced to either waste his money and stop playing the game after less than 15 hours or to finish all the cool challenges. I decided the later. Boi was that a good idea, i spent hours save scumming trying to get silent assassin titles for all the missions. Then spent even more hours trying to get mastery on all the levels. Btw u only need to complete 50% of the challenges to get mastery, its not easy to achieve but its fun when u do. 

Compared to last Hitman title this is better, The locations are twice as good.

59,45949257,english,"Hitman 2 is another immensely replayable and enjoyable entry in the series that only improves the gameplay of the last game with even better maps. I would highly recommend, the gameplay is a perfect blend of seriousness and goofyness, it's just such a fun game. This is the definition of a true perfect sequel, takes the first game and refines the experience and improves on it, especially with the maps. Unlike the first game, there isn't a map in Hitman 2 I would consider as not enjoyable, the sequel is an intensely enjoyable gem that deserves every bit of praise it gets. 

The game receives a roadmap every month (viewable on the Subreddit r/HiTMAN or on IOIs site) and is receiving new content in form of new challenge packs that give new unique rewards, elusive targets and is about to receive the first new batch of content with the season pass. Considering the game has a ton of content that has kept me preoccupied almost 80 hours in and is still receiving quality content is a testament to the value IOI has provided to us with this game, and I sincerely hope they keep it up (season 3 as an extension of this game maybe, pretty please?) 

There is a ridiculous amount of content in this package, and I also highly recommend the Legacy Pack that contains all of the original maps from the first Hitman, which still really hold up (even Colorado is a bit more tolerable with the added foliage, but this is the only map I consider as unsatisfactory due to its lack of replayability). All 6 maps in the new game are greatly designed and fun to play, but a heads up regarding Hawkes Bay (the first map of the 6) which is rather compact but it serves as a fun enough tutorial that you can sink a few playthroughs through, although nowhere near as much as the other maps). This game is regarded for me personally as one of my favourite games ever made, and it is the perfect game for anyone wanting to scratch that stealth itch.

A warning that the game is quite graphics intensive, so mid-higher tier cards (I'm thinking GTX 1060 and upwards) are needed for a constant 60fps.

I've been playing the Hitman series since the very first iteration. I always loved the cerebral, slow play through the levels. I'm a huge fan of the reboot, but I simply cannot recommend the crash-laden second game. A huge part of this game is immersion, and the constant crashes simply make that impossible. I've got a very capable gaming rig, and it played the first reboot flawlessly, if it around 30fps. I upgraded in anticipation of the sequel, but it was all for nothing. While i can pull 60fps average(RTX 2060), the game simply crashes inexplicably. Mind you, not at the same spot every time, but totally at random. It complete breaks concentration, as well as immersion, and makes what would otherwise be a great game into a roll of the dice. Every time i start the game, i wonder how long until I crash to desktop. Instead of taking my time and evaluating a situation, i found myself quickly smashing through levels to try and finish before the next crash to desktop.

I paid the full price for the game, as well as the season pass. I looked forward to the elusive targets, and the high-stakes, one time gameplay. I feel robbed every time I'm playing an elusive target, and the game crashes mid-way through. Granted, you can restart safely if the game crashes, but it totally ruins the vibe I've always enjoyed from the Hitman series. And i have yet to be able to COMPLETE an elusive target, because you cannot save, and you start from the beginning if the game crashes.

I don't know why this game is so unstable, but consider your purchase very carefully before spending your hard earned dollars. There is a fantastic game here(as always), but it is utterly overshadowed by constant, unexpected crashes. Maybe the March patch will fix it...maybe....

allright first off i absolutely enjoyed the crap out of the ""First Hitman"" new version 2016 i think it is.
Back then i actually was searching for info on the next elusive target.
when i found more info online i was excited to kill the target. Puzzling how to kill the target the best way possible.
just by yourself, try to find out, how to kill the target within a 2 week period if im correct.
so bought the first new (2016) hitman, played it so much, enjoyed it so much... just loved it.
played alot of new games, and then it got anounced hitman 2.
yes the circomstances are different, i think the studio has changed or the publisher, but who cares i love it (the game).
looked up the best experience i could get, wich it seems was the gold edition ( 89,99 euro's at the time of writing).
all DLC and whatnot.
even all content of the first HITMAN 2016 where presence.
played not a'lot, but i seen some Content of HITMAN 2 with ""patience Zero"" so didn't got all content, which in my opinion is a bit :-( but anyhow 10 euro's to a good cause and now i have all content.

9/10 for me, if it weren't for the miscommunication regarding all possible content it would'f been the first 10/10 for me
+ same as 2016 hitman
+ a'lot, and i mean a'lot of hours gameplay
+ if you not getting your content spoiled its so fun to find out how to kill the target the best way and the fastest way possible.

If you've played Hitman 2016, it's practically the same game. Same type of [i]""as deep as the Mariana Trench""[/i] levels. Everything's interconnected as heck, each level always has a sort of ""if you can think it, you can do it"" type opportunity somewhere in the map, and getting to the target alone can be fun in its own right.

While the world's order is about to be thrown in chaos by Skullface or the illuminati or whatever (this shit is harder to make out than Metal Gear), 47 is constantly cracking super ridiculous one-liners that you can't help but giggle at.

Just a darn shame that it has to have always online and [strike]Denuvo[/strike] and all this time restriction elusive target nonsense.

87,49300753,english,"""Hitman is a Stealth game.""

When i first saw this game . I was honestly Sceptical about this game , since it was all about stealth and most Stealthgames are a bad experience for myself,but then i decided to give it a shot , once i saw it's on sale and here is my experience.

The first time i played it i was done with it rather quick and was a bit dissapointed, but Hitman 2 isnt simply build on story. It's build on replayability and this is where the game starts to shine.You discover new ways to engage your targets and new Options to pull off.Another cool thingy is , that you dont rely on your Ammo and Melee skills.

No! You can use almost anything as a weapon and the enviroment too.Placing a mine near a car and wait for the target?Yes you can do that.Create a leak at a oil can and wait for the target to go there and light it up?Yes you can! Simply throw a screwdriver and be done with it ? Yes you can!

There are a lot of options and you also can play carnage and simply kill everyone and if the situation gets to hot. You can simply vanish due the disguise system,which makes hitman kinda hiliarious , if guards cant recognize you , because you changed your outfit and not your hairstyle ,but let's be honest. It's something funny and i liked it.Also with new Disguises comes new options and new areas can be reached.

The maps are beautifully designed and so different.Hotel ? Concert? Beach ?City ? All areas you can enter and discover.It's amazing how the npc's are living their life or their job and it's simply fascinating for myself.I sometimes gets lost and forget to kill the targets or create a mayhem.

Over time you will unlock new gear and you may realise that the game is still a stealthgame , because some missions can't be done with pure violence and killing everyone.Also the Rough way get punished pretty hard or certain events doesnt occur , because peoples are scared of you,which makes carnage in most situations rather a bad option , if you want to do stories to get exp for new gear. Some missions are tough or getting tedious, because it can simply happen that the Npc's doesnt do what they should do or it takes some time until they are there.Pretty tedious and sometimes annoying especially on higher difficulties or missions.

Overall is Hitman 2 is fantastic game with some ""downsides"" for me personally,because i rather end up using the starter gear rather than newer gear i unlocked and in general it feels more fun to kill a target with a screwdriver ,than with all those weapons , however i havent tested them all yet , because some needs to be unlocked still.

I personally would recommend this game with Legacy Pack to everyone , who wants to play a stealth game , that isn't so ""badly"" scripted as other games , where you just need to shoot once and everyone is alerted on the entire map in an instant or for peoples who seeks for a funny experience in a stealthgame with an actually interesting story.

Everything you loved (or hated) is here from the 2016 title and then some. The levels in my opinion are structured a bit better and can be a bit more confusing to trench thru, but that also is a good thing. It makes you pay a little more attention to mapping out that special way of killing your target, makes you pay attention to that conversation between 2 npc's to later find out there's another access point to a specific area that you have been blindly passing by unnoticed. And while some of the level's can be simple to understand the majority are peppered with a diverse amount of area's to keep you playing the same map in many different ways. 
    
However, and this is my only issue, the cut scenes are boring. While informative, and well done, to the narrative of the plot, they are boring. I wish they would have kept them animated, but either they had a differing design choice or they ran low on time, the scenes are a drag. But that's my personal opinion.

Pretty much the same game as HITMAN (2016) but more content and a few gameplay improvements. Whether that is good or not, it's up to you.

[b] Pros: [/b]
+ Easy to learn and master controls and smooth movement.
+ Nice graphics 
+ Beautiful and large locations for you to explore
+ Doesn't take itself too seriously (outside the boring story)
+ High replay value (challenges, elusive targets, user content etc...)
+ Familiar design and gameplay from HITMAN (2016)

[b] Cons: [/b]
- Familiar design and gameplay from HITMAN (2016)
- Unnecessary DRM in a form of DENUVO and locked content that can't be access while offline (this is a SINGLE PLAYER GAME!)
- Boring story
- Lack of content for full priced game/sequel (more maps would be nice)

There has been very little in the way of communication from the developers to the players as to how close the devs are to a solution to this problem. A game is only as fun as it is able to be played.

[b]HITMAN™ 2[/b] is a brilliant contrast between melodrama and slapstick humour that ingeniously works together as partners in hand. Meticulous planning and resourcefulness is key to choosing your target’s demise in any way the player sorely desire. Level design is overwhelmingly vast yet inexplicably simple to navigate through like the labyrinth streets of Mumbai and Colombia. However. Unintuitive UI, persistent bugs from Season 1, and navigating through the menu is still a pain but surprisingly overshadowed by its stellar gameplay. I applaud IO Interactive’s bold direction in keeping the spirit of stealth shooters in the midst of fast-paced shooters that has oversaturated the market.

Excluding the piece meal nature of the game and the way it presents you with game modes, options, and missions in the main menu that you then find out are all DLC (I just love paying money for an advertisement) it is simply frustrating. 

This is not because the basic game isn't enjoyable - it absolutely is... when you can access it. 

Please note the DRM warning on the side - I wish I had. This game is all the fun of a Ubisoft Montréal game that I really WANT to like, but simply can't because currently I can't connect to their servers (diagnostics say this issue isn't on my end).  It's true I could play in offline mode, and at first I didn't care (who cares about achievements) ...until I realized that about 2/3 of the equipment and weapons are locked behind these achievements. Such fun. 

In short - this game has some great game play and very enjoyable moments, but the campaign is too short, and the built-in restrictions make it range somewhere from unenjoyable to stressful.

Buy it if you like... but I'll go back to my indie games if this is what big devs are putting out.

Hitman 2 didn´t dissapointed. They kept all good features from Hitman 1 and even included more good features.

I liked the new destinations and I felt like they gave you more possibilities then before.
Ofc, Paris from Hitman 1 is an outstanding map that is hard to beat, but the rest from Hitman 1 felt sometimes a little bit annoying (Marrakesh for having two targets really far away from each other, Sapienza where you had to detroy the virus every time on professional mode to get the challenges and Colorado with it´s 4 targets).

The new destinations on Hitman 2 are well planned and a great playground for 47. And Miami can easily compete against Paris as first big location.

The only thing that bothered me a little were the cutscenes. After Hitman 2 I really expected real cutscenes and not some still frames. In Max Payne or other games they fit, but here it just gave me the feeling that they didn´t had enough time to make real ones.

I brought the game close after the release and since then I never had any crashes or saving/loading problems.
Most people complaining are users with an RTX. It´s sad that these people can´t play atm due to crashes and I hope they will fix it for them, but it´s also somehow their fault. Their specs don´t fit into the minimum and maximum requirements. When you buy a game despite that you must be aware that you can face some troubles.

58,48964161,english,"As a huge fan of the Hitman series, especially HITMAN 2016 I was looking forward to the sequel/expansion. I knew it was simply going to be more levels and some additional features under the guise of a new game but I didn't care. Now that I have the game I'm shocked at the bare bones 'new' content and how it was implemented. 

No saves or unlocks were carried over from HITMAN 2016 to HITMAN 2 which, although annoying, gave me reason to replay the older levels. This wouldn't have been an issue if it wasn't for the number of game breaking bugs and annoyances. It was frustrating to the point of rage quit when element that worked (and indeed still work )in HITMAN 2016 failed in bizarre manners in the sequel.

This would have been okay if the new content made up for it but it sadly misses the mark. The new levels are massive to the point of being annoying to replay. This inconvenience is exacerbated when forced to grind challenges to unlock items and basic unlocks that I started with in HITMAN 2016 and/or expected to be already in my arsenal.

The final straw was when the latest elusive target, which is a great feature of the game, was not only set on a level that I have been playing since 2016 but was an exact copy of a target I had already completed. This was made worse when after the target spotted me the game bugged out, alerting all guards to my presence, thus allowing me to get gunned down. '

I'm annoyed at repeated content because it is broken, I'm annoyed at the limited gameplay styles, especially considering they didn't bother to port all content from HITMAN 2016 and I'm extremely annoyed at the laziness. 

If you loved HITMAN 2016 and played a large amount of content avoid this lazy expansion pack sequel. Not worth the money and robbed me of the love I had for the previous game.

Why so? The humor.
IO Interactive are bad at jokes. They are flat, unfunny and they put these jokes everywhere. As an outcome, it turns a ""spy movie-style"" assasin game into something hilarious.
And that is a loss. A carefully executed assassination should bring a feeling of triumph - and this feeling should be magnified by an atmosphere of seriousness around. Without this atmosphere, it brings no more satisfaction than a Candy Crush level. It is still better than Absolution (which was complete B-movie from start to end) but worse than Contracts (with their grim dark atmosphere).

What do I like is the gameplay. The new levels are enormous and the devs are kind enough to bring the old ""legacy"" levels as well - which offers hours and hours of replayability. There are hundreds of ways to get this juicy ""Silent Assassin"" rating - and a worthy challenge to play a level on ""Master"" difficulty. Elusive targets are very OK - and I like how levels get a slight redesign once one of the Elusives goes out.

65,48935185,english,"I'll be providing my personal pros and cons of the game with comparison to Hitman

Pros:

1) Targets on the mini-map are in red, with their names written down. A small thing, but it helps more than just a white circle.
2) Bonus missions' achievements like in ""Landslide"", etc. and the Patient Zero campaign count towards your mastery level of the map. The first game didn't have this feature, only main missions counted towards mastery.
3) Mission stories are more relevant and provide additional XP.
4) New maps are really cool with tons of areas to explore.
5) Speaking of areas to explore, now you get bonus points for discovering new areas.
6) New MK unlocks, which are usually the same items from the first game, but this gives you the opportunity to have two of the same item at once. For example, you can start with two lethal syringes, that's really helpful in some missions.
7) The story is more interesting, now there are additional objectives to your missions, not just kill the targets and leave. Whittleton Creek is the perfect example of this.

Cons:

1) Some bugs appear from time to time: NPCs not reacting to coins, botched SA rankings. However, these issues are regularly being fixed, so I wouldn't put too much attention to that. Still, a con nonetheless.
2) This game has very high CPU demand. If you don't have a good i7 processor, then you will experience stuttering in crowded areas and your PC will most likely make so much noise. Even on the lowest settings, while the game runs at a rather stable 50-60 FPS on my i5, the noise that my PC generates is kind of irritating.

To sum up, Hitman 2 is an amazing game and it's worth the money. For a stealth genre fan, this game is a must have.

66,48792797,english,"In it's present stage, a pile of garbage, regret buying it after the success of the first season, Hitman 2 is a technically un-polished and flawed game that hides behind clever marketing, presentation, and amazing level/world design.

- Broken game with constant CTD's on new generation RTX cards with game being unplayable on certain levels without saving every 2 minutes.

- Although the CTD issue is widespread, its been 3 months and still no fix let alone clear acknowledgment of the issue, most posts on Steam, Reddit and IOI forums are being largely ignored by developer.

- lazy development with multiple assets being re-used from previous game including ultra-repetitive dialog and voice samples from previous game that the AU used, the Mumbai level being the only exception.

- 5 or 5 and a 1/4 missions not 6, the extra mission is a half baked small sized map with not much to do, or mastery to achieve, the same size lets say the air force base level in the previous Hitman training section of games. (prologue) An example of the clever marketing that squeezes every little thing to make it seem more than it actually is.

- No sign of promised DLC levels, latest announcement indicates only one of the two already paid for levels for gold users coming out in 2019, no roadmap either.

- On the plus side IOI have presented a masterclass in marketing, spending most of their resources on very high end videos and announcements that give the illusion of new updates & content being more than they actually are. Clever word-play, posh looking video productions/cinematics, artwork and aesthetics hide the fact that the updates bring very little new additions, a temporary target, a cosmetically different weapon that’s already in the game etc

It now makes sense why the game requires an internet connection to play to get any progress & unlocks.

GOOD:
+ Fine smooth Glacier graphics.
+ Classic sandbox Hitman missions in exotic locations.
+ Sprawling levels with much to do.
+ A lot of quality content: I clocked 14 hrs with SA on professional on all missions; SA on master on the first two; and about one-third of all mission stories complete. Just the core content offers at least another 15-20 hrs.
+ Non-core sandboxy content in the form of contracts, challenges, and so on.
+ Unlocks work great by removing tedium and doling out new gameplay options.
+ The excellent challenges system gently directs the player toward novel possibilities and experimentation.

BAD:
- The levels are too big. I wouldn't mind more missions like the Nightcall mission, where you can get in and out in 5-10 minutes. I miss the old Hitman 2 with its shorter levels that focused on a single target. The big missions sometimes feel like 3 separate missions crammed together in a single location.

19,47759144,english,"Edit after 30 hours: Hitman remains a superb game. The levels are ridiculously replayable and each one feels different. Patches have been coming in about once a month and I have only noticed a couple of brief, non game-breaking bugs (quick visual glitches).

---

It feels like a mission pack, not a game deserving a ""2"" label. The production value of the cut-scenes is sub-par for a modern, full-price game, and I had stuttering in them, even after upgrading my Nvidia drivers. (Press space bar to skip cutscenes! This shortcut is shown nowhere in the UI I could find; I had to google it.) Having to connect to a server even though it's primarily a single-player game is annoying. The story is ridiculous. It's like a Dan Brown novel got put in a blender. It's cliche and convoluted, and I have had to replay several of the audio portions to try to remember, ""Okay, who is this target and how do they relate to the main story?"" I really wish I could see challenges be visually disabled in a playthrough if they're no longer possible.

So why did I give it a thumbs-up!? Because if you love stealth games like I do, and you loved Hitman 2016, the core mechanics and level designs are still amazing. There are very few 
 games still being produced which are as high quality in the stealth genre (Dishonored may be one exception). There's nothing like the rush of trying to escape a level after eliminating the target, with swarms of guards between you and the exit. The missions are highly re-playable, with dozens of challenges, different assassination methods, different levels of difficulty, both built into the difficulty levels and player-chosen (e.g. trying not to be spotted on camera, only having one save per mission, or choosing to play with hints or instinct mode turned off).

I do like the new additions to the game, like being able to hide in crowds and foliage, and being seen in reflections. There's also the briefcase, which I haven't tried yet.

Cut-scenes aside, the performance in-game is good. I have a GTX 970 and was able to crank all options up to High or Ultra at 1920x1200 with only occasional dips to mid-40s FPS in some especially detailed areas. It's otherwise locked to 60 FPS in most areas when I have V-sync turned on (without V-sync I'd get upwards of 150-250 FPS). The engine looks about the same, and it's not going to blow you away with its graphics, but it's perfectly fine and modern.

During my 117 minutes of playing while I decided whether I want to refund or not (I had terrible video artifacts and was about to throw in the towel before realizing I needed to upgrade my GeForce game driver to fix them), I completed the first mission. It's a smaller level, but even still it offers opportunities for replay. For example, I used guns to kill some guards in an area particularly dense with them during my escape, and now I want to try a non-lethal run.

if you like to get every challenge in the game, you may find this game frustrate

the highest challenge call silent assassin, suit only on professional difficulties 
is tedious.  the problem is it only give you 1 save  but they change the configure of the map like guards position,number of camera . this mean you can not practice on lower difficult
so this make you need to waste so much time replay again and again 

i like playing game with challenges but not tedious. reload the game and do the same thing again until you fail will not give any satisfaction 
it is better to limit the save like you can save only in certain area. 

after 80 hours save and load i give up professional SA/SO run
waste too much time and something is buggy.

Update from 21st of January '19
----------------------------------------------------
I figured an update would be fair:

- Most of the bugs mentioned in my initial review are still there, something like 3-4 patches later.. I did however hear from several sources (people in the chat of streams of MrFreeze2244 and CJ, aswell as in several youtube vids) that bugs are pretty random, some people get virtually none, some people get a few, some people (like me) get most, so with a bit of luck you should never really encounter the mentioned bugs, but its likely that you will see at least some.

- I've clocked roughly 20 hours in the game so far, and honestly, im done with the game already, i pretty much forced myself to play that amount of hours to try justify getting it, in all honesty i was already done with the game in 10 hours or less, the only reason i still launch it now is elusive targets, and i doubt i will keep that up for the entire run.

- Having spent roughly 160 hours in 'season 1' / 'Hitman 2016' or however you want to call it, im very much annoyed that all my progress is gone, i would've rather not have the 'legacy' content in Hitman 2 (7) at all, because now its just a constant reminder that all my items are gone. I get how having to play it all again might be fun for some people, but it really isnt for me, i cant justify spending another 160 hours in the new game just to unlock old stuff i already unlocked in the last game. If you ask me they should offer an option to port over your progress for the players that want this.

- Unlike popular opinion, i honestly think that the episodic release was better, the previous game somehow felt like more content, even though this latest game HAS more content, which i think all comes down to the more spread out release, there was more incentive to return to the game, now that we got all the chapters for this game at once i played them maybe 2-3 times each and am now pretty much done with them, where-as before i would play each new chapter 10-15 times upon release, and then another few times when i played trough the entire campaign again once it was done.

- I stand by the statements & choice of words of my initial review, its ridiculous that the game was released in the state that it did, and i feel like the patching that has been going on since is slow and puts focus on the wrong things (like fixing font scale in the ui, what even..)

Initial review:
----------------------------------------------------

FUCK THIS BUGGY MESS, SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK IO FIX THIS SHIT NOW
ALL of these bugs where in 2016, most got fixed, but now they're ALL back?!?! and happen A LOT MORE?!?!?!
- Im CONSTANTLY spotted trough walls/obstructions
- The goddamn 180' spin bug is back in full force (try subdue someone from behind, and you instead end up in a fist fight)
- Floors eat items again because why wouldnt they
- Distractions (radios / sinks / etc) often get completely ignored, and then when you just set up several of them trying to get any result you end up distracting somebody 2 rooms away
- Try and do any opportunity without letting diana annoy the fuck out of you and you just end up breaking the opportunity.

Im trying to find something in the game i can enjoy, but every single playsession ive had so far ended in a fucking ragefest because of these random fuckups happening ALL THE FUCKING TIME, it took me literally 30 save-loads to get SA on Paris just because of these bugs happening, im not gonna bother playing again till they patch this tripe of a product.

49,48464531,english,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS OVER 1.99
Utterly despicable, lazyiest sequel they have ever created. It's time to boycott. What a pathetic continuation of what was an intriguing plot in the first half. AND I DO MEAN HALF BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL, It is the EXACT same engine with hardly any of the rough edges smoothed out.

The additions to this game from the previous one can be put thusly; in the previous game I said this was a valiant start to getting back to Blood Money basics with Absolution graphics. I complained about there being no bloody suitcase with a sniper rifle being meticulously pieced together every time, a wonderful attention to detail which signalled to all the soul of that game (Blood Money) . In this one they did give us the suitcase but you pull out the weapons as if you were Mary sodding Poppins (the shit Emily Blunt version mind you, as bereft of originality as this game). And this is the essence of this game, lazy. Now more than ever it is becoming frightfully clear that you can do less and less with these games.

You can't even hold someone hostage or get them to put there hands up etc. It's just the same thing with literally no innovations and IN FACT they REMOVED some innovations like holding the gun behind your back when there's someone in front of you, I though logically that they were gonna add to that this time round but no they obviously thought it was too much work.

Given the lack of things they did to upgrade this experience they also could've put WAAAAAAAY more effort into the cinematics, another thing they just phoned in pathetically without a hint of shame.

It is just so clear walking around these half decent maps that the aesthetic is all they looked into. The level of interactivity is shockingly base and you can only really set basic repetitive traps, do a 'mission' handed on a plate or just kill them somewhere off-handedly therefore it is really hard to make this game your own.

Now what's to come from me is obvious I suppose. Queue the usual 'NPCs are somehow idiot savants that behave moronically and yet also see through walls' monologue etc. Well you can all easliy guess that.

What worries me is to see the amount of people that are enjoying or recommending this game. If this is now to be the level we all sink to then I shudder to think of what the next game will be, I suppose ideally for the majority of you it will be to have the exact same game again for 45 quid but with one extra map. It is hardly gonna be there fault next time after the showers of mindless praise. The shallowness of this pool would break any long-time fan's neck as we expect something far deeper than this creek of shit.

Why not put a real coop? Or a combat system that lets you deal with 3-4 men like jason fucking bourne or something? Gimme skills and upgrades, you know... GIMME A NEW GAME. All in all they must've just hired some landscape designers and saved the rest of the cash on themselves. And bar the map designers they should all be ashamed of themselves for the most pathetic phoning in of a AAA game sequel belonging to such an illustrious series.

I was too kind last time round, had so much faith and am betrayed by either greed, stupidity or both. This is only a preliminary commentary, if I ever am so bored as to play again I'll look more in depth as in the 29 hour's i've played so far so much has annoyed me it's had to remember it all.",1548091786,1548091786,False,6,0,0.456468582153320313,0,True,False,False,76561198066925708,167,11,1949,0,1768,1583695616

With great regret I need to downvote this game in its current state (2019/01/20). I have an nvidia card  (1060) and I'm among apparently large group of people reporting problems with the game. I love the franchise, I was so happy to buy the latest game. I was so happy to play it, then, after the update, I can't play it anymore.

The game crashes every few minutes: quits to dekstop or freezes the PC without any visible error report (though it can be found in system log). 
IOI ""acknowledges the error"" but there is no official communication abot it. I played 30 hours, most of it in the Sniper Assasin mode, which seems the only one not bugging.  Did not yet finish the main story, most of time relaunching the game and trying to play again.  Since the time played is more than 2 hours and game started crashing after the update - I don't see any way to get reimbursed (or am I wrong?).

And actually, it evolved just a little, but very effective.

You can play all missions from the first game with new features. This gives a lot new opportunities and invites to replay the first game, but this time with slightly better mechanics. What I liked most, they improved the whole level system, so it's very motivating to replay and try something new. For example, you get now EP for hiding bodies, for silent attacks, for headshots, destroyed cameras and so on.

The story is in my opinion very interesting (I think it's mainly for Hitman fans), the presentation (I mean the cut scenes) seems a bit like a compromise, but I still enjoy it. The new levels are absolutely amazing and immersive. The story missions within the levels are fantastic and sometimes very funny. But to me, one absolute highlight is the music. I liked Jesper Kyds soundtracks and HITMAN 2016 had compared to that very low quality. But HITMAN 2 has in my opinion the best and the most fitting soundtrack of all Hitman games.

I also saw on a reddit conversation that the steam copy is just bad or doesn't work, and one of the friends I asked said that the developers or of the game or some compony has a bad drm or something.

But if you do like to revisit games to check off ""the list"" of ways to kill people using all the opportinitues and tools it gives you, this is probably one of the best assassin simulators available. There's an INSANE ammount of ways to kill your targets in each mission. Watch a youtube video that shows them all, it's impressive. I think the best thing I can compare it too (outside previous games like Blood Money) is Dishonored. Even though that's a first person game, both put you in a large level and give you a lot of tools to get the job done, and the choice of killing or knocking people out. Though in this one you must kill your main target; no way around it. To summarise, this is a game made for a patient gamer who loves to have their creativity and intelligence rewarded.

61,48401220,english,"A reiteration of the classic Hitman formula; find the target and neutralize in pretty much any way you see fit. Along with its prequel, the return of planning and gear selection before missions has made a welcome return. There aren't very many locations true, but each one of them is far more expansive than the classic games and, as usual with Hitman titles, replayability is where this game shines. Additionally, I was delighted to see another suburban map which was clearly inspired from one of my favorite locations in Blood Money from the title alone. The opportunity system does make the game a bit of a no-brainer, but they are completely optional and a good way for beginners to learn how 47 operates and can eventually serve as the foundation for effective stratagems.

Now for a few negatives. While there are a few nitpicky gripes I have as a fan (lack of gloves for the signature suit, ICA silverballers aren't as iconic and apparently can't be dual weilded), something that isn't as trivial which I am reproachful of is the cutscenes, or rather how they play out. Every one of them are presented in still images, which doesn't make sense to me as these games have always been quite cinematic and arguably just as enjoyable as the gameplay itself. While I do commemorate IO for trying out something new artistically, I don't think it really works here. Ultimately, a great yet imperfect addition to the franchise of a perfect assassin.

First, it feels as if the developers have gotten extremely lazy. Both of the last two Hitman games only released 6 maps, 6 missions. They try to cheat by adding more ""missions"" on the same maps. Instead of killing person A this time kill person B and look its a whole new mission. That is total BS crap.

Codename 47: 13 maps / missions
Silent Assassin: 21 maps / missions
Contracts: 12 maps / missions
Blood Money: 13 maps / missions
Absolution: 20 maps / missions
Hitman: 6 maps + 1 tutorial map
Hitman2: 6 maps

The second irritation is i pre-purchased the Gold addition of Hitman2. Gold addition is supposed to come with everything. I fire up the game and there are additional ""Patient Zero"" missions not available to me. I have to buy an additional DLC when i already paid $99 for Gold to get only 6 maps? Whats worse than being asked for more money after already spending $99 for a $60 game is that these extra missions aren't even new maps, they are just different objectives of the same 6 maps i already have.

Its one thing to charge extra for work developers do in creating extra content / maps, but their lazy asses didn't make new content, they just changed objectives to already existing content.

- The graphics are ok
- Decent story
- lots of disguises
- lots of different ways to complete an objective 

Cons
- Some of the AI aren't that responsive. I had a gunfight once with some guards and a random civilian AI was watching with no reaction whatsoever. 
- Constant crashing. 
For some reason whenever I play the game it crashes a LOT. I have a high end pc so I don't know why it keeps crashing.

Overall It is a great game. Espically if you are into stealth based games with a good story.

If you dodged the last one, its a good time to get into the series as you can get this game and the last games legacy levels and have what feels like a complete package. 

You play as a Forty Seven, a bald man with a head chisled out of a rock who travels the world killing bad guys so cartoonishly evil they'd be laughed off a he-man auditio. You travel to a diverse bunch of locations from a Race Track to a retread of Hitman: Blood Moneys suburb level and finally end up at a high society cults doomsday MLM seminar hosted on a castle in the middle of the ocean. 

Its got small improvements over AWMS 2k17, better crowds (It stole that hide thing from AC2), reflections in mirrors and just generally denser locals that anything else in the series. 

The core gameplay is a rubics cude where the best solution is to lure individuals into dark alleys by throwing pocket change and then braining them at a distance with anything that you can carry one handed. Coke cans, baseballs, busts of soviet leaders. Just pick it up and chuck it. 

Story wise it where it starts to lose me a little. 2k17 setup a 'refreshed' world of international high society assassinations that were all tied together through the targets affiliation with IAGO, named after that bird from Alladin. Every kill had you hot on the trail of another guy who was also killing similar people and it was vague, kinda futuristic and felt satisfying. 2k18 drops some of the vagueness and reveals what has really been at the core of the Active White Male Shooter franchise and thats Class Warfare. 

The games have always had an issue with 'how do you make 47 seem like a better guy than the people he's killing'. They played around with revenge killing, eugenicist, a lot of chinese people (Which you, a white nordic looking guy can 'disguse' yourself as in some serious Charlie Chan nonsense) before finally settling on horrifying sexual degenerate serial murders and a vice president. Thats fair. Morality was always kind of 'grey', and kind of smeared on the wall but whatever. 

2k18's villains all vaguely belong to a society whos outward intent is to load the rich and powerful into a rocket and leave earth, or unleash killbots into the hands of despots or they run the shadow government or they are slum lords. All of them are rich and slimey and profit off the suffering of others while everyone on your side were somewhat down trodden and corralled into this world or were pushed into through tradgey. Its more tounge-in-cheek in this way, but sort of in the same way that social-marxists end direct quotes from the communist manifesto with ""lol, but whatever XD"".

Though, to be fair, the game has always had this element in its subtext.

IOI Interactive has really outdone themselves on Hitman 2.
The graphics are probablly the best I have ever seen in a game (almost photorealistic)
Literally hundreds of characters on screen at one time with little or no effect on processing power. This game world is ""alive""
Hitman 2 is like a ""Black Case"" of execution. Both Deadly and Crafty.
Stunning and beautiful levels with masterfully crafted design.
Gameplay is interactive and controls are very responsive.
Game is fun to control with an intuitive and professional touch.
Sound FX are spot on and immersive.
Hitman 2 is a huge sandbox where **almost** anything is possible.
Levels are huge and expansive. Discover, explore and exploit your surroundings.
Missions can be completed in a variety of creative or violent ways. (Ghost and Stealth Like or a Full Guns Out Bloody Massacre or a mix of both)
(Or even achieve a well timed kill where you assassinate your targets made to look like a ""accident"")
Lotsa weapons, items, unlocks, suits and more. Over 60+ Firearms
Music is basically what you would expect from a Hitman game.
Travel the world in search of that ""perfect hit"" with much expansion content to be released in the future. Free & Paid
Replayability is at maximum as there are several contracts that you can undertake within the included missions with neverending outcomes.
or even make your own ""hits"" and play Co-Op with a friend.
Overall even at full price Hitman 2 is an experience ""Not To Be Missed"" - And well worth your time (FUN LEVEL MAXIMUM)

25,48105483,english,"I think this game functions quite well as an RPG. It really is fundamentally different from any other Hitman game there is (except for Hitman 2016 but Hitman 2 is kind of just an extension of Hitman 2016). In Hitman 2 it continues the same gameplay style as Hitman 2016 but with new locations and some slight changes to mechanics (i.e hiding in bushes or tall grass now conceals you, discovering new areas in the locations grants experience, etc.). These slight tweaks do make for some slightly more immersive gameplay and don’t seem to hinder the game at all. Now the reason I say that Hitman 2 functions well as an RPG is because playing it you really feel like you’re playing the role of an assassin sent on a mission with the creative freedom to eliminate your target in any number of ways. The missions are not linear in any way except for the story missions but those are entirely optional and you don’t even need to follow the steps exactly in order to complete them. Hitman 2 feels quite a bit like an open world experience in the sense that you can explore the locations freely and assault the target from any angle and method.

1. There are only two new gameplay features: 
- hiding in a grass/bushes - good addition, but they're overusing it even in places where it doesn't fit.
- briefcases for hiding weapons - pretty useless, could be taken for some specific weird-ass challenges.

2. They cut the majority of season 1 content (contracts, escalations, suits). In legacy pack there's only a bare story missions with locked rewards. Yep, you'll need to grind again the same old missions for the very same weapons/gear. And forget about your rewards for Elusive Targets, they're gone forever.

3. There are zero technical/QoL improvements from season 1. They even managed to lost a few features that were present in season 1, like default loadout for a mission.

4. There are 6 new missions - one of them is a brief prologue, another one doesn't even qualify as a full mission (9 identical suburban houses on a tiny map). So there are only 4 full-size maps, and Mumbai is officially the worst Hitman map since Hitman Absolution. They are still a good sandbox for a hitman, but very non-interactive and plain. Almost all non-typical killings are buried behind long chain of unnecessary triggers - feels like gamedesigners holding your hand on every step.
In general words - nothing wildly new and original, just a bunch of old ideas in new decorations.

Final map has some interesting level geometry, can praise it for that. 

5. New weapons/gear is straight up laughable. It's either absolutely useless, or a copy of a gear from Season 1 with a ""2"" drawn on it - ""This one has the signature Mk II look"" (c).

6. Story now being told in slideshows instead of videos, and there's nothing good about that. 

7. Apparently, they thought that Elusive Targets was a great feature and continuing them in season 2. Dear IO, they are fucking suck and will suck until all your buggy animations will be ironed out.

SUMMARY:

It would qualify as a good expansion pass instead of that ""Patient Zero"" fart in the wind. I'm not recommending buying it as a sequel for a full price right now, but it could worth it a year later with all old content being restored, new good content being added and improvements being made.

-Incredible the things you can do in it 
-Graphics are really nice too
-A ton of replayability, a many hours game
-Play the game the way you want (Ninja or Rambo or both)

-Can get quite violent if you want, the choice is yours lol 
(For instance, I was in Miami near the entrance where they show off a nice car and there are a sh*t ton of people, so i steal a kitchen knife and some turd saw me cause theres a sh*t ton of people around, so I blend in the crowd too lose them, then 1 of my targets walks by me, I was like wtf, so i pull out the kitchen knife and walk up behind him, I decide to attack...he pulls the targets head back and slits the f*ckers throat open right in front of everyone ""AHHHHHH"" goes the people and scatter) crazy a$$ game, all of this I could of avoided if I wanted too, the CHOICE is yours ;D

-I have not tried the multiplayer, not really interested in it
-The campaign and challenges are well worth my money

There are so many ways to kill your target that you're gonna end up playing a single map many times over and you'll still find more exciting ways to go about your target.

I can't, I can't... How can anyone praise this game? How do fanboys even defend this utter bullsh!t?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[h1]Not a bad game itself, but overrated and definitely overpiced in my opinion.[/h1]

... I withdraw that. This is pretty bad for a game that costs full AAA price. Let's just bear in mind before we move on that the game is priced at 60 bucks which means it positioned itself in the top league, along with other AAA titles like gta, like red dead, god of war, mhw, and so on and so on. Now, the biggest selling point of the game, which it delivers quite well I must say, is that you have numerous ways to kill your targets, and some of them are genuinely very creative. It's not like your usual choice between stealth and confront. Here you have so many more options - poisoning, drawning the target in a toilet, pushing off a bridge, smashing with a falling billboard, and a lot more. Really, the only limit is your imagination.

Well, that should be fun, or supposedly. The problem with this game is that some of its core gameplay mechanics are just [b]unrealistic[/b]. You are doing things that are plain impossible or illogical in real life which makes the game feel fake, and just unimmersive. And the most broken of them all is the 'disguise' system. For example, in the first mission I was asked to murder a race car driver, so what I did is I went to the event and somehow got to the paddock of the target's team. I then just beat up one of the mechanics, and dressed myself with his uniform and thus 'disguised' myself as him, and I talked to the chief, and she actually believed me and let me take charge of changing the tires, so I tempered with the tires and the target had a crash. Job done. Now, tell me this, what kind of a chief mechanic of a racing team doesn't recognize his or her team members, eh? It is just IMPOSSIBLE in real life that you can impersonate someone in this manner and not getting compromised! That is utter bullsh!t! Ok, some would say this is understandable because maybe she thought you are the temporary mechanic she just requested and she doesn't know you personally. So how about this? In the second mission I was asked to murder a drug lord in Columbia who is going to attend a shaman cleansing ritual. So again I beat up the shaman and 'disguised' myself as him. And you know what, it turned out the target actually knows the shaman quite well, and we had a long conversation like old friends, and all that time she didn't realize that I am someone else!!! I mean COME ON!! Just imagine you asking your good friend Joe to a movie, and someone else turned up wearing Joe's clothes. Just imagine how long it would take you to realize that he is not Joe and Joe is probably lying dead somewhere in a ditch. Later in the same mission, I also beat up a member of a band, and again 'disguised' myself as him, and joined the other two band members in a performance. My lord... Imagine you are in a band (of 3 people), and in a rehearsal session one of your mates didn't come and instead a creepy bald guy came dressing like him. How long does it take you to notice something is off???? Incredible. And not just the disguise mechanic, other non-trivial things also constantly break immersion. Now, back to the first mission, one of the targets was going to have a private meeting with an army officer. So, guess what, I beat up the officer and impersonated as him. I'm not going to talk about this unrealistic 'disguise' again, although this is pretty hilarious... Imagine you are going to have a meeting with your boss and instead of your boss someone else.. You know what I'm going to say. Anyway, this time the security actually found the body of this officer, naked. So, in real life what should happen is the security will inform the whole building that this army officer was attacked and someone took his uniform and probably was impersonating him, and whoever spots this guy with uniform should apprehend him immediately, and most importantly the boss (i.e. my target) should be informed at once that the officer with whom he was going to have a meeting is attacked and the meeting should be canceled. So in one word, I shouldn't be able to walk with that uniform in the building for one second longer. But you know what, I actually passed all the security checks, and had the meeting with the target, him believing I was the officer and all, and killed him in the end. WHAT CAN I SAY... Utter utter garbage of a game design.

I know some people would say 'oh this is a game so we wanna do stuff that we can't do irl' and such. But it depends on the genre and the tone of the game right? When I am playing say Just Cause, I don't care about it being unrealistic, because the game manifests itself as a joke and it doesn't take itself seriously. But Hitman takes itself seriously. It tries to be this serious, hardcore assassin simulator, so I am expecting a realistic experience, but in that regard it fails catastrophically.
 
So, I'm pretty disappointed. Really looked forward to enjoying this game, but unfortunately it turned out to be another overhyped piece of garbage, suitable only for 10 years old or below.",1546319423,1546324918,False,2,1,0.364652514457702637,0,True,False,False,76561198283281587,240,76,566,0,460,1570917556

This flew under my radar until a Youtube personality recommended it to me, and I'm glad they did. This game is actually great, and fills the stealth game-sized void that MGS5 left in my heart.

The silly episodic DLC format of the first game is no longer present, which is the biggest thing that matters to me. Unfortunately much of the silly always online stuff is still present; you can technically play offline, but you miss out on the entire progression system of the game if you do so, which locks you out of lots of weapons, gadgets and other goodies, which in turn restricts the amount of ways you can approach missions. I've already ran into an issue where one of my mission playthroughs was ruined by the always online requirement; whenever I completed the mission the game would run into a connection error that would never recover no matter how many times I hit ""Retry"" or reloaded an earlier save, which meant I had to restart that particular mission. I also think the game has Denuvo, though personally I've been fortunate enough to have no issues with that.

Caveat emptor: the Silver and Gold versions are some sort of season pass things for content that is not yet released. As of the current moment and to the best of my understanding they do not grant you anything in-game, as the post-release DLC content is not yet released.

Another important addendum: if you didn't play the first (2016) game, download the free ""Prologue"" version of this game and then purchase the GOTY Legacy Pack DLC rather than purchasing the 2016 game.

Hitman 2 is everything we asked for.

Everything that made the 2016 game fantastic remains, with subtle but crucial tweaks to certain mechanics, such as the revamped difficulty system and concealment system for when inside crowds/foliage, which helps to bring the franchise more in-line with other modern stealth games. In addition, key features from the darling child of the series, Hitman: Blood Money have made a comeback, including the use of briefcases, picture-in-picture information and hole-peeping. The levels are extensive and designed to be explored and memorised by the player. Hitman 2 rewards players who are patient, logical and aware of their surroundings...however if things do go to shit, the 'swiss cheese' level layout is also helpful for finding escape routes in mind for the more clumsy among us. Certainly helped me out from time to time.

Despite all of its charms, the chronic DRM system is still here and still just as intrusive. You may be signed out at random for no reason, interrupting the flow in vital moments. If you can't sign back in, you may have to restart the mission. Autosaves will be locked, and you can't even obtain a rating upon mission completion when offline. 

If you have poor/unreliable internet, be very cautious about buying this game.

97,47901548,english,"One of the best games I've played. Very immersive, especially if you play on Master. On Master, you don't get the story guides, so you have to walk around, listen in on conversations and sneak a lot to find clues. And it's hard but very doable. I played the first 2 missions on Professional. The training/demo mission is ""eh"". The first real mission is ""ok"" but the setting (a beach) is pretty cool. Now, Colombia and Mumbai is where it really clicked for me. Crowded with characters, large map, lots of parallel stories. That's when I started playing on Master and it got even better, because you feel like you're really there, just feeling it out as you go. I now play on Master 6-12 times just to poke around. Once I can get 80% completed on Master, I restart in Professional and that helps wrap it up, see what stories/challenges I missed.

I really love this game. I've had a few fire fights, which can be satisfying, because it's really hard. You're guaranteed to die, but it feels intense with everyone out to get you. Lots of running, ducking, and hitting a dead end with a crowd of guards on top of you. The real game mechanic is to sneak, knock people out (you get punished for killing anyone other than your target), disguise, hide, distract people, and find a way to get alone with the mark. It feel like a puzzle game (e.g., how to sneak into the house unseen).

The background story is pretty good too, though I don't care much for the character. I just love the game play. Every level is different - beach, crowded city, castle. The AI is pretty good and funny as hell. In Mumbai, be sure to haggle with the cloth merchant. Just stand there. He'll negotiate himself down from 5 to 1 coins and it's hillarious.

FYI Each mission has multiple stories and tons of ""challenges"", so you can play them over and over, discovering different sub-plots and ways of completing your mission. So you don't have to worry about doing it ""right"". You just play multiple times. I see a lot of replay value. I must have played the Colombia level 20 times and I'm tired of it for now, but I can see how I could come back to it in a while. I only covered 3/4 of the stories and 1/4 of the challenges.

I got the Gold edition on sale for $90. Well worth it! I'm having a blast. Now at the ARK society castle, sneaking in as a guest. Very cool setting.

FYI This game has excellent performance. I played one mission on my built-in video card (instead of my high-end card) and didn't even notice. It ran perfect.

Here are some of my thoughts-

1)Game is a little short. Since most players are casual gamers, they won't try to grind the challenges after finishing the game. They play however they want and think it's short but that's not the point of a Hitman game. The point is to be a silent assassin. So that's that. But the game is beautiful and is worth the money for any true Hitman fan.

2) I can't seem to customize weapons like Sniper Rifle like I could in Blood Money. I am confused because in the game it labels the weapon as ""highly customizable"". Also I would like the small animation scene of the setup of sniper rifles after opening from brifcases, just like in Blood Money.

17,47841268,english,"Love it! It isn't much of a change from the ""first"" Hitman (2016) but that's alright. Games like this that involve some intellectual thought to eliminate someone, as oppossed to the point and click method of FPS games makes the replay value of this game excellent. The interactions with the environment (people, guns, tools...fish) are great and some have a comedy style to them. I still have yet to uncover ones I haven't found yet.
If you're new to the series, you don't necessarily have to get the first one, but if you are into the stories and want to know what the heck is going on, you might want to get the original one. I'm not sure if they will have a DLC for the first timers that will include the Legacy Pack (which includes the first Hitman).
The only CON I see is with the brief case. In Hitman: Blood Money, you could see the assembly/disassembly of the gun as you were taking the gun in or out of the briefcase. Here, it's just a few hand movements and the gun just magically disapears in the briefcase. That detail could've been a bit more thorough with as detailed as this game usually is. Plus, you can't go through frisks successfully even if your ""illegal"" items are stored in the brief case. What's the point of the briefcase then?! Yes, I know it's to store your rifle if you have one and travel places without arising suspicion but I was hoping it would be a bit more useful. I know it's realistic to search the briefcase in the real-world, but it would've been useful in the make-believe game anyway.

The second season (meaning Hitman 2) is full of content. The levels feel big and full with oppurtunities to take in. You've got lots of choices between strategies and that's the main thing about this game, the freeedom of approach. If you played the previous titles, you should check this out, you won't regret it (espacially if you liked the first season). It doesn't have that distinct story telling of the older games but it's not bad either, there are interesting aspects of it. 

There are some new mechanics different from the first game as well. For example the AI is much better, they can see you from mirrors, you can blend in crowds and hide in foliage, security cameras monitor activity and the famous sniper briefcase is making a comeback. The gunplay also feels much better imo, might be a placebo for me tho. These are obviously no big changes but it's a good overhaul of the first game. 


The only con I could think of is that this game runs worse compared to the first game. I don't know if it has to do anything with the complexity of the maps, texture resolution, ambient occulsion or other types of things that are different from the first engine. I'm gonna check out Digital Foundry for the differences later.


Btw, if you have the first game's GOTY edition or all the six episodes respectively, you get a Legacy Pack depending on the version. You get the GOTY Legacy Pack if you own the GOTY edition and the normal Legacy Pack if you own only the 6 episodes. Legacy Packs basically lets you play Hitman 1 on the Hitman 2 engine, which is pretty neat.

40 hours in, and it's definitely Hitman, but it just doesn't quite deliver the home run I was hoping for.

I love that David Bateson is back, and continues to voice 47 - without him I'm not sure I would have bought this, or Hitman 2016 - this is a critical element, for me.  David Bateson IS 47, and should he ever not be part of this game, well ... 

My BIGGEST complaint is the performance, still (Dec 22 2018).  I have an older setup, kinda, an i7 2600K @ 4.6, 16GB, SLI 980 Ti - this setup should and still cranks out lovely FPS in every game, depending on the overall settings I set.  It's not just me and my 'old' system talking, there are many others with MUCH higher/newer specs who are still having issues with performance, specifically in Mumbai.  There is a performance issue with this DX11 title; the most recent patch (at the very least) has corrected the insane SLI performance drops.

What's most frustrating is that using an overlay (I use Afterburner + Riva) this game doesn't make sense when it comes to performance, and it clearly (still) leans towards poor optimization (using 50-60% GPU, 60-70% CPU in Mumbai, for instance), and likely a lack of DX12 (possibly Vulkan) support, which Hitman (2016) eventually corrected, and now runs flawlessly on my setup, and looks better - minus the game-changing improvements to Hitman 2 (like actual reflections).

I feel like once this game implements DX12 (which is almost a given based on the RTX support announcement) it will perform better, and also look better (like Hitman 2016).

I may update this again in the future, when/if they further improve the performance, but now, I'm not sure this game is worth the $70 (CND) price tag - get it on sale, it's a steal.",1542150487,1545526712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197960948631,594,13,5144,0,2545,1580175992

Hitman 2.
This game a sequel to its previous title Hitman. 

This is another ambitious step of IO Interactive A/S to improve and develop this franchise title. A new sequel to Hitman 2016. I have played the 2016 which was amazingly introduced. This title during launch had a slight graphical problems, it was shortly repaired within a week after release.

New maps and new improvements. New usage of interacting with targets, non-targets, ambient objects. Alot of preparation, effort and work has been put into this title.

Multiple sequenced scenarious made to accomodate potential outcomes before target is neutralised.

I recommend anyone who has played previous Hitman titles. This dynamic interactive action puzzle game will not dissapoint.

The gameplay is fluid and combat is slightly improved.

A new difficulty level higher than proffesional, the realistic difficulty level. In realistic difficulty level, officers and staff are more critical on gameplay disguises and actions.

Conclusion to this game, challenges to achieve unlocks of gear and insertion points are still available on this 2018 title. In this 2018 version named Hitman 2. More maps and more unique short stories and gossips where the player can try to complete their mission with greater options including bigger maps, challenges and gears.

76,47667291,english,"After playing the hell out of the missions from season 2 and replaying the legacy missions from season 1, investing over 80 hours into the game, I can give my review for what has already received my Steam nomination for game of the year, HITMAN 2.

In a lot of ways I consider this game to be an improvement from the last game, with much better attention to detail in the new maps, giving them more life than any Hitman mission prior. Every single map was really well fleshed out in my opinion. Some are obviously better than others but none of them felt Colorado or even Marrakesh level bad. Miami was incredibly fun and packed with crowds. Colombia was discrete and its hostility was not to be underestimated. Mumbai was hauntingly accurate in Indian culture and environments (they actually got voice actors with fitting acents. *cough* Marrakesh). Vermont was REALLY fun and a nice omage to A New Life. Isle of Sgail was uncomfortably cult-like, fitting for the finale and first confrontation of the Constant.

Maps aside, the game has little more to offer in terms of equipment or suits. It does however give us a fish... and the absolute meme that is the most intimidatingly deadly briefcase known to man. Certain mechanics have been adjusted to be faster and more accurate, the addition of the corner cam is a nice touch, information is delivered more smoothly this time around and thanfully 47 is no longer a tank.

Access to the legacy maps is a nice addition, even if it's a little disappointing to see certain tricks used in the last game impossible in this one.
Some beloved mechanics and tricks from the last game have unfortunately been nerfed. Most notibly leg shots, fetch trick, VIP behaviour, fire extinguisers and breaching charges are practically useless now.

There are a few negatives from the last game that for some reason are still present, for example: Hip fire is still a thing. Rating system is still too binary. The DRM system.. Clueless why they thought it was still a good idea. As well as a few changes that have made the game worse for some people, for example: Diana. She just doesn't shut the fuck up with her obssesive hand holding and Lee Everett observations! Jorge Franco. Everything about this guy and his inconsistency pissing me and a lot of other pro players off. The story. If you thought it was bad in the last game, since IOI is no longer partnered with Square Enix, cutscenes are presented in the form of storyboards instead of actual cutscenes and it's INCREDIBLY short.

Despite the negatives, though, IOI is continously providing patches and listening to user feedback, so hopefully the bad mechanics and additions will see some changes. I mean they did refuse to fix the meme-case after all, which you've got to give them props for.

Pros:
- Maps are some of the greatest in the franchise
- Absoultely packed with hundreds of hours of content
- Many examples of Blood Money nostalgia
- EPIC (yeah I said it) assassinations
- Creativity and strategising really shine in this game
- Meniachal playstyle is way harder to get away with
- Every completionists wet dream (part 2)

Cons:
- Story is very poorly presented
- DRM system
- The removal of some beloved mechanics
- TOO MUCH DIANA

Overall HITMAN 2 is like HITMAN but better. Given IOI is provided enough time to fix fan's issues with the game (which I am confident they will) HITMAN 2 gets my game of the year nomination for 2018!

Ghost Mode is a fun new addition that I never thought I would like but multiplayer Hitman turns out to be a blast. The game being packaged with Sniper Assassin makes the game even more worth it in my opinion. This game will be a bit hard to run on an older machine but I'd say it's worth the upgrade. This game has tons of replayability with all the chalenges on the new and old levels. The new featured contracts being released every few days. The escalation missions that drastically change gameplay every level, and the best part about the game in my opinion is the Elusive Targets. The Elusive Targets are one attempt new developer made contracts where you cannot save. There are so many new ways to approach them for each target and the thrill of figuring out the routine and weaknesses of each target with only one try is probably the best feeling in the game. All in all I'd give the game a 9/10 I was gonna go for a seven but the additon of Hitman 20116 maps and the Sean Bean target brought the game back up for me.

If you're not sure what this is, here's a short description: a 3rd person sandbox puzzle hitman simulator, you're tasked with eliminating targets in huge open levels. There are dozens of curated ways to take people down, and hundreds of emergent ones. 

The majority of your time is spent scheming how to get close to your targets, and how to set up circumstances to take them down. You are continually bonking randoms on the head to take their clothes so you can sneak around--a waiter can get close to food to poison it, and a gardener can access a shed full of sharp tools and not raise an eybrow. 

You can play it like you're the stealthiest sneaky dude of all time, in and out like a ghost, or you can play it like a bumbling hitman on his first mission, accidentally throwing scissors into guards' necks as your target shrieks and runs. I spent a few hours in the early game bumbling around and trying to figure out how to get people alone to take their outfits, then something *clicked* and I became a master at luring people out of their routines. 

A recent story: I felt like a complete badass when I took my sniper rifle to one of the overpasses in Miami and sniped one target, a driver, and then, as I came to the door of the overpass tower, a cop ran in on high alert, having heard the gunshot, and I stepped to the side as the door opened, neatly concealing myself and my briefcase from the cop, who ran past and up the stairs, leaving me to stroll out onto the grass and look for the ideal spot from which to snipe the next target.

91,47630973,english,"A must-have game in your collection for die hard stealth fans. Hitman 2 is an outstanding successor to Hitman (2016). I am glad they ditched the episodic release format for each map and just release all 6 maps at once. 

Each map's environment is huge and presents diverse opportunities to take out/manipulate your targets. Characters of interest have interesting dialogues that sometimes make me stop in my tracks just to eavesdrop their conversation. The music, environment and everything feels immersive and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

My top favourite maps are the Isle of Sgail, Whittleton Creak and Miami. The first 2 mentioned, they gave me very strong Hitman Blood Money vibes and thats I love it so much. Miami is a very unique location as it has a race-car event for its environment, which is new for a Hitman game. I can see alot of effort was made into this map and this map has very fun and unique assassination methods, thats why I liked it alot. Mumbai and Santa Fortuna felt a little long-winded, but it was still really fun to explore as well. Even though the introduction map Hawke's Bay was smaller compared to others, it has various interestesting elimination methods and story lines to the characters that compensate for it.

The sniper assassin map, Himmelstein in Austria, made me stay up all night and spent hours and hours on it, that's how much fun it is. There are so many little things of interest that are easily overlooked.

After spending hours playing as 47, I noticed 47's face in Hitman 2016 appears to be perpetually fierce, whereas in the newer maps, he appears to have a much neutral face.

A shortcoming that I can think of for this game is that the story telling cutscenes in between missions are no longer animated like it did in the previous game. It is presented in a comic-book style, which although is unique, its kinda unusual for the Hitman game. Nevertheless, I got used to it quickly.

If you purchased the Hitman 2016 edition, you have access to it in Hitman 2 as well, although all your achievements accumulated are not available in this game. It is fine by me, because I get to play the old maps again.

The AI is much smarter in this game. They can see you in reflections of mirrors.

TL;DR
HITMAN 2 doesn't do too much to the formula that wasn't already established in 2016. If you had any serious qualms with the game from two years ago, I doubt you'll change your mind about it this year, even with the new multiplayer and sniper modes. However, if you are like me, and all you wanted was more of the previous game, then this is perfect for you. There are more maps to explore, more items to use, more murder methods to employ, and more hidden bits of dark and funny dialogue to discover. The story and the missions go in some interesting directions with some unique twists to the familiar format. It is a ton of content and, if you have the previous game already, you can install the previous maps into HITMAN 2 to make the game even bigger. It's a convenient way of having all the maps in one place and it allows you to re-experience everything with some slightly updated mechanics and graphics. Just be aware that you might need 100+ GB of space on your hard drive.

I haven't been a fan of the franchise since the beginning, but I'm definitely one now and I cannot overstate how much fun I am continuing to have with HITMAN 2.",1544930357,1544930357,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198032575353,469,45,10005,0,5097,1589063362

Have you played Hitman 2016? This is DLC for Hitman 2016. I am not joking. You are paying full 60€ (80€ if you want the full game since quite an important piece of story content is behind the season pass) for what is quite literally a map pack for Hitman 2016. Plus a couple of useless MP game modes that noone is ever going to play.

Do I have a problem with paying 80€ for a game? No, I think games are unsustainably underpriced, since they remained at the same price for a decade without covering for inflation and rising standards. I am against paying a full game's price for extra content to a game I already played. Zero new mechanics. No improvements or changes to existing mechanics. And worst disappointment of all for me - even less story. In Hitman 2 they decided story was so unimportant they reduced it to [i]slideshow cutscenes[/i] between levels. Just slideshows with some voice over. Hell you can play the original Hitman 2016 from within the main menu of this game. Its literally the same build - just more maps.

Now I have stated in my Hitman 2016 review that my favourite of the series is Absolution because of it's more directed story-focused approach. It is disappointing that instead of improving Absolution's gameplay elements, and continuing with that approach, they decided to milk the niche audience of Hitman: Blood Money by making this no-story sandbox ""find your own fun"" kind of game. But whatever, their choice, if it makes them money why not? However, trying to sell a content pack that contains less actual content than the first game as a standalone game (without even offering a discount to owners of Hitman 2016) is just an insult to returning customers. If you are like me, this game is just plain not for you. If you like Hitman 2016, then wait and buy this content pack for at least a 50% off discount. If you haven't played Hitman 2016, I guess you can give this a shot, read my Hitman 2016 review to see what I think.

40,47409403,english,"Takes everything great about HITMAN 2016 and makes it all better.  Very close to the difinitive HITMAN experience in my opinion.  When you combine the Legacy pack with the current HITMAN 2 maps, there is so much to do here.  I am currently 47 hours in and I'm fairly certain I'm going to clock up another 100 before I'm done with this game.

Pros:
-Graphics. Looks amazing, the HITMAN 2 levels in particular are sprawling environments with loads of exploration and unique assassination methods to discover.  Miami and Wittleton Creek in particular are beautiful new additions to the game, while the Isle of Sgail is one of those maps that typifies that exotic location premise.  
-Gameplay.  Speaking of assassination, there are so many ways to kill your targets in this game, and rewards you with some truly awesome moments, as well as some hilarious ones too.  One of the major criticisms I had with Absolution was the relative lack of humour to the rest of the series.  HITMAN 2 has the right amount of silly kills that will force a chuckle out, while still giving you the tools to be a serious stealthy assassin.  It's a great balance and keeps the game fresh.  Finally, between Hokkaido, the Isle of Sgail, the elusive targets, and escalation missions you'll have plenty of challenge as well, as the limitation force you to plan ahead as well as improvise.
-Content.  When you combine this game with the Legacy pack, the escalations, the elusive targets, contracts, multiplayer modes and the challenges, there is so much to do here it's not funny.  And the game is going to be constantly updated for the forseeable future too so there will be plenty of reasons to come back to HITMAN 2.
-Multiplayer.  Even as a beginning to HITMAN's foray into multiplayer, this game does the job nicely.  Contracts have been around for a while, are effortless to create and provide all sorts of freedom to make the game more replayable.  Ghost mode is a blast, although there is a sense of speed is more important than stealth so hopefully they can rectify this.  Also, make sure you know the map before you go in as it's easy to get lost trying to get to a target.  But it is some hilarious fun, especially seeing your ghost partner getting spotted in front of you while you stealth kill.  Sniper maps are really good to, especially co-op, and hopefully IOI get some new maps out.

On the Fence:
-Audio.  The soundtrack is overall pretty good, nice atmospheric stealth music for the most part.  Also some of the in map tracks are fantastic and fit the mood of the location.  However some of the voice acting leaves a lot to be desired.  Some voices sound very jarring in places which ruins the tone.  There are some good bits, and everyone knows Agent 47's familiar deadpan voice, but overall the VA work could do with some improvement.  Otherwise all the maps sound great and create the right atmosphere.
-The Legacy Pack. On one hand, almost all the content from HITMAN 2016 is available again in HITMAN 2, which is fantastic.  However, for anyone who's grinded their way through the first game, it feels somewhat cheap that you have to redo everything to unlock all your gear again.  Yes the progression system is different and the item unlocks have been revised, and it's good that some items are no longer locked behind the hardest difficulty, but still, having to do some of those annoying challenges again is a bit of a letdown.  Having said that, HITMAN 2016 features some fantastic level design, and with the added mechanics brought by HITMAN 2, there is a bit of freshness to be had.

Cons:
-Colorado.  The intention of this map was to create a challenge, which it does, however, it's not an ""exotic location"" nor is it a particularly fun map to play on.  The SASO challenge on Master difficulty is especially annoying.
-Always online.  I know a number of reviews have stated this already, but having to be connected to the internet to register challenge completion and unlock gear is frustrating and hopefully will get rectified soon.  I would 100% place HITMAN 2 at the top of the tree in terms of Hitman games if this was removed.
-Story.  The story has never been the Hitman series' greatest asset, and really the game is not here to tell a great story, but the story in this game (including HITMAN 2016's portion) is downright pitiful.  There's a bit of an intriguing twist at the end but overall it's pretty basic and formulaic.  With a more intriguing and engaging story this could have been a true classic in every sense of the word.

Overall this is one of the greatest games I've played in a long time.  Honestly the amount of things to do in this game rivals some open world behemoths without the feeling that the game's robbing you of your time.  There's some fantastic replayability.  If you're a fan of the stealth genre this is a must play in my opinion.",1544342857,1544342857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198013513913,291,3,13814,0,3166,1583500931
41,47408985,english,"Hitman 2 is in the forefront of the modern game release practices in both good and bad. The game is a modular base that can be expanded and comes with all kinds of baits meant to keep the player attached. Missions are of elaborate design for certain, and can be completed in many ways as the wall of achievements to be had at the end of each mission shows. However, while there are options in how to complete a mission, they represent a type of pseudo freedom, where you are restrained into following strict paths laid by the developer.

The strict path is also ever so present in how the game plays otherwise. Hitman, a hardened stealth assassin, is dumbfounded before insurmountable obstacles such as low steps. You cannot walk down from the side of stairs or drop down four feet unless the developer allows it. Walk through a raised flowerbed? No, 47, you may not. Instead, climb over this wall right next to it. While there would be seemingly scalable surroundings everywhere, only specific hotspots are apparently within mission parameters. Half of the movement controls are reduced to a press x to do something adaptation, and melee combat is a small collection of animated quicktime events with a one button level of interaction.

So every step of the way I was trying NOT to do what the developer intended, and just played the game keeping as far away from the leash as possible. This translated to pretty direct get close and get the kill tactics, and only allowed for the game to last a few hours, which for a full priced title is a fraction of what it should be. I like the game's sleak and polished look, with a great eye for environmental design and the large crowds add atmosphere, but I'm not into being told how to play a game in order to get the most out of it.

what the hell happened to the cinamatics and cutscense??!?
HitMan (2016) had very captivating cinamtics that had me wanting more story.
Hitman 2 (2018) has slide shows with subtitles over them.
it pulls me out of the story so much that now I find my self either skipping them or using the opportunity for a bathroom break. 

other than that this game really knocks it out of the park!!
there is not much to improve upon in the hitman series. it has always been a great game to play!
it feels very much like a 3rd person chess game. having to plan out strategies and how to approach just about anything in any level. graphics are fine. not much of an improvement from the last game but that is not a bad thing. it looks really good. not great. but really good.

the insentive to play each level over and over and over again is absolutley a stand out feature in the hitman series. other than collectibles you don't often find yourself replaying certain portions of other games hours on end.
it is a steep price if you want the whole season pass and DLC and all that jazz. but honestly this is one game that offers your moneys worth in gameplay. no tote bags. no art books. nothing to bump up the price of their deluxe version of the game other than quality gameplay and in game features.

58,47320815,english,"If you think Hitman 2 is just a 'slight face lift' improvement over the last game then you're dead wrong. The graphics, which already looked slick, are a lot more detailed now. The areas are absolutely gigantic, easily the biggest levels ever featured in a Hitman game and impressively full of realistic feeling NPCs. If anything they're almost too big - like an assassination marathon of sorts often involving three targets at a time. I'd personally like to see the occasional single target mission included in the storyline. The last game went with multiple targets in every mission which makes it feel not special anymore and Hitman 2 ups the ante with multiple three target missions. The storyline actually gets borderline interesting as Agent 47's origins take centre stage but I've never cared much for Hitman storylines and I'd almost be happier with the ""story"" being simply you are a guy being paid to kill people.  All in all I think this game is being severely underrated and overlooked as a mere face lift when it is in fact a beast of a Hitman game with impressively ambitious level design which delivers an experience well beyond what was achieved in Hitman 2016. Speaking of Hitman 2016 you'll be able to revisit and play all those missions in Hitman 2 with the improved graphics and gameplay.

Besides the 2-3 ""special assassinations"" per location I find myself struggling to re-play them though because they're all pretty repetitive besides the scripted assassinations. Add this in with the fact there are only 5, and I just don't really think it's worth it for a full priced game. I've owned every Hitman ever made and it seems like it gets smaller with every iteration and more like a demo.

The sniper challenge is fun until you take 5m to try and actually beat it and if you unlocked everything from the previous version prepare to go through the entire game and unlock it all again because it wipes all your progress. The elusive targets are cool but just like the last game, suffer from a timelock that will prevent you from getting the rewards if you don't regularly log in to check on elusive targets.

TL:DR version:

It's fun but extremely short for 60 dollars and it wipes all progress from the previous game which requires you to play through it again if you want to use any of those items/upgrades. The Hitman franchise continues to decline while swathes of people bought into marketing pretend that it's anything more than a demo.

I am both, but recently I don't play any stealth game as the genre only has few titles. I play Metal Gear Solid 1, 2, 3, 4, and MGS V. Unfortunately MGS V formula is different than the previous title so I stopped playing it. Too many unimportant mission need to be done to get the story cutscene. The stealth itself is pretty good, but nothing special.

In Hitman 2, you can enjoy it like you enjoy previous Hitman (minus Absolution), plan your action and eliminate your target. No need for useless side mission. The story is the continuation of Himan (2016), it explain how the shadow client in previous Hitman is your *******. 

Graphic: Nothing special, I think MGS V is better, but maybe it's because my potato PC can't handle the high setting in 60fps. -> 8/10
Music: Is good. -> 9/10
Map: Larger than previous Hitman Game, especially the mumbai and colombia map. -> 8/10
Challenges are plentiful, may take dozens of hours (if not hundreds). Especially if you have Hitman complete episodes which make you eligible for Legacy Pack DLC that allow you to play HITMAN in HITMAN 2. -> 9/10
Replaybility: 9/10 
Gameplay: stealth are better than old hitman, you can use cover, hide in bushes and crowds. The most important things here is the ability to distract NPC in many ways. Which really help in achieving SUIT ONLY SILENT ASSASSIN challenges in each map. This really shine if you watch HITMAN 2 Speedrun, which can be achieved by some YouTuber in less than 30 minutes (REAL TIME), then you can ask Steam to refund your game, or just keep it, enjoy the game, while supporting IO-Interactive to make great Hitman game and long online support). 9/10
Online/Multiplayer: No real multiplayer game but a 2 player online sniper mode and ghost mode which allow you to challenge your opponent on killing target perfectly. Contract and Elusive targets is quite fun.

Minus:
- No weapon customization (since Absolution)
- [strike] No nude mod (ok, not really minus, but Bethesda game has, lol)[/strike]
- No newspaper like in Hitman Blood Money and no rating. If you finish the mission beside silent assassin rating, the rating screen will not show any other title, only score. In Hitman Blood Money, you can see many (https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Ratings).

While Hitman 2016 was great and my personal GOTY when it came out, Hitman 2  improves on the formula and gives us even more choice and finally gives us the option to take a briefcase with us.

Personally not a fan of stealth games because it always comes down to 1 or 2 tactics that you keep repeating (e.g. Batman arkham games, dishonored) but in Hitman 2 you just have so many options and they're often very unique from other levels. 

Some more positive points:
-Voices that fit the NPC's (unlike Hitman 1)
-Loads of unlockables
-Interesting story for a Hitman game
-Loads of NPC's in 1 level
-Great soundtrack
-Awesome level design
-Great art design

Some small negative points:
-Graphics take a small step back but this might be because of the enormous amount of NPC's each with their own routine.
-Cutscenes are not entirely animated which is a bummer
-The story while interesting is pretty short and could use a lot more fleshing out.
-Illusive targets should be repeatable (also the ones from Hitman 2016 should all be available)

Save games not following through Hitman 1 and being forced to play through and complete every season 1 assasination is another challange and personally only having to play Sapienza.  ;) 

Bad signs of the developers working to a deadline for it's investors. Kinda made obvious by various cut backs such as cut scenes no longer being animated in season 2 & really bad AI pathing. It's also inclusive of a pointless alternate timeline exploring a story already done and told in silent assassin.

10,47219325,english,"Have you ever imagined yourself to be a professional killer? Just like the ones in the movies that ""get the job done"" with a silenced weapon, wipe off their fingerprints and leave without a trace? Well then this is a game for you!

This game goes for a lot of realism, so you can expect a lot of stuff from real life in here. Things like:
- Npcs act in believable ways. They will make meaningful conversation with each other and react in horror if they see you doing something ""not very legal"".
- As you'd expect in real life, shooting the target in the face in front of a bunch of guards will not go over very well with them.
- If you're seen holding a weapon it's going to raise a few eyebrows (and potentially alarms).

As you'd expect of a real pro, your job is to take out your target without getting noticed or leaving a trace. Maybe they just tripped and accidentally landed on a fire, you know? Stealth is a core part of the game, of course, but you CAN go in guns blazing if you don't care about score.

One of the ""less realistic"" but absolutely incredible elements of this game is the disguise system. You can take another person's clothes (forcefully, most of the time) and infiltrate the location as one of the guards or staff. Some of the npcs, called ""Enforcers"" are apparently really good friends with their work colleagues, so they'll recognize you even through the disguise. This adds a lot of fun and depth to the stealth.

Voice acting is top notch across the board, the game will really make you feel like you're a professional in the field.

A word of warning: The game technically ""only"" contains 6 main levels. Hear me out, it's not a bad thing, it just requires a different approach to the game than you'd normally expect. Each level (apart from the 1st, which is more like a tutorial) is huge and chock full of content. The game has a thing called ""Story missions"" which guide you through a bunch of fun different ways that you can take out the target(s). You will need at least 3 playthroughs of each level just to go through them, and there's more secret ways to kill the target outside of those if you can figure them out.

Once you're ""done"" with the story, I advise you go for the ""classic"" challenges. These range from simply requiring you to complete a level ""perfectly"", to downright brutal ones like the famous ""Silent Assassin Suit Only"" challenge which forbids you from ever changing your disguise (thus, the ""suit only""), no matter how dangerous it may be to enter the area that the target resides in, while also requiring a perfect score. As you can see, even with ""just 6 levels"" I got 120+ hours on the game, and that's without needlesly repeating any content (and without getting any of the boring achievements).

As you might have noticed, this is the 2nd game in the series and it improved on the original in a bunch of small but very meaningful ways:
- There are now several difficulty levels.
- Bushes and crowds can now be used to hide in.
- There is a new online game mode called Ghost Mode which is very fun!
- Other stuff.

The only downside I've noticed is that the performance seems worse in this one, but it's manageable.

The current base game is not all you're getting with the purchase as the developers keep adding extra content like bonus missions and have promised new additions to the online mode as well. These are both separate from the DLC which will be available for purchase to give you extra locations.

If you're afraid of missing out on the 1st game, don't be, you can purchase the ""Legacy Pack"" which adds all the missions, improved, from the 1st game to this one. If you already own Hitman 1 you just get them for free.

You could call Hitman a stealth game but it's a unique genre of its own because your goal isn't just to ""get past the enemies"", but to also kill your targets. If you just want to breeze through the story and have no plans to do any of the challenges/extra content/higher difficulties then I suggest you avoid this game unless it's on a 50% sale, since you'll be done within like 10 hours.

If you heard something about a ""Shady Privacy Policy"", it's complete nonsense, creating an IO account is completely optional and doesn't lock any part of the game away from you (I didn't make one, for example). Even then, I don't think there's anything special about the ""policy"" anyway, just fear mongering from uninformed people.

The game does have an ""Always online"" requirement, but handles it very well. Reconnecting is pretty easy if you ever lose connection (even in the middle of a game) and you can keep playing the entire game offline, just without the unlocks (most of which are not necessary). I may also be biased a little because I'm a generally competitive player and always online ensures nobody cheats on the leaderboards (so far I have seen no instances of cheating). You may be thinking ""Huh, leaderboards?"". They're essentially about trying to complete a level perfectly in the shortest amount of time possible, pretty fun!",1543617752,1543618034,True,2,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False,76561198034694581,105,10,15325,0,7417,1574286294

Pros: 
1. Excellent Level Design
2. Mission Stories are well constructed and give amazing payoffs if you follow them.
3. Graphics are good but not on par with the current generation of games.
4.  Insane Replayability. I played each map so many times and each time i found something interesting.
5. Contracts mode and the new Ghost Mode are fantastic.
6. The suitcase and the different suits.
7. Tools of the trade.

Cons:
1.  AI. The biggest problem with this game. AI is very rudimentary and not mission specific. Makes the game feel more like a puzzle solving challenge than an actual immersive experience.
2. No ripple effect after assassinating the main targets.  Invariably a bodyguard appears and says 'Oh Well! Sierra Knox is Dead..No big deal, i will just bag her and tag her. Adios. Finito! ' Nobody seems to care about such influencial targets being killed.  In this instance, her father Robert Knox just goes about his day as usual even though his daughter is dead and done with. 
3. Animations need to be ramped up. 47 feels like a robot when he walks or opens doors with just a touch and traverses ledges like a tin man. And the fiber wire kills are so fast and unrealistic. I cant even see the fiber wire when he is strangling people. The sniper rifle unpacking animations should be included too, you know where 47 assembles the sniper rifle after opening the suitcase, like in the previous games.  Also blood, where is the effin Blood developers??! 
4. Just make the game more immersive and realistic with the current formula. Look at Red Dead 2. IOI will make insane amounts of money if they just make it feel real, grim and more stylish. I know they have budget problems but now that they have a good working game, they can push forward, i guess.

All this talk about the privacy policy and the small first mission, dishonest sales practices, etc: NONE of this is different from the original reboot (Hitman 2016).  If you were cool with that game's intrusions into your privacy and the small tutorial level being marketed as a full level (huh? was it really?), and all the silver/deluxe/gold edition yada yada, this isn't anything worse.

From what I've seen so far, this is exactly the same experience as Hitman 2016, and I mean that in a good way.  We all wanted IOI to stop messing with things once they finally got it right (Absolution after Blood Money was yuck), and it seems like Hitman 2016 finally gave us what we wanted (although still no sniper-rifle briefcase), and therefore I think we should all be happy that IOI didn't take this game back to the drawing board, but kept things mostly untouched (while still managing to finally add a sniper-rifle briefcase).

For roughly the same price as its forebear it has fewer levels than Hitman 2016, but from what I can see we are NOT getting less content! And what content there is appears to be of higher quality (better acting). Bigger juicer levels, and they're all being released at once instead of episodically which was very stupid of Square Enix with Hitman 2016 IMO.

The only complaint I agree with is there is a noticeable downgrade in the cinematics, which was one of my favorite parts of Hitman 2016.  They try valiantly to dress them up and mostly succeed, but you can tell it's a much smaller budget in this area than the previous game.

I can't speak to the story because I've only played the first two levels, but nothing seems worse here.

My main point is, after reading the negative reviews I was feeling rather apprehensive about buying this, but now that I've seen for myself, I feel those negative reviews were way overblown.  There really is very little that's different from Hitman 2016, and if you're like me, that's a reason to buy, not avoid.

Edit:  I now have more hours in the game, and feel I should also mention there is a significant upgrade in NPC graphics.  I also can't emphasize the improvement in NPC acting enough, it is much better than Hitman 2016.  And the levels, oh the levels.  Yes there are less of them, but they really are bigger and juicier.

This is a large open world concept with muliple optional storylines that you need to do quite a bit of wandering around to find.  However, they have introduced a new character - the Enforcer.  These are random characters scattered about the map that can see you wandering around and find you suspicious, challenge you and ultimately try to shoot you ... even if you are in a disguise.  This seriously impacts you being able to move about the map to find intel and story lines.  The other BIG difference is the lack of basic equipment you would expect to be available to you at the start of a mission - like lockpicks.  You can be moving through a storyline, come to a locked door and be stuck, especially if you have committed yourself to a certain risky plan of action.  Being an open world, there is no easy way to even find a lockpick ... you have to stumble upon it,

If I knew then what I know now, I would not have purchased the game.  There is no flow becasue it is too herky-jerky stopping and starting with the presence of the Enforcers, and I don't even have the basic Hitman equipment for a mission.   It is go 50 yards, get a new disguise, hide, go another 50 yards, get another disguise, hide ... rinse and repeat.  I find myself getting caught and killed about 25 times for each individual story line, and this is just not my idea of fun ... not for the high price of this game.

This doesn't even mention that you can't play the game unless you are on-line, even in single-player.

What can I say - it's brilliant, tough, scary and very, very rewarding when you get it right.  Thats when you get it right. 

Don't buy this if your expecting an FPS shooter - if you use your gun more than a couple of times in each mission chances are your not playing it right - and you're also likely to die, you have to approach each mission using your most deadly weapon - your brain.  Replayablity is off the scale as each mission is designed for you to replay it, and get different outcomes every time - this is where, for me, the game really shines.

If you don't already own the 2016 Hitman then I strongly suggest you buy the GOTY Legacy Pack as well, this is not included in your purchase of Hitman 2 - so if you buy the Expansion pass as well (content to be released later!) the whole package is going to cost you a lot of money.

Really fun game but the logistics of the game get in the way of my fun. I don’t care about DRM and legit score postings and competition, I just want to kill my target in the dumbest way possible without anyone noticing. 

And just to elaborate on why I don’t like the elusive targets. The fun of hitman for me is the many ways you can eliminate your mark but the elusive targets directly oppose that mentality and encourage you to go by the book. “Don’t you dare f**k it up because you’re not allowed to replay the mission, I don’t CARE if you accidently performed an illegal action and got yourself killed that’s on you” said IO Interactive.

Pros
+The amount of content and variety for every level is staggering. You can take so many approaches, it's up to you how you want to play. (For those saying it's ""too easy"", turn off the story mission guides in the options menu and/or play on Master difficulty.) 
+You can play Hitman 1 levels in the Hitman 2 engine. Replaying them with the new UI on Master difficulty is truly a great addition.
+The gameplay feels faster and smoother than the first Hitman.
+Replayability is off the charts, with you trying to master every level and complete all the challenges and gain all the unlocks, almost every runthrough of a mission can be different.
+Contracts return to give you community-made targets and challenges, so new targets never end.
+Visuals can be very good at times and has a nice balance of not hampering gameplay at times.
+This game is the best and/or second best Hitman game to date (Blood Money is first in some aspects, but this game wins in other aspects)

Cons
-The game does have a ""tone"" so to speak, in that everything is clean and modern, but it is nowhere near the tone and atmosphere of Blood Money. The music is a bit lackluster (Except for some parts in Whittleton Creek), nothing as memorable as Jespyr Kyd's Blood Money ost.
-This ""Live Experience""/always online bullshit has to go. Why is this still in the game after so many people rightfully knock points off the last game for that? AT LEAST make unlocks and progression available offline.
-There can be minor bugs and glitches at times that remove you from the experience at times (If 47 is wearing glasses, they do not appear in mirrors/getting stuck behind doors/SOMETIMES when attacking an enemy from behind, they will literally TURN AROUND in a split second as if you were in front of them, trigger the front facing attack quick time event, and you will be compromised.)
- The framerate takes a huge hit when you are far away staring at a landscape (Ex. Sapienza, when at the top of the Sapienza Ruins, staring at Silvio Caruso's property makes the framerate go from 110 looking at the ocean, to 30 to 55. I have a GTX 1070.)

[i]Ignore the privacy policy garbage, it's not worth the concern and no one is trying to farm your data - your data is already farmed in 100 other places.[/i]

[b]Let's start with the cons because they are few:[/b]
[*] - [b]The amount of locations.[/b] I was slightly dissapointed that we were getting one less location than Hitman 1 (discounting the sniper level at Himmelstein). Now we have been promised two new locations from the Season Pass/Deluxe content. [b]If this comes as it is sold and we do end up getting two full locations I will absolutely remove this point.[/b] My feeling is that we will get one and a sniper challenge because WB are money-hungry and that would cast a shadow here. With that being said IOI have done exceedingly well to keep this franchise going given their difficulties over the last year, for that reason I did decide to support them ahead of time and take these two locations on faith.
[*] - [b]Multiplayer[/b] This really isn't a huge gripe I just find it useless. Everyone would have loved co-operative hitman, no one really seems interested in what is presented here. People like to take their time planning hits and studying level design and character interactions. All this does is create a stressed and disconnected experience based on rushing around another player. With that being said, meh, it impacts nothing and it's not a buggy mess or anything.

[b]On to why I voted for this for Game of the Year:[/b]

[*] - [b]The Hitman Experience[/b] When the episodic format of Hitman 1 was announced I was in the minority of fans that weren't upset by this. Overall I think it has had a great impact on what 'Hitman' can be. The main driving force behind why I was for it was my optimism that once a lot of locations were introduced this would then feel like something special. When the IOI controversy broke and WB scooped them up I was concerned the new game would be fragmented and you simply wouldn't be able to have this MASSIVE Hitman experience. I am glad to say I was wrong, you can effortlessly move between Hitman 1 levels and Hitman 2 (presumably Hitman 3 fingers crossed) and it just feels...special. Like they have truly realised promises I remember reading in 90's playstation magazines about a world-spanning assassin selecting the best tools for the job. It really does feel like that. I know it may seem like an odd thing to start with but this menu system is really special. To labour the point I had always felt like 47 needed a physical hideout, I guess kinda like what you get in PAYDAY2 but with more gun tuning and less terrible boredom. I'm happy to say I no longer think that - this menu is your passport, your arsenal, your wardrobe, your filing system and my god is it satisfying. Well-bloody-done IOI on realising something through hardship that people didn't know they wanted until they had it.
[*] - [b]Graphics[/b] If you're reading this review you know what the game looks like, it's gorgeous. Perhaps one thing of note is that it runs much better than Hitman 1 did at launch and more impressively they have updated every level of Hitman 1 with the new graphical polish of Hitman 2. This is another example of IOI putting in more work than they needed to in order to deliver a confronting and polished experience.
[*] - [b]Agent  47[/b] Fans will be pleased to know that he looks a lot more like he did in Blood Money. People who enjoy the comical situations 47 finds himself in will find no shortage here also. 
[*] - [b]New locations [/b] They're all absolutely stunning. I've never enjoyed Hitman levels as much where the entire area is hostiles. I much prefer large public spaces with hostile areas to infiltrate. Think Paris vs Colarado or Gun Shop vs Terminus. From what I can tell most of the fanbase agree with me on that and thankfully it seems IOI have listened. Colombia is a little on the hostile heavy side but there's enough freedom that this is forgivable. Miami is beyond awesome and Isle of Sgain is just breathtaking with a really cool feel to it. My favourite has to be Whittleton Creek though - it's a small town/suburb in middle-class America and it's the type of place where Hitman hits the apex of what it can do and how it feels to play. Anyone that has played Blood Money will know of a mission involving a mafioso and a clown costume and Whittleton Creek is very much in that wheelhouse.
[*] - [b]Elusive Targets[/b] Some people love them, some people hate them. I actually think they're another integral part of the overall Hitman experience, a reason to keep coming back to the game and the most likeable and sensible way of implementing game-as-live-service that I've seen yet. They've set the bar high from the start with Sean Bean as 'The Undying' and having completed that mission I can say honestly that if they're all around that quality it's again going to be something very special when viewed as a whole experience. It's something this franchise does very well - breadth instead of depth.
[*] - [b]Gameplay[/b] I have heard reports that things like character movement and animations are clunkier on console, I can't speak to that. I have seen confirmed however that hitboxing on console is *bad*. I'm pleased to say that the master race remains unperturbed by this and none of those problems exist here. If you have played previous Hitman titles then I can say with assurity you will find this to be the most fluid, least 'clunky' one yet. If you haven't played any of them then maybe check out footage, you're not going to be free running around at the hold of a button like Assassin's Creed. The gameplay requires thought, trial and patience if you want to be top rated. This is no bad thing, the game knows what it wants to be and does that very well. It's specific, which is something very important for a big title in today's increasingly vanilla, design-by-committee, fckin Ubisoft sandbox inspired, trash. RDR2 is another great example of a major title knowing what it wants to be and sticking to it, Witcher 3 would be another. Learn the lesson people, no one wants the product designed to offend the least people because that product is boring. Hitman 2 for GoTY.
[*] - [b]Inventory[/b] Almost forgot, everything you'd expect is here and more. It's kinda lame that they just stuck a ""2"" on existing items and called them Mk.II but I'm certain given the fan response that this will be taken care of so I'm not putting it in the cons column. New crazy weapons, disguises, beautiful suits and yes, at last, the briefcase is back baby.

I hope they continue to grow and tweak the formulae. Ghost Mode still needs a chunk of work to come out of Beta and some bugs could be worked on but having finished the story on professional now I think all the maps have offered something genuinely new, unique and interesting.

Since I was playing the first HITMAN and this one was on the way, I decided why the hell not buy it. It was literally HITMAN but better cause multiplayer and refined mechanics and UI.
Not only I purchased it, but the golden pack to play sniper assassin and have the expansions, so I was fuckin ready.
And turns out, there is a legacy pack for the first maps.
And I had them cause I had the first game
No need to buy it again (not that I would but I'm happy that it turned out this way)
I was fuckin pleased with that, and had a lotta maps and ways to play, even if I had bought standard edition cause the expansions aren't even out yet
It's a great fuckin business to buy this just from this facts cause it is clear that IO Interactive did it's best not for money, but for the comunity that was listened to, and I like that shit

And for the gameplay, 
I was a clown that was hammering everyone without others noticing, put bodies in a hay machine, became a fashion star, distracted people with coins while I hammer some other dude, and exploded a duck in Sean Bean's face.

83,47048775,english,"Regarding the private policy. Allow me to give you a rundown for Hitman 2.

For thouse that don't know. Hitman is a game about assisination, breaking into people's mansions and stealing their clothes. Mindless slauther is discourage. For every npc you killed in game, you would get the big red font that says 'non-target kill' and deduct 5,000 points on your score. Sure, you can still complete some challenges while raising hell. You would end up lossing the silent assasin raiting, anyways. Literally, you goal here is to eliminate only on the target and try to get out of there without any resistence coming after you.

It may suprise other people. Does anyone totally forgot that there never been a James Bond video game for ages? Yea, sure. we already see a bunch of 007 lisence game make by EA and Activision. For Hitman, this is the probably the closet 007 like video game you could ever get. In the 007 films, every Bond villian need to die. The villians are meant to represent the worst of the worse instead of having the highest bid. Most villian are said to be rich, powerful, and currupt. Only one person has to die. This is meant to be the case for Hitman 2.

In fact, the bigest kicker you have to understand is this game has a heavy empasis on the puzzle. It turns out assasination is mean to be the main theme for the puzzle. Pay very close attention to the details on the envirnemt and the level design. Most level design would usually want to keep the player safe and encourage you to go to point A to B. In Hitman. the level design is in a specifc way where there multiple route you can take. In Marrakesh, the target is located in a Swedish Embassy. There are two ways I could get inside. I could climb over the stone wall, make my way through the parking lot and take the locked doorway so I can go after my target. Or or. I could take the camera man disguise and calmly get inside the Embassy without getting too much attention. So many way to take on the target. Variety of ways to kill the target.

What make it appealing is the well crafted storytelling that fill our the details depending on what map you play on. Most FPS would usually require players to shoot x amout of people, trigger cutseen, shoot x amout of people again, trigger another cutseen, and so on. In Hitman, the game does not constantly shoved up a story on your throat as you play though the game. If you take the time to easedrop on the NPCs conversation, you should be able to get hint about the target, their daily routine and look for variety of ways to silently assasin your target. The story is there if you want to pay attention to it, but it really dosen't get in the way of the game. 

While Hitman 2 wasn't nessearly meant to be the true proper sequeal, it was considered to be a major improvement on the already best seath video game. More weapons, and gear are added, including the briefcase. Bigger sandbox enviornment. New game mechanic were added (foilage and NPCs can see the player through the mirror, just like in IRL). New difficulty game mode (Casual, Professional or Master mode). Of course, Co-op sniper and ghost mode included in multiplayer.

While the performance is not really that demaning compared to other triple A titles. The game is very optimized. Depending on the hardware, grathics setting, or the map you play on; your milage may very. Luckly for me, I was able to run the game quite fine between the minimum and recomended reqirements. While the framerate may dip depending on how many NPC, explosive or whatever might throw on me. It playable.

Instantly marked as the ""Game of the Year"" award for the Steam Awards.

88,45867845,english,"Oh my dear Hitman, we meet again. This series is a guilty pleasure of mine. One I have had strong feelings for since I played Silent Asssassin back in 2002 when I was 8 years old. (Probably shouldn't have, but too late now!) This will be a review and also a deeper look into the series as a whole. This is in reference to how I think it stacks up to the others.

First and foremost I would like to mention that I have played every Hitman game except for Hitman: Codename 47 and Absolution. I have been playing this series for well over 15 years. Does that equate to a man such as myself being worthy of writing a review for you, my dear reader? You be the judge.

Gameplay

Hitman 2 is the sequel to the reboot of the series. The first being Hitman 2016. A game I quite enjoyed. This game has you stalking around locales all across the world in search of your next target as the infamous bald headed assassin known as Agent 47. 
A stealth action game is what you will be diving into. But understand my fair reader, you may go in guns blazing and mow down your target and their bodyguards if you so choose.
I play Hitman 2 with a ps4 controller. It is a nice touch that they added in the ps4 button layout to this game and its prequel. Not many games do this and I believe this is worthy of mentioning for those who use a gamepad. To further expand upon this topic; I find it noteworthy that the controls are rather tight and very responsive. My only complaint after playing 23 hours is I notice sometimes when you knock somebody out, the body will still twitch and you cannot grab the body with circle until they stop. This may just be a gameplay feature and or bug. Still, it is worth mentioning.
As you journey across these 6 locations, you may feel overwhelmed by all the things you can do. I know I was. But heed my words reader, I highly suggest you shut off mission stories on your first run. Learning the layout of the map and finding your target and whacking them on your first playthrough without a guide is one rewarding experience I encourage you to try out. If you feel you cannot figure out the map and are struggling for quite some time, then by all means turn them back on.
I am disappointed there are only 6 locations in this story. The first mission is more like a prologue and less like an actual mission. This is detracting when one looks at the 6 locations in the base game. But I will add that there are many things to do per mission. I found myself going back and playing through each mission 3 times each before I moved onto the next one. There are so many avenues in the game that it constantly allows you to explore and try out new ideas without penalizing you.
I love this because that is what was strong in the last game. It allowed so much variety and things to do. It encouraged you to go out and kill your target in many different ways. This is no different. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
From garroting an enemy to poisoning ones IV drip, the forms of assassination are limitless. But gameplay does suffer in one aspect.
The lack of weapon variants bothers me. Hitman Blood Money allowed weapon customization and all manner of add ons and ammunition types. This is something that must be added back and allow more depth in my weaponry than choosing preloaded firearm templates.
All in all, I find this game to be a fun and engaging experience but it does have more of that ""samey"" feelling from the last game. I do not consider this to be problem though. These last two games have shown a lot of promise and I hope to see more improvements on the series.

Soundtrack

Sadly, I do not have nearly as much to say about this as the gameplay. As somebody who loves the music in games, I feel this is a detractor to the game as a whole. Sometimes the music can make or break a video game. Bear in mind, the music here is not bad, by any means.
But, none of the songs give me that epic feeling of being an assassin for hire. None of them give me chills as I lurk through a dark alley about to snuff out some unsuspecting fool.
Jesper Kyd was the voice of the soundtracks in the Hitman series. His dark soundtracks of gloomy ambience and the deep sung voices of latin singers with powerful percussions are what I think of when I look through the scope of a rifle, ready to take the plunge and wipe out my target with lethal efficiency.
There are a few tracks played when you kill your targets that did sound rather well made and intrigued me. I really loved the part when I was stalking through Mumbai after the Shah and that beautiful Indian singer sung those lower parts as I crouched and ran between the bushes.
There is more depth here than the last game in terms of soundtrack, but a pond can only be so deep.

Sound

Excellent is all I have to say. The low crack of a suppressed pistol to the suffocating sounds of a person smothered by a pillow, there is work that has been accomplished here. The sound is done properly and sounds great to my ears.
I love the explosive nature of the shotgun when you blow somebody's feet out from under them. 
Same for the dialogue. They actually made the people from other countries sound like foreigners. This is key. When one travels to Bangkok Thailand and they are all speaking with proper English accents, I find this jarring and wrong. I am looking at you Hitman 2016.
And thankfully, that is gone. When I heard them speaking with Colombian accents in Santa Fortuna, you cannot imagine how relieved I was. It was something I nitpicked at, but hey, others told me it bothered them too.
47 sounds as cold as ever. David Bateson never disappoints. Some of the things he said even made me chuckle. David is a gem in the voice acting world. 

A Glimpse of The Past And A Look To The Future

Hitman 2018 is a solid game without many bugs. A good thing in this day and age if you ask me. Too many companies launch out half baked titles. But I digress.
Hitman continues to impress but it does suffer from some hiccups that I talked about earlier. In my humble opinion, I think this game could learn from its past titles. Atmosphere and music go to Contracts hands down. The grimy and perverse locales of Contracts set the stage for a dark and eerie story. This is further supported by in my own opinion the greatest Hitman soundtrack.
With that said, I think we should go back to a dark and violent world supported by Jesper Kyd in the third game. The deep booming sounds of bass and latin singing would be music to my ears with this highly improved gameplay experience over its predecessors.
We need the dark and moody atmosphere back. I think if this company could manage to combine this modern style gameplay with the brutality of Contracts and the finesse and fantastic storytelling of Blood Money, we may have the best Hitman on our hands in the future.

Final Thoughts

This game could turn off some by its nearly always online requirements. I am completely opposed to this and wish they would remove this. This has kept others from playing a well polished and awesome experience.
This game needs a better soundtrack, more missions than just 6 per game, and a better story that is fleshed out more. This games story is told in still images that were not enjoyable to watch. Do away with that in the next game please. But with all that said, I would avidly grant this game an 8.5 out of 10. If they can work out these kinks, the next one could be a deserving title of best hitman game of all time. Until next time, I bid you fairwell.

90,47029102,english,"Why I enjoyed hitman 1
1. Enjoyable moments, blowing up people, using a atv to blow up the two targets, dismissing all of the soldiers in the old school and turning on the intercom. Snapping general zaydans neck when he thinks the prisoner is sleeping, and other various non cutscene and cutscene kills.
2. Killing every last npc 
3. Poisoning people randomly and overflowing all the sinks and running around dressed like a crazy hippy on a rampage

Why I enjoy hitman 2 a lot more then 1.
1. Hitman 2 is hitman 1 but,
 hitman 2 has better graphics 
2. Hitman 2 has a lot of weapons
3. More creative kills 
4. Freedom to do the kill however I want for example tossing a remote explosive onto the race track and hoping I can time it perfectly to get Sierra Knox. Or luring the guy in the doctors office to leave and knocking him out with a hammer and poisoning the iv bag so Sierra Knox can have a quick demise or I can become the doctor and do it myself if I want. Or pushing mr Knox of the roof or drowning him In a bathroom. My point is the options are almost endless.
5. Easter eggs. Wittenberg pizza on the awning
6. The part where you can serve food to people and poison it in front of them and watch them croak. 
7. Larger maps= more places to hide=More things to do
8. The kashmirian 
9. Slapping a. Guy into a ocean with a fish achievement 
10. No killing dogs i love dogs
11. Tons of challenges 
12. Maybe escalations for season two

What I would like to see added or implemented/improved on.
1. Add more challenges because it would be great to have more things to do more creative things.
2. Maybe add more accessible areas on the map with more NPCs
3. Add more weapons and explosives on the maps.
4. Escalations for season 2
5. Maybe add exclusive targets for each map that alternates every 7 days and that never ends PLS
6. Make guns that are not silenced louder so npcs can hear the gun through doors because realistically people can hear a gun go off in your house of walking by.
7. Rope? You know to garrote your target then toss his body out a window but attach rope to his whatever you want for youtube 
8. I would be exited to see new animations for certain weapons cough cough all melee weapons. For example a variety of animations not just the same crowbar right left animation like maybe a different attack style one time you swing right left one time left right one time you swing it is a downward swing with a skull crack noise. So additional animations for the melee weapons all of them lethal and non lethal and not the same stab animation playing over and over 10,000 times make it unique like 5 different stabs from the right side 5 different animations for the left and 8 animations for front stabs same with non lethal 
9. More dialog like more voice actors more voices like more funny conversations more different people saying stuff when you are compromised like “the guards are going to get you” “you. Are. Done mister” “I’m calling the cops” “police!” Like atleast 10-50 different lines for compromised and for when guards or security catch you they say 10-20 lines of different dialog like “caught red handed, hands up bald guy!” “Hands up mister” “you are under arrest” I feel like I am playing oblivion over here
Npc1: hi npc2: bye npc2: 
hi npc1: bye
10. Lever action revolver or a bolt action rifle like hunting rifle 
10. Add more ghost mode spawns for the targets 
11. Add ghost mode for every map 
12. Ghost mode 1v1v1
13. Coop hits like playing hitman with a friend or with a random and doing a hit with your buddies


Criticism.
1. Dialog is repetitive at times I hear the same lines of dialog over and over when I get compromised or hunted or arrested, or trespassing
2. Melee weapons animations are repetitive the same animation for attacking someone from the front happens the same exact way 20 times. Same with attacking someone from the sides. The only animation that works good that way is the silent one because slicing their throat is somewhat enjoyable.
3. Mk2 weapons really you could not think of creative weapons do you had to add mk2 to everything the mace is pretty cool same animation but cool. I am just saying you could make silver baller and then name the new silver ballers 
The Silverballers or like mk2 remote explosive make that highly remote explosive with twice the blast radius. IO get creative Bruh
4. Can hitman smoke because I wish sometimes it would allow agent 47 to take a puff from the cigs I find in maps cool points 
5. Escalations for season 2 
6. IMPORTANT: Ghost mode please make more ghost mode spawns I have played ghost mode 5-10 times I have all the spawns memorized it feels like I am just doing the same thing over and over again. 
7. Ghost mode for every map please I think it would be interesting putting a target near the cartel submarine wink wink 
8. New animations please for melee weapons they are the animations from 2016 not saying remove them just saying add more variety to each attack 

Conclusion: the game is fun but, would get boring with the same animations and without more ghost mode variety with each target so that would make each target more unique and without ghost mode on other maps Miami would get boring. 
I enjoy hitman 2 I give it a
8/10 +1 for ghost mode on every map and more ghost mode targets with different looks and in a variety of places like a lot more places like just about anywhere.
And +1 for a variety of dialog said from NPCs and a variety of melee animations


Currently +2 for graphics 
+4 for variety of kills and gameplay
+1 for Easter eggs/sound effects
+.5 for the large maps
+.5 for the new weapons 
8/10 needs some animation improvements and dialog variety along with ghost mode needs more target spawn locations with different looks and different personal bodyguards with different guns and ghost mode should be added to every single map *in beta* *testing the idea*",1543228568,1543228568,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198155069979,56,25,7430,0,2348,1600062179

You can also buy a dlc to get the missions from the 2016 which I might end up getting at some point.

Pros:
Levels  are so big and there are so many  ways you can achieve your objectives. Thus each mission offers a huge amount of replayability.

There are optional story missions, these are cool scripted interactions that you can follow to achieve your objectives. I like to stumble upon them first, but you can track them from the pause menu.

Cons
If you're one to play a game for the stroy, this game is not for you. Some are saying that this time the story is decent. I never paid attention to it since I haven't played the previous.

I was worried the developers would change absolutely everything and ruin it but they've really not changed it much at all. I've been a big fan of the HITMAN franchise since the first game so buying this one at full price was not a hard sell for me. I loved it. To conclude, this is a great puzzle game that looks a bit like an action game and if you enjoy committing virtual crimes and getting away with it, you'll enjoy this game.

Now, the bad stuff:

The always-online requirement is a bit stupid considering this is a single-player game. If you're travelling with a laptop for example this would be really annoying. None of the achievements work and you can't see much of post mission stats. I understand why of course - it's a form of DRM and having your game pirated must suck but they've never relaxed this requirement - Denuvo DRM was removed from Hitman 2016 some time after launch but the always-online part is there. It's very frustrating to get signed out of a SINGLE PLAYER game because someone unplugged your router by accident.

Finally, the story is just forgettable.

38,45798681,english,"Hitman No Subtitle™ 2 is the logical successor to 2016’s reboot. It builds upon what worked for the last game (immersive systems, situational humour, Sapienza-style level architectures) and reforms what did not work two years ago (levels too grey and aggressive like Colorado or levels too schematic like Bangkok and Paris). The gameplay additions are limited but well-chosen: suitcase, vegetational concealments, tripwires. It’s what a second season would have been and that’s all I ever asked for.

The five new sandboxes feel more rounded than 2016’s line-up, probably due to the general supervision of Torbjørn Christensen, of Sapienza and Hokkaido fame. The levels are larger and more integrated – granted you sometimes wish for a bicycle or motorbike, as the walking distances can feel a bit tedious. The verticality of Mumbai and Sgail is one solution to this problem and it’s what makes them the best levels of the game.

Then there is ghost mode, which holds so much potential. The chaos and tension created by having to compete in assassinations under a time constraint is unique and makes for a lot of fun. I hope the developers will soon unlock this mode for all levels and expand on the system, as this mode could become a selling point on its own right.

They took everything we loved from the original game and improved the mechanics, levels, and gameplay while making some welcomed additions that expanded our option nicely.

Like HITMAN, this is a unique title. It occupies a gaming niche that no other title does, asking you to complete social puzzles, stealth, shooting, and timing. No crude and thoughtless solutions will give satisfaction (or high scores) in this title, instead careful observation, planning, and expert timing will reap the rewards of a perfect run. 

Several years ago a game like no other arrived on the scene- Hitman: Blood Money. It was a genre unto itself, a social stealth game with intricate NPC routines and rich, story filled worlds in which you could infiltrate and influence. Will you help the star crossed lovers meet? Undermine a corrupt business? Each level offered you so many possibilities, but the richest mine of choice was in how you killed your target. Do you daisy-chain your way to the inner sanctum, masquerading as a delivery boy, then security guard, then kitchen chef, then waiter, the final domino an artfully poisoned appertif? Will you arrange a set of unfortunate accidents, a misplaced wrench, an opened valve, a silenced alarm that kills your target in an unfortunate industrial mishap? Or perhaps you will go in guns blazing?

This is the source of the modern day HITMAN franchise, the place where the series hit the stride and settled into the trajectory that has made it famous and well loved. HITMAN 2 is a continuation of this legacy, and is obviously a labor of love and care.

[list]
[*]New locations are huge and multifarious as usual and allow passing your target to the other side with multiple ways.
[*]There are additional tasks during missions in the second season (to find and gather different evidences, for example).
[*]Owners of the first season have received its content automatically. That allows to walkthrough good old missions in a new fashion with couple of new mechanics (only downside is that you have to discover all compartments and items there again).
[*]There are three levels of difficulty of the game now. For example, there are no CCTV on easy difficulty. Conversely, missions have plenty of it on expert difficulty, as well as more enemies, who react on sounds of your run and see you much better now.
[*]There is a section with classic challenges in the game that depends completely of difficulty. Therefore, you have to work hard to discover new unique items for Agent 47.

I'd also like to see certain in game UI elements changed or tweaked. Having a weapon wheel on PC is extremely lackluster, i don't like having to have the game paused in order to switch between weapons mid-combat. Why not just have an action bar that we can drag items and weapons on to so we can simply hit a key to equip it? Similar to Absolution.

The number of refinements that they added to the game are too many to count, but they all make for an incredible sandbox experience.

I only really have two complaints: first, that there's no way to import your mastery progress from Season 1; second, that all the maps in Season 2 are a bit samey. They all feel like Sapienza/Marrakech from Season 1, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as those were the better sandbox maps. However, they lack the experimental refinement and sense of escalation that Season 1 had. Hokkaido is probably my favourite map in the series because of its unique mechanic, but unfortunately there isn't anything like that in Season 2. That will probably be done in Escalations, but I wish it were part of the main game.

It definitely feels like all the maps were designed more around the Contracts mode for this time around, which isn't a bad thing, I just wish the maps felt more distinct from each other.

5,46839388,english,"[h1]REVIEW AFTER 27.6 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY[/h1]
I played Hitman (2016) and it was great; the game had big open worlds with so much stuff to do in so many ways that it could possibly be a game you could play indefinitely. But due to the persistent always online requirement that severely cut off a lot of people from fully enjoying the game, it fell short from being perfect. I wanted for the sequel to be just as good, if not better, than the first one with the negatives cut out. Like an offline mode that didn't prevent progress, or atleast a separate save file that kept progress separate from online and offline. A contracts mode like sandbox where you could just do a personal contract that you didn't have to upload. And of course the quality of life things like better AI, better animations...etc. Did Hitman 2 deliver? Maybe.

See, Hitman 2 is just like Hitman 1, but bigger. New mechanics, new toys, new maps, but without cutting anything that made the core gameplay good. IOI gave up the episodic release for a full fledge game, but still leaving in the online requirements BS still stapled to the game.

[b]PROS:[/b]
-Everything about Hitman 2016
-New non-lethal options
-New maps, weapons, gear
-New mechanics like the functional mirror, crowd blending in and shrubbery
-Same old AI with modest IQ, not too perseptive to be omnipotent, but not too unaware that you can just do whatever you like.
[b]CONS:[/b]
-Everything Bad from Hitman 2016
-Glitchy animations and controls, could definitely be better.
-Always online for full game and data monitoring. Opting out basically means you get a demo like experience for full price.
[b]MAYBE:[/b]
-Ghost mode is an interesting concept, but I will never really touch that mode. Stealth-Action games like Hitman are solo experiences for me, and introducing a competitive element will surely appeal to some people, but I never really cared for the leaderboards and I'm sure others don't neither.
-Coop Sniper Mode. Again, I prefer solo experiences, and having to coordinate kills with random people online will always end up in a disaster, but if you could find a friend interested in this mini game, then go for it.
-Season Passes. These are promised content that may or may not be good, and may or may not come. As of the moment, buying the standard edition is more than enough, because the silver and gold edition just gives you a brief case, a gun and promise for more content. Paying for the 30$ when said content comes out might be the better choice here.

My review for Hitman 2016 ended on a note that I will not be paying full price for this game if practices continued, but IOI did make a solid game that I enjoyed for over 100 hours and that was more than enough to sway my decision to buy this game. As of now, I am enjoying Hitman 2, and killing Sean Bean was a great way to start the elusive targets, and I am looking forward to the next one. If only IOI would fix animations problems and disappearing NPCs, and other issues related to reloading saves, I would really appreciate it.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
-If you liked the first game and everything about it, then maybe get the standard edition of this game.
-If you feel like you need the suit case, pay for the extra 30$.
-As of now, I could recommend this game and I'm looking forward to what it has for me in the next 75 hours.",1543097034,1543097034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198096427947,68,5,22748,0,2755,1597058912

Now let's get going:
Hitman 2016 = Masterpiece
Hitman 2 = Improves, with minor setbacks.

The game looks fairly the same, but textures and animations are better looking, even if most animations are from the first game. The remastered maps from Hitman 2016 look much better texture wise, but Hitman 2 comes with added bloom which can make everything seem more glowy, this is a preference thing on how you like it.

Crowds look better than ever, not only do they have respective accents now according to their country ( huge improvement over Hitman 2016 where everyone had american accents), they also look like they come from the country you're in, making you immerse even further to the crowds.

I have no issues with the game framerate wise, optimization is great and I always have atleast 60 fps. That said the game does requires a pretty fast PC, dont hate on me because you tried to play with a laptop from 2010

Just like the first game you have the option to choose whether you want the game to show you opportunities, waymarkers and your HUD, if you feel like you want minimal hud and no hand-holding that is possible. Really helps with immersion!
If you feel like you want the game to show you things you can do or give you objectives through ¨Mission stories¨ that is possible too, and there are several of those just like the first game so it gives replayability a bonus.
Beware that the game can be a bit hard without using any help at all though.

Speaking of replayability, there is A LOT to do. You will most likely not go through the whole map on your first playthrough of it, the maps are huge and all have their own little secrets.

The game has gotten several new items, you can now move around and knock out people with a fish that looks like it has downs syndrome. Now that is humiliation! However it seems like most of the new weapon unlockables are reskinned versions of the ones from the first games. Some are the exact same weapon except it has the number ¨2¨ somewhere on it, that felt pretty lazy to me.

I tried out the new multiplayer mode and it was pretty fun but uninspired, it is pretty much like mobile race games, you see a ghost of the other player which you can not interact with in any way.
Mostly for playing around with your friends in a race to take down the targets first and see who is the better 47.
I felt like they could have done a lot more with this, like having a Assassin's creed-esque multiplayer where you try to hunt each other, might be a problem because of how the NPCS work though.

TLDR;
The game is definitely an improvement with more gamemodes and things to do, but a few things could've been better.

Pros:
+Huge maps with A LOT of opportunities and ways to take down your targets
+Hitman 2016 maps are remastered, free for everyone who owned the first game.
+Graphics are amazeballs
+Optimization is good, still need a pretty fast pc.
+Replayability is over the top, so much to do
+Level design is great
+Choose whether to let the game help you kill the target or not
+Choice to have minimal hud for immersion
+Now features multiplayer (?!), which works pretty well, race your friends and kill the targets first. More replayability, a bit of wasted potential.
+Sniper Assassin mode, sit on a hill and take out targets from afar with a sniper rifle, not a selling point but pretty fun to do a few times.
+NPCS HAVE ACCENTS TO THE RESPECTIVE AREA!!

Cons:
-Not a huge deal, but cutscenes are now slightly animated still-pictures, not full CGI cutscenes.
-Added unneccessary bloom to the game, preference based but makes some areas feel watered out or glowy.
-Most guns are the same as Hitman 2016, but with another texture and the number ¨2¨ on it. A bit lazy.",1543079857,1543080191,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197979465506,417,19,2575,0,462,1600068654

Pros
- same Hitman feeling I had with 2016 and Blood Money by extension
- exciting and funny executions
- 47 talks a bit more, especially when interacting with targets
-Opportunities (now called ""story missions"") lead to unique and interesting ways to kill your target, each with a bit of backstory to the characters for exposition
-basically all of season 1 with a graphical upgrade if you own it on top of the actual game

Cons
-Hawke's Bay is a glorified tutorial that's counted as a full mission (yet it's still a nice story-level it's just very short and has next to no replayability value)
-the punch glitch is still a thing
-the story is told in slideshows with voice narration (doesn't need to be a con in your eyes but it's a downgrade from what we had)

34,45881222,english,"Hitman 2 is a refined version of Hitman 2016. So while the formula largely remained the same, it's a really good formula. If you liked Hitman 2016, you will enjoy the better maps Hitman 2 has to offer. Other than maybe Hawke's Bay... Which while I think it is a lot of fun and a really strong first scenario for a tutorial, it is rather small and limited in scope. But that is a small thing compared to what you get for the rest of the game: 5 levels like nothing else you've seen in video games where IOI has masterfully built layers of ai stratification, goofy stories, and some damn good stealth scenarios. 

The environments are the real star of the game. Hitman 2 I think has a little more fun with the maps than in Hitman 2016. The setups are just a little bit more fun in general, opening up the opportunities for hijinks beyond that of Hitman 2016. Listing off highlights (SPOLIERS): you can become a race car mechanic, a celebrity tattoo artist, the lead actor of a bollywood film, a cultish ceremony leader, a mascot who is blackmailing someone, a tailor for a slumlord, a realator, a muffin caterer, an indiana jones wannabe, and of course every goon and henchman under the sun. But you know what, many of my best moments playing this game didn't even come from those costumes and scenarios. There is nothing that will put you on the spot more than trying to throw a screwdriver at your target and missing... twice. Messing up, going loud, and trying to find a non-comprimised disguise are all part of the fun in Hitman 2, and I think the way the levels have expanded has made making mistakes less brutal to runs (but still brutal to your score), and have made perfect runs that much more satisfying. 

It is worth noting that Hitman 2 has added a few gameplay features and UI upgrades. You can now hide in large groups of people and large vegitation, and the tresspassing warning on the mini map now is a bright yellow other than the grey of Hitman 2016. Changes like these seem small, but play out pretty dramatically. Playing Hitman 2, I had better knowledge of where I was on the map and was more willing to play aggressively as there are more opportunities to hide. So while most changes were small, they had a pretty big impact on how I play the game. 

Overall, I love this game like I loved its predecessor.

Hitman 2 provides that expansive rich detailed environments which are the playing field for yourself in the shoes of Agent 47. The levels are intricate, busy and full of interesting points to discover that tend to keep you immersed in the gameplay while you try and ferret out a strategy the best way to kill your target (preferably via accidental kills and keeping that coveted Stealth Assasin rating).

Sometimes npcs on different elevations levels run over half the map when you flip a coin and stuff. To be honest i dont get that bugs often enough to frustrate me instantly but when you play a 3 target missions on master with silent assassin suit only and it happens on the way to your last target its annoying. The game itself is pretty cool and the mapdesign feels more komplex than in hitman 1. I really appreciate the feature to play all the hitman missions of 1 and 2 in one game when you own the previous one. Most annoying feature for me is the allways on to really play the game, because doing the standard mission without any challenges gives you about 5 hours playtime. Would really appreciate if they would turn it on in offline mode aswell, maybe with some sort of trigger that youre then not able to get on the leaderboards anymore because this feature kills the possibility to play on the go.",1543048813,1543048813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197972625004,472,2,4340,0,4313,1547634398

[list]
[*] The new locations are great. [spoiler] With the exception of new zealand, which is barely a level, but is still better than Colorado[/spoiler]
[*] SUITCASE!
[*] Story picks off where HITMAN 2016 left off.  Pretty enjoyable this time around.
[*] Looks as great as ever.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[list]
[*] DRM is still here.  I don't think it's going away anytime soon.
[*] ToS seems to be a little sketchy regarding user info, but this seems to be commonplace nowadays.  :(
[/list]

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]
[list]
[*] Elusive targets are back... and are still illusive...  This is an opinion thing, but I'd much rather have these be replayable and accessible to anyone playing the game.
[*] Some people are having issues with bloom? (I'm not experiencing this at all)
[*] Some of the levels carried over from 2016 seem to have some serious bugs, hopefully these are addressed soon.
[*] You'll want a pretty beefy machine to run this on higher settings.
[/list]

It's a true sequel to HITMAN 2016, and I'm looking forward to whatever comes next from IO.


I get ~60fps (although it sometimes dips below 50) @2560x1440 on all the settings cranked to max with the following system:

One of the key aspects of Hitman 2 is its replayability - if you really wanted, you could probably finish all of the levels in two hours or less. You can (and are encouraged to) play levels dozens of times over, learning new routes and ways to assassinate your targets. One of the biggest criticisms I've seen against Hitman 2 is its small number of levels, but this is like complaining that Assassin's Creed only has one ""level."" These complaints are technically truthful, but they're not focusing on the game as a whole. Each level is clearly designed to be beautiful, full of details, and played dozens of times. The game is absolutely fantastic - it is my favorite game of 2018 as of yet.

And in regards to the game's privacy policy, it is absolutely nothing to worry about. The complaints about the privacy policy are referring to a COMPLETELY OPTIONAL sign-up; even then, the information they're requesting is nothing more than a normal website would gather.

Hitman Blood Money was hands down by far the best Hitman out there till this beast came along.
Didnt really like Hitman (2016) 
But this, this is much better then that.
Enjoyed all of the missions but especially the Another Life

I rushed through the missions for the sake of the plot in 9 hours. but now im going for silent assassin (Suit Only) runs for every mission as well as going for every challenge possible


The story could be improved upon,
The still cutscenes are weird but i guess they didnt focus on this part to use their money on this bit so (+1)
Gameplay 9.5/10
Enemy AI = 8.5/10
Map Design = 9/10
Replay ablity = 9.5/10
Story 7/10  (But again we dont really play Hitman for its story do we)

Crashed once on Another Life mission [basically once in 16 hours]

Overall game 9/10

They will always have my full support for creating a kind of sand-box stealth game that are very rare these days. Let alone Hitman games which are completely unique unto themselves.

It is probably important to think of this as Hitman 2016 Season 2, as it was probably likely intentioned as before the shake up with the publisher. Despite that there are lots of important improvements and added mechanics that change how the game is played. Foliage, crowd blending, mirrors, etc add up.

Additionally, having Season 1 content transfer into the new game makes it clear this is what IOI hopes to keep as the Hitman frontpage going forward. I rarely buy Season Passes in advance but I have faith in IOI based on how they managed Hitman 2016. I look foward to seeing how the game continues to expand.

The levels in this game are larger than ever and the vast amount of assassination opprotunities are varied. I have already got all the challenges on the first stage and now working on Miami. I look foward to going through each stage meticulously.

I'm also personally disappointed that they signed on with WB, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the game. It's pretty similar to it's predecessor, in both good and bad ways. The worst thing I can think of right now is a lack of content, which was my problem with the 2016 game. Hitman has always been about replaying the same levels to see how many ways you can kill, but I don't think they've struck a balance quite yet between amount of varying levels and the size of the maps. Basically I think if they reduced the map sizes by a bit and added one or two more missions it would be perfect, as sometimes the levels feel too big and sprawling and can feel both tedious and confusing to navigate. Now, it's not too bad a problem, I just wanted to get what I dislike out of the way, on to the good. While it can be a bit hand-holdy, I really enjoy the mission stories mechanic more so than the opertunies system of the last game simply because it tells you if you've missed an opertunity, whether it's due to not being fast enough, killing the target of the story, etc. It's a really nice feature just by itself, it would, however; be nice to have them explicitly state who the target of the story is. Most of the time you can quickly figure it out by reading the description, but for the few cryptic ones it would be cool to see that. Anyways there's my ""review"" I guess, if you can even call it that, I just kinda threw my thoughts down chaoticly and don't plan on editing :P

82,46520363,english,"Season 1 & 2 is Hitman at its finest. Hitman is a ""sandbox"" stealth series developed by IO Interactive, previously published by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix. Due to cutbacks and layoffs, things took a turn for the future of the Hitman series, but in this rare case, it's all for the better. Square Enix allowed IO Interactive to keep the Hitman IP. Most other companies would have retained the rights to the franchise and later sourced another developer to
reboot it. Instead, IO Interactive now acts as an independent studio with the full departure of Square Enix.

Season 2 delivers six additional sandboxes to play in, bringing the total amount to levels to 12 if you include Season 1. I have always been a big fan of the series, and started playing Hitman with the original on PC, and then played the rest of the series up util now. Each game is great and carries its own strengths and weaknesses, with Absolution being the most unorthodox on the list do to its more linear approach.

This new take on the series is what I would call a ""true fans dream come true"". Everything is greatly expanded upon and levels now feature the scope and detail the series has always deserved. Season 1 had a bit of a slow start being episodic, and it took a while to make a disk version. The game was around, but it was more like a ghost, few even knew about it. As good as Season 1 was, it never felt 100% complete because it only had 6 mission. Even with the missions being large in size, it still felt like half a game, and that is because it was.

Season 2 is the second half we needed, but its greatness doesn't end there. Season 1 lacked only a few things that held it back from being perfect, and Season 2 not only addresses such impediments, it also reprograms the original Season 1 missions with much needed features. Season 2 brings back the six locations from the previous Season, as part of the Hitman Legacy Pack, but it is only a free download for owners of Season 1. The new levels in Season 2, do not take part in the Season 1 levels, they are all new locations.

The new missions from Season 1 have been remastered and enhanced to support new gameplay features found in Season 2, including a new progression system, higher-fidelity crowds, picture-in-picture mode, and new gameplay items such as your briefcase, dart gun and flash grenades. There are new difficulty modes and the A.I has been reworked from the ground up. The A.I will no longer stand around and let you go gun happy, they will now move around tactically, flank and run into cover, so it is now a blast to play it both ways, stealth and as a shooter.

A.I can now see you in a mirror and respond accordingly. Cameras also now serve a purpose. Guards will now run to investigate, like they should with guns ready. No longer do they hide in the back eating Doritos, or whatever it was they have been doing for the past 15 or so years. It is now safe to say that all of the old guards have officially been ""let go"" do to a lack in job performance, and have now been replaced with guards who are more actively motivated by some kind of new payroll system.

Final Verdict:

Season 2 delivers more needed content, as well as polishing up its Season 1 content. The only feature I would like to see return is the ""Human Shield"", which for whatever reason is not an option, but does not hinder the great experience. If you have been holding out on buying Season 1 then now is the time. This will now give you 12 large sandbox stages to play around in, but just keep in mind, the Season 1 stages are not included on this disk, they are downloaded only as part of a DLC Legacy Pack, and only free to owners of Season 1.",1542953433,1542953433,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198046480988,53,2,7454,0,1526,1592482617

If you enjoyed the first season then you'll love this, if you enjoyed blood money, contracts or (lol) Hitman 2:silent assassin then you are guaranteed to enjoy this though it's not without some flaws. In the base game, there are 6 levels but the first level you play acts as a tutorial of sorts so in actuallity it's 5 levels and a training mission but wait, each of those levels, even the first to an extent, have great replayability factor. my favorite has to be the one called ""another life"" which is a new life 2.0. 

If you played season 1 then you'll be familair with mastery levels. To the uninitiated, Master levels are unlocked by doing different assassination challenges, feats, etc. unlocking a level would give you an item, starting point, or smuggling point. I have to point out a negative here, while there are some new unlocks, there's a bunch which is rehashed from the first season and the only difference between them is that they have a ""2"" logo on them. kinda cheap if you ask me but there are some cool new toys like the tazer mine, goes great with electricity kills, the briefcase returns of course, and there are mine unlocks which are unnoticable by the npcs.


Besides contracts mode, which is where I placed most of my hours in season 1 and will do so again in 2, there's ghost mode which is a multiplayer mode where you race against another player to kill 5 targets. It's fun but we need more maps to play in, Miami is the only map that has ghost mode availible  for now.


On perfromance,  as of this date, it's better but there are reports of memory leaks which yours truely also suffers from in this game. playing with 8 gigs is doable but don't expect to place all of your settings on high.

The biggest downside is the cutscenes. Instead of the gorgeous videos from the first, we get a series of still images with dialogue dubbed over. But they do feel longer as a trade off, so I'm not complaining. 

The levels we do get though... Amazing. The maps are huge and expansive, but don't feel like they are made up of as much wasted space as we saw in Sapienza. And I have to say Whittleton Creek is probably my favorite level of either game.

Just like its predecessor Hitman 2 immerses you into a world of asassination where you can disguise yourself as anyone, blend in with anything and kill using your favorite tools and weapons. I like this game. It feels good, it looks good, and it gives you so many options to approach your targets that you'll be spending countless hours completing challenges and unlocking new outfits and items for yourself to better your arsenal for more technical goal completions. They brought back Elusive Targets (and the first one includes Sean Bean ofc, why does he always have to die?), a new Ghost mode where you can study or follow someone else's movements ingame, beautiful, well-thought out worlds that are sometimes more fun to explore instead of killing inside of. And if you want more replayibility, there's the Contracts mode where players can assassinate anyone (and i mean anyone) in a mission using whatever diguise and tool and other players have to try and replicate that feat.

The story is actually deeper than I thought it'd be. Although, it's only by small cutscenes that flesh out general information about our hero and his allies.

If you're into the stealth genre and don't mind getting your hands dirty, get this. If you like being patient and waiting for that perfect opportunity to assassinate a target, get this. If you enjoy being a mastermind and setting up a series of events that coalesce into a wonderful (albeit, violent) scene, get this.

Or you could always just go on a killing spree and see how many NPCs you can murder before you die yourself. However, it is possible to kill everyone in a level... happy hunting :)

Here my review on Hitman 2, 
If you played hitman 1 then you should know what to expect as nothing as really changed-
Where Hitman takes one step forward it takes two steps back- you can tell this has been a rushed game as it feels unfinished, the cutscene are like a power point but worst, Mk2 weopens have a pink 2 sticker on the side and the story conflicets with the old games [spoiler]Number 6's death is also described in a flashback in Hitman: Enemy Within. It's mentioned there that 47 killed him with an improvised garrote being his first kill.[/spoiler] but If you count this as a full reboot then its okay.

The step forward: the levels feel more alive and bigger then the first game, If you play the game with out the challages n object marks the game feels more natural n fun. little thing like people notice boold and mirror refections.

the things I didnt like is some time i can throw a object at someone and a guy next room can hear it or it class as a none taget kill. shooting feels worse as i can eirther be shooting a CCTV camera at pointblank range and miss.

27,46475525,english,"Hitman 2 takes its excellent 2016 predecessor and adds even more fun to its open playgrounds of assassinations. Add in the legacy content (or simply own the original 2016 game) and this solid sequel makes for a very fun and content filled package of sandbox goodness. Very recommended!

Each mission in Hitman basically drops you in an open playground with only two or three objectives. The playgrounds themselves however are crowded with everyday people, just living out their lives, and the way you can interact with it's environment is really fun. You can bring and find a variety of ""tools"" and use the terrain to your advantage, but you need to know how or when to use it. You can disguise as different people to blend in better (and pretend your doing some work to stay unnoticed) but you still gotta pay attention to sharpminded people who see through your chameleon abilities. The game has a lot of cool mechanics and Hitman 2 adds a few more mechanics to this mix, like hiding in tall grass or blending in with crowds of people. Its great fun and every mission is meant to be replayed several times. You could go guns blazing, but planning out and being stealthy about it is much more fun and rewarding. The best way to enjoy the missions is to try a couple of approaches, and then switch to a new locale to keep things fresh. Just make sure that you revisit older missions later, keep em in rotation so to speak. 

What i also like (especially with its open-ended nature) is how the game handles its UI. Some games treat you like you're some toddler, while others games don't feel like explaining anything at all. Now this game offers basic guidance through hints and markers, and these are enabled by default. However, at any time in the game, you can tell the game that Agent 47 is a big boy now (or big girl?) and ask the game to let go of the handholding by disabling a variety of these guidance options. You can also re-enable it at any time (unless you're playing on the highest difficulty) and I think more games should offer this kind  of variety in options!

*New about those missions... Apart from the New Zeeland Villa introduction (awesome!) I have only really checked out the new mechanics in older missions from the previous game. So I cant say much about the new missions at the moment, but they look really fun (A RACETRACK!? IN MIAMI OF ALL PLACES?!?!) and abit more colorful then the ""season 1"" content. This will prolly be updated once I got fimiliar with the new missions.

The game is not perfect of course, and some mechanics from the previous game are still a little wonky. Dragging a body can, once again, be a little iffy. If the body collides with anything (and i really DO mean ANYTHING) Agent 47 will stop dragging it around. Trying to subdue someone on or near a set of stairs can still trigger a different, not so subtle animation, and alerts everyone around you. They're not such a big deal, but it can be cumbersome and frustrating every once in a while. The ""always online"" requirement is also a mixed bag. This way the game can show you news updates, track everyones scores for leaderboards and offer timelimited ""Elusive targets"" and other people's custom contracts. Now i actually kinda like the idea of what COULD have been done with it,  but the way it works now doesnt really add all that much to a game that's mostly singleplayer at it's core, so im not sure why this is absolutely neccessary. (If its there for security reasons, its absolutely not the way to do it)

38,45926167,english,"HITMAN has been my favourite game to play, though that position has now been taken over by HITMAN 2 which is basically more HITMAN (which is not a bad thing).

This game coming out is a miracle; Squre Enix abandoned Hitman, IOI had to fire a bunch of staff and the promised HITMAN Season 2 seemed like a dead game, as all we got as minor updates to HITMAN such as a reskinned hammer and Patient Zero which were 4 lightly reskinned (but still good) maps. 

Everything seemed doomed until HITMAN 2 was announced, and the eventual reveal more than lived up to the hype. Here we get 5 more great missions (and New Zealand) and each one feels like a high point for the entire series. Best of all, the previous game is playable from within HITMAN 2's launcher, with new updates such as working mirrors, hiding in grass and new items. For those of you who didn't pick up the last game, it is available at a reasonable price as DLC, and it doubles the game's content, more so if you count bonus missions and Patient Zero. 

Many problems fans had with the earlier installment have been fixed such as viewcones on NPCs, the lack of a briefcase, the lack of difficulty options on all missions, the lack of picture in picture, targets spotting you resulting in your silent assassin being ruined, the lack of security cameras that actually do their job, and the lack of NPC accents fitting their region. It's kind of amazing to see just how much IOI listened to their fans. 

This game does have some weaker elements such as doubling up on items such as a Lockpick and Lockpick Mk 2, or Silverballer and Silverballer Mk 2, the fact that we only get 5 main missions at launch (New Zealand doesn't really count),  elusive targets not being replayable despite the amount of work put into them, elusive target rewards not carrying over from the first game (GIVE ME BACK MY TACTICAL SUIT AND HAT) and so on, but these don't really detract from the fun of the core game here. 

HITMAN was already an amazing game offering up hundreds or even thousands of hours of content to the right people (my 900+ hours in it attest to that), and this is just more of that. We get the new content, the old content and new modes like ghost mode. I don't think I'll stop playing this until the eventual HITMAN 2. This is a fantastic package and not only the new best Hitman entry, but my favourite game to play.

Not to mention they are going to be adding tons more content over the life span of the game (including two entirely new maps). The fact that it had 6 missions may be a turn off for the hitman layman but  the fact is that you could spend 100 hours easily on each level. The contracts mode keeps this fresh, and the escalation and elusive targets are the cherry on top. All of this doesn't even mention the two multiplayer modes which I find myself enjoying time and time again.

47,46444071,english,"TL;DR - If you like Hitman games - buy this immediately. If you're new to the franchise, buy it, eventually...

Honestly, this game is pretty flawless except for some small issues. Definitely the best modern Hitman out there, if not the best one in the whole series (sorry, Blood Money). And this time you actually get all the content without waiting for months for a new location to release.

All of the locations (except for the tutorial one) are absolutely huge, they vary in setting, verticality and objective types. On one map you can play on an empty beach with a villa on its coast. While playing on the second map, you could be surrounded by huge crowds and a race track around the map with a target actually racing. The third map could be a typical American suburban setting. You could enter houses of families preparing for picnic.

It's also pretty clear the devs tried to please Blood Money fans by adding Whittleton Creek, which reminds of A New Life. And the last location is absolutely gorgeous - the mysterious Isle of Sgàil which reminds of A Dance With the Devil. The soundtrack on this map is a nice touch. Both Miami and Mumbai are one of the most crowdiest locations in a Hitman game ever, plus they offer new types of objectives. My least favorite would be Santa Fortuna, which is still better than the weaker maps of 2016's HITMAN like Marrakesh and Colorado. And while the tutorial map is quite small, it's a very aesthetically beautiful map.

There are lots of new neat features that are actually useful or fun - briefcase you can conceal big weapons in, picture-in-picture, security camera grids, ability to hide in crowds / bushes, competitive multiplayer 'Ghost mode', multiplayer or singleplayer 'Sniper Assassin' gamemode and more.

Some of the cons - there are no longer high-quality CGI cutscenes between missions like in 2016's HITMAN. I was actually a bit sad not being able to see them. Cutscenes in the previous game were great, I still remember getting goosebumps from seeing the ""Call me Agent 47"" CGI for the first time. But it's understandable they ran out of funds to produce CGI and since this isn't a story-based game, it's not a big deal. Another thing some people might have an issue with - this game is DENUVO protected. You have been warned. Other than that, if you ignore some minor bugs, loading screen freezes and crashes that will eventually be fixed, I would say it's a pretty stable build.

If you're a fan of the franchise, then you will most definitely like this game, especially if you like the 2016 HITMAN reboot. This is basically the same game, but perfected and with better locations.

There are tons of opportunities to kill targets in various different ways to achieve Silent Assassin and none of the missions prevents you from going crazy and slaughtering all body guards and witnesses.

There is now a new level up system in that you get a total level for all your accomplishments through all levels and Legacy levels and a individual Mastery level as there was before that unlocks certain items for play in all levels as well as starting points and places you can have an item smuggled in for use.  I have yet to really see a point to the overall level but I am only level 64 at this time and I haven't done the Legacy missions again yet but have gotten a ways in the main story and gotten my Mastery up by redoing them a few times.

Challenges are back again where they say DO X and I feel like they have added many more than before and they are actually fun to do and some of them you will do just by playing the game through normally which is also neat.  There are a few that will really be a challenge but that is the point of them.  They still give you the exp to get mastery and this also goes towards your overall level.",1542912008,1542912008,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198090710667,911,27,7346,0,3463,1595392459

32,45901910,english,"Alright so off the bat I'm going to clarify I'm a HITMAN superfan I played all Hitman games from codename 47 to this one and never missed one, I bought Hitman Blood Money and up on release day and pre ordered Absloution and 2016 (I didn't buy them on PC they were all on my Xbox and Xbox 360 this is the first Hitman that I pre order on PC).

Righto, So I love this game it takes all the best parts from all Hitman games unlike 2016 and Absloution this game has the right old Hitman feel to it.

The gameplay is like every other Hitman game get in kill the targets however you like in a huge sandbox and rewards you with whatever way you choose to kill the targets (Unlike 2016 where it only awarded stealth players which is fine since I'm one but not so fine for other players).

The maps are great although I haven't fully explored them as I'm enjoying the Hitman 2016 levels with the new mechanics a lot, But not to worry I will return to them once I finish doing everything once again in the Legacy.

Also one thing thats annoying me is the white map I really wish we could change it to the gray 2016 map.

Alright it's time I preach to IOI about getting some of the memorable missions from the past games in this game as a flashback or as a DLC (Some of those would be The Hayamoto missions or Beldingford Mannor or Murder at the Bazaar or The Lee Hong Assassination and many many more).

I remember back in the day I used to comeback home from School to play Hitman 2 or contracts or Blood Money and spend the whole day trying to get Silent assassin in another way, Ah good old days.

Finally I want to thank IOI for a delivering a great game and I'll be waiting for new locations and new missions.

While this is certainly sketchy, it does not affect my thoughts on the game, nor my nomination of this game for Game of the Year.[/b]

HITMAN™ 2 is the sequel to 2016's phenomenal Hitman reboot. It also the second game in this series to be called Hitman 2. I understand the trend towards soft reboots, but that doesn't make me any less unhappy with this naming convention. From here on, I will be referring to HITMAN™ as ""Hitman 2016"", HITMAN™ 2 as ""Hitman 2"", and Hitman 2: Silent Assassin as simply ""Silent Assassin"". Got it? Good.

I really, really liked Hitman 2016- as in, 120 hours of game-time liked it. The massive, intricately detailed levels, the interplay of systems, and the modifcations to the Hitman formula all profoundly resonated with me, and led to one of the best experiences I've had in years. When Hitman 2 was first announced, it immediately rocketed to the top of my wishlist, and my eyes were kept firmly on it. I am absolutely relieved to say that Hitman 2 is not only a great sequel, but it is the best game of 2018, and is also the best video game I've played since Dark Souls, all the back in 2011. Never before has a game felt so alive, so bursting with detail, and so intricately designed. What appears, on the surface, to be more of the same from Hitman 2016, very quickly shows its hand as a bigger, better, wildly changed game, that feels just similar enough to fit like a glove.

[h1]Audio-Visuals[/h1]
For anyone familiar with Hitman 2016, Hitman 2 will look mostly the same, but with a general graphical facelift. Levels are larger, have more colour, more NPCs, better lighting, and in general have more going on. There's also small details, like hair being slightly see-through under the right light, that were either not present, or were far less prevalent in the previous game. The small changes they made to the Glacier Engine make everything look and feel nicer than almost every other AAA game to come out this year. While most games in 2018 seem to rely solely on shades of brown and grey, Hitman 2 boldly uses flamboyant blues, greens, and pinks, alongside warm, comforting oranges and yellows. The levels in Hitman 2 [i]look[/i] real, and that's the most important part of immersing you in them. From the lush, green rainforests of rural Colombia, to the picket-fenced suburbia of Whittleton Creek, to the hustle and bustle of the Mumbai slums, areas not only look good, but look good enough to navigate by sight alone. No room looks identical, no street indistinguishable. Every area builds a wonderful mental map, and I absolutely adore it.

The visuals aren't the only things that have been touched up, however, as the soundscape has also been wildly improved. In the most recent 2.11 update, the option for ""Simulation Quality"" allows you increase the fidelity and the richness of the soundscape to the nth degree, and it's really something to behold. Gunshots not longer just ring out in isolation, they echo and refract off the surrounding walls, impacts have a nice, crunchy resonance to them, and you really get a feel for just how far people are, just by conversation alone. Running this through a pair of Sennheiser HD650s, everything sounded absolutely beautiful. Crowd dialogue is far more intricate, and it's obvious that they've added significant amounts of random NPC chatter, as conversations regularly fade in-and-out of focus as you move through the crowds.

The music is probably the weakest part of the package here, but that is not to say it is bad, necessarily. Jesper Kyd has been and will forever be the sound of Hitman, in my opinion, anyways. While the soundtrack here does a good job at establishing a James Bond-y vibe, it does little more than that. I don't think I would ever listen to any of these tracks in isolation, something I have done extensively for Kyd's prior soundtracks. I also think the end-of-mission theme song has started to get particularly grating, and wish I could disable it. The fact that the only way to turn it off is to disable music entirely is stupid. It's mixed poorly, and just makes me run even faster for an exit.

I also wanna end this section with a few sentences on the Voice Acting. Hitman 2016 was infamous for its terrible voice acting, and I'm relieved to say that it's fixed here. There are far more Actors, and they all do their things very well. People finally talk like they're from a place, now!

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
On the surface, Hitman 2 appears to be very, very similar to Hitman 2016: sandbox stealth assassination in massive, wide open levels, with slightly more scripted kills called ""Mission Stories"" (formerly Opportunities) being littered throughout. The HUD doesn't do many favours to this perception either, because it looks very similar. Hitman 2, however, adds a lot of small changes that add up to a game that feels, overall, very different. The foremost new mechanic is the Camoflage ability- allowing you to blend in with crowds and use tall grass to hide your position, a la Assassin's Creed. This turns the massive, otherwise-useless crowds of the first game into a vital resource, moving through groups of people in an attempt to avoid the more observant guards.

Alongside this, the extra tiny details they've added are absolutely [i]insane[/i]. When I first learned that you could barter with street vendors in Mumbai, I actually, vocally said, ""Wow, they actually did it."" That's just one of the many minute details that IOI added to this game, that absolutely amaze me. Here's just a few examples of tiny things that 99% of players won't notice, but are in there anyways.
[list]
    [*] In Whittleton Creek, you can serve snacks to anyone who comes near you, targets included.
    [*] In Mumbai, you can [i]barter with street vendors[/i] for extensive periods of time.
    [*] In Colombia, you can just give your target a tattoo, without ever having to kill him.
    [*] In Miami, if you dress up as a driver, members of the Press actively approach you for interviews.
    [*] On Isle of Sgail, you can pass a test to become a full member of the Ark Society.
[/list]
These are only a few examples of the sheer detail put into every map, and a lot of it has a gameplay purpose! As you do these tiny things, not only are you concealing yourself with the crowd, but you're also getting a look at your targets, giving you multiple angles to analyze and familiarize yourself with their routines. This much intricacy absolutely dwarfs what was in the first game, in every way, and it completely changes the way you explore the levels. You can spend literally hours in these areas, now, just doing small thing. It's incredibly immersive, and really makes you [i]feel[/i] like 47.

Not all is perfect in this department, however. Hitman 2 suffers from very few bugs, but what bugs there are, are very annoying. Multiple instances of infinite loading screens, an instance where a fish flew through walls, and a few points where 47 would begin walking on air, as if there were a staircase there.

[h1]Story[/h1]
To cut a long story short (hah), it's very simple, but decent. Think James Bond, but with multiple different assassin agencies, instead of Govt. Agencies. Because of the character restrictions of Steam's review format, and me wanting you to experience this for youself, I cannot elaborate further.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Hitman 2 is easily the best game I've played in years, I cannot recommend it enough. I had to cut out several paragraphs of pure gushing, simply because I couldn't fit it all in. Without a shadow of a doubt, Hitman 2 is the best game of 2018, and one of the best ever made. It's essential playing, and a worthy successor to Silent Assassin. Play it now.",1542891928,1542892197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198078537742,704,3,2097,0,2017,1545773914

Only downside I can see is a total downgrade of story cutscenes, that were fully animated CGI in previous game. Wish they were made on in-game engine at least. But I like where the story goes, connecting all the dots with classic installments, instead of silly retcons and reboots. Looking forward to playing DLC content as well.

The NPCs are a lot less buggier and makes the gameplay more enjoyable and less frustuating, The fact that you can play maps from the previous game with new mechanics, features and improvements makes the game that much better. 

Although, there are a few things that are off. Some noise in the map just dont match the environemnt ie shhoting a gun in a corridor in Sapienza sounds like shooting a gun in a cave, the briefcase acts weird as you may have seen on reddit and hdr sometimes is a little too much. You do notice these things but while you play the game I believe these issues will be addressed as it happened in the past.

It was dissapointing to see a pre-oder of 2 expansion packs already but I guess with IOs new publisher WB we will have to see where this will go. My only hope is that the upcoming expansion packs will not dissapoint.

Ghost Mode is SO much fun because it's almost endless until you either be the first to reach a score of 5 or just rage quit because you keep screwing up epically or lowered your score with too much collateral damage when trying to kill a target.

Sniper Assassin is good too as it tests your aiming and you can have fun with all the modifiers.

Single Player main story ties up a LOT of loose ends from Season 1 and develops 47's character even further as you play towards the ending. Nods to earlier games was a nice touch too. I can't recommend this game enough...

HITMAN 2 (2018) is the sequel to HITMAN (2016). HITMAN 2 no longer follows the episodic format that the first HITMAN had which will please many fans. However, unlike most of them, I didn't mind the episodic format.

Pros:
- Gameplay has been vastly improved from the first HITMAN. More gameplay mechanics have been added and existing mechanics have been improved upon. IO Interactive did a great job on the gameplay for HITMAN 2.

- Graphics have been slightly improved. The game looks smoother, though if you really want to see the difference in graphics you would have to look closer. Graphics will still look the same if you don't do so.

- The voice acting in HITMAN 2 is still superb. They got all of the voice actors from the previous HITMAN back to voice the characters, which is a relieve.

- The locations are all unique and huge. The size of the maps have been signifcantly increased compared to it's predecessor. There are many more things to do and the maps all look equally beautiful.

- The briefings by Diana Burnwood are still amazing, and seem to have been improved. The animations look better than the previous HITMAN and Jane Perry's performance is still great. 

- If you own the previous HITMAN, the missions from the first game will show up in HITMAN 2 as well, which is a nice touch. 

Mixed:
- The soundtrack in HITMAN 2 isn't terrible, but when compared to the first one, it falls short. Although this is the case, the blame cannot be placed on the composer. HITMAN (2016)'s story was more spy-like compared to HITMAN 2's story. HITMAN 2's story is more about Diana and 47's origins, therefore the soundtrack in HITMAN 2 is much slower, quiet, melancholic and depressing compared to the explosive and bombastic soundtrack of HITMAN (2016). 

Cons:
- The story has been downgraded a little. The first HITMAN's story was intriguing and got me curious and interested to find out more. However, HITMAN 2's story got interesting around the last few locations, but dies down after the ending. The ending does not intrigue me and I genuinely don't feel excited for the sequel's story (if there's going to be one).

- The cutscenes are one of the obvious elements of the game which suffered from the Square Enix separation. Cutscenes in HITMAN 2 are now just moving images with voice acting over them. Although it is a nice touch, I would have preferred animated cutscenes just like in the first HITMAN. I'm utterly disappointed by this.

- 4 days early access bullshit. I understand that they need to earn money, but paying double the standard price just to get 4 days early access? That is something that I cannot accept. Locking out content for people is not the way to go. 

- Your progress and awards from Season 1 do not carry over to Season 2, which is a MASSIVE disappointment.

In conclusion, this definitely worth the buy. Though, there are some aspects of the game that suffer from the Square Enix separation. I do recommend this, but it feels like a downgrade of the first HITMAN. Not a drastic downgrade, but definitely one. 8.9/10.",1542192646,1542872983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198089619195,95,56,8279,0,2387,1586782114

New mechanics, new missions with just as much in them (and often more) than the old, and the same satisfying gameplay loop as the excellent Hitman 2016 are the hallmarks of Hitman 2. 
There are a few rough edges, though: the lack of budget is clear in the loss of CGI cutscenes, and the first mission (Hawke's Bay) acts as sort of a tutorial despite the original tutorial (ICA Facility) still being included, as far as I can tell. Also, the game doesn't provide much in the way of new gear to unlock - much of the unlocks are literal reskins of old equipment - and has failed to find a good use for certain other pieces of gear, like the sedative poison, which was mostly useless in 2016 and remains such now.

9,46191182,english,"For those who played Hitman 2016, you might think ""more of the same"" is all it takes to describe the game. But that would be only near the truth.

First, what is the game? It's a stealth/action puzzle game where the aim isn't to kill your target, but to kill them in every way possible. Replayability is the operative word here. The game encourages you to explore the maps, to trigger opportunities, to try new weapons, new approaches, and to replay again, and again, and again. And then again.

For veterans of the first game, the gameplay will be very familiar. Instinct is still there for you to see through wall. Disguises work the same way, allowing you access to some areas provided an enforcer doesn't recognise your subterfuge. Hide the bodies, erase video recordings, don't get caught, and you'll get your Silent Assassin rating.

There are a few changes to note of course. The most notable might be the picture-in-picture feature showing important events. It also highlights that cameras will now rat you out in the normal difficulty. Another change is said normal difficulty is now called Professional, not to be confused with the Professional difficulty of the previous game now called Master.

New weapons are in play too. This includes grenades and tripwires, and even non-lethal variants of these explosives. The suitcase makes its comeback, allowing you to carry weapons and place bombs undetected (well, as long as you don't leave your suspicious package unattended in view). It's also a great melee weapon. Beyond that, there is a flurry of new items to weaponise, from cocaine bricks to fishes.

But the biggest new thing is the levels. It sounds obvious but it means something. You aren't threading familiar grounds anymore. For a few hours, you are back in the unknown, in locations you don't know, with few items to start with.

And that's what Hitman 2 is. It isn't just more of the same. It is a journey from discovery to mastery. It's an incredibly rewarding feeling through and through. First following your instinct in search of new ways to kill, trying to piece the puzzle of these new environments together, working up to the perfect set up and executing it. Soon, you'll be hunting for challenges, new ways to kill, self-imposed restrictions until you can truly said you've done it all.

Hitman 2 is more of the same. But it's not a continuation of Hitman 2016, it's a reset, a journey both new and familiar.",1542870509,1542870509,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198028742775,140,7,10790,0,1445,1587914134
10,46185541,english,"HITMAN  2 is the second season of the episodic HITMAN game and to talk about the gameplay, nothing has really changed except the addition of minute additional features to help us out. This installment is indeed very beautiful in terms of the locations and as always, the game never fails to provide us with a huge amount of opportunities to kill your targets. However, I felt that the maps so given, are quite smaller than the previous season maps and doing speed runs aren't too much of a challenge. 
The GHOST MODE is something that was well developed but has its share of flaws that made it nearly unplayble during the first week of its release, kept disconnecting while playing with a friend invited. The game on the whole isn't as flawed as HITMAN 2016 but still does give us some FPS drops but I hope they're trying to fix it. Sniper Assassin Mode is yet another competitive mode where you can take a break from the conventional motion of the game and enjoy sniping the bulls out the targets' eyes.

18,46182435,english,"It's more Hitman, if you liked the last one you'll probably like this one. Attempt to assassinate one or more people in whatever way you choose and maybe collect some intel then escape. You can bring a couple items and weapons into each stage and find more than enough stuff in levels to cover any deficit in your meager starting gear.

Ignoring the first level, which is basically a tutorial, the maps are huge with tons to do and see. There's a lot of world building lore in the form on dialogue, notes, and stuff you'll hear on TV's and radios in the background. There's lots of NPC chatter that gives the info on the area and the characters, some give hints on where to find items or about patrol routes. There's a lot of stealth mechanics besides the basic don't get seen kind; you can disguise as other people and pretend to do their jobs, blend into crowds or hide in tall grass or bushes. Every level has multiple unique ways to take out the target on top of the regular poisoning, strangling, and shooting. 

As for negatives, the targets like to hang out in each area for a long time so you have time to explore and a chance at each style of assassination but this means you spend a lot of time waiting around in some levels. The story isn't the best but I never played these games for the plot. If you don't intend to play the levels multiple times to try to unlock everything or try the alternate types of assassinations the game would probably be pretty short.

They also added a versus mode where you attempt to kill your targets more efficiently than your opponent does. I guess it's okay if that's your kinda thing.

I guess the other things to note about this game are the oddities on the store page and in the reviews. 
The free play game thing is only the training mission from the previous Hitman with the updated engine and a few changes but it also unlocks any levels you own from the previous game and lets you play them in the new engine so it sorta obsoletes the old game if you don't mind unlocking all your unique gear again. This also means if you have the GOTY  edition of the previous game, or own all parts of the GOTY pack separately, you get the GOTY legacy pack for free. It won't appear until you play the game for a bit though, it won't check if the game has never been run.

Yes, it has Denuvo and yes it does seem to impact performance a bit for some people.

Some reviews seem to be freaking out about the fact that is always online, in that your unlocks are stored server side to stop people from cheating, which is annoying if you have a data cap or your internet goes out a lot I guess? 

There's also a lot of misinformation about the privacy policy selling your info or some such nonsense even though it's the same basic stuff you'll see in every policy nowadays, including Steam's. It collects info about how you play for the leader boards, so they have data on how to change things if something is too difficult or easy, or for ideas about what levels are popular so they know what kind to make more of. The targeted ads thing is for the in-game store to try to sell you the same dlcs you'll see on the steam store.",1542868191,1542868191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198004940118,1768,16,1049,0,710,1548668952

62,46125575,english,"Big recommendation for Hitman 2, one of the highlights of the year for me.

Yes this game is ""just more Hitman 2016"". However:
a) Hitman 2016 is great,
b) IOI has learned from Hitman 2016 and made even better levels this time around, and
c) The backward-compatibility of Hitman 2016 levels add a lot of value.

It's a testament to IOI's level design that I still enjoy replaying Hitman 2016's levels so much. While the previous game felt just a bit light on content, Hitman 2 feels like a full, rich game because I can bounce between learning a new level, and exploring a familiar level from last game. If you don't own Hitman 2016, it costs extra for the legacy pack, but man is it worth it!

Crucially, the level design is strong through ALL the new levels. I felt that Hitman 2016 peaked with Paris and Sapienza and that Colorado was a bit of a dud. Hitman 2 levels are consistently good. I also think the variety in the objectives is stronger this time around (in one level you don't know what one target looks like, and you have to figure out who they are, for example). Compared to Hitman 2016, I didn't hit those brick-wall moments where I needed to know ""the trick"" to make things work, and I discovered more options naturally through exploring, rather than needing to look up ""where do I find x"" online.",1542853523,1542853523,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561197973859098,463,24,3651,0,2394,1571988843

Given how the game has only been out for just over a week and Ive already squeezed over 75 hours from it I can definitely say Ive gotten my money's worth already.

In terms of how much you can actually do in this game theres all of the main missions in the game themselves which can all be carried out the way you want and each one comes with a numerous amount of challenges for you to do and a vast number of unlockables. Live content which introduces new challenges and missions such as escalation contracts, elusive targets, bonus missions and more. Two new modes were added in this game too: Sniper assassin which is pretty much what it says on the tin and Ghost Mode which is a new 1v1 duel mode where you try to be a better assassin than your opponant. Even when you start to get bored you can just mess around or go on a murder spree. The game is literally a sandbox for you to play around in.

I really support the devs IOI and all the cool things they have done for this game. They touched up the maps from 2016 with the new mechanics introduced in this one and released it as a legacy pack... which is completely FREE for anyone who owns 2016. They didnt have to do that but they did. A lot of the changes and additions in Hitman 2 are also things that the community asked for, such as the briefcase. After what they went through after being dropped by SE yet still managing to put so much love into the game and franchise as a whole I cant help but respect them for it.

I see a lot of people complaining about the DRM in this game... and I agree, I dont like it that much and wish it would be removed.

[u][h1] Gameplay [/h1][/u]
The gameplay is in many ways completely like H1, but improved in some ways. The game have 7 maps/scenarios where you have some targets to assassinate. These targets can be taken out is so many ways that it will be impossible for 1 player to find them all. These target is parts of the story which resumes from HITMAN 1 (2016). The story gives you a couple of ways to kill your targets, these was named oppotunities in the last game, but it works exactly the same way. The story takes a short time to complete, especially iof you don't care about your score. Even so, you have 7 sandbox maps with, a big amount of challenges in each.

If you haven't played any hitman games, you will atill be confused. However, the game is actually kinda unique, because the gameply is like no other. The game is a third person game, but with a more ""technical"" stealth mechanic. Youas Agent 47 have to track down you target and assassinate him or her and sometime with an objetive to destroy or steal an item. This is done in many ways. The story oppotunities leans the player how to get in and out unnoticed and does so in a small space, so the player doesn't feel overwhelmed. As long as you have played a third person game before you should have no problem.

[b] Positives and Negatives [/b]
The gameplay is great and simple to learn. However still complex enough to feel new every scenarios. The game has alot of new mechanics like bushes and crowds, plus many new ways to kill your target.
BUT! The game can feel very samey. So if you have just complete H1 (2016), you should probably wait. (more on that later)

[u][h1] Contracts [/h1][/u]
Contracts is missions made by other player and are often more difficult than the original game. The game have a nice guide that shows you have to make your own missions it is easy and fun to do so. not much else

[b] Positives and Negatives [/b]
It is always good to have more content in a game. However, I am one of those people who like to get 100% of achivements (a completionist) and multiplayer achivements is kinda annoying. A lucky thing that there is so few of them and is fairly easy to get.

[u][h1] Multiplayer [/h1][/u]
Haven't tried it yet. It requires friends sadly ;)

[u][h1] Bonuses [/h1][/u]
If you have HITMAN 1 (2016) you will get all the maps/scenarios from that game remastered in this game. Even the DLC if you have that. There is only 2 bad parts about this. as a completionist you have to complete all the old achievments AGAIN! you can't get all the new achivements before you get the old ones. However, that you get the old game again, but better for free, is awesome. Even if you didnt had the original game, you can get all the old maps cheap. It will cost you 20€, but it is much cheap than to buy the old game.

If you didn't like the previous game, this one won't change your mind.

29,45979397,english,"Positives: 
I liked what they did with the season 2 levels (I.E. take the expansiveness and intricacies of Sapienza and expand upon that, plus they look beautiful in their own ways.) 
Making you remaster all of the legacy levels is kinda okay, but I was still a bit miffed about that, they make up for it by adding small details and giving you new toys to play with though.
Hitman is still as nice to play as ever, still fairly fluid gameplay and IO have polished what they did right in Hitman 2016.

Negatives:
There's typos in the game, like, a fair few.
Achievement and suit unlock glitches - I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but after achieving mastery 20/20 on Sapienza, the achievement did not unlock. Furthermore, the challenge for SA 1 ET (The Undying) should've unlocked the Terminus suit for me, but it didn't seem to unlock. 
The online aspect is a pain in the ass - sometimes my connection drops JUST as I'm about to finish a level where I'd achieve SA or SA/SO and the game has a fit.
There's still small subdue glitches where you have to grab people at the right angle or you instigate hand-to-hand combat with them and blow your cover.
I'm NOT a fan of the hand-holding during the ET, that opportunity sucked, I wanted to work it all out by myself (I guess I still had the opportunity to do that but it felt forced upon me).

Overall:
I appreciate the shitshow IO went through after Square Enix split, and for the most part they've improved their winning formula. However, there are still some creases they need to iron out.

It's definitely not the best story, but let's be real, who buys a Hitman game for its story?
These games are all about the replayability, and there's a lot to do in this one.
If you own the previous HITMAN you can play all those levels in this one too, alternatively you can buy a DLC to unlock that game's levels for this one.

Despite all its flaws, I really liked the previous entry in the series and when it comes to playing a Hitman game, this one has done nothing but improve on it.

52,45798867,english,"[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
HITMAN 2 is a well-known stealth game, where you take a role of top world assassin, taking out the most dangerous and famous targets in a highly crowded areas. During each level you’ll have to stay undetected and quite often switch your uniform, disguising as event staff members, or even target’s personal bodyguards. Second game in a rebooted line serves as straight up story continuation and brings up some more interesting mechanics. For those of you who are uncommon with the game, developers made short introduction video and an ability to play all the levels from previous game (for the extra price, of course).

[h1]Few words about the story and game universe:[/h1]
In any HITMAN game you can divide the story on global and local one. Global story serves as glue between the levels, explaining why your character would hunt exactly this person. In HITMAN, global story displays some top notch secret society, which is at war with unknown mercenary. Your character is hired to hunt this mercenary down. 

Local story usually consists of briefing and personal data on your targets, quite often with their type of personality and some dirt on their life, be it accidental murder, or cocaine trafficking. Local briefing however, is usually quite interesting to study and track down, as it’s full of various tiny interesting details, which help you to discover some more small stories. Each map not only possess own unique local story, but also slightly interconnects it with previous levels. As such, you can hear NPCs discussing how “someone” murdered a guy, or TV news which tell that FBI finally found a body of dead terrorist who you had killed few maps ago.

[h1]Gameplay analysis:[/h1]
HITMAN 2 is a stealth game with an advanced rank system and multiple ways of completing the mission. And by multiple I mean really many ways:

First way the most boring one, which is simply bringing assault weapon and turning level to the hell on Earth. In this way, security would try to stop you, using all the weaponry they have, which includes pistols, shotguns, SMGs, assault rifles and even grenades. Except that, you’ll hear guards talking on the radio and commenting your actions. For example what uniform you wear, or whether you’re an accurate shooter. As soon as you begin the shooting, alarm starts off and the security will try to evacuate targets to some well defended place. Game itself doesn’t appreciate such approach, though, but if you’re bored, feel free to give it a try.

Second way is suitable for those people who enjoys classic stealth games, as you can also bring sniper rifle, silenced pistol, or a bomb, taking down your target in a stylish way, similar to all those bad guys in the movies. Each map features at least one suitable position per target and, quite often, a spot where you can make an ambush with the bomb. If anything goes wrong, you can always use your silenced pistol and try to silence the witness, before they manage to report your illegal actions to the security. However, using lethal weaponry isn’t always needed, as for minor offenses security would just try to guide you out of the restricted area.

However, real art of the game is to make a kill on a top notch level, framing everything up in the way so that common people would believe that target’s death was nothing more but an accident. This is how you get the highest score, this is how you find out more local stories on the map and this is usually the most difficult, yet somewhat enjoying way of taking out a target. Quite often such ways include dark humor, or even cynicism.

Comparing to previous game, the new part brought up some more new features. These are the grenades, which can be used by both, your character and the enemy. Also, old suitcase was brought back to living, so using sniper rifle has become way easier than before. From now on you can hide inside crowd (before that, enemies could see you from some distance, even if you stood behind multiple people). Overall, game feels more alive, as on many maps you’ll need to interact with surroundings, such as purchasing soda, taking a ticket from people, or giving someone keys.

This is where bonuses for hitman end and more difficulties arrive: For example, if an NPC saw you snitching around for too long in one suit, and then they see you again but this time wearing some staff uniform, it’s a straight mission failure, as you’ll be reported. Of course, you could always shoot all the witnesses before they reach the security, or change uniform again, so that security seeks for a wrong guy instead of you, but quite often such actions have a negative impact on the final score. The last but not least is mirrors and cameras: If you try to knock out an NPC from behind but someone sees you through the mirror, you’re in troubles.

Perhaps, gameplay section can be finished with a short description of multiple gamemodes: One of such is a ghost mode, where you and rival hitman play on the same map and compete in time. The one who kills the 5 target, wins. Another game mode is elusive target, which came straight from previous Hitman game. In it, you are supposed to hunt down certain NPC, but duo to interesting pathfinding, quite often it brings quite some extra complications.
Overall, gameplay-wise, HITMAN 2 feels way friendlier to the new players, as it introduces better difficulty system, which can be tweaked in even more advanced ways and has all the levels, including in-game videos with story, from HITMAN 1.

[h1]The graphics:[/h1]
Unfortunately steam has character limit on reviews, so I’ll try to be short:
Graphics feels on the same level as HITMAN 1 really. Yeah, it’s a bit better than couple of years ago, but don’t expect a revolution. For an AAA title it’s neither good, nor bad. Just accept it how it is. Most of the impressions come not from HD looking models, but rather from the nice views, which every level is full of.

The REAL problem with the graphical aspect, however, is videos. Apparently IO interactive didn’t have enough funds to repeat video quality of HITMAN 1, so what they did was making comic strip looking videos. You can literally feel how difficult it was for them to accept such a sacrifice, as most of the camera angles are placed so that you only see person sitting, or staying straight. Unfortunately, such decision also leaves a negative impact on the story, as what looked stylish in HITMAN 1, feels quite cheapish in HITMAN 2.

[h1]The sound:[/h1]
The sound is done on a same level as before. Music feels stylish and good. So do the sounds. The only slight issue worth mentioning is the fact that for some reason game lacks subtitles for some secondary unimportant dialogues. Taking in attention the fact that game takes place in a crowded area with a lot of noise, some verbal phrases can be misheard, or even not heard at all. That only partially touches the SOUND, of course, but still…

[h1]Final verdict:[/h1]
HITMAN 2 is definitely a game worth buying, or at least trying. It doesn’t have too much difference from HITMAN 1 of course, however those few steps that game had made, are quite important in the series and are clearly having an impact on the gameplay. Sure, it’s not perfect, for example videos in between missions look really out of place, especially after HITMAN 1 quality, and the amount of levels is quite low. 

Yet on the bright side of things, you’ll have more advanced interaction with surroundings, where cars would explode, enemies throw grenades and civilians behave similarly to real people. Besides, IO Interactive promised few DLCs which should increase amount of content and that’s not even mentioning the fact that you can play whole HITMAN 1 story and that each map has high replayability value.

I paid for the Gold edition, I have a solid constant internet connection and I don't really care about the privacy stuff. I don't like it, but what groundbreaking information are they going to learn about me or my computer? ...whatever

The game is awesome, as you would expect it to be. It is practically identical to season 1. I really haven't noticed anything too different, but a few things I have noticed, or feel like are different:

-Guards don't have pinpoint laser accuracy when shooting at you (when I feel like playing like a psycho) you hear lots of bullets whizzing by your head.
-AI *seems*/(unproven) to seek out a more appropriate place to vomit following emetic poisoning e.g. a toilet or a sink. I remember being infuriated at the places they chose when I went through the hassle of poisoning them, especially when I'm trying to drown them.
-I think the player is better informed (via picture in picture) for events taking place far away. When a body is found for example, you always see a picture in picture. I might have bad memory, but I feel like you would often just see ""body found"" on the screen and that's it, you've blown your silent assassin rating. You're very well informed in the new game
-Also don't know if this was the case in season 1, but if you hide a body in plain sight in an NON-TRAFFICKED room, you still won't lose any rating points, so long as it stays quiet in there. I know at least in blood money if you left a body in an empty room it would still count against you in the end? 

I haven't noticed any bugs as of yet (at one point the game wasn't letting me subdue the Maelstrom in Mumbai, but that's pretty trivial given how complicated that level can be). 

In summary, the game rocks. I haven't played any of the revamped season 1 maps yet, but I am looking forward to it. I think Hitman 2 is the most polished of the series. If you want stealth, dubious murders, humor, look no further. The story? Meh... I haven't finished the game yet, but truth be told I don't really care... I play Hitman for fun and creative gameplay. I couldn't really care why I am in each given location. Granted Blood Money had some neat story elements that I like, but whatever man. If you love the hitman series, buy the game, without a doubt. If you loved season 1, its almost a necessity that you buy this one (that's how I looked at it at least :D.

Pros:
-Hitman gameplay we know and love
-Polished game mechanics
-Lots of targets on each map/ lots of level elements
-Suitcase is back baby!
-I hear there is a tranquilizer gun? Amazing 1. If this is true & 2: If it isn't locked to a level and can be selected pre-mission. I will have a great deal of fun with that.
-Cloud based saves: amazing now that I have a gaming laptop and can play on my lunch at work, then pickup at home on my desktop.

Cons:
-Price for Gold, boo, those expansions better not be $25 a piece lol
-Story cut scenes with minimal animation between levels lame, do not help the narrative. But hey, if animated story cut scenes got slashed for the budget to make way for richer game play, I'm all for it! 
-Unlocks from previous season did not carry over, lame! This is my biggest con for sure. I spent hours playing season 1 and painstakingly completed the challenges to get mastery 20/20; I really have no desire to do it again. 
 

IN REGARDS TO THE SUITCASE: I knew I was at least going to buy the silver because I wanted the suitcase, but decided to hell with it, may as well pay for all the future content. I will say for those who desperately want the suitcase, the only good it is, is bringing in a sniper rifle or other large weapon. The suitcase slot takes the place of the 2nd inventory item you can bring. For example, for my load out I could choose the pistol, fiber wire, and lock pick. If however I elect to have my suitcase instead, I could have pistol, fiber wire, and suitcase (which contains an item slot) but would not have an extra slot I otherwise wouldn't have. So in that regards, the suitcase is pretty useless. How much stuff do you really need to bring? Agency pickups pick up the slack. So if you're obsessed with getting the suitcase, just know that its not the must have item *I* believe you need. Once again awesome for getting a rifle in though (even if I don't have the sweet one yet).

81,45908999,english,"So, let me start by stating that I am a huge Hitman fan.  I have played and enjoyed every game in the franchise, and while this one is by no means an exception to that rule, it's also not the best game in the franchise.  The reasons for that are as follows:
1. This game tries to seize on the established trend from past Hitman games that it's fun to replay your favorite missions and try new methods of assassination.  It does this by reminding you about all the ""mission stories"" you haven't done each time you complete a mission for the first time.  While the intent is fine, the way they did it comes across as pushy and in your face.  I'll repeat only the missions I like when I want to get around to it, thanks.  You don't need to keep telling me about the stories I haven't done.
2. A good number of these mission stories suck as actual methods of covert assassination, and are instead all about the spectacle.  Kill a tech CEO by causing his prototype combat android to shoot him instead of a dummy, and all the witnesses just let you walk away, even though they all watched you use the android.  Kill a drug maker by posing as one of his employees, and bring him a poisoned sample to taste.  All the guards around just let you walk out, no questions asked.  Kill the head of a shadow organization by tricking her into electrocuting herself, then blatantly take two things off her corpse, and again, everybody just lets you walk away. 
3. The last mission has way too many enforcers.  Yes, I get that it's the last mission and so it should be difficult, but it's a castle full of people who are almost all wearing masks (including the guards), and somehow, every other person is an enforcer.  That's a really cheap, lazy way to add difficulty to a mission that was otherwise enjoyable.",1542693586,1542693586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197980804400,481,35,890,0,623,1571534160
82,45801719,english,"Short Answer:

I regret nothing, 10/10 - IGN ""would hit again""


Long Answer:

This game is pretty amazing  the levels are massive (except for Hawk's Bay and another one) and they really make the world feel lived in, The first hitman had something i absolutely hated and that was unsatisfying sounds when i broke someones neck it sound like i actually don't know what to compare it to. But this is what i wanted when i break someones neck and hear the crunch you know you just F***ed this man up. Something so simple as sound design can make a world of difference and you can see this here, the guns sounds have bass and feel like guns and the Silencers sound dope, This game is a perfectionists dream memorize the level layouts and guard cycles and all that fun stuff and the level up gives more incentive.

Ok now for what I disliked lets start with sounds THE FLASHBANG THAT SOUND IS AWFUL not awful as in it sounds weird as in IT'S SO GOOD THAT IF YOU WEAR HEADPHONES IT DISORIENTATES YOU IN REAL LIFE when you get flashbanged alot in a row it has this high frequency that messes with your ears big time no joke (at least for me), I started to use instinct when a flash bang was thrown at me to avoid the sound. still incountered some wonky AI at times. One BIG issue is that they reuse the same equipment as rewards as in 2 door hacking tools or  ""name here"" mkII, give us a lazer watch or something but i disliked that  quite a bit.

IN conclusion this game really makes you feeeeeel like batman.",1542146004,1542691989,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198394175877,280,16,49836,0,10381,1599730445

85,45907580,english,"A great game, an excellent Hitman game.

Some things I like: 

+They added all the levels at launch no more episodic bullshit.
+All the levels in this game are really fun to play and built really well (even the starting tutorial mission)
+I enjoy alot of the new equipment like the new flashbang grenades, new guns etc
+Thank GOD they added the briefcase back into this game. with these bad boys you can smuggle what ever you want (sniper rifles, shotguns, Ars, Bombs) and youre not spotted (unfortunately you cant get passed a frisk zone with one, im guessing for balancing reasons)
+remastered season 1 maps for free (if you own season 1)
+mastery points can now be gained by doing other things besides just challenges. you can aquire them by getting headshots,hiding bodies, changing disguises, ya know assassin stuff 

Some things I don't:

- I dont know if its meant to be a joke but im not a fan at all of the ""MK 2"" items of any kind. It seems lazy to me, why did they give me the same gun from the first season (that by the way I now have in the second game because of the legacy pack) with a pink 2 sticker on the side of it? it just makes some of the unlocks feel redundant.
- not really a fan of the online only, i have shity internet and sometimes it goes out for long periods of time and then i cant use any of my unlocks.
-Ghost mode, if youre beating who youre up against the other player will drop

things that didnt bother me:

~ The story is okay. in my opinion its not bad but its nothing to write home about.
~ They replaced the story cinematic videos with more of a still art style, didnt really bother me",1542683193,1542683193,True,6,0,0.526768624782562256,0,True,False,False,76561198054721798,223,56,7238,0,2981,1596308807
86,45907290,english,"Pros:

+ A fantastic continuation from the 2016 release, this entry in the series adds several mechanics that vastly improve core gameplay, including notification windows, fully functionable mirrors, Guard AI retweeking, briefcase usage and much more. The game also adds interesting mission-specific mechanics, such as finding a clue or NOT harming an individual.

+ Allowing us to instantly replay the old levels in the new engine, without having to rebuy them (unless you never owned them to begin with) was a great move.

+ Each of the new levels are distinct and huge in scale, to the point where they feel far bigger than the ones in Legacy. The game's gorgeous attention to detail shines through the level complexity -- It wasn't uncommon to feel completely lost in some of the levels.

+ Visually this game is very impressive, with some areas surpassing the 2016 entry. 

+ The story continues from 2016 and takes a few interesting (albeit predictable) turns. While the cutscenes are scaled down from 2016's entry (as this game features a sort-of 'comic book' version where you see still frames at the same quality), it's also arguable that the scenes get the player far more invested.

+ Two new multiplayer and co-op modes add another layer to the entertaining post-game you can participate in. And of course, illusive targets make a return! 



Cons:

- Performance can be abysmal in certain areas, especially those that are crowded. A lacking in DX12 support (that 2016 had) is a huge part of the problem. With a GTX 1080 I was barely managing 35-43 in some of the dense areas, regardless of what settings I was running -- and my card recommended far higher settings. AMD cards may have an easier time with this game. 

- There is still no real purpose for unlocking a good 2/4ths of the game's weapons, as the game punishes you for, y'know, not being a silent assassin. Often times I've gotten rewards that simply made me go ""oh, I'll never use that"". Giving us a reason to use these weapons would be a huge boost. A horde mode of some kind to use your weapon unlocks in would be beneficial.

- While the cutscenes are still engaging, and arguably are better at engaging the player --  it's not quite as satisfying as having a full motion video.




Overall:

Hitman 2 is a solid jump in quality from Hitman 2016, but it has some rough edges to work with. The lack of optimization is a gigantic flaw to an otherwise fantastic experience. Hopefully they will re-introduce directx 12, or at least greatly reduce performance drops in populated areas.

Still, If you're a hitman fan, you owe it to yourself to get this game. And if you're new to the series, picking up this package of 2016 + 2018's levels is a must-have. It is overall a wonderful experience, and one that I play on continuing to play off and on over the next few months.",1542681248,1542681255,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561197984598883,379,39,2768,0,966,1551639520

93,45904566,english,"An excellent follow-up to 2016's Hitman.

PROS:
- A variety of new locations that look & sound great.
- Inventive new assassination opportunities, including some clever indirect methods.
- Missions play some neat tricks with pacing & structure.
- Gameplay has been refined since the last game in some small but fun ways (e.g., disappearing in crowds, hiding things in a briefcase).

96,45901085,english,"I am a fan of Hitman franchise since the very beginning. I still remember that fine autumn day, I was 10 years old back then. We often visited the local computer club with my friend and played Counter-Strike, however there were lots of fellow gamers gathered around one PC that day and we were curious as well. When we got closer I saw the now very famous level from Hitman: Codename 47 - The Lee Hong Assassination. It was so interesting to watch rather than play. So exciting and marvellous. The ragdoll animations were so crazy and the visual style and music were terrific. I wanted to play it so bad after a couple of hours of just staring at the monitor while some random guy played it, but I didnt have a chance. Sadly - I didnt remember the title of the game and I lost it until my friend gave me a copy of both first and second chapters two years later.

So, I was older, smarter and I always had a certain taste within the video game world. I played dozens of hours and fell in love with those two games, especially with Silent Assassin. That perfect music from Jesper Kyd was and still is astonishing! I became a dedicated fan and when I heard some rumors via the PC game journal few years later about the third installment of the franchise - I got thrilled! Contracts will be always my favorite even though lots of gamers don't like it. The dark tone and atmosphere as long as deep, dark soundtrack gave the most memorable experience to me. I spent hundreds of hours within all those games and when Blood Money got announced - it was a celebration for my soul. Still remember the in-game commercial in ""25 to life"" shooter.

And after BM a whole six years have passed before we found out about the new game of series about the cold blooded bald assassin. Honestly - i liked it very much. Yes, there were some inconvinient part of the gameplay, but for one awesome ride - Absolution sure did everything very well. But most of the fans weren't pleased with that game and IOI went back to thinking about the new formula fore several years.

And they did it! After four long years in 2016 we got almost perfect game about Agent 47. It borrowed best things from 4 first classic installments and from Absolution. Large levels full of massive exploration, new graphics, new weapons, features and possibilities. Tons of hours of replayability! Even though we didn't receive our favorite composer Jesper Kyd back, overall - the game was great. 

The new HITMAN 2 is the successor of the first one and even from all of the previous games. It is quintessential. Story, game mechanics, lots of variativity make this game a ""must have"". Yes, there are some graphic glitches sometimes, visual effects are not best in our modern video game world, but its style works pretty awesome. I love it, I love IOI, I'm grateful that after 20 years of game developement you are still making games about 47.

4,45891676,english,"PROS:

If you liked Hitman (2016), you will absolutely love this one, it is a seamless continuation of the previous game. Because I had the 2016 game, all the maps from that game just imported right into this one, so you can play ALL maps between the two games but with the cool new mechanics they added to this one (hiding in tall vegetation, ability to place items instead of dropping them, the briefcase, etc.) I bought the standard edition, btw. Not to mention the new game modes, coop, all the new little items AND the fact that if you replay the former missions you can unlock those items in the new ones? yeah this game is fire. Everyone talking about these disconnection errors must have a slow internet connection, my connection hasn't dropped once since I bought it. (And for the record, at launch with the previous game, my connection dropped regularly, despite having cable line, 100mbps)

CONS:

The only thing I don't like about the game, and it's strictly a personal preference, is the introduction of ""searching for intel"", where you have to walk around gathering intel, listening in on conversations, etc as a part of the mission.  I think it's only on a few maps but yeah it's boring.

This is NOT A NEW HITMAN GAME. IOI has fallen to the same greedy fate as most other corporate money making machines. Their new formula for Hitman; literally take the exact same game, design new maps and slap an 80$ price tag on it. Its glorified DLC. There's no real graphic improvements, no added assasination methods or weapons (nothing worth a damn anyways), and the CUT SCENES. 

Don't even get me started on the cut scenes. They were too lazy to make motion driven CGI or animated cut scenes, and instead all the cut scenes consist of STILLS. NOTHING MOVES. It just looks sloppy and completely uninteresting. What an embarassing cop out for IOI.

Not only that, but the direction that the story takes is so absolutely confusing compared to the previous games and the poorly done cut scenes make it 5x harder to figure out wtf is going on. The whole time I was playing I didn't really understand what the point really was. I was just entering my ""focus mode"", finding the red 'targets', walking to them and shooting them in the face. Rinse and repeat. The pre cut and un satisfying 'use the world as your weapon' assasination techniques are all poorly designed and often times your target just ends up flopping to the floor like a fucking fish, leaving you with the most unsatisfying kill you could probably get in a game. 

The game CRASHES EVERY level at the exact SAME points. I have not been able to get through a single mission without creating multiple save points, restarting the mission, or trying to bypass areas that crash the game.

The base game is Hitman 2016, but with six new maps, six new contracts, and a story not everyone cares about. The gameplay, visuals, and sound are clean, however the music cuts off if you let your computer sit for too long. I have not yet experienced any bugs during my mere 20 hours of gameplay, except for a slight wrinkle when it came to “No Bodies Found” WHERE AS YOU CAN SEE THE GASOLINE SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTED I’m getting off topic. Gameplay is challenging, but abides by rules that are not explicitly stated, however spending enough time with the game will help you out. Weapon and tool selections are similar to the first game, with most of the new toys simply being reskins. The three difficulty levels are clear as to who they are targeting (casual for noobs and youtubers, professional for players who want some straight Hitman, master for you crazy good people) , however I cannot give an opinion because I only ever play on professional. Overall, the gameplay elements are polished, however the suspicion meter should trigger investigation when it’s partially filled ALL the time instead of just when in your base suit. The new mirror system was overhyped, you crouch and suddenly NPC’s are blind as bats, it should only worry you if it’s tall. The new crowd/foliage hiding is useful and has funny dialog when you pop up near an NPC. Overall, it’s very satisfying.

Boy oh boy this is crazy. No worries about silent assassin, just get in, get five points, get out. Sounds easy. Chaos ensues. Ghost mode pits you against another assassin in order to get five unnoticed kills before the other person. Points are scored by eliminating the target and making sure the corpse isn’t spotted for ten seconds. The opponent is then forced to do the same in a constraint of twenty seconds. I cannot confirm if the timer runs out, your assassin attempt while on the back foot is canceled or not. Points can be lost by killing non-targets, and the lowest it can go is zero points. Strategies differ greatly between players. I once saw an opponent, while at zero points, kill all non targets around his target, and then kill the target. Since there was nobody left to see him, he scored a point. Ghost coins also exist, and they trigger a reaction in your opponents world, meaning that you can ruin an assassination attempt by flicking one of these into the next dimension over. Overall it’s fun, intense, and immensly satisfying, almost turning into a game of “how much [i]can[/i] 47 get away with?”

Sniper Assassin has a simple premise: shoot people from half a mile away instead of getting your hands dirty by trying to infiltrate. This is probably the most underwhelming of the three game modes. Remember point and click adventures? This is basically that, but without the story or interest. Multiplayer would probably be more fun with a friend, but none of mine have Hitman, so I’m kind of stuck. It can get really dull, and when the only thing to work for is weapon upgrades and the number one on the leaderboard (which probably has bots in it, so you can’t even try for that) there’s little replayibility. Maybe the new maps will pique my interest, but otherwise I do t like this mode.

Purchased Hitman 2 - Gold Edition 

I'm a huge Hitman fan, and have always loved the Hitman games for their replay-ability, and for the variety of options to complete missions. Because I'm a huge fan I bought the most expensive version, and to me its well worth it. If your an achievement hunter, like myself you will thoroughly enjoy the game-play and the hunt to gather all the achievements and challenges.   

This game, despite its online policy (which isn't as bad as people say) is an excellent edition to the Hitman series. I'm loving the new locations, as well as the option to go back and play the original locations from Hitman, remastered. 

If you loved Hitman, you will love Hitman 2, nuff said. If you're new to Hitman, and have the money shell out on the Gold Edition - do it, you wont be disappointed. Plus you get the biggest bang for your buck and near endless amount of things to do.

40,45868091,english,"A lot of reviews I've read discuss the story being weak. Frankly, I couldn't disagree more; in fact, after Absolution, which was certainly flawed in many ways, the thing I missed in HITMAN was a story.

I love the story elements in this one. Definitely a step up. 

Also, this game is so packed with content it is hard to know where to begin. 
All of the HITMAN locations are included, only updated and with completely different mission objectives. Then all the new maps I've barely even explored because I want to play this out in order. Again, all part of the story.

And the other thing which is amazing is that they have turned what used to be story components to follow, usually for a way to infiltrate and complete some level of a mission, they have made this game in a way where these become critical story lines. So, the replayability level is extremely high.

It is non-episodic, and probably half as large in hard drive space as the original, yet the content is just packed with fun.

And Ghost Mode is an addition I've wanted, in one form or another, forever. It is competitive online play, but not to kill the other person. It is a race to kill 5 targets first. Each target is introduced, and the players from their relative starting positions go to eliminate them. The moment one is eliminated, a new one is introduced, and the battle to be first begins again.

I liked Absolution because of the incredible acting, but hated its disguise mechanic which was truly ridiculous and ineffective. I loved HITMAN because it was so much better in this regard, and it is beautiful and open ended much more than prior games in the franchise. HITMAN2 has taken the best of both and put them together, adding, finally, an online component in real time, improving the story to actually be one, and by making the mechanics better than before.

I have only one gripe with the game. I purchased early to get the Sniper Assassin addition, and make no mistake, it is addictive and fun. My complaint is that there is only one single location from which Agent 47 snipes, on one map. That seems like a very bizarre thing. With all the content otherwise, one would think they could have more than one map for the extra $20. 

I HIGHLY recommend this game for fans of the series. It is the best HITMAN yet, and I've played them all. This game is spectacular, and again, the first most important thing is that it has more content than I could have imagined. It is beautiful, and completely fun if you like these types of games.

One more problem, sorta, but not of any significant importance:
My computer is a beast, and I own nearly 500 games, and this is the only one it won't stick to a frame rate of 60+. I have never thought the Glacier engine was great at all, but I do understand it was built for the big, packed crowds in locations, purpose. It does run over 50, usually 55 - 57 or so on my system, but the folks developing the game should consider a better version of their engine, which they created specifically for Hitman: Absolution, and have continued using.

[h1] Hitman 2 is a stealth action game that continues the story and the ideas of the previous game (2016) and exalts them to the next level. Player has an ability to travel around the world to track and eliminate his targets with all its inherent elegance on the enormous sandbox locations. [/h1]  

[b] Pros: [/b]

+ Stunningly detailed enormous levels 
+ Countless ways to eliminate the targets
+ Very high degree of replayability, perfect game for completionists
+ Game was designed to be friendly for both newcomers and experienced players
+ Player can follow the whole story from the first season from here without launching the previous game, as all the missions have been brought here. All these old missions updated with new features as well.
+ Lots of new stealth mechanics that are minor but they actually bring a lot to the gameplay
+ Brand new awesome 1vs1 multiplayer Ghost Mode
+ Challenging and fun stealth gameplay, not as hardcore as it was before
+ Say goodbye to episodic format

[b] Cons: [/b]

- Requires connection to the internet all the time
- It has Denuvo, that can be a problem for lots of players
- Cutscenes have a much lower quality comparing to previous season
- It feels pretty short if you don’t feel like replaying the same level many times to find every single possibility and reveal every secret.
- Unremarkable story 
- Voice acting issues here and there
- Can be a bit buggy at some levels, forcing you to reload the game from checkpoints

To be perfectly clear, it won’t hurt to declare that Hitman 2 is a perfect pick for someone, who call himself a true fan of the series and eager to know the story of Agent 47 and what happened to him next. This game doesn’t bring too much of a new features or it doesn’t change the gameplay dramatically, so it’s better to think that Hitman 2 is just a logical continuation of the previous game. It brings six new perfectly designed enormous sandbox missions, with tons of possibilities and different scenarios to discover, making players want to replay it again and again, bringing lots of satisfaction.

[h1] Story [/h1]   
The story in Hitman 2 is not that remarkable, basically it follows the events of the 2016 game and reveal the Codename 47 secrets a little bit more, telling us how he became a serial killer and who was staying behind all of this. He meets a man from the past and that leads him to the answers for the questions that players can still have from the 2016’s game. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 

Speaking of gameplay, Hitman 2 brings us the fullest experience that we ever had, with every possible gadget and disguise. Player is the one to choose, either to make it clear and silently or maybe it will be much more easier to organize a bloodbath. Everything is possible and here we come to the point of understanding, that player is not able to see and experience every single opportunity that mission offers you in a single playthrough. Seriously, this game can be such a great satisfaction for the players, who are fond of completing games on 100% and getting a perfect score, there are countless of possibilities. 

Some of the scenarios requires player to walk around the level a lot and play a waiting games for a long time, before he will get the perfect opportunity to take down the target. On his way to the final goal, lots of victims can be subdued or even killed to get the needed disguise, documents they hold or keys to unlock specific locations. Well, it’s a classical stealth game after all, so no surprise here, that players have to do this a lot, patience has always been the key in Hitman series, let’s be fair. 

The game literally demands you to remain calm and patient, as a minor failure can lead to reloading your game completely from the beginning, losing your precious time. Of course, player can save his game to not lose too much of his progress, unless he is not playing on the highest difficulty, where saving option is limited to one save per mission. Basically, the highest difficulty is something where the game starts to shine and it’s a great chance to test your skills. I recommend to play on this difficulty after beating the whole game and trying every single scenario on the easier difficulty.  

The level design of the missions is something, that I can't stop admiring at all. Players can spend literally hours exploring every mission and looking for opportunities, enjoying the picturesque locations and completing the challenge list. Or they can simply open the menu and choose one of the scenarios, track it and eliminate the target. I really liked the way how developers managed to come up with tons of creative ideas of killing your target: from some tricky and interesting scenarios, revealing the plot even more to some accidental events, like short circuit at the most convenient and right moment.

Sniper Assassin mode is back again with lots of different scenarios, making players stay in Hitman 2 even longer and a brand new mode appears here as well, called Ghost multiplayer. In this mode, player co-exists with his opponent in 1vs1 competitive mode in one world, having no ability to interact with each other. They have to hunt down the targets to have a better score and win the round. I can’t say that I was that i was delighted with this multiplayer mode, but it definitely can bring players even more fun, when they are done with everything else. Also, let’s not forget that developers promised to support the game with Elusive Target missions, a time limited scenarios with a single chance to take down the target. The first one will be represented by a famous british actor Sean Bean - the guy who is not lucky enough with his movie roles, getting killed there all the time, so it’s really fun how they decided to ironize on this fact. Looking forward to these new activities to spend even more hours in this great game.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]    
I can say that graphics is almost on the same level as it was in the previous game, maybe a little bit more polished. The only thing that really bothered me was the cutscenes, that confused me a lot, when I saw this static figures staying on one place, while camera was moving around the scene. I am not quite sure, either they were trying to bring something new with this comic book look style, or was it just a lack of money, but it was definitely that thing I disliked in Hitman 2 for sure. 

[h1] Sound [/h1]    
The sound was a bit buggy for me - at some missions, there were scenes, when I knew that I was going to hear a character talking to me and apparently, it had to be accompanied by a dramatic music on the background, but it never happened. Then after I reloaded my game from the save, this issue was gone and a situation like this happened around four or five times to me. Other than that, I can say that audio is also almost on the same level as it was in the first game and I appreciated how stylish music was, definitely fitting the atmosphere. Every single line is voice dubbed by professional actors, there were only few scenes where subtitles were missing for some reason.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]   
Shortly speaking, if you enjoyed the first game, then you have to grab this one as well. Hitman 2 definitely does not change the game beyond recognition, but I can not say this is bad. It just adds more experience to the game you love and enjoy, especially adding these new cool features. Six missions can feel a bit short and not enough, especially if you are not a fan of replaying the missions. It can be a minor disappointment with a plot and its weak cutscenes, so let’s hope that they will work more on this one in the next game. And it also very friendly to the newcomers, so if you ever feel like introducing to the Hitman story, now is a perfect time for this!

Good story, really makes you feel like you are a hitman.

One large side note for the multiplayer, it needs to be harder and if you die/get spotted you should lose the match.

Also the doors should be locked and the targets need more body guards/guards/people around them in my opinion.

Maybe make 1-3 targets max, so the randomness is maximized because of XX amount of targets. Wich improves the feeling you are actually on a legit contract. Give 1-3 targets right away, so people can choose who to kill first, more sandbox like.

Work with a point system, getting spotted/not wiping cameras/etc lowers score.

Highest score wins/person who dies loses/etc.

It's in beta and I'm hopefull it will be 10 times better than any other assassination multiplayer game when it gets that magic final touch.

I only recommend this if you liked the first Hitman TM game (1). The missions are very linear and it's a my way or the highway, they set up a bunch of fancy toys and they want you to use them. It's harder to actually find your own way to kill a target than their way. For example on a later mission (all mission are available from the start) you can choose to, disguise yourself as a real estate agent after disguising yourself as a food vendor take someone on a tour of a house; I mean ACTUALLY take them on a tour of the house, none of that half ass shit. Even if you're alone in the house with them and you can bash them on the head with a rubber duck and do laps around their body, doesn't matter STORY MISSION failed. Or you could just poison them with an exterminator outfit. Already have poison? Well too bad shitdick, this is IO's game so you have to find IO's poison. 

I want to like it, I really do. But it's blindingly frustrating when you have your own unique way to take on a target or you skip step three of fourteen and the mission freezes. A lot of the opportunity kills happen when you set off certain triggers, so if you're waiting for the target to show up to their medical appointment better make sure you did step 4-7 first (even if they are not vital) otherwise the target will literally never show up. Or maybe the will show up I decided to not wait over three hours. 

Final downtick, the GD scoring system. Points for an unnoticed kill, points for a subdue, minus points for those though because you're not supposed to be doing anything except the story, to the letter, otherwise MINUS MINUS MINUS MINUS. I know you can ignore it but one of the most satisfying games like Blood Money would be reading the newspapers afterwards and finding out how well you did. Not ""you didn't do it our way, here's 2 stars replay the map for other 'fun' stories"" which it will tell you to do. It doesn't recommend you ""progress"" until you experience it their way. I'm mostly writing this to vent my frustration before I go back to try and break their game and have fun with it. 

Now the review is going to stop and I'm just going to write down dumb**** that happened. No animated cutscenes. I walked into a mexican villa, found my target, hop a fence, look through a window, knock out the witness with a briefcase, shoot target in face. Alternative; Go and find a shaman, a certain kind of poison poppy, a certain kind of tea, invite target to spiritual tea time after finding out targets hobbys, poison target during tea time. Or, you know, LITERALLY WALK DOWN THE STREET AND SHOOT THEM IN THE FACE. Steal military man's uniform, attend demonstration of unmanned fighters, replace photo of dummy target with photo of real target, or wait until they go outside and sit down and SHOOT THEM IN THE FACE. Find another NPC assassin, help him assassinate your target by going into a penthouse and pretending to be a painter, paint an entire portrait and listen to Agent 47 and the target talk about how big the targets package is. Or, steal a policeman uniform, sneak up the elevator shaft and SHOOT THEM IN THE FACE.

Item stash locations are limited to none or one, the XP/progression system won't work at all, you can't unlock anything including weapons, and more. I have not played any other HITMAN series games, but a quick Google shows that they've done this in the past and many people hoped they had learned from their mistake.

Well, they haven't. It's disgusting that the game treats you very differently if you're offline, when there's just no good reason. I'm going to assume it's to temp you to go online so they can take that data that the other reviews are talking about, because I just can't see any other good reason. Why punish us for choosing to go offline? Not everyone wants to play online, not everyone can play online all of the time, and not everyone will want to agree to the privacy policy. You shouldn't punish us for that choice by limiting the game. I had hoped that the seperation of IOI and Square Enix could of helped, but nope.

I will never be able to recommend a game that limits offline play in this way. Many titles do not do this at all, certainly not so unfairly. I believe that the choice to not accept the privacy policy and to go offline should be a free choice, and limitations like this shouldn't exist from such a pricey game. I'm going to refund this game and might grab a torrent in pure spite, but I'm certainly not paying for the offline choice to be so rubbish.",1542400765,1542400765,False,345,15,0.742064774036407471,7,True,False,False,76561198049648176,37,24,306,0,103,1590672677

An excellent followup to an already stellar re-birth for the series. Only this time, we're not stuck waiting a full year just to get the full game. All levels are available now to play, and are just as large and expansive as they were in Hitman 2016. 

Visually, the game looks about the same, though there have been some minor downgrades, like to Agent 47's suit. The game plays exactly the same as before, and you can even revist locations from the previous game either by purchasing the levels like DLC, or play them free if you already own the previous game. 

There's also a new cooperative sniper mode, and a competitive challenge mode that has players running around the same map (but with their own set of NPCs) and try to kill targets first.

+ the stuttering only hit me hard in the 2nd mission (GTX1070) and its still playable so the game is much more optimized than Hitman 2016

- story is average (i don't really care about story that much), the ending hinted Hitman 3 will be a thing, just fyi.
- all the weapons you unlocked in 2016 hitman wont be carried over!?
- apparently killing the cartel members (who are murderers and drug smugglers will reduce your score, although they're not civillian)
- i expected more levels (2~3 more maybe?, because some levels aren't as big and complicated as the rest)

overall: 8/10
further optimization required but overall a pleasant experience
the amount of levels is a bit underwhelming

They all have their own unique ambience, and the soundtrack (way better than HITMAN 1 in my opinion), along with all the little details incorporated among each level, make them very enjoyable to explore.

Also, for some reason I care alot about this, but the guns sound amazing! Loud guns have an oomph to them and silenced pistols sound like an actual silenced pistol, which isn't a pew pew sound nor completely silent at all (which is how they're supposed to be). Well done on the sound design!
It looks beautiful and runs fine. 30+ FPS in crowded areas on Ultra with an FX 8350 and GTX 1060. This is much better than the last game's. Turning the settings down the high or medium-high lets me get around 60, something I could never achieve in the original.

Though the new content, challenges and replayability of the old levels too, makes up for the price point. It's better optimized, gives more tools and challenges and overall a really interesting and inspiring game.

The story is going even deeper as well! Though I know not many of those playing Hitman are focused on the story, but rather the gameplay, but the story is definitely icing on the cake for this one.

But the always online BS and the stealing of your private data for targeted ads would have been a dealbreaker had I been aware of it before buying.",1542284749,1542284749,False,212,18,0.667956888675689697,24,True,False,False,76561198045014220,933,6,683,0,353,1572681801
7,45824258,english,"First of all... let's get the biggest horse out of the room:

YOU DO NOT NEED AN INTERNET CONNECTION TO PLAY THE GAME!!!

The reason why I point this out is because the primary reason folks are giving this a negative review is because they claim you need one. I tested it right before making this review and you don't need one. Period. You litterally do NOT need one!

Good, now onto the actual review:
The game is very methodical in it's approach and this has a massive upside and a slight downside as well. It's great because it allows you to explore the level/map and find the different stories that you can interact with and believe me... there's a TON of stories to explore! They range from minor things that help you, minor things that flesh out the world and also massive stories that directly relate to how one takes out the target.
One can go up and shoot them in the face true... but you can also shoot their car whilst they are racing so they spin out and have an ""accident"" on the track, you can poison them in a million different fashions and spend some quality time killing them in a bathroom.
This is where the massive positive comes in, because you have a tremendous amount of choices how you go about things... even though the world around you does work on a clock meaning that a person will be at a specific place at a specific time unless theey have been interrupted. May it be you directly or perhaps a chainreaction from something you did earlier.
All of this means that you engage with the world a lot more than one perhaps would.
It also helps that you have roughly five billion challenges to complete if you are into that. To provide an example: I have played (willingly I will also add) through what is essentially the tutorial level 4 or 5 times... I am 37% done with the challenges. I may have spent a few hours doing that.

Yah', there's A LOT of game to be had if one sees these challenges and really go for them.
But that's where I will point out a VERY slight negative to all of this: if you are on one end of the level and your target is on the litteral opposite end, it can feel a bit like a choir to get to 'em. Not necessarily for all levels due to guards and other hinders or even story arcs to explore, but it is still worth mentioning. Even if I will point out it is a VERY slight negative towards what enriches the world a hundred times more, so it's definitely a worthwhile tradeoff.

Other than that:
You have Sniper assassination challenges.

You have a sort of almost like a real-time time trial versus assassination multiplayer mode.
... you might need to have a look on YouTube for an explaination to that one because I don't know how to explain it any other way! ^^'

You have access to DLC that provides you with the prior Hitman game in this game as well for relatively cheap.

You got custom made contracts meaning you get to play on the same maps but have different objectives and restrictions if you so wish. This also means you essentially have an infinite number of people you can assassinate... possibly whilst wearing a flamingo costume.


So here's my final words:
I love stealth games and MMOs specifically. They are probably amongst my favourite types of games.
As someone who has played as a direct result many MMOs that have sunk thousands of hours for me... this game is on that scale if not even larger for what it offers you. It is a game that outshines so many other games to this date.
It's a world that feels alive and you get to play as a hitman in this world feeling exceptionally clever when you pull off some almost outworldly stunt.

If you like stealth gameplay where you also get to disguise yourself or possibly just want to assassinate people for the fun of it... Buy the game already! ^^",1542284517,1542284517,True,1,1,0.458278536796569824,0,True,False,False,76561198030554225,202,41,7295,0,1780,1584353118

18,45817625,english,"Hitman 2: 2 is easily one of the best games in the series, marred by some of the worst flaws in the series, barring the awful problems that plagued the first 2 games. Its a difficult recommendation because a lot of the flaws can break the game for people unable to cope with them, but if you can see past them the game is still very good.

First: What do you get? By buying Hitman 2: 2, you get 5 massive levels, 1 small level, each with a myriad of challenges and feats you can perform to unlock new crap to use to shoot, maim, and bomb your target and everyone in a 15ft radius. If you own Hitman 2016, you get those 6 levels and their challenges to play as well. Note that previous suit and gadget unlocks don't carry over so be prepped to claw and scream for your WA2000 and Silver Baller again.

First off heres whats good about Hitman 2: 2; The gameplay. Improvements to 2016's gameplay and level design can be found all around. Without a disguise, you can shoot while on narrow ledges, hide in bushes, and there generally seems to be more in the way of means to scale buildings and navigate around areas. With a disguise, enforcers who see through your disguise spot you much slower and their range is reduced. This means you can actually walk like a human being if you're some distance from these guys instead of having to resort to Solid Snake mode when Steve the 20:20 vision man walks in the room. Climbing pipes and shimmying along ledges is also no longer socially acceptable behaviour as well. Alongside this are general improvements like being caught trespassing means people lead you out instead of shooting you cause you needed the use the bathroom. As for the levels, they're gigantic, they're intuitive even for people playing with basically no HUD, they're pretty, and theres even more crap to do, both related and unrelated to the mission itself. A single run of the game took me about 9 hours, trying to go for a somewhat high rating first go. 7 hours seems to be the norm for people who just ice the targets and run leaving a trail of bullets and bodies behind. So, even if you don't want to replay the game its still a somewhat lengthy game.

As for the bad, the bad ranges from survivable to touching the inside of the toilet bowl with your dingdong. The controls are still awful, and rebinding them is even worse. You get used to it but you can also get used to living in Syria. The UI is awful, and is more confusing than most DOOM 2 levels. DENUVO AND ALWAYS ONLINE is absolute BS but I'm a giant Hitman fan so I have to look past it in order to print out a photo of 47's latest bald head to cum on again. Not having my Suit Unlocks from the first game blows but whatever I guess I'll live without my precious Blood Money suit. Not having my unlocks from the first game sucks and I can't think of a way to rationalize this away actually. What I'm getting at is that I'm capable of putting up with a lot of crap to play a game, but if one of these things is a dealbreaker for you, like maybe you use ESDF controls, or you can't live without the hobo Terminus suit, or you have morality and refuse to touch games with Denuvo and/or Always Online requirements, then this game will kill you irl.

Aside from the major problems and general improvement to gameplay and level design, here are some lesser things of note I just felt the need to mention. The music still sucks, Elusive Targets are still going to be a thing and as far as I know there is no change to the system, the rating system is still bad, the plot is awful but theres an antidote to give 47 memory back so the plot is at least hilariously bad, and the game runs way WAY better than 2016 but does work my computer a bit harder. GTX 980 TI, Intel i7-4770k and I never had a drop below the 72 fps I capped my game to. When it was running at 144 for the first 2 levels it stayed there and never dropped as well. I only capped it because I'm paranoid about my comp. Last, because its release, theres a few bugs in a couple levels. I encountered 2 temporarily broken target pathing circles, a staircase npc's could see through, and an instance where some Alpha Males trapped me between them.

In the end, Hitman 2 is generally just a step up above Hitman 2016, and another high quality game with a huge load of variety in ways to play each of its levels. If you liked Hitman 2016, chances are you'll enjoy this game. If you enjoy stealth games, chances are you'll enjoy this game. Even if you don't want to replay levels constantly, this is still a fine game throughout, but the majority of value comes from replaying it as with all of the Hitman games. Just check and see if any of the flaws i listed are dealbreakers for you, cause those flaws do indeed exist and I can't see them leaving anytime soon.",1542238969,1542238969,True,2,0,0.52358633279800415,0,True,False,False,76561197971123350,479,54,3178,0,822,1569525214

The fact that each location has dozens of subplots to drive repeat playing means it simply doesn’t get old, and I found myself jumping back to HITMAN 1 to replay some of those episodes, given the new information in the storyline. Anyone new to HITMAN will enjoy the previous version’s episodes too, making this a marvellous gaming experience with real sticking power.

I also love that the entier first game is remastered in this one and it was free (because I had already purchased it when i bought the first game). If you buy the legacy content you get ALL of it so any non-cosmetic DLC you might have missed from the first game is present.

The game looks stunning for me, but I do not care so much for graphics. What I really like is gameplay!

So I just played all the levels and I did it on professional. I tried to hide all the bodies, but I did not care much about the targets. At some levels it was just hide, shoot and walk away. At the other levels I did care and followed the story. I just wanted to see all the levels!
And oh my... The levels are BIG. Very big. And there is a lot to do. Cameras are more difficult. They detect you, but when you should not be there, they will also call for reinforcement.

They can also recognize you when you are showing your back. It is amazing! :). But I must also say it is easy on professional. Even if you make a mistake, you can easily correct it.

32,45812626,english,"I write too much, so in summary:

Excellent game from an excellent game studio.

Pros:
- New maps are even better than Season 1
- The series' signature morbid sense of humor is back to make you feel terrible for laughing
- Legacy Pack is free for owners of the previous game, adding all Season 1 maps
- Demo available, can be upgraded with Season 1 and Season 2 maps
- Many free updates planned, 2 paid expansions planned, and Season 3 all but confirmed!
- Return of the Briefcase!
- IOI is very active in listening to the community and responding positively to criticism. Awesome developer!

Cons:
- Nearly 1/2 of all unlocks are re-skinned Season 1 items... Good for new players, but they could have put more work in to give returning players something with at least new models or assets... I'm certain the publisher swap is behind this, but it is still my biggest and only real complaint.
- Unlocks reset for returning players. Not a huge deal, but I'm really missing my suit collection.
- Some items will still be locked behind timed challenges. It's disappointing to miss something cool because you're out of town, etc. then never have the chance to play/unlock it.
- Game is always online and features heavy DRM.

Overall:
- Never heard of this series? If you like puzzle solving games with some action and a focus on replayability, this game is for you. It is a slower paced game that often punishes violent approaches.
- If you're new to Hitman and into the premise, this game is going to have a massive amount of content by the end of it's life. If you haven't played Hitman 2016 (Season 1), then get this version and the Legacy Pack, it supersedes the previous game.
- If you're a fan of the series, this is the best one yet. 

~~~

Despite their split with Square Enix since Season 1 of Hitman, they have come back true to their vision. IOI has created a platform to maintain a growing Hitman game. In some ways Hitman2 is a massive expansion for the previous game (and is likely standalone simply because of their change of publishers), but the new content amounts to a full game itself. Taking it in context with the levels from the last game it is quickly becoming a massive experience. 

IOI has also been kind enough to offer the game's Prologue up as a free demo.

Anyone with a copy of Hitman 2016 on Steam will get a remastered pack containing essentially the entire first game for free. This Legacy Pack is also available to those who would like to get it independently. In fact, you can download the free Prologue demo and add the Legacy Pack to it without having to buy Hitman2, getting a remastered Season 1 experience for less than the price of the previous game.

New to Hitman? This is the place to start. 
The game updates frequently with new content and levels, IOI has two more full maps planned to launch, and Season 3 is all but confirmed at this point. If you have any interest in puzzle gameplay with very dark humor, this game is for you.

Played Hitman 2016 and wondering what's changed?
There are many new items, most key of which are flashbangs, a tranquilizer gun, and the triumphant return of the briefcase - which gives new life to the Season 1 maps as well. The new maps are even higher quality than the last season IMO, and the graphics have been refined. There's some room for optimization still, and I'll admit I'm somewhat disappointed that a number of unlocks are just re-skinned items from Season 1. I understand why they have done this, given that players should not miss basic things simply for not owning the Legacy Pack, but I think that a better solution than obvious re-skins could have been adopted.

You have quite literally dozens upon dozens of methods of elimating each and every target on every map.

And as if that wasn't enough, IO Interactive have really nailed level design outside of just killing. Searching for clues and even protecting targets are now critical parts of the gameplay and once you experience it you just dont know how it wasn't a thing before.

its sad. you can see the cutbacks in the story telling and cut scenes. the brand i fear is drawing to a close. 
that is its biggest fault.

i heard there are more updates due more missions etc. and the pvp is beta mode still apparently.

""hey the gig is here can you please stop walking around my hou-- BLLARRGG""

The only negative I can say is when you have a weapon that matches the uniform, 47 doesn't holster the weapon but hides it while the holster is empty. If 47 is using the correct weapon the gun should go in the holster.

73,45804568,english,"So, [b]HITMAN 2[/b], ladies and gentlemen. To be honest, when they have announced the previous one, I wasn't really excited. Just because I can't stand the reboots and, let's be honest, those are rarely good. But you know what? Miracles do happen and not only [b]IO Interactive[/b] made a good game, they've made one of the very best games in the series. Instead of forcing us to follow a certain route, the original [b]HITMAN[/b] gave us a lot of freedom in every single mission. From our way to the target to the way we approach it, [b]HITMAN[/b] allowed us to choose everything. And boy, oh boy, there was [i]a lot[/i] to choose from. Unfortunately, there was that certain a-hole, who though “[i]Hey! Let's split the campaign into the episodes and sell them separately![/i]”. No idea who it was, but that's exactly who ruined the first [b]HITMAN[/b] and doomed it to fail. Don't get me wrong, it was still a great game, it's just it didn't feel as good as it was supposed to and didn't sell well either. So, after all that disaster (which almost sank the [b]IOI[/b] BTW), it was decided to make sequel a real deal. That's right, guys, we've finally got it. A game that comes with both the original [b]HITMAN[/b] mechanics and proper single player experience. Or did we? Let's see.

The [b]HITMAN 2[/b] begins with the new mission that feels a lot like a tutorial, or an introduction to the story of sorts. Remember, the previous game ended with cliffhanger, so, it's only logical. That new mission looks pretty cool, but it's also laughably short (only a few minutes long) and can't really be considered a real deal. It's just that – a way to remember the story and controls. After that, you'll be able to choose. You'll be able to re-play the entire campaign of the original [b]HITMAN[/b] with [b]Patient Zero[/b] expansion, or start with the sequel. Yep, you've got it right. The sequel comes with the full version of the original game. And if you begin to feel suspicious at this point, you're absolutely right. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] isn't really a sequel. It's... an expansion pack. Aside from that short introduction, there's only five new missions and the new story still ends with a cliffhanger. There won't even be much of it, especially since [b]IO Interactive[/b] didn't change the way of telling the story at all. If you expected the new business model to change something in the game, you were wrong. It's exactly the same mission → cutscene, mission → cutscene thing, while cutscenes are even more dull this time. In missions? There's pretty much nothing. Only you and your goals. Don't expect much surprises, or story-related stuff. The only good thing I can say about the story is the fact that we've finally got a proper backstory for [b]Diana[/b]. Which is a really good thing since in the original game she felt [i]really[/i] shallow. Everything else, unfortunately, is just a bunch of broken expectations. [b]HITMAN 2[/b]'s story is just a bunch of the old cliché. Secret society, [b]KGB[/b], [b]USSR[/b] experiments and a group of “revengers”. You know, our usual generic cheesy stuff.

Thankfully, there's a gameplay to make us all feel better. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] gives us everything that made the original game so cool and awesome. A lot of freedom, a lot of choices. It's all here. The problem with all that, though, (as you've probably already guessed) is the fact that it feels a lot like more of the same. That's right. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] doesn't even feel like [b]HITMAN 2[/b]. It feels like five... new... missions. And a short intro. I'm not kidding. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] is exactly how the original game's DLC was supposed to be. Remember DLC to the original [b]HITMAN[/b]? Both [b]Patient Zero[/b] and [b]The Sarajevo Six[/b] ([b]PlayStation 4[/b] exclusive DLC) were the same exact maps, only with slightly different goals. As the result, both felt a lot like re-playing the original game. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] is pretty much that – long-awaited five new maps. Sold as a new game. For the full price. Do you feel robbed now? 'Cause I sure do.

It's not [i]that[/i] bad, though. Because again, developers did their best to provide us an exciting experience. And when it's about [b]HITMAN 2[/b], there are two things to make us feel good. First – taking the alternative paths will feel good like never before. Actually, every path you'll take will feel like some small side-story. There'll be some exclusive dialogues, there'll be some exclusive cutscenes and other awesome stuff for every single major path. And, of course, you'll be completely free to do anything you want on the way. No so-called “story rails”, no, sir. The new markers will be there to assist you with such “sub-stories” and you can actually re-play the original [b]HITMAN[/b] campaign with them. Which will make the game more user-friendly and more intuitive without ruining the exploration, but again, you can clearly see that [b]IOI[/b] just keeps developing their game on go. The guys didn't even fix the disaster called “[b]The Elusive Targets[/b]”. The missions with no option to save the game, which, if failed, can't be replayed. Everybody hated them. [i]Everybody[/i]. And those were [i]so[/i] easy to fix. But guess what? [b]IOI[/b] just made it worse by making [b]Sean Bean[/b] the first target. I mean, sure, the winter is coming and the guy dies in, like, every movie, which makes all this kind of funny, but [i]come on![/i] Think about it! Everybody will want to kill him. And with all that “no second chance” crap... yeah... the winter is coming with a lot of hate. And, like I said, it was really easy to fix. Just let people learn some sort of special points on regular missions and waste them to buy second chances on the [b]Elusive Targets[/b]. Like, you know... let people compensate lack of skill with a lot of patience. But no, we've got the old crap all over again... But enough about that, I'm trying to talk about the good things here.

Another good thing here is, of course, so-called [b]Ghost Mode[/b]. Ladies and gents, finally, [b]HITMAN[/b] is always online for the reason. And that reason is... [i]there's a freakin' multiplayer now![/i] And guess what? It's awesome. Absolutely, completely, awesome. If you're at least as old as the old geezer here, you probably remember the game called [b]Spy vs. Spy[/b]. A [b]1984[/b] split-screen videogame by the [b]First Star Software[/b], based on comic strip of the same name. In that game players controlled two spies. One of which was black and another one was white (no racist jokes, please). The goal was to collect some items to your briefcase and escape to the airport before your opponent will do the same. The [b]Ghost Mode[/b] in [b]HITMAN 2[/b] feels [i]a lot[/i] like that. There'll be a set of randomly selected targets and you'll race your opponent to them, without actually getting on each other's way. It'll feel a lot like split screen... on the same screen. Kind of hard to explain, but long story short, it has that awesome [b]Spy vs. Spy[/b] feeling and I'll tell you what, the [b]Ghost Mode[/b] has [i]a lot[/i] of potential. Even if you won't want to re-play the main game for the alternative routes right away, [b]Ghost Mode[/b] will be there to save the day. It's absolutely awesome.

So, what's the conclusion here? The conclusion here, unfortunately, is that we've got robbed again. After all those re-releases of the original [b]HITMAN[/b] (“The Complete First Season”, “Game of the Year”, “Definitive Edition”), each of which offered more and more extra DLC, we've got [b]HITMAN 2[/b]. Which, is pretty much a four hours long [b]DLC[/b] to the same exact game. [i]But[/i]. It's a good DLC. [i]Very[/i] good DLC. And if you enjoyed the original game as much as I did, you should totally look for it. It'll give you a lot of good time.

Cons:
-no weapon customization like in blood money
-repeat unlocks with a nice pink 2 added onto it :(

Overall:
This game is part of a genre that is slowly dying since I am a huge stealth fan.  I see many of these games as hidden gems and seeing that this game came out around red dead 2, black ops 4, bf5, etc.  I hope that this game sells well enough for WB and IO because this game truly deserves the $60 it costs.  If you are on the fence, try out a demo or maybe the first hitman demo and see if you like the style.

89,45802979,english,"I am an old fan of this series of games, I own them all and have enjoyed them all - it's a good recipe, but a one item menu is leaving me hungry for what I paid for which was something improved upon and wider reaching. Having finished the campaign, along with the revamped previous content, I need to thumbs down this game. It just does not deliver in so many ways and feels like a DLC addition at best. We learn nothing really new on 47 as the story meanders through a muck of secret societies that even a conspiracy nut would snore through. The game feels older than 47 and the interface has too many issues to have been released as is. Sniper mode is a joke with a buggy interface that showcases just how rushed this game was to meet release dates. The contract mode is tacked on and adds nothing new, I haven't tried the Ghost mode, but am not expecting much given the current state of this game. Rather than put my feelings into paragraphs, I am going to list my pros and cons below.

PROS

- The graphics are defintinely improved with some impressive and well though out locales, but its nothing you wouldn't expect in 2018. There were games made a decade ago which look better, but its nothing that takes away from the game ultimately.

- Its Hitman, same old game with few new angles, but its a good recipe so why mess with it? See below...

- The addition of Enforcers who will recognize you no matter what was inventive and needed as the game is far too easy.

- There is a consistent sense of dark humor to the game that just plain works without interfering with the seriousness 47 deals in.

- The Mumbai map is superbly done and probably my favorite mission map to date.

- Some of the kill events are hysterical and worth playing through missions multiple times to get that exact timing.


CONS

- The game relies on cut scenes and cinematics to tell the story of 47 in further detail, but I honestly cannot remember a worse story line. The cut scenes are so poorly done you lose interest in the supposed reveals about 47's past and you need to go through two every time you complete a mission. The cinematics are like anime stills with some moving parts like rain in the background, but it feels more like developer laziness than an artistic choice and they break apart the already loose tale told here.

- With only six playable campaign missions the game lacks content to say the least, maps are reused in the other modes which would have been fine if there were more.

- You cannot load a save game without beginning a mission from the start if you are opening the game mid mission. To quit you need to go into the menu and go to options and there is no map key, so many clicks to do anything in the menu leaves you sighing every time you hit F1.

- Most maps have three targets which is fine, but the story's manner of trying to make sense of that is clumsy and was clearly done to make the game longer, with only six maps, what else could they do?

- The inventory interface is just plain garbage, with a rotary interface getting to anything quickly is encumbered by the mostly useless things you can actually interact with in game. The map interface is garbage as well, marking points does not work and objectives don't register sometimes.

- The game suggests you play the original missions and then directs you to buy that from the Steam store, for the price, this should have been included. Without that content you will progress through character levels very slowly and be done with the campaign in less than twelve hours.

- Levelling offers more places to drop useless gear, more uselss gear choices and starting points so don't worry too much about it as the game is already insanely easy even with every help option turned off.

- Agent 47's controls feel unwieldy and he moves more like a geriatric than the world's most feared assasin. Climbing in particular is done very poorly. When running full speed he is barely at a jog and when walking slowly he will still overcome NPCs walking, making walking slowly useless.

- The equipment you are offered is sparse, with few weapons and reskins that don't change anything other than cosmetics, gadgets are also done poorly and are rarely used. Your default always includes coins and when anything can be thrown as a distraction - this makes zero sense.

- AI is ridiculous, you can drop someone two seconds after they were talking with someone, put their disguise on and go back and not be noticed most of the time, apparanlty 47's voice isn't somethinbg anyone would notice...

- The penalty for taking out non targets is steep enough to make 1/4 of the equipment on offer pretty much useless. There are no maps where it is guns free nor any mission where you can snipe until you reach a level where you have already played all the maps twice or more.

- The voice acting is fine for the most part, but 47 sounds off to me, the primary ""bad guy"" sounds ridiculous and the actor goes off accent sometimes which is very jarring to the story.

- 47 does not look right to me in-game, but its a small miss, the bigger miss is he looks different in the cut scenes and at mission end screens. Three 47s for the price of one, at least they didn't skimp on that.

- Bugs: 1) certain disguises disappear when changed out of over time, 2) In the very first mission the target will clip into the bed they sleep in when killed making it impossible to hide the body, 3) Certain conversations will overlap and sometimes story missions will not prompt even after listening to the whole dialogue, 4) Apples? There are apples in the game which glow - indicating you can pick them up - you cannot, 5) Map bugs sometimes on objectives and does not show them. 6) Certain events that surround targets will sometimes bug out like a phone call that will make them move on a different path having no audio and the target will stay still indefinitely. 5) If you drop your briefcase to do something like knock some fool out it may disappear and no not because someone picked it up.

Ultimately the game is plagued with poor design choices and an interface that hinders enjoyment and certainly destroys any immersion, hoever, it was enjoyable to see 47 back at what he does. If you are a huge fan of the series and the above does not put you off go for it, otheriwse revisit the older games.

And I am not exactly sure what I really expected...

First, let me point out that this is a game well done.
BUT (and oh is that a big one), it feels so... weak.

You can finish the entire story arc in about 2 hours if you are a little bit experienced with the latest two Hitman games.
like... there is NOTHING to actually occupy you.
The levels are designed very well but the approach is always the same.
Ontop of that, you have to replay Levels multiple times, not only to gain Mastery on that level which grant access to new starting locations or stashes/hideouts. No your HITMAN level has to increase in order for you to gain access to the BASIC EQUIPMENT.
Lockpick, Sedative, Poison, weapons (not even important because you never ever need AR or PG, even SG is barely of any use as it is nonsurpressed/muffled), all these you have to acquire, and let me tell you, some of them take you alot of time.
The game is designed to occupy you by throwing so called ""mission stories"" at you, which are nothing else but different ways to accomplish your goal: eliminating your targets. So absically, you have to play some of the missions (there are six) dozens of times, because of the different methods of killing.
A total lackluster of depth.
Sadly.
Also, the game has seemed to have made it a bad habit of reusing alot of Square Enyxes HITMAN(tm) animations.
Literally taken 1:1
Fun fact: in Hitman: Bloodmoney, when you retrieved your sniper from your suitcase where it was hidden to carry around, there was actually an animation of 47 reassambling it. Body, Barrel, Scope, were taken out separately and individually attached to reassamble your SR. Now 47 does a stupid animaiton while holding the fully assembled gun in his hands.
Some of the achievements can not be achieved, because the devs failed a few (it's rare but none the less frustrating) mechanical options in the worlds design (shoving people into pools for example is not possible in certain levels, because devs forgot to add the location interaction).

The game itself is quite fun once you get the hang of it but it ends too early.

What bothers me more is, that with the Legacy Upgrade they promised reworked levels but literally 95% of everything is exactly as it was before, they only changed a very few rare enviromental situations, for the new AI and different interactions to not create bugs.
So, yeah nothing was changed except what had to be changed for the new mechanics.

60 bucks for 2 hours of real game play and everything else being achievement hunting and grinding, thats... with all due respect, not worth.
But if you are like me a fan of the HITMAN series (please, please, please fucking remake Bloodmoney already with mondern day mechanics and grafics but keep the gameplay the same, maybe few new missions) it sort of still is a musthave.

1,45802349,english,"Read the conclusion if you don’t care about the specifics of the improvements and differences between 2016 and this game as well as my thoughts on these. This is bit of a long one, so I understand :).

A good improvement on the beloved 2016 formula of sprawling open levels with a huge amount of ways to accomplish your goals. Remasters of 2016 levels with the improvements of this game are a welcomed addition that I’m sure most will enjoy, making it free for 2016 owners was for sure the best way to go about it. 

With the return of the briefcase many new ways to accomplish your goals have been introduced and I’m sure the most creative among us will come up with crazy new strategies using it. The physics are hilarious with slow heat seeking travel after being thrown but most other aspects of the game work nicely so far. 

The new missions are great with interesting settings and design as well as a huge amount of NPC interactions. Special shout-out to the Whittleton Creek map which is very similar in design and gameplay to ‘A New Life’ from Blood Money, got to say it’s quite a hoot to explore and play. The replacement of the opportunity system from 2016 with the mission stories is an interesting change that encourages you to complete each one to discover new characters and locations.

A quick note on the maps:
Unlike 2016 not all the maps have a maximum mastery level of 20. This is mostly due to the size of the map or its purpose, for example the 'tutorial' map has a maximum mastery level of 5. Each map also has interesting challenges as always that provide a large amount of replay ability.

A quick rundown of the major added mechanics follows so you can skip this if you want. 
- Stalking zones and crowd blending:
   - Similar to the system in Horizon Zero Dawn (grass) or the Assassins Creed games (crowd) when crouching and moving through tall grass or walking through crowds you are concealed from sight up to a very small range. Good iteration as it allows hidden access points to locations and sneaky ways around guards.

- Briefcase:
   - Same as blood money, can be chosen from the loadout to replace a piece of equipment. Any items or weapons can be concealed within, the same way the agency pickups work. A quick note on those too, smuggled items now appear in briefcases too.

- New Items:
   - Near self-explanatory. New items such as proximity concussion mines, tazer mines, micro explosives, tranquilizer gun and more.

- Mirrors:
   - Mirrors are functional now and NPCs will notice you sneaking up behind them before you attack them, most can be avoided by crouching however.

- Sniper Assassin:
   - New single or multiplayer game mode similar to the pre order bonus from Absolution. Has its own progression system as well as challenges to complete. Pretty good. Will have new maps added with each expansion.

- Ghost Mode:
   - Multiplayer head to head assassination, has invitation-based lobbies to vs a friend or matchmaking to vs a random player. Based around assassinating a person more quickly and quietly then your opponent. Seems pretty good

Finally, a quick rundown on the unlocks and difficulty levels:

Mostly very similar to that of 2016 except in a mk II variant with slight visual differences such as an embedded 2 in the grip of weapons. Season 1 professional unlocks are unlocked through the same mastery level instead of 2 separate one. Some unlocks are missing due to this process as well as them being in the new maps.
Three difficulty levels instead of the previous 2 in 2016 provides a difference in gameplay as well, as some challenges can only be completed on certain difficulty levels. Changes between difficulty levels include changes in guard’s perceptiveness, reaction time, brutality and effectiveness. The ‘master’ mode is this games equivalent to pro mode from 2016 but misses some features, most noticeably the lack of investigation of broken cameras. So even at its hardest it should be slightly easier then 2016, which should not be taken as a bad thing. Just depends on personal preference.

[b] In conclusion, if you enjoyed Hitman (2016) and want more of the same with some gameplay improvements and additional game modes, would recommend. If you wanted the big next step up from Hitman 2016 this may not be for you. As some have said before, its hitman season 2 not an entirely new game but to me this is okay as this is what this has always been and what it set out to achieve. [/b]

19,45800761,english,"While the phrase ""more of the same"" can definitely be applied to Hitman 2, that is not at all a slight against this game. Following up the stellar Hitman (2016) release, Hitman 2 continues to provide rich sandboxes filled with endlessly replayable missions that allow the player to approach each kill with as much freedom as any one game could possibly provide. While the central story is again a bit lackluster, the smaller stories that can be uncovered within the levels tend to be more meaningful and interesting if the player has the patience and knowhow to uncover them. 

While most of Hitman 2 is very familiar to those who have played the previous title, there are some smaller, quality of life improvements that can be found here, such as the ability to blend into a crowd, working mirrors, picture in picture events, and best of all: the briefcase. Hitman 2 also boasts five of the best levels the series has to offer, as well as a smaller, but well done opening mission. Those who were enamored with Hitman (2016)'s Sapienza should find plenty to love here. Also worth note is that for players who own the previous title, all of the 2016 game's levels have been imported into Hitman 2, where they can be played again with the new features Hitman 2 has to offer. Contracts mode also makes a welcome return, as well as multiplayer features such as Ghost Mode and Sniper Assassin mode. Elusive Targets also make a welcome return in the weeks following release, a feature that I personally enjoyed very much the first time around. There certainly is no shortage of content here for those who find enjoyment uncovering each corner of Hitman 2's expansive sandboxes. 

Overall, the gameplay is phenomenal, the replayability is unmatched, and the sandbox's are deeper than almost anything else out there. Negatives include a short, almost inconsequential story and some forced online features that can stymie player progression.

It improves everything from Hitman 1 – Escalations are shorter, better locations, the briefcase is back.

Ghost mode is a lot of fun, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this is the groundwork for Hitman Co-Op in the future. Can’t wait for more map support in Ghost Mode.

It’s just Hitman and it’s better than ever. No episodic stuff, just the full package.

The only flaws I can think of in the game are the following:
-	Some legacy maps have slight bugs. Colorado was the only one I noticed though.
-	CGI Cutscenes are gone – I assume this is due to the Io/Square Enix split though. Story is still fine, it’s just in comparison to the first game you realise how good they were.
-	Infinite Loading Screen bug occasionally (I’m sure this will be patched out though, will edit this review when it does)

I wanted more maps to the Hitman 2016 and I get what I exactly wanted. I loved all the maps. A bigger version of ""A New Life"" from Blood Money is here too!

A huge sandbox assassination game that follows exactly the previous game. Don't expect something new, they just added some basic things like a briefcase (which you can carry anything you want sniper rifles, pistols etc.) and mirrors that actually works like mirrors.

This is a short game in my opinion, yet I have not perfected every level, and that will add time for sure. I also have a lot to explore on every level, as I quite enjoy messing around and trying to do challenges. 

If you are a fan of Hitman games, all in all, I definitely recommend this game. BUT, not if you decide to just purchase the second game without the Legacy levels (levels from the first game). It feels like a rushed game, with storyboard cutscenes and a short campaign if you don't complete every mission story. These mission stories are very important, I recommend you complete every one before continuing to the next level because that's what I did and I wish I didn't. 

If you crave more Hitman, this is an A+ game. However, be aware that this is not worth just the Hitman 2 campaign. You are better off spending more than necessary for every campaign plus the Expansions, so wait for a sale. Maybe try the original HITMAN first before deciding on this.

Sure it has some glitches but nothing is gamebreaking. The game just came out, it will have patches (alongside more content).

If you think six map isn't enough, that you're going to finish the game in 10 hours, that you want to run&shoot the targets with a shotgun, maybe you should take something else. Of course, each map can be done as loudly as you want, but hitman is about planing and being stealthy. More than that, it's about replaying the levels, trying to find what you've missed, unlocking secret entrances, killing your targets in more ways than you ever thought of.

I have more than 30h for now and I still have opportunities to take, stuff to discover and levels to finish. I did not even tried the multiplayer gamemodes yet! (I have more than 220h in Hitman 2016.) There will be more missions, more locations in the future and if you already owned hitman 2016, you get the levels of the first game for free remastered!

Each location is huge, and it's not huge just to be huge. Each place, room, street, house have a purpose.

It's fun. There's a lot to do. If you're a casual gamer trying to rush the game with assault rifles, you'll be very disappointed. There are gunfights if you mess up, but this is not the core nor the purpose of the game.

It might sound repetitive for some people to hear ""the fun in the game is to replay the levels"" but I assure you that it is NOT repetitive at all.

51,45799004,english,"So I pre-ordered the gold edition for the early access because I enjoy the Hitman games. What hit me right away is that this is more or less the previous game in new locations with new targets. (And a new story... if you actually play Hitman games for the story lol) I ended up refunding it and waiting for release to just buy the base game on release instead since I decided that I didn't really feel like what I received for $100 was worth it in the long run.

The maps are bigger, and theres a ton of challenges to complete on each mission so theres a lot of replayability. I haven't really played enough to see any crazy new mechanics but I mean it's Hitman. It's a great game to dick around in.

However, one complaint I have is why in gods name would you re-use the SAME tutorial missions from your previous game? In my opinion those tutorial missions are the most grueling missions out of them all. I just wanted a refresher course on the game and then realized I was going to be doing the same shit I did when I played the first Hitman. I'm not a CRAZY completionist but I do like to complete all of the missions in a game to consider it ""beaten"" So I was kinda stuck with finishing the same tutorial from the first games demo and its main game. Too much work to muster up a new tutorial for a new game I guess? I'm not sure. You CAN skip it however, it just bothered me that they didn't put that effort in.

All in all it's your typical Hitman game. It's not by any means bad - it's just more or less the same stuff in different locations. If you're a fan of the series and enjoy games of this nature then this is a great game to get that gameplay. 60 dollars might be pushing it as far as price goes but in the long run the Hitman games provide me a lot of fun when I'm bored so I can deal with the price.",1542133279,1542133475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198057097038,402,99,1460,37,333,1601688369

The gameplay is pretty much the same as Hitman 2016 but with some minor needed changes like being able to hide in bushes and blending in crowds is a welcoming addition. 

The levels are great but they leave me wanting more with there only being ""5"" missions I'm not including New Zealand because it's a tutorial level. The levels do have alot of replayability and if you owned Hitman 2016 you do get the previous levels which does add more meat to the game. Miami and Whittleton Creek are some of the best levels I've played in a Hitman game ever you'll see why once you play them.

They've done a great job fleshing out Agent 47 seeing him actively engage in conversations with other npcs is absolutely hilarious especially when it's your target.

Plenty of voice acting and funny npc dialogs that creates an immersive world.
The gun sounds have been greatly improved, they sound amazing now. You can now carry a briefcase to carry and hide your large weapons.
You can also now carry 2 large weapons, one in the back and one in the hand. 
There's also a variety of new guns, namely tranquilizer gun, a silenced UZI (which you can hide by holstering it) amongst others.

All the missions from Season 1 (Hitman 2016) have been made available as the Legacy Pack and integrated into the game, allowing the player
to use equipment from Hitman 2 in Season 1, and viceversa. The Season 1 maps also were slightly improved graphically.
As such, there's no reason to play Hitman 2016 anymore, if you have Hitman 2 and the Legacy Pack you can simply play all content via Hitman 2.

So if you never played Hitman or don't own the previous game (Hitman 2016), you don't need to get it, just get Hitman 2 and the Legacy Pack.

The game will also be receiving at the very least 2 expansions (DLC), which will include new locations, missions, outfits and weapons.

The story is also quite interesting. I enjoyed it and i'm eager to learn more about this world.
The music is also great, it adds tension and excitement to the levels at the exact times something important is happening.

It's an excellent Hitman game, in my opinion one of the best if not the best, a substantial improvement from the previous game.

An absolutely amazing sequel to 2016's HITMAN. Fans of the series where at one point unsure we'd even see a second season, thank all that is right with the world that we did.

The game features 6 incredibly beautiful and vast landscapes in which 47 can complete his assigned tasks. Similar to the previous title, although I can safely say these levels are much more wide-scale and have a much stronger open world presence.

While giant beautiful maps where to be expected, I found one of them (apologies for forgetting the name) to be very similar to Hitman: Blood Money's A New Life. As pictured below:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1564131760

This had me overly ecstatic upon starting the mission, IO Interactive really know what their core fan base expect and they deliver every time in my opinion.

There's also new weapons and equipment, I won't go too into it as some of them are overly bizarre but I'm sure Hitman fans will be happy to know, the coveted briefcase has returned and can be used from the very first starting point in the game. This was a big issue within the community concerning 2016's HITMAN and I'm glad to see it's been rectified here. Not to mention, you can go back and enjoy Season 1 via HITMAN 2 with the briefcase!

I've not had one single issue with connectivity, I've seen a few glitchy engine errors which are pretty much unavoidable and nowhere near game breaking. They're actually more humorous than anything.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1564131888

If I have to name one bad thing about this game, which believe me, is a difficult task. It's that you still can't turn off taps that you've turned on! Again, not a huge issue but it's something that always bugged me.

Also, just a word of warning regarding PC specs. I ran this on an i3/960 combo and it struggled greatly. Although now that I've switched to an i5/1080 combo, I've not experienced a single hitch, it runs like a dream.
