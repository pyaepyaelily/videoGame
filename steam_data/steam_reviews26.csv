2017-05-27,0,0,493,True,Recommended,"87 hours so far in 2 weeks.Firstly I can't reccomend this game enough It stands out in its genre because in all honestly You have as muhc of a chance at winning as a fresh starter as you do having sunk 80 something hours into it.The game works remarkably well. Its not perfect and Crashes are somewhat commen (most are memory related) but its not enough to deter me Nor any of the people I have reccomended it too.The pre game lobby and the All chat are honestly 2 of the most hysterical things I have ever hear.Pregame lobby can either be ""normal"" or turn into a miniture rave with such artists as ""Backstreet Boys"" and ""that one guy who shredded on a guitar enough to have an encore demanded""Allchat is worth it to hear someone scream in panic whilst hiding in a bathroom because They saw you coming.I've laughed enough in this game to make my sides hurt and I've only got a handful of wins.It's better with freinds You might not survive longer but its well worth the money Edit november 2018 The playerbase has dropped It's still fun but the ""fix PUBG"" campaign has been a mixed success.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,228,False,Recommended,"To begin with my specs I5 4690 3.5ghzGeforce GTX 960 2GB8GB DDR35400rpm HDDAfter initially loading into a lobby I instantly noticed framerate issues sound and player model lag. PUBG recommended I put my graphics towards the medium/low end of the spectrum which is fair as my computer specs lean towards the minimum side of things. Instantly when all the players were loaded into the plane the framerate dropped below 30. My game froze for a solid 15 seconds before I realised I had ejected out of the plane and was plummeting towards the Earth. When I landed my game continued to freeze as the textures loaded from potato quality to the actual quality I expected. A very disappointing result which was further backed up by continuous frame drops and even the game crashed when I attempted to open my inventory. Fast forward three games I still had the same issues of textures not loading and continuous framerate drops.It is important to understand that this game is poorly optimised for low end PC's. A game should not freeze for + 2 minutes while waiting for textures to load while constantly getting ""Network lag"". Pretty poor performance and very annoyed but an enjoyable game when it decides to work. Aside from my technical issues the gameplay itself is sound. I thoroughly enjoyed one game making it to top 10 when I got two tapped with a pistol outside of the zone and died by the gas. While there were a variety of guns and various items I certainly noticed a lack of attachments for weapons. This is probably just my bad luck ha ha ha (It cost me a game). Regardless of my issues PUBG is a very exciting and thrilling game well worth the full price of 30USD. 22/10/18still a buggy and poorly optimized game. kinda fun lol",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-24,0,0,537,True,Recommended,"Extremely good game in many many interesting ways. The core concept is simply clever and addictive but it's the implementation of that concept (survival/Running Man/Hunger Games/Deathmatching) that really does the trick. The game's use of a closing circle of death that kicks in after a set amount of time on a regular basis growing smaller and smaller which kills anything outside of it over time is ingenious. It drives player movement and prevents camping (I'm not against camping per se as it can make a lot of sense to sit tight in a shooter) but this helps prevent someone from holing up and never moving. This ""Death circle"" creates many interesting decision points and all the greatest of games know how to create these. Another keen game design aspect is the initial player drop from the C 130 plane choosing where to go can make a life or death difference.Mix in the looting aspects with tight shooting and moving controls and you have the components for a very fun type of game. Add in Supply Crate drops (that generate even more decision making and which also helps to drive player movement) along with localized random bomb raids that force players inside for periods of time and you have a simple game concept made FAR more interesting due to the myriad of choices available to players.Do you loot a bit longer gambling that you'll be able to make it inside the closing death circle? Or do you rush your way towards where you think the game's final circles might be in order to be set up and get ready ahead of time? Considering that the final circles close in concentrically yet somewhat randomly in a region no one can be too sure where they should try to end up.It's a one life style of game where if you die you have to jump back into a new game BUT because you can quickly do so it's not really frustrating. My (and other players I game with) main complaint is simply that the damage modeling in terms of TTK (Time to Kill) is somewhat wimpy feeling at times. The classic headshot is always heavy hitting but if you miss that you can sometimes run into a situation where you're seeing blood spray and know you've hit someone multiple times only for them to (against all odds) survive somehow.Overall performance isn't perfect (yet) as the game is still in Early Access but the designers are clearly plugging away with regular and appreciated abandon to patch bugs balance things out and even add tweaks and such. My final thoughts are that this is already an amazing game and it's only in Early Access. I give it a very very high recommendation. )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you are constantly rushing enemies you put yourself in the position to have a very high risk for a high reward type situation you have a higher chance of getting that chicken dinner but at a higher cost/risk. If you camp in a sh*t shack the whole game then you probably wont have the highest probability of bringing home that chicken dinner but you still have that chance as long as you play it smart.

2017-10-25,0,0,72,False,Not Recommended,Could be good. Isn't. Player movement is like a robot ice skating simulator. FPS mechanics (aim shoot peak etc) are all very poorly executed. Feels like a game from the 90's. This may well be the best battle royale game out there. Still doesn't mean it's a good game. On top of everything else they still haven't done anything about the cheaters. Gotta luv getting one tapped by a dude with a pistol while alone inside a room with the door closed and no windows..... Just played a round where I had full health a fresh lvl 3 helmet and had just taken 2 energy drinks. Got into a sniper battle with another player we both had Kar98's. I shoot him right in the face (lvl 2 helmet) he doesn't die. He shoots me in the head (lvl 3 helmet no damage) I die instantly. this game.If you haven't bought this game yet don't. Wait until Bluehole shows that they can deal with the cheaters and make the game run halfway decently before you give them any money.Update (Jun18) Been playing the war game event mode. Closest thing to fun I've had with this game. Still utter crap combat though. Just walked up behind a dude and gave him both barrels of my sawed off right in center of mass. Not only did he not die he had time to fire his K98 switch to his 1911 and empty the clip at me then switch to melee and one punch me to death all before I could reload the TWO ing shells in the sawed off...... I'm done. Probably for good. Only thing that would bring me back would be a total overhaul of the combat and movement mechanics not bloody likely.Update (Jan 2019) Got bored and tried PUBG again. New maps new weapons a crap tonne of cosmetics but the same old terrible gameplay. Why are so many people still playing this???? I'm done. RIP PUBG uninstalled Jan 15 2019.

2017-05-02,0,0,981,True,Recommended,"TL DR (When this Game First Came out it was great. These guys turned it into FORTNITE with it s MicroTrans).This game is great for you if you wanna deck out your avatar like fortnite and CSGO(Edited) I slightly Recommend this game. This game is (Edited out ""a lot"") of fun. These recent Beta Tester games have left a sour taste in my mouth ie DayZ. *Although ""Squad"" is great.* Quite simply This game (Used to) have similar heart racing combat as DayZ. PlyrUnk allows you to gear up (Sometimes) hastily and (Sometimes) not run around like an imbecile bambi DayZ/Rust. It seems the Devs of PlyrUnk took their time to read and assess gamer's gripes and praise on similar games in this genre. (Then decided to hump the IG Dream of Hoes and Money And Drugs And Sell OUT) PlyrUnk takes into consideration all of the pros/cons of each similar game in this genre and Made this raw 100 player force on force combat game. (To bait OG players into the game and then flush them out with micro transactions) This game has the feel that the developers of this game actually played video games and used that hands on knowledge to put in their work to produce this game. (UNTIL Micro transactions fed their money hungry lifestyles) The following are clever ways to get this game to stand out... 1) I appreciate how clever they implement the sky diving (To pick a spot on map to spawn TO rather than ON) 2) The random artillery Zones to keep goons from loafing around. 3) YOU CAN SPAWN TOGETHERISH WITH FRIENDS TO PLAY AS A UNIT 4) The ever contracting force field To pressure people to engage in combat rather than prop a bolt action out of a 2nd story windowOther considerations.... (Used to) go from nude to loot within seconds of landing. There are SOME vehicles (In their entirety!*) as a form of quick transportation... they're noisey and a good way to attract attention which can be capitalized on Firefighting is smooth and fluid and not sluggish or clunky.

From what I hear however these streamers are able to get anyone banned for ""Stream Sniping"" EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT REPORTED.

2017-04-08,0,0,134,True,Recommended,"EDIT 6/25/2017 I finally won a game and felt like a ing badass doing so! I can quit this game happily now lol. JK it's flipping addicting!REMINDER!!! THIS GAME IS IN EARLY ACCESS! PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is my favorite most addicting battle royale game I have ever played! Pros Combat is fair and balanced IMO . A short learning curve easy to learn (watch YT videos or streamers to get better tips). Very easy to get addicted. Plenty of weapons and vehicles. Team spectating at launch. Can be played very tactically or ""run n gun"" Plenty of players and servers to just hop on whenever you want so low wait time. Feels like a good mix of DayZ H1Z1 KotK and ArmA The devs actually listen to the players and what they want also great feedback from the devs. Plenty of players to kill! Cons A bit buggy Don't forget it's in Beta/Early Access . Sounds are a bit off (devs are working on that). Server and graphic optimization isn't too great (devs are also working on that READ THEIR PATCH NOTES PLEASE! ). Some players are annoying (or quite a bit depending on what players are on your server). In my opinion it's a great game I fully support this dev team and their project. Playing this game has probably given me the most fun I've had in a while with a video game. Even though it is a bit buggy the devs are working on it and IMO I believe they are going to fix as much as they can because they have already done so much already. Please read the patch notes as well it'll give you an insight of what has been going on.I hope everyone has a great day and I'll see you on the BATTLEGROUNDS!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-12,0,0,149,True,Not Recommended,I predict this game will mimic dayz and h1z1 landing somewhere in the middle of having a forever buggy and broken game that is filled to the brim with cosmetics that you can buy or get as part of some event.This developer spends SO much more time deleting negative forum posts and banning people having doubts about the game in an attempt to hide all the t thats going on like horrible servers bad tickrate bad hitdetection and all sorts of other t.If they only spent half that time improving the game or AT LEAST work on improving the game to a state where its not every single game you have horrible lag or desync or hit detection problems before they spread out to other platforms hold competitions or make twitch prime exclusive skins the game would be in a much much better state and it would have a future.This game has been getting worse and worse since closed beta back then it was a great game to play the problems werent as many and it wasnt every game that was tormented by bugs and problems.As of now it seems theyre trying to grab as much money as possible from as many platforms as possible all while postponing every single patch from every single deadline they set themselves.On top of that to cement how badly their PR team are doing their jobs.To find patch notes or upcoming stuff. You need to frequent their website their twitter their forums and the steam forums.Theres not a single one of those places that has all the information their website has blog posts regarding patches but theyre around 3 4 weeks behind at the time of typing this their forums are almost updated but steam forums seem to be up2date atm. On twitter you can get an idea that theyre actually working on stuff if you dont use twitter youre outta luck since they NEVER update anything at all beside the random placed patch notes.This is a game with great potential and everything to lose. Unfortunately the actions of the devs really really tell me that theyre going to drop the game and break it and not have the skills to fix it again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The developers told us a couple of weeks ago that the unreal engine had ddos protection and that due to that 90% of the packets were being dropped causing all the desync and lag issues. They fixed it promptly but then had to roll that patch back due to issues that arose from fixing that. That was about two weeks ago and until it gets fixed I cannot recommend that others buy this game. The dev's have said it will be fixed but until then just hold off.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Running up to everybody and trying to kill them just didn't work and after an hour of game time I was ready to quit. The next game I played I shot a couple of people and hid in a box. Made it to 3rd and I fell in love with the game. This game is something different to H1Z1 and Last Man Standing. This takes strategy and stealth to win (or insane gunplay). Whilst solo is enjoyable. Duos and Squads are better. Playing with your friends can bring you closer or drive you apart. Both have happened so far ). It adds a new level of teamwork. Overall Really enjoyable game and I could play it all day long.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Many reviews for this game were about Hackers and Cheaters (I think thats the same) but I can't confirm it yet. In all this time I haven't seen anything that was too suspicious. Now to the gameplay... I love this game. This is maybe the best game I have in my entire library and every Euro I have spent on this game was worth it. It's fun and addicting and I played it almost every day for a bit because I enjoyed it so much. The best moment was when I opened this pioneer box thing and it gave me a jacket that was worth 16 bucks... so if it goes on like this I will get my money back by selling my clothes in the game.overall rating 9/11 because of the fps drops.. but I'm downloading the patch right now and they promised to fix those performance issues in this patch so maybe I will fix my rating later.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-18,0,0,254,True,Recommended,I bought this game Today 18/06/17 and I already LOVE it it is just such an intense game I love the vibe where you have to be prepared. This game may be in early access and not configured very well but it is still amazing. This game has a few bugs and is hard to run for budget pcs. But after it seems like a really fun game the game was in my mind for a while while I thought whether I should get it or not till one day I said F*** it I asked for it and begged and got it. To get the most out of this game you need to have a squad of people preferably 4 or so on then you have a chance of domination but as a pair me and my friend Siloh tried our best and made it to third before being utterly destroyed. I haven't played this game for 2 hours and I'm writing this review I absolutely love this game it's just brilliant. Hands down the best game of 2017.I further played this gameafter I had resolved my issue with the game and I was welcomed back in I truly love this game in the time I didn't play I had purchased H1Z1 and had tried it out I quite liked it but battlegrounds just seems like a better option. I have a certain thing wrong with certain things that battlegrounds does.Attachments a wide variety of attachments are spread around the map and are quite common but the one of the rarest items n the game is a suppresor for sniper rifles I love how in depth it goes with the attachments such as you can only put an assault rifle suppressor on an assault rifle and little things like that.Variety guns in particular have a wide variety with there being different machine guns different sniper rifles and all sorts wih different rates and spawns you will rarely find some guns and you may have to work hard to get some such as from an airdrop where you can sneak in a bush and snipe or just rush and blow them down.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-14,0,0,488,True,Not Recommended,Game is actually fun and entertaining. Unfortunately as all ES the game as quite a few bugs. Most of all hit/damage registration is completely faulty and inconsistent. Considering that the core of the game is shooting (it's an FPS) I strongly advise to stay away from this game until they fix the current issues.Edit (1) Be very careful with this game. If you of a streamer (who basically fuels and brings immense visibility to the game) you might get banned for stream sniping. It's the very first game where this happens and I strongly suggest you to read between the lines and realize how your privacy and rights might very well be trumpled by Bluehole.Edit(2) DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!

Ultimately just don't buy this game. older review below As fun as this game is (sometimes) you really shouldn't buy this garbage because it isn't a decent game yet. It has so many problems ranging from terrible programing to balancing issues. This is the game where a literal frying pan gives you more protection than military grade armor. This is the game where you might be playing it with no problems while your friend is sitting out in the open unable to move because the game did not render the buildings for him yet.Developers seem to care more about fluff and planning to release their &gt UNFINISHED GAME&lt on other platforms than actually taking care of these problems that have been in the game for months. You shouldn't need 16GB of RAM and a mid/high end graphics card to run a game on low settings without having too many issues how do they expect this game to run on a Xbox?As fun as this is to play with friends most of the time you will be frustrated because the game won't let someone play either because of the issues listed above or because the game just crashes on loading screens sometimes.Wait for the final product.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also kind of annoying you cant rejoin your game eventhough you stay alive meaning your teamate cannot get you stuff as you are still alive and also really irritating you can't split item stacks as its kind of annoying on team versions of the game. Good concept though. You could try and get a bigger dev team and make this game crash less. and im not sending a crash report because it takes forever(my download speed is 40 mb/s)NOT WORTH 27 EITHER as the game isnt even finished think you charge less for an early access game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Considering it is out of early access it should be a lot less buggy and refined than it currently is in fact some of the early versions were better than the mess that this game is right now. Chinese players have invaded servers that should not be for them hackers and lag are prominent in most games and half the time I can't even connect to the servers! I still somewhat enjoy the game when everything works and I'm not getting smashed by asians hackers or players with letters or numbers for names but I find myself wanting to play it far less than ever before.

2018-01-01,0,0,519,False,Recommended,A great game a huge step up in battle royale games which before this one barely interested me. simply becausethe gameplay and amount of fun I've had in this game I would rate this at least an 8/10. However unless you have a high powered computer you may struggle to run this game even on low settings. It's still quite unoptimized and buggy even though the game is now out of alpha which is dissapointing. I would highy recomend this game none the less unless you aren't confident in your pc. Hopefully soon the game will be updated to run better. As for people calling hacks or 'Chinese' hackers I haven't seen any since very early on in the game developement (hackers in general never seen a chinese one) before the official release. I have been playing on EU though so maybe that makes a diffenece.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-16,0,0,23,True,Not Recommended,Truly a great concept mired under many issues. Tried really hard to like the game but overall it leaves you feeling dissapointed. Reminds me alot of payday just a awesome concept that fails to deliver.Love the flight over and drop in via plane instead of randnom spawn great idea! Immersion is AWESOME one of the few games you can almost feel like you are there.Cons 1. Random crashes seem to be about 25% hit rate on reloads or intial spawn good news is it hasn't happened mid game. Running in window mode and mutli tasking seem to make it much worse.2. Performance holy un optmized run about 30 40fps with a 1080TI running on mostly low settings. Geesh. 3. Movement and physics is more like GTA and less like Call of Duty be prepared to get stuck on fences accidental falls. Guns get fully blocked by stupid things like a open fence. Spread and hit register is awful safest bet use a shotgun or uzi and small area. 4. By FAR the number 1 issue de sync and lag switchers/software laggers. Combinaiton of hackers and just buggy net code cause some horrfic deaths at end game. Last 3 or 4 games I made to last 10 I get killed by somone 100% invisible driving a car. No sound or anything then death and car appears all of sudden. Some research looks like the hack community has software lag switches now reminds me of the destiny crap with laggers. 5. Grendades oh sweet hell 100% useless most of the time. Slow impossible to aim and they bounce all over the place. Most cases you end up nuking yourself instead of the baddie.6. The bubble that keeps you moving into circle it kills the immmersion alot. The concept is great the visible bubble barrier is not. Maybe changed to radation or something that doesnt look arcade'y in a game with so much realism.7. No player list spec or kill stats after death you die and its just how many people you killed. After clawing your way to top 10 for 30 mins it feels very unsatisfying to just drop and not know the results. Very least they could tell you how many HP your oppoenet walked away with and a deathcam.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I received it as a gift copy from a friend who has been enjoying this game immensly but whenever I join a server the game freezes within' 8 seconds of getting into the beginning lobby. Windows task manager shows that the game is using upwards of 3k+ MB of memory. This is a huge game breaking crash/memory leak and adding to the pain is the fact that I can't even end the process it requires a whole hard reboot to regain functionality of my computer.I would steer clear of buying this game until the game developers fix some of the harsher problems of that plague it for the time being.

A small revolver tucked in the corner of a attic in a house I clutched the revolver with my hand and pointed it at the attic opening. I was ready. (Narrator Voice) 10 mins later I was watching Youtube cus I got bored of waiting for people to come up. *BANG Gunshots rained around me Playarea shrinking down bodies pileing up. I knew it was time.......... I ran out guns blazing holding on to the only thing keeping me alive...... my dreams (And mostly my revolver) The second I got out the door bullets sprayed towards me and I decided to do the only tactic that would save me Running away screaming ""plz don't kill me"" ""plz don't kill me"" and I survived. I was safe for now. I found a humvee on the way to the Playarea. I was relived and I drove it in circles around the playarea Bullets starting flying everywhere again. I was immune to the bullets. I am GOD. crashes into a tree barely alive I took my limping body to the nearest tree and hid behind it. It left me and him 1v1 I knew I couldn't win him in combat. But I could wait it out. So I harnessed all the power within me my dreams my hopes. I became the tree. I felt as if my legs became roots and arms became branches. I was one with the tree. The only way to win in the Cullin.... I mean PLAYERSUNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND. *dink* I opened my eyes ""OH ....... My only weakness..... grenades Instantly dies and dreams crushed I told my friends about this and they told me to git gud.Final Verdict 10/10 would become a tree again.

2017-04-17,0,0,66,True,Recommended,This recommendation comes with a cautionary statement This game needs a better server infrastucture. If you are playing in Eastern Canada you will almost certainly get one of or some of the following issues hitching bad server side rubberbanding teleporting players and bad hit feedback. If you intend on playing competitively or tend to take these games seriously you might not be in for a good time. I've reached out to Bluehole about possibly fixing or addressing the problems but they haven't gotten back to me and honestly I don't expect them to.That being said when I'm playing with a friend or just have some time to kill to play a fast game and play aggressively/stupid I always seem to find my fun.

2018-08-14,3,1,508,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG also known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a world where you are fighting for you or your party's survival in a last man(s) standing brawl full of explosions and gunplay. Overall the gameplay is smooth(er) but the gunplay and emersion is by far its best qualities. On the other hand there is a blatant slap in the face of the player and a total emersion killer. The exhaust sounds of the vehicles are completly and noticably wrong. There is no way that a car stuck in a post human interaction era could possibly have the sound of a well maintained machine. It seems that there is an abnormal amount of care for an ""abandoned island"" forcing you to question as to if you're truly alone. Random rust and weather (when its in the game) would cause random wear on said exhaust causing different sounds from each vehicle. So spending the better half of a game collecting duplicate vehicles to test the fortitude of the hypothesis SMOOSH my head is ripped apart by a scilenced AWM.Air tire pressure is also under review.Good skydiving sim 102.56/103.45",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-01,0,0,370,True,Recommended,Other than the performance imperfections and untenable gunshot sounds I'm only curious and slightly concerned about how quickly Battlegrounds might age. Although it's a prettier grittier and more deliberate game than King of the Kill those who've already put a ton of time into battle royale might eventually feel like Battlegrounds is a better fitting set of pants. The Early Access offering is shallow a map essentially one mode and the mildly satisfying lure of sick trenchcoats awaiting you in the loot system. It'll be interesting to see if the devs can keep pace with the game's burgeoning community.Overall Battlegrounds' approach to simplifying simulation style systems and mechanics is successful. Many of my gaming friends who bounced off of Arma because they perceived it as too unwieldy are diving in and those who haven't yet have been asking me enthusiastically about whether they should. I'm glad to have a short form gateway game to sell them on the fun of FPS fidelity.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,249,True,Recommended,Great early access game with consistent and constant improvements and great communication from the devs. There is a lot of negative reviews regarding 'micro transactions' and 'crate and key' for cosmetics. You know you don't have to have cosmetics right?Edit since logging in I feel that I should clarify the crate system.There is 3 crates all of which can be 'bought' using in game points which are earned from playing. Only one of these requires a key to open. If you don't want to open the crate you can sell on the steam market. So you can make back some money on this game. It's a shame that the majority of negative reviews are purely reactive to either misinformation or lack of information or on the basis that some people don't like to continue to invest money into a game. And whilst everyone is entitled to an opinion the decision to play a game should not rest solely on an optional feature which has no impact on gameplay.I recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-02,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,Early acces review so things might be fixed already!Player unknown's battlegrounds has in my eyes the potential to become the best battle royale game around but at the moment there are some game breaking glitches. Like I cant even cancel matching which is really annoying when another friend wants to join. Also in game there are game breaking glitches nades getting stuck in a wall which kills us all and there is also no way to control a car mid air. which is really annoying when you suddenly fly into the air for absolutely no reason.Another problem is the lack of content that you are getting for 30 Euro's all that you are getting is a battle royale gamemode I would love to get some more gamemodes soon. My conclusion if you wait a couple weeks the game will probably be fixed in terms of bugs and I would recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-25,0,0,95,True,Recommended,What is Pubg?Pubg is a Third person or first person shooter that is about surviving by collecting loot &amp guns to survive in an 8x8km map. 100 people are spawned in a plane and they can choose when and to jump out. once the player lands they begin collecting loot &amp guns. once you drop you will be vulnerable to all players so you have to loot fast. the game also has a white and blue barrier that closes in. the white barrier is a safe spot where you can not die from being outside the playzone the blue barrier closes in on you and you cannot out run it but you can drive away from it with a vehicle if you are lucky enough to find one. once the barrier gets small enough you will encounter a lot of players and the game will get tense because the worry of dying to the playzone and the worry that a player will shoot you from the back adds up. once it is in the top 5 the circle is basically a death arena and the winner gets a chicken dinner.(yes. you do get a chicken dinner). If you are in a duo or a squad if you lose your first health bar your friend has a limited time to pick you up that is if you dont get killed before you can crawl to your team.Why I like the gameIt's very exhilarating and can bring you and your friends hours of funPubg isn't an easy game to play and will be tough if your starting out but once you learn a few tips and tricks the game gets fun (especially when you are one of the top 10 surviors.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-11,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,Worst game ever. Sometimes you have 130 fps sometimes 50 you don't even know why and how. Loots are terrible I only find a shotgun or a pistol in like 5 houses and this in EVERY game. Movements are bad and this game is only for campers there is no action and it gets boring after 10 minutes without seeing someone. Honestly I don't understand how this game can get more than 2 millions of players maybe they are not enough skilled to kill someone on h1z1 for example where the skill is present and not on this nerd game called PUBG. This is probably my worst purchase of the year sad that I can't refund. 1/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-08,0,0,18,True,Recommended,I do not play FPS or TPS. I don't play shooters at ALL. But a friend at work kept hassling me to play. So I did.MAN am I glad I did. This game has CRAZY good gunplay. The environmental collisions with body/vehicles still need a LOT of work. But even the way it is (clunky for EVERYONE) it's still a very balanced game. I think the range on the guns is too high but I'd imagine balance issues are a daily concern.I've played some 2 and 4 person squads and I've found it's more fun to watch highly skilled players play than to play myself. I'm a noob and often the first to die in the squads but my team mates have pulled off some impressive feats. We've captured TONS of wild video of crazy frying pan miracle firefights. I watch the last player on our squad nearly succumb to the suppression fire of 2 full squads (8 players) and with his trusty frying pan keeping bullets out of his lower back he managed to down TWO ENTIRE SQUADS solo after nearly dying. It was without a doubt the most insane multiplayer experience I've ever witnessed and I've been playing MMO's since the 90's. GET THIS GAME and squad up. Solo play is OK but finding a squad is much more fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,30,True,Not Recommended,While this game has promise I cannot in good conscience recommend it at this time as I do not agree with many of the business decisions the company has made in the past few months. Despite having a smash hit on their hands they have decided to push the eSports scene and introduce microtransactions before the game is fully developed. I am willing to accept an unpolished EA game but not when they are trying to milk every last penny out of the game before putting out something that doesn't play like buggy garbage half the time. It's a major red flag that tells me they might not be all too interested in moving out of the EA phase when the game is selling this well. Similar titles like Fortnite have put out comparable (if not better) gameplay without reneging on consumer promises or compromising the integrity of the game for immediate cash grabs. So I may return to PUBG when they put out a better product but for now I'm walking away.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Their focus is releasing more content not on fixing and optimizing the game. Game devs are confused They ignore the problems and are just milking PUBG right now. In comparison Fortnite follows and looks at the community and changes things according to what they deem to be beneficial for the game. They released Orange justice for free for season 4 they've removed guided missles after the the community complained about them. They've got the forumala with the least amount of things wrong with them and are running the gaming industry. This game is slowly following H1Z1 steps and will be a shadow of it's former self when the chinese players leave. TL DR Just don't buy into the hype especially it being the most expensive BR game out there right now.

2017-07-30,0,0,307,True,Recommended,Really great battle royale type game. It gets a lot better when you play with friends adding that colaborative aspect to the gameplay. The making of a great game is there but it is only in Alpha. I an exited to see where it is headed. There still are some problems such as being unable to pull yourself onto higher objects or being able to jump over a small concrete barricade. Still a really great find.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-09,1,1,60,False,Recommended,HEADERI've been playing since the Early Access program. What can I say about this game?TL DRIt has a lot a potencial but lack fixes and features. EDIT It had a lot of fixes since NVIDIA is helping in the development of the game!LONG VERSIONWhat I mean by all of this is that while the game is really fun to play with friends it has few to offer when you're not with them. It has only one mode which is its selling point a survival game. Around 100 people jump from an airplane and fight each other in TPS/FPS styles until one survives (or a party of 2 4 players) or everyone kills each other (a drawn is possible in this game). Now it has two scenarios which the Mexican desert is quite hard to survive since it way too open..... So... well it's has more failures than that.It has PK feature to your partners. It's quite unfair to play this with too many cheaters! It has some bugs that really unsatisfy me especially concerning fallings and driving vehicles. And the best one it gets tiring quickly. As I said the selling point is the fact that it's a survival game so it has no respawn. However as it has only one mode available the charm of this game gets old so quickly a lot when you're just killed by headshots all the time then I think it must have other kinds of modes such as fewer people on the survival game or maybe even bigger teams with hunter mode or something like that (like CS GO with terrorists vs anti terrorists). The most concerning fact about this game for the community however is the fact that it's not so well optimitized so it needs more processment power from CPU and GPU than it really would need it the development of the game regarded about optimizing PUBG. In theory you'd need to have a really powerful PC. On the other hand NVIDIA is investing in this field opmitizing PUBG in each update so if you have a NVIDIA GPU you're lucky. If it's from AMD or other obscure developer I'm sorry but it will have delays and other problems in rendering.Well it has another good selling point updates. It's fairly updated by the developers. Each update expands the game or correct some bugs but I can see that they're really caring about this game. So if you're quite frightened by these many bad things I've just said don't worry the developers may know all of this and are solving this problems... Maybe.CONCLUSIONBesides all that it's still a fun game to play occasionally with friends especially if you can chat with them by VoIP. I had many hours of fun chatting with them while playing PUBG so I think you can also have it with them! Also I believe that this game has a lot of potential to develop through its updates and expansions.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-16,1,1,30,True,Not Recommended,Hi I just got into Pc gaming about five days ago. I'm new to this very new. I basically just suck at this point. I bought the Trace 930 specifically with the hopes of playing this game. After I got my pc up and running you better believe my first purchase was this game. For months I've been watching with my brothers YouTube's fighting it out. Funny moments epic moments. I was like.. Yeah. I want that. Instead what I got is fights where I'm in a room searching I hear footsteps ext away. So I stop and listen to see where they are going. O no. They went into the building I'm in. O no.. they came in the room in in? Looking right at me a kill me before I can kill them. I'm just like how the hell did this guy know where I was? Then I've had others where I'm behind cover fighting someone. I get shot through the wall? Im thinking hm. That's odd. Then.. weird stuff like that happens again.. again.. again... and then i read the reviews and was like.. o... wow. That's a shame. So I would recommend not getting this as long as (hackers cheaters) are prevailing against the quotation marks.. anti cheat system.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's excellent gunplay and suspenseful final duels are marred only by the fact you are constantly running towards a safe zone which in my experience almost exclusively spawns on an island with the military base. This rather conveniently sets up two bridges as massive chokepoints which are essentially a death sentence for players on foot or on a bike. I have lots of fun while playing but please fix the safe zone balance there needs to be better methods of crossing (boats are coffins).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-20,0,0,496,True,Recommended,the game is not complete but its more of a game then h1z1 is for sure. the game does have bugs but the dev team is doing a great job of fixing things. the game has lag in certain points but the devs have fixed alot of the fps drops in high population areas. i love that they add new content every month and hope that we will see more maps and modes. as of right now the game is okay it may not be worth $30 but i really think it will be in the near future maybe within the next month. guns are constantly being balanced and tweaked however its hard to get used how hard it is to deck a gun you like out. bottom line if you want a game that plays like h1z1 mixed with arma get this game. if your looking for a fun shot'em up move on. if you want a fast paced game this game has its moments but its mostly a tactical shooter where being in the right place in the right time makes surviving more easy. this game is about picking which fights to take not about running in and killing everyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-15,0,0,1588,False,Recommended,Probably the best Battle Royale game out there+ Solid battle royale gameplay. Drop from a plane collect loot kill players get pushed in closer and closer try to be the last man standing. The gun play is pretty realistic and it's always fun to get into an intense firefight.+ Great fun with friends+ Very High Replayability+ First Person and Third Person modes.+ Vehicles + Depening on how well you do you earn battle points. You can use these to get crates which you can sell on the market for profit OR open them for a cosmetic item. More of a personal note When playing in a squad it's very common for one of your friends to get knocked down and within a second they get killed with no chance of reviving them. This causes you to either leave the game or your friends have to sit there in boredom watching you play the remainder of the game. Can be frustratingly repetitive. Example Spending 20minutes looting / looking for players and then suddenly getting sniped across the map. Not enough map variety (there are only two maps currently) Lots of bugs... from randomly flipping off a bike taking heavy damage parachuting from the plane glitching inside loading buildings etc.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-22,0,0,604,False,Not Recommended,Here comes my Review from a guy who only wants to like this game and loves the core Gameplay of it.Positives I love the Gameplay of Pubg when everything works right(which still is like 90% of the time in a round i would say).I like the models of the Guns how the Guns feel and how it feels to hit a fat dab on the Haters.The fights in this game are really interesting and Unique to this type of game as long as youre playing in Squad Gameplay.The first few Wins in this game gave me a feeling of exhilaration I rarely ever felt in any other game if any other gamer at all.You really do feel good when playing and hitting shots.Negativ The state of the Game got increasingly worse and worse after 1.0.Right now there are huge Latency Problems with the Servers. For example I myself got Headshot multiple times while being behind a solid Object for a second or two already without any Line of Sight to the Person shooting me. This has happened to me on multiple Occasions and on every Map thats in the game. There were and sometimes still are a stupendous amount of Bugs and glitches that sometimes move in and out of the game from Patch to Patch.There is probably a lot missing that I havent actively thought of since its minor or forgotten about/gotten used to.Overall you can see that the Developers are Passionate about most Parts of the Game but you can also see that they either dont Focus on the Important Stuff or manage to Eff the Important Stuff up again and again.Of course I wouldnt know how involved the Developement of this game is but at the End of the Day for a Consumer the Product matters and not really the Process of making the Product.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-15,0,0,508,True,Recommended,PUBG is the most brutally unforgiving game I've ever played. And yet despite dying over and over again it is also the most satisfying game I've ever played.When you first start you die easy but you can also learn to last until the end. You'll still die but you'll have fun learning the terrain and how to stealth and how to find items.As you get better you'll start engaging other players. You'll die some more. But eventually you'll kill a few.Then as you start to get good you might start killing a lot of players and diving straight into the action without hesitation.This learning curve takes at least a month. You'll play third person first person in a duo or in a squad. You might even play in a squad on your own. Nobody talks about the significance of small decisions like this but they're in your hands and they can make each game a very different experience.This is the BEST multiplayer game I have ever played. It's compelling and keeps you coming back. Every day I have a bunch of new stories and no two games are the same.In an unusual twist the skills you can develop in this game may serve you in real life as well. This isn't a survival game as much as it is a free for all combat game but somehow it's the game that will teach you about moving through terrain and surviving.PUBG is the best addiction you could possibly develop.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This was solved relatively quickly and I can now run a smooth FPS on my AMD FX 8 Processor and 120+FPS on my Ryzen 1700X using a Nvidia 970GTX.GameplayIf you're into ranking system this game can get seriously addictive just be careful not to let it ruin the fun!I find this came most enjoyable in 3/4 team mates where can run around loot stuff and mess around with the occassional voice chat interaction with other teams which have made for some of the best moments.Player base Not really had an issue with any players or hackers in this game so far and have a fair few hours. Waiting Lobbies can be really good fun if you can get everyone singing or dancing or other ridiculous acts.Advice if you buy They are just starting to release new crates save your points you get from games for when they release a lot of crates so you have a higher chance of a better value for money my friends have about 20 white tshirts where as I held 30K and got some good items when the latest pack came out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-09,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I had heard about this game before the hype train launched PUBG to the top of the Steam playerc ounts and Twitch view counts and I really liked the premise of this game. I've played similar games before and they've always been good fun. I looked forward to this game and when I finally got to play it I didn't enjoy it very much.It's very poorly optimised which causes it to run like even on the lowest settings (yes my build is more than capable of running this according to the recommended system requirements). So I managed to get into a few games with everything looking like a game from the 1990s with a barely playable framerate and the other supposedely strong points of PUBG fell flat on their face in my opinion. The gunplay was nothing spectacular and the shrinking arena was nothing new to me either. Melee weapons have awful hit detection and the game is pretty buggy all round. Please note that I only had &lt 2 hours playtime with PUBG as I claimed a refund as 26.99 is a steep asking price for a game that doesn't really do much for me. Perhaps it was the hypetrain that raised my expectations or maybe my first experiences were a coincidence and not indicative of the true PUBG experience. If the game ever reduces in price (hasn't been on sale yet) then I suggest you give it a try but for the price being asked I suggest you buy with caution and remember to exercise your right to a refund if you don't like it. I will likely buy the game again after some time when the hype dies down and the price has gone down a bit. When that happens I'll update this review and will hopefully be able to recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-04,0,0,391,True,Not Recommended,Great game with very unique/intense/fun moments.. great to play as a squad.. ruined by Terrible optimisation (1080ti seeing as low as 40fps at times) Bugs Lack of basic features CHEATERSThere is so many asain cheaters flooding OC servers in particular Solo mode.. they do this because there is crate monetization people are supporting their family cheating and getting lots of crates and selling them.Stop the crate/items money system and they will dissapear.

2017-08-27,2,2,210,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR&gt Looks like bootleg ghost recon wildlands. &gt FPS like my dad (inconsistent and absent)&gt Plays like asset flipFull review Today I recieved an update 10/17/2017 and update of 1gb it fixed a frying pan glitch fixed ui glitch for spectator mode fire animation for plane in start and some spawns. Bluehole is a sh t company I didn't expect much from this game considering I was basically forced to get it by friends it was made by the guy from DayZ who wasn't expecting to get burned? They've made hundreds of millions of dollars and they can't have a game that run well. This game has so many fu king problems. How it runs/plays Optimization is garbage and that's probably the nicest way to put it top reviews being marked as fixes to the game shouldn't exist. It's early access but they're not focusing on making the game run well they're focusing on adding vaulting or a another map... who even cares about these features when the game can't run for sh t on many systems? Lot's of people with good systems have to lower their settings to very low to even play let alone that you get an advantage at low settings. The game doesn't really run that well like it feels off I don't know how else to describe it other than muted? A lot of games have very different ways to make you feel like you're part of the experience small nuanced ways but until I'm surrounded by people near the end It generally feels just muted and takes me out. Doesn't help that you spend a majority of your time looking at the floor with a bland boring map with bland boring buildings with small land marks here and there. The entire thing feels very uninspired and that ""oh it's apocolyptic"" is a garbage excuse because you can make inspirational landscapes with dreary settings. It's been done. This god awful net code combined with the blues clues building textures is worthy of a dumpster fire.Asia A lot of people don't like the fact that asians go onto the american servers and call for region locks. When there's much bigger problems with the whole Asia scenario how do the game developers think it's rightful to charge more money to have people from a different region play the game correctly instead of setting up their sh tty a s servers near there? It's fu king disgusting and disgraceful. Putting ads in the game. You awful beings what's wrong with you?! Who does that?! You do that. Bluehole what in actual fu k. Hackers BattleEye is garbage you're banning people unrightfully so because your game runs poorly and it crashes and some people get banned for that. Your ""average of 6k"" is terrible when you take into account the amount of sales of this game and the fact that a lot of people get banned unrightfully so. Doesn't help that hackers get by anyway. Streamers Whiny people with popularity banning regular players who used their hard earned cash without a lick of evidence other than word of mouth. Not much to say here other than that this is filthy.Team Killing If you find yourself in a lobby full of people who don't speak your language get ready to get shot and if you try and defend yourself by shooting back get ready to get banned. Cosmetics I can't tell what's worse the fact that they added micro transactions in a early access or the fact that theres camo in the game in lootboxes (god fu k lootboxes) which you can pay for the camo stuff don't worry if you wanted a pay to win mechanic in a pay to play game this is the one stop shop for all your degenerate needs. Misc They added a button to fix the UI because the UI breaks so often. This alone.Conclusion This is the worst part because at the end of the day there's been complaints for quite of few of the issues listed above for a while now. And nothing has been done and there's a key reason for that they already got their money. It's too late. They made hundreds of millions. It's Day Z part two. It's sad. Can't refund millions of dollars can we? Can we?Update Game released games still sh t. Most of these issues if none of them have still not been fixed. Oh and in the desert map in the small island there's 2 buildings clipping into eachother that's right in a $30 game with 2 maps and one game mode (non selectable maps) they couldn't be bothered to make 2 buildings not clip.

You dont have a clue where everyone is. You start off with nothing at the beginning of every match but you have to run to find a building and quickly gather weapons armor medkits and clothing. No time to run around as the circle of bounds gets smaller and smaller as the match goes on till all the players are eventually all close together in one spot.

2017-03-26,1,1,69,True,Recommended,It's a great game much more enjoyable than H1Z1. But i would like to ask the developers to please just focus on the optimization for now as it will put the game much further gameplay wise. Content are fine just focus on making it run good. Differ from the other Early access games. I've got a 6700k and a GTX 1080 even playing on medium makes me drop below 40 50fps.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,61,True,Recommended,To balance all the negative reviews here's a positive one. I'll try to go by the main negative points one by one and why you SHOULD buy the game since it's actually a really good game despite what everyone keeps shouting in the reviews. AdsThe thing about ads is pretty badly handled I agree. HOWEVER! It is ONLY in the CHINESE region. Any other region has no ads so no reason not to buy the game if you live literally anywhere else. Banned for streamsnipingThis is something that has been blown out of proportions by the internet. Yes people have been banned for streamsniping but this has barely happened. Just the few that have or the 1 in 2.000.000 that has been banned on accident gets all the attention. MicrotransactionsHonestly it's all fashion wise. You want a yellow jacket? Maybe u'll get lucky by opening a crate FOR FREE but if you wanna buy it straight from the market you can for a price. Honestly I think this is a plus. I've made the games money back from selling crates I get by earning In Game currency. Another reason to buy it Bad performance/optimizationI agree this is an annoying point. However since it's still early acces and they will be optimizing the game. It should be playable on all medium rigs tho as long as you put the graphics all on the lowest. Still don't think it's a reason not to buy the game. HackersAgain not as bad as most people say and mostly on the Chinese server. Bluehole is actively banning hackers and it's not really an issue. In my 50 hours of playing I have not seen a single hacker. RNG for weapons low actionThis is all about how you play. People who make this claim are dropping in low loot areas with little players. Of COURSE you're getting little action if you drop away from everyone. Drop in the middle and there will be 10 others ready to fight you. It's all risk vs rewardThe truth is PUBG is a GREAT game that deserves better reviews. There is a reason it's been getting the most players online on steam to any other game.Chicken dinner,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,766,True,Recommended,By far the best game I have played. With the test servers showing off the valting mechanics is proves that the developers arent't here to suck money out of the community. The ENTIRE map has different movement mechanics all dependent on the position of the player The speed moving and the wall or fence you are navigating through just shows that this game is well placed as Game Of The Year 2017. Then again Post Malone Playes the game. So something must be right here. Only issue is optimization. I have two 750ti's and a core i5 4690k with 16gb of ram and I only run 40 60fps on all low settings So deffently some room for the developers to optimize some! Other than that best AAA game i've played!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you don't feel like slitting your wrists then don't buy this game.The game is filled with bugs and the developers keep adding in new content without fixing simple bugs that have been in the game for months using early access as just an excuse for not fixing certain issues is not acceptable I suggest that you don't buy this game until the developers get their priorites right. At this rate PUBG is going to be one those games released out of early access pre maturely in a buggy and unoptimized state with tons of problems.For now just take your money and spend it on a game thats actually refined there are even some other early access titles that are better optimized than pubg so just have look around for a better game to spend your money on.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-10,0,0,132,False,Not Recommended,"while yes the devs are updating the game there are still plenty of bugs and problems like hackers that seem to be ignored. I die from someone who is blantly cheating like every 5 or 6 matches and it is pretty annoying. The game is at it's best when you're screwing around with friends. Instead of fixing the game they come out with new maps and ""fix"" things that don't need to be ""fixed"". Luckily I have a 1080 and it runs perfectly at 120+ FPS with no issues. But on lesser graphics card like a 970 the game runs at less than 60 FPS which is not okay. Another example of poor dev decisions is the god aweful loot crate system they have. I don't mind if it's cosmetic only but when you have to charge 2 or 3 bucks to get a key that's where I draw the line. I have to earn the stupid BP and why can't I open it for free? while yes i realize some crates can open for free it's not enough. I really find it amusing how the devs at PUBG sued the devs at epic for ""copying PUBG"" then PUBG decides to blantly rip off Fortnite with the battlepass system. Like what the hell is that about.Core gameplay itself is alright when it's working properly. But I can't recommend it at this stage. Needs serious fixing.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They still need to make tweeks but its cool that the Dev's are actually making progress and reporting what is coming next. Which is something I think is awesome. If you are new to this game the learning curve isn't bad at all. Quite easy I think if you have played other FPS games or even TPS. Now this is a good game with a few bad things. My number one gripe with this game are cheaters. There seems to be more then a few in TPP but almost none in FPP. My 2nd gripe in this game is there is nothing that this game rewards you for. I have over 800+ hours in this game and nothing to show for it. The BP boxes are kind of a scam because you don't really get that much BP back as it is. If you buy the boxes with cash it is a waste of money. I have witnessed a buddy buy $50 bucks in boxes and not even get a rare item.

2017-08-02,0,0,81,True,Recommended,The game was fun I have to say and finding a match was so fast I mean I've play so much multiplayer on Cod Overwatch and other titles that finding the next match blow me away. After playing the game for a few hour I have to say that the game need more work to be done. Example 1 Find gears and weapon was taking more time to find than players. Example 2 Understanding the keyboard was tricky and pretty hard too. Example 3 The map was bigger than I was excepting you will run so much just to get to the kill circle or you just died outside of the circle. Overall great game for those who have patience time and know who to take down enemies faster than me. I would still recommended this game to the player who like this kind of multiplayer.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-19,0,0,91,True,Recommended,Finally got to play!I purchased Battlegrounds when it was first released. I was super excited! My friends purchased the game and everyone was playing and when I first started the game...major freezing 0 10 fps bad lag stuck loading etc...This did not deter me. I patiently waited for the first big monthly patch. 2 days prior to the update they released a test server to test said update.I started the game to familiar freezing at the start up screen. A little worried I continued. The menu loaded and I quickly turned my graphics settings down to medium (my computer specs are at the bottom). Once I created my character I started a solo game. THe initial load took forever which concerned me but as soon as the starting arena appeared there was 0 lag! No crazy fps drops! I was actually playing! The plane popped up no lag I jumped out the plane no lag. I played 2 games no lag or fps drops!The 2 games I did play were amazing enough for me to go ahead and write a review.Almost every moment is intense. Looting listening watching the clock..Yes their are bugs. Yes is still needs optimization. Yes they are working on making it a perfect game.So I finally got to start playing and I can easily recommend Battlegrounds to anybody considering it.Specs i5 4670k 3.4ghz8gb ddr3 ramGTX 960 2gb,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-23,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a just okay experience. I'm choosing to leave a not recomended rating because I think that you can probably find more fun elsewhere while the 100 man survival mode can be compelling it's also grueling and not always fun esspecially given that most of the time there's no action going on. PUBG has modes that aleviate this war is my favorite and playing in squads usually ends up more interesting than the 30 minuite sneak sessions that are solo. However special modes only appear during event times servers can't be made by anyone except a select few and the core game is so drawn out that sometimes it's a relief to die and start over.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-06,0,0,247,True,Recommended,"The game is conceptually simple 100 people fighting for loot on a huge island. There are a plethora of towns military locations and farms that loot can be found in (albeit with varying levels) which gives you hundreds of strategies to take when you first parachute out onto the island. One of the main reasons people are getting banned for ""no reason"" is due to stream sniping where people find lobbies with streamers and intentionally annoy and harass them. It's a pathetic way to play this game which is hence the reason so many people are complaining about being banned for no reason. PUBG in itself is surprisingly addictive however and encourages you to try new strategies fail then learn from failed strategies to devise better plans.(EDIT structure and spelling)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Then you all get stuck in a c130 where voice chat is even more noticable and everyone who is 12 is shouting jump N*g*er Anyone who is 15 is pretending to be Chinese and anyone who has not turned down the volume by now is telling everyone else they are the fire commander and order you to jump... n*g*er...So now you jumped and are droping to the ground with 100 other people. Your parachute opens and you float down to what is the worst parachute landing animation ever god help you if someone saw you and managed to get a gun from the house you were floating towards. So now you've picked yourself up and are hauling as much as you can to the house of your choice in hopes there is loot in there an not another player.Lets say you managed to loot the house and are still alive you run out of the house trying to keep ahead of the giant blue circle that is enclosing around the play field you must stay ahead of it or you lose health for every few seconds your on the backside of the blue. If you are lucky enough to have guessed where the middle of the play field is and can stay camped up with your looted weapons you might have a chance. If you are unlucky and find yourself running along the wilderness and sudden pops and snaps are happening around you consider your self spotted and said player is hot on your tail BUT you can't determine which direction the shots came from EVEN with high dollar headphones on cause its not possible to discern in this game. One other reason I do not recommend this is there is already a community of hackers deeply invested in it and where can it go from there but to the toilet. Do a simple google search for ""Playerunknown hacks"". You will find surveys for codes for in game points to buy more gear you will find hack groups already charging for undetectable hacks... the list goes on.Thanks but no thanks.

2017-08-05,0,0,448,True,Not Recommended,It's a fun game but too many hackers ruining the game. It's a game about stealth and precision. When people are running around with ESP and aimbots it has a much bigger effect on the game than for a normal FPS. While sometimes you're just unlucky sometimes it's clear what's happening. For example I'm sitting in a house in the middle of a city. Squad drives up in a car straight to my house. They come up the stairs ignoring all the other closed doors open the one I'm in and shoot me.Another example. Just now I was in the top 4. I was holed up in a house and had been for a while. Some guy runs up and he's scurrying around outside looking in windows I guess. I'm on the second floor and I crawl around a bit trying to get a look at him using 3rd person camera. Whatever side of the house I crawl to he follows me outside. Finally I crawl out on a balcony and lay flat so he can't see me from the ground. He immediately comes around the house and stands *under* the balcony like he knows where I am exactly. I jump down behind him dump an Uzi clip into him and he one shots me at point blank range with an 8x scoped sniper rifle. Seriously WTF. Now I'm not saying everyone cheats. I play a good bit and I make the top 10 60% of the time. But there is almost always one guy in the top 10 who's hacking and either has and aimbot ESP or can shoot through walls and trees. It makes winning almost impossible. I have a 60% top 10 rate in solo and 4 man squad and like a 1% win rate in both. It makes zero sense.Unless they fix the game I wouldn't buy it.

2018-05-02,0,0,303,False,Not Recommended,If there was an ambivalent/leaning no option I would select it. But on a strict binary I cannot recommend this game in good faith.I really enjoyed this game when it came out and when it was a fresh game and idea it had so much promise and potential. Almost half a year after 'release ' this game is still in extended early access.It is not at all optimized and runs very poorly/sluggishly unless you have a god tier machine it's full of bugs has many many unfinished and bizarre texture issues the skin economy is worse than cancer and adds absolutely nothing to the game (there's absolutely no point to running any skin since they're all really poorly mapped and designed and look terrible you're better off just selling the crates to some Chinese dude to recoup the money you're wasting on this game) and cheating remains a rampant issue in the game which Bluehole has yet to attempt to address despite numerous and repeated promises to do so.The cheating problem in this game is well documented and well known and if you choose to play be prepared to die questionably and repeatedly in gunfights you have no possible way of winning. The overwhelming majority of the hackers in this game (something like 99%) are all from China. Be prepared to be teamed aimbotted or simply teamkilled for your loot by Chinese players they are a scourge on the US and EU servers that Bluehole refuses to address and will continue to plague it until they region lock (which is doubtful at this point).On the plus side and to Bluehole's credit they have recently released a slight ballistics and damage rework that I feel has significantly improved the gunplay and made more weapons viable to get kills with and have finally fixed some issues with the abysmal boring 2nd map (Mirarmar) by adding more cover more loot and a new vehicle but it's really too little too late.When this game works and you have a cheater free game it is extremely enjoyable especially if you like a (somewhat) more realistic battle royale experience than a game like Fortnite or H1Z1. However where this game falters is exactly where the aforementioned titles shine the action pacing and kills per game are all in need of work for this to become a truly decent game.If you insist on buying this game I would strongly recommend having above the minimum specs to run this game at a decent framerate even at the lowest settings otherwise it will run at about 35 50 FPS tops.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The gist of the story is this 1) You're in a plane you're watching how many fools eject at the very first second of the game...you wait until you're over a decent area nobody else is then you drop..2) You haven't even touched the ground yet 10 out of 100 people are already dead3) You notice someone else is close by you hear their feet pounding on grass and wood looking for a gun....you BOOK IT to the nearest house...you can't find a gun....4) You hear a reloading sound they have a gun...you finally found a gun a shotgun a smile on your face as you load shells.5) You hear footsteps coming towards you he's running for you he's hunting you...you have a plan.6) You crouch down and aim your shotgun at the only entrance to your house the idiot barges in... BOOM chk chk... that's one less survivor and one less person you have to kill.7) You look outside there's no car you go back to loot the body of the fallen take the nice assault rifle he generously brought you and its ammunition...and begin your trek.8) You watch the survivor count slowly dwindle the crack of gunshots in the distance...and yet you know the most deadly sound of all when there's only 20 left?Silence,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-30,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,This is probably the worst game I've ever played. It does so much right as a battle royal but does so much more wrong as it too. You will land and probably take 20 minutes (if you don't die yet) just to find a pistol. If you're lucky you have 2 amazing choices to put into your inventory an AK and an M16. Every other gun practically doesn't exist btw ammo not included.Next the death cam is a great feature to see how your enemy hacked I mean out played you. Same thing. The death cam will either show you that you were exposaed even though you were clearly behind cover and it'll also show you how an enemy can have the aim of Helen Keller with a wii remote and still somehow clean you up. Even better it'll show 7 out 12 times how an enemy will instant snap to you (1 out of the 7 will be legit). I can't wait till a proper vac secure system will finally be mentioned at HQ.Third I'd like to point out I absolutely detest the sand map I think it shouldn't have ever been thought of. I personally prefer the grassy map because I can actually find cover and die less often. I think to sort this out for player like me there should've been an option from day 1 of sand map to choose to queue up for either one or a random playlist. I think that the corporation should've taken this into account.Fourth I'd like to say what makes this game so good yet so terribly ing awful is its community. Streamers like Shroud and Dr. Disrespect will show you how fun it can be and how its like to be good. However its the top tier that prevents players from having fun. Because when you die in every gun fight to someone better how can you improve? The players will sometimes go out of their way just to make sure you have a miserable time that match. I think a way to overcome skill gaps is to incorporate a form of training game mode so players can practice aim and/or maneuverability. This should've been predicted and implemented long ago.What really pisses me off about this game is that the developers refuse to offer anything that can make this game better and I enjoy it sometimes even though I've yet to win on PC I can still find some fun at times. I however think for now this game is a dissapointment and should be given some redux before anyone new thinks about purchasing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is also loads of bugs like textures not loading in resulting in people being able ot drive and walk through walls.Playtime 9/10 ive put nearly 200 hours in as of this review and every game still feels fresh even though its the same map everytime.

Unfortunetly Bluehole/Pubg corp Have decided to defecate all over their amazing creation and riddled it with Micro Transactions and ******** in the hands that feed them. This game unlike Fortnite Player Unknown has a better Hardcore element and Raw Aim skill and tactic element Compared to Fortnite(Build Build Build luck luck luck). I'm going to get it out of the way and say I personally think Fortnite is trash that is overhyped by the younger generation and casual playerbase. Nothing like camping in a tower 3rd personing over a wall you built in the middle of a circle.I Think what annoys the Passionate Fans of PubG and myself is the fact that this game has so Much more to offer and so much Potential that was sqandered by the plague of greed that is currently sweeping the Moguls of Gaming Companies. The fact is that if Bluehole actually LISTENED to their fan base they would definitely still be the King of Battle Royale. But like H1Z1 They riddled it with micro transactions and the satisfaction that only a spare few could get of getting that sweet sweet ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"" but even then so what. Personally i enjoy the Stupid and Idiotic Moments of Pubg.(Running up to a Squad with a Primed Nade).&gt Winning.Whether it's too late for BlueHole to turn it around and Listen to the Creative Community of PubG or continue on the Path of Destruction of what could of been a better but still an Amazing Legacy Burnt into the Gaming History Books is up to the heads of Pubg Corp. But for some reason i don't think it'll happen anytime soon. It seems the board of Pubg Corp is headed by Pathetic Children that are more consumed on the idea that Fortnite has Ripped off their game and are suing instead of fixing.

You get what you pay for here. This isn't a $60 AAA title. It's a $30 Arena Survival Shooter.You start by skydiving onto a massive island from a random direction while forced to pay attention to your surroundings at all times all the while looking for a means to survive as well as win. You can go the stealthy route and make it a massive deadly game of Hide and Seek or strap on your boots and git gud charging head first into the fray with only your fists.There are so many different and creative ways I've seen people play this game both alone and in groups and I have to say it's pretty fun when you've got the time to play it.HOWEVERThe biggest motion of discontent seems to be with the Pay to be Pretty model they're about to introduce. Get over yourselves.It's not like you're paying 15.00 for a reusable SCAR L with attachments on drop or paying for an airdrop to get extra loot to your location. It's completely goddamn optional to go spend money on loot crates on the off chance you'll get that sweet Kill Bill outfit or a trenchcoat.

2017-07-13,1,1,87,True,Not Recommended,"Why is this game so popular?Honestly I've been asking myself this question with increasing frequency as of late. I've sunk about 80 hours into the game at this point yet I couldn't honestly tell you with a straight face that I think it's a ""good"" game. The people I play with on a regular basis all have considerable experience with shooters ranging from above average to semi professional in skill level and the general consensus amongst them is that the gun play is bad. The hit registration is mediocre. The environments have genuinely atrocious hitboxes.On top of this the movement mechanics are also pretty lacklustre it's extremely easy to get stuck on or in objects and your characters ultimate kryptonite is apparently knee high walls. Furthermore the game is not only ugly but incredibly poorly optimised. Unless you're running the sort of rig that wouldn't look out of place on the goddam Starship Enterprise be prepared for some slideshow gaming here and there.So why has it sold 3 million+ copies? Well in my mind it comes down to one major factor there is a huge void in the market for accessible pick up and play co op games especially for those looking to get some sort of PvP fix. I mean what are your alternatives? MOBA's specialize in destroying friendships rather than fortifying them and MMORPGs are about as good for you as a crack habit but PUBG? The games are quick the atmosphere is relaxed and the game is conceptually extremely simple to grasp.If you're one of the twelve people left out there who have not yet purchased PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS I'd honestly tell you to hold onto your money at 30USD a pop the overwhelming technical issues and mediocre gameplay just can't justify the pricetag at this point in time but let's be honest Bluehole Studios have already made more money than God at this point in time so who really gives a toss what I have to say on the matter.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,295,True,Recommended,I've been a sucker for nearly every Early Access surivival title holding out that one day someone would get it right. The Culling came close but ulitmately subcummed to a loss of players and lack of signifigant updates. This game already feels so much better than H1Z1 ever did it nailes the perfect balance between realism and fun. The gunplay is tight and the movement feels good. The optimization could be better but that's obvious. If the developers continue with this trend of updates and communication this is going to be a game that will be talked about and played for years to come.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Im guessing you know the rest from other reveiws anyways sometimes youll get destroyed and feel hopeless. sometimes youll yourself over and maybe Go to use a grenade change your mind then before noticing you dropped the nade on the ground (like you should and unlike other games) you kill yourself. Sometimes you will get a nice start and find your choice weapon or a lvl 3 backpack ect. Overall you gotta be smart with what you use. how you maneuver through the areas.

2017-08-12,0,0,210,True,Not Recommended,PUBG had the potential to be a modern solo team shooter masterpiece. The game keeps you wanting more it's fun ridiculous at times involves a high degree of tactical planning and skill and hosts one of the most diverse player communities i've seen in a game. But here's what it lacks. The game is poorly optimized all over the place. Frame drops are to be expected and can even ruin your efforts in a match at the most random of times. There's a major lack of content when it comes to the world guns vehicles and equiptment/gear. Rather than focus on improving performance issues to maintain stability the devs have been adding PAID content?!?! As if the game hasn't made enough money from it's 5 million steam sales now it has a paid loot system with absolutely NO NECESSITY execpt for MAKING THE DEVS MORE MONEY. Okay so great the devs have gotten more money from PC gamers supporting them this would be great if their focus was to improve the pc version of the game drasstically. But no alas the devs are investing our hard spent money into a console version of the same alpha that we've come to love. ALL game devs like Playeruknown dream of making a wonderfull came that brings both joy and financial profit. But right now Battlegrounds seems to be bringing only the profit as it lets down the gamers who hope to see a this game become a crucial part of the pc gaming shooter community.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's a very good game a simple but extremely fun/addictive formula. Problem is if the devs are focused on introducing crates and micropayment before the game is EVEN RELEASED instead of atually solving actual problems that actually cripple the entire thing (wich is a shame for such a fun game) then it's a nono.

2017-04-30,0,0,692,True,Not Recommended,The game is alot of fun when it's working like it should. but it almost never does. dsync lag spikes. memory leaks. if you have bad internent don't even bother. instead of roll backs or dsync that you'd usually get this game gives you the joy of freeze lags and hinders you from playing when the ping gets to high. i also have 8gb ram and that should be enough for this kind of game but it seems as of 16gb and maybe even an SSD is what you need to get rid of the stutter lag. gameplay 7/10 everything else might aswell be tossed aside,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

First I feel like I shouldn't need a PC that GOD himself had put together to be able to run this game. I would like to think I have a mid tier PC and its a miracle if I even get 40 frames on pretty much all low settings. I am not the person to put all my money into a machine that is for entertainment purposes. I would also like to say that I can run a game such as SIEGE 60 frames all on high plus that is a pretty game. This looks like cottage cheese someone threw up on a hot sidewalk. Basically it looks like I will give credit where credit is due they are TRYING to update this game but I can already seeing it being another DAYZ stay in early access for years to come just as an excuse. I am also not going to tell you to play H1Z1 either. Overall I enjoy H1 SOOO much more than this POS but that is where I stand. All in All if you like server lag and ""updates"" that dont seem to do much. You will love this game.

2017-08-04,0,0,422,True,Recommended,Never do reviews but since most of the negative reviews have come from reddit spewing their nonsense I thought I would write one. First yes micro transactions are going to be a thing for cosmetic items not sure why anyone thinks this is an issue since it does not affect the game in anyway. Second the game has been in EA for a bit now and has come leaps and bounds from where it started with weekly patches and major monthly updates which most games would kill for that are in EA. The devs have had a pretty clear direction with some turns that are unexepected but that is going to happen during development.With the release of 1st Person servers this even give more people an oppurtunity to enjoy the game with no 3rd person advantage from corners. With even more good things on the way like vaulting im not sure why people are upset at the game. Yes there are still bugs that are actively being worked on and being fixed along the way but its an EA game still.100% recommend the game if you like shooters in general and like a competetive nature of a shooter. If you are waiting for full release I would also totally understand but still not a reason to dislike the game because of the bugs currently in EA.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-08,0,0,64,True,Recommended,Ignore those people saying do not buy this game cuz they broke a promise. As I have read they will use those money to fund the Gamescom event prize pool and charity. So what now? They will just use their own money to produce the whole event?Back to the game I really recommend it. Tho the game is in early access and you will experience how to be stuck on a door sounds not accurate etc. But we can actively see that the devs are trying their best to keep up with the issues with weekly fixes monthly updates etc.In this game you will become a true hunter that leaves no mark of your existence.You will become a bear mauling your pans on the face of the enemies.You will become a horse and tirelessly run across the battlefield.You will become a marksman aiming for the heads of those brave ones running on an open wheat field.You will become a rock and wait for that unlucky one to enter your domain.You will become a snek and wiggle your body while on prone to avoid detection.Yeah so far so good.

2018-06-06,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,Runs terribly for how it looks. Probably because the game was made by modders not game developers. RNG based system where skill is rendered almost pointless either be the first one to find a gun or have better loot than your opponents. It doesn't matter how skilled you are chances are you will lose a fight when you have a machete and your opponent has a shotgun. Not to mention how many times you get sniped without even seeing a single person. With randomized loot safe zones bomb drops etc. it makes fun randomized. When I won it took some serious luck. (Great randomized teammate knew what he was doing lucky safe zone that played in my favor loot and guns that played in my favor etc.) If you want to win more play as a coward and camp until the zone pushes you along. Then find another place to camp avoiding all conflict possible. Rinse repeat.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Es würde auch Spaß machen alleine oder mit Freunden wenn die Server nicht von irgendwelchen inkompetenten Japsen in Nordkorea welche für ihre Arbeit mit einer Vergewaltigung bezahlt werden würden. Die Server laufen nämlich wirkloich extrem schlecht. Mit Glück kann man in 1 von 10 Fällen einen Gegner anvisieren bevor er sich aus dem Nichts vor dich teleportiert und dich sofort tötet ohne auch nur irgendein Geräusch. Außerdem gibt es mittlerweile mit der neuen Map Miramar unzählige neue Bugs die das Spiel unspielbar machen. Mein persönlicher Favorit ist dass man einfach aus dem nichts sich nicht mehr bewegen kann die einzige Option die man dann noch hat ist zu quitten (10/10 Gameplay).

2017-09-15,1,2,458,True,Recommended,This is the most well made bug free game i have ever experienced. Very realistic graphics and gameplay but don't try and play it in 4k or it will break your monitor from the number of screen tearing and resolution stutter. The game is very balanced. I once shot a kid with no helmet 4 times in the head with a sniper rifle and he did not die as you would expect the kid ended up dying to a pistol from 300m away in about 3 4 shots minutes later. You just can't find any other game with that kind of realism. The sounds in the game are like no other as u can be getting shot from the east but hear it in the west just as u would if u were being shot at in real life. Sometimes when you're running you can hear the sound of a buggy constantly ringing in your ear as if u are about to take a tire up the but then u turn around and realize it was of a buggy 2000m away on a hill. The game truly begins to reach its full potential once u get on a raining server. The game intensifies by 10x due to the fact that u can't hear footsteps vehicles airdrops or gunshots. Just the ever so present sound of rain and wind ing your ear drums. The game has 2 main servers NA and Asia. If u want a real challenge asian servers are key. Your ping lowers by about 85% and you won't understand anything anyone is saying in the pregame chat which i find to personally be the best part of the game. If a bunch of chinese noodle slurpers hyped up on soy sauce playing a highly competitive battle royale game in 15 fps doesn't scare you i'm not sure what will.The game can be very slow to start but makes sure to pick up the pace rapidly as u are constantly being chased by a giant blue electric field readying to bend u over and closing u into a smaller zone of players. In most cases you'll only have a UMP and if ur lucky a crossbow going up against three M249s and a korean kid with an AWM ghillie suit and a $200 mouse. Seems like a bad situation right? wrong. The crossbow shoots a bolt that does more damage than the .50 magnum rounds shot from the awp. Not to mention it's completely silent. Most developers would make airdrop items valuable and most powerful but PUBG has found a creative way to make the UMP the best gun in the game and spawn it in 2 rooms of every house making for a very balanced multiplayer experienced. As its in early access you'd expect some bugs and glitches right? wrong again. PUBG is the only game i have ever played to not contain any bugs or glitches. PUBG can guarantee you that you will never spawn in without the vision of buildings and structures or fall through the floor on a rainy but NOT LAGGY server. Once i was climbing a 1000m 90 degree sea cliff in the middle of a thunderstorm as the game allows and i reached the top only to get stuck on one tree and a rock in a field and instantly die to falling damage while having two ARs an AR suppressor and a SR suppressor. After raging for what i thought was a bug i found on the PUBG forum that it was not a bug but a fundamental part of the game. This was implemented because in real life when u jump on a rock next to a tree u have the possibility of falling off the rock into the tree and splitting your head open. This game effect is rare but triples its chances in rain. As you can tell the game is very optimized and well past its time compared to other FP shooters. A game filled with looting gunfights parachutes diversely cultured pregame lobbies but never swimming. After my long and fun filled experience with PUBG i feel it is my job to you to recommend this game to any and all fellow steamers. It will be the best $30 youve ever and will ever spend. Unless u play 3rd person.This review is not sponsored by PUBG or Nike.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,1456,True,Recommended,After 1000 hours I think I have come to the following conclusion This game definately needs the time and money from developers to make for a better performance on the servers. If you do not have a very good pc (Processor and graphics card) it may not always be fun to play. Lag rubberbanding and d sync are problems you will run into. But let's all face it. The hate this game receives is simply due to the fact that everyone wants to play this but many people want it to run smooth af. It is exciting competetive infuriating satisfying and well in short an emotional rollercoaster everyone wants a piece off. And understandably this game gets the nomination for game of the year. Buy this If you can get past the problems that arise every now and then (just make sure you have a high end pc). It will give you many many hours of awesome gameplay that will make your heart pounce and your hands shake. So even with all the problems that still need fixing this game is for sure worth the 30 euros you need to cough up if you want to buy it. Have fun! And for all you warriors that will buy the game I will see you on the battlegrounds just before I put a 7.62 round through your head!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-13,0,0,542,False,Not Recommended,"Do you enjoy multiplayer games with the worst latency and hit registration possible? Do you enjoy being forced to play games online with no one who speaks your language? Do you enjoy being forced to play in servers that are an astronomical distance from you? Do you enjoy talent and skill being replaced by a random dice roll chance when it comes to weapons and equipment? Do you enjoy playing games with no incentive to keep playing regardless of the fact that it is 2018 and performanced based unlocks have been a thing for well over a decade? Is your computer capable of playing every other triple A title flawlessly but you'd like a DirectX 9 looking potato to completely brick it it back down to an inconsistant 40 FPS at 1080?The only incentive to playing this game is loot crates with cosmetic items. The majority of which require $2.50 just to open and you'll just get common gray duplicates. I've finally stopped being stupid enough to give these idiots more money. The hackers farm the BP points and sell the skins for redicoulous amounts of money. After over 500 hours cut between the THREE... yes THREE versions of this game (Main Test Server and Test Test Server) I've received one item that is rated higher than common and hundreds of duplicates. It's obvious that developers are giving themselves these items and selling them on steam market place. Look at the user names who purchase them! There is ZERO incentive to winning the matches when reaching Top 10 has the same exact pay out. In order to climb the leader boards into the top 1% you just have to make Top 10 in every match. EASY. Hit registration is a joke! You can litterally watch your bullet go right through someone's head and hit the objects behind them! It's not rare it's the ing norm! CQB is a joke with this kind of latency. You can drop on the same house every single game and never get the same loot. Sounds good right? No.. it's not. You spend almost 5 min just trying to get into a game only to land and spend a few minutes franticly running around looking for a weapon only to be gunned down by dude who rolled a lucky number and ended up in a house with a full kit. Now you're back at the home screen waiting for it to connect to a server waiting for it to fill up waiting for the air plane to take all ing day to fly across the map. I'm not even going to get started in the t of landing in an area with no vehicle and being killed by the zone because you where forced to walk a map that is stupid big for no reason outside of just wanting to be large. What's funny is how easy all of these problems should be to fix for anyone who has realistic game development exsperence. The developers are amature at best or this game would have made some actual progress over the past year. It still feels exactly the same as it did when I first purchased it.It's like they watched DayZ unfold with no burned people where by it and said ""Hold my beer and watch this"" *released PUBG and announces Xbox port* STOP GIVING THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY FOR NOTHING IN RETURN.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-11,0,0,1087,True,Recommended,Addictive tense and above all fun to play. The game is in alpha so there are a few optimisation issues glitches and bugs but these are generally few and far between. Some are having server issues but the EU servers tend to be stable and relatively lag free.The concept is solid building on earlier Arma 3 mods and similar game types and is essentially a 100 person 'King of the Hill' set in large open world map reminiscent of late 1980s Soviet Block states. Parachute in grab some loot tool up and fight it out in an ever reducing area until only one person is left. What's not to like?The execution is also solid despite being in alpha. Of course there are going to be issues... that's the point of alpha. Some of the weapons need balancing some of the gear looks a bit a few more maps would be nice but the game itself look good and plays well and doesn t really feel like its still in alpha. Playing with a friend or group of friends in a team is definitely the most rewarding and entertaining experience.Its the first game I've played for a while that really gets the palms sweating and heart racing where each decision can make or break you... when you're down to just three players and you're hanging on my the skin of your teeth inside a tiny circle. That's when you know you're getting your moneys worth. Ultimately the response of the devs to the feedback from this early access testing will make or break this game on final release. The issues some are experiencing especially server issues in China are pretty poor and there needs to be a bit more variety to ensure longevity.Definitely recommend at the moment maybe over a nice single malt (something light like a Dalwhinnie or Strathisla) and with friends. 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There was a lot of Early access games that had already disappointed me beyond belief such as Dayz H1Z1 The culling just to name a few but after I got this game all my expectations were met. The developers actually talk to the player base the game is fairly balance and it gets you on edge from the second you drop off the plane. Sure it has flaws lots of them for what it s worth such as immense lag at the beginning of games the poor optimization of the game (Bad frames in a lot of cities) and it has a fair share of hackers on the game but to be honest if this dropped as a completed game and with full price I would still be satisfied with what I ve got. The game is on early access and for the first time in a while I actually think the developers will come through with the problems that the game already has and then repair and keep adding new stuff. I will keep supporting the development of the game and I m sure the final product will be even more worth the money that it cost.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You're dying almost all the time but you still want to try it again and again. You can take lots of potentially rewarding but at the same time potentially deadly risks. (Should I hide in a small house and sit still or should I run around and search for weapons but risk being killed? Thould I walk slowly and carefully or should I take a fast car but risk being heared and... uuum... killed?) You are always forced to make decisions and never have time to think. The gameplay is kinda addictive due to the tension and paranoia you have to feel all the time since you can suddenly be killed at any moment.

Somy advice is to fix the hacker situation get it pached up before release and optomise it.

Pros It's still in early access/ alpha version. I expect changes to be made before the games released on this issue so we can atleast have a decent optimized game and run it at a descent 30 60 FPS with no frame drops or atleast I hope they do and not leave us with an unfinished poorly optimized game But I have hope in this game and the developers that they will fix this issue and more before the actual realease of the game.

2017-07-21,0,0,45,True,Recommended,Been playing for about a week now and I am very impressed so far. Dont waste anymore time reading reviews just buy it. This game is such a simple idea but keeps you very entertained. First game I have ever played where I dont care if I get 1st or 99th place. Its just fun to mess around. Best way to descibe the game is its the hunger games with guns. My only complaint is the red zone that forces players to move closer together moves to fast. I mean this in two ways it litterally moves to fast to where it is hard to out run it. The other way I mean is the time between zone changes is way to short in my opinion. It doesnt give enough time to loot and get dug in for some sweet camping kills. I get it that some people want a fast pace game that only takes 15min per match but I say if you want that go play CoD. It should take time and strategy to kill 99 other players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's a high maybe.Pros Love how you can quickly enter new games after previous one ends so quickly. Almost no waiting. Squad setup system is wonderful and easy to use and perfect for friends. Basic rules and understanding of game mode. Visually pleasing and right on with sound(mostly) and ""realism""Cons The lag and rubber band along with the constant crashes really kills the game. Getting stuck in the parachute upon landing and hovering inchs off grouind has happened to many times. Makes getting to high targeted areas almost impossible due to getting shot at when you havent even landed. Low section of weapons water and background sounds glitch and create a deafening noise only 1 game mode as far as non custom games go.Point is I know the game is in alpha but to charge so much for a game that is 2/3 missing is awful. It has great potential and I hope to see it grow however it seems the trend for most games is to bank as much off ""alpha"" builds before the company bails.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game was praised at first but when any company that releases an early access game and gets that amount of money in weeks god knows that the game was already done for.We were promised many things but all we got was micro transactions when Bluehole literally said there will not be any transactions at all. Any money invested in this game is pointless now since they'll only invest into the most useless things such as esports and crates so they can make extra money. Anything that was anounced beforehand will probably not come out until a year after since their top priority is money.Feelsbad when an early access game starts off strong but failed to accomodate to any of the consumer's needs.

Battle Royale games can have a big learning curve but once you get over that curve there's a damn fine game waiting for you.

I don't understand what kind of idiots ban their players based on what a whinny streamer said. If the streamers don't want to die then maybe the devs can give them immortality hacks and let them play alone. Also the game runs like even in mid tier gaming rigs that according to their minimum requirements ( dev's) should be able to run the game fine. I give it 3 months before RIP if the continue along this path. Oh and btw it also has terrible hit detection and hit registration. Avoid at all cost.

2018-04-13,0,0,132,False,Not Recommended,The game was actually a lot of fun when Battle Royale was a whole new concept and I got back to playing it when they added the new map (December 2017). Since then it's been a downhill ride of cheaters Server Problems desync etc. and Bluehole decided not to invest their resources into fixing their ing game not into adding new content (as in guns or maps they did add like 2 new guns and announced a new map finally after a 6 month drought) they did not expand their staff with the mountains of cash this game generated they chose to add more ing LOOTBOXES (they even added some that need keys to make you pay twice for that 0.0000001% chance to get a rare item) and SKINS and EMOTES which not a single person even asked for.That's leaving aside the performance issues other people experienced (I have a i5 8600K 6x4.8GHz and a GTX1080 that could handle it in 2k at 90 140 FPS which is playable with GSync) and which always seemed to come back to the game with each new patch.Paying 30 bucks for it was maybe worth it back in the beginning but honestly?

2017-09-21,3,3,93,True,Recommended,"Pubg has done something that many games have not done in the recent years. Gaming has always been about feeling something and thats why people love gaming so much. Not only is gaming an escape from real world problems...but its something that can bring great joy. But I think many games today have lost some of there joy because they never properly punish you for your mistakes. For example games like call of duty star wars battlefront ect. These games don't punish you for dying if you die in them you can instantly respawn. If you die there is hardly any pain in that death. Which means there is hardly any joy when you get a kill. ""When you give up pain...you inevitably give up joy"". It would be like deciding to not buy a puppy because you know you will out live it and will half to witness its death. NO!(that is not how the world works). Even though you know you will watch its death...you still buy the puppy. Because you know the years before its death will bring great joy and will outway the pain of its death. Call of duty and games like it are the equivalent of not buying the puppy. And this is why I think pubg has exploded onto the scene like it has. Pubg does BUY THE PUPPY! You will have many deaths that will bring pain because when you do die it has real world consequences. But when you finally do win it brings great joy because there has been many struggles before it. When you win you feel something that you have been longing for. It brings a great adrenaline rush. Personaly for me it has been very a refreshing expierense. If you want to talk about the technacle side of the game I really enjoy how the long to mid range combat feels. My biggest complaint is that the close range compat feels abit lacking. And if you are a concidering buying either h1z1 or pubg(being a person that owns both games) I would consider h1z1 being more like a ""Marvel"" movie where it feels more arcadic because it doesn't take itself super serious. It's like a marvel movie has its intense moments but it also cracks a joke here and then. On the other hand I would consider pubg to be a ""DC Commics"" movie where it takes itself more serious.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-03,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,Everyone sees the obvious appeal that this game offers one way or another whether it be through obvious platforms like Twitch or Youtube or if they were just legitimately curious because they looked at the Steam page. Regardless of what provoked people to buy the game I can say that it is in no way shape or form worth that bulky $30 price tag. The idea of a fun game is there but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. With problems ranging from unstable servers unoptimized game performance dull gameplay and the questionable behavior of the devs PUBG is an incomplete game and will most likely stay that way for a long while. There are other games out there that provide a better experience and more unique gameplay for way lower prices sometimes even being available for FREE. Unfortunately by the time I realized all the previously mentioned issues I had too much game time invested to refund this. If you're on the fence about this game don't get it. Go look at other games with this concept that are handled way better and can deliver more bang for your buck. $30 effectively wasted.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They can't put the game down.I have never come across another game that has given a more exhilirating heart pounding ending when it comes down to the top 10 players of the match.

2017-07-22,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I have to say at least as is I just can not recommend this game. I understand I haven't exactly played a lot of it and I'v only had the game a few hours but here's why I can't recommend it Good features Nice engine graphical looks etc. Feels realistic... if it doesn't lag Nice movement and vehicle system though driving is a tad sensitive Nice options menu something which seems to be rare in early access games Bad features Lags like hell seriously this game randomly lags all the time no matter how good or bad your framerate is. It really destroys the experience esepcially when you're killing someone and a second later you're on the ground dead without the ability to do anything about it. Optimization is quite horrific two people could have the same graphics card and RAM but one will get 60FPS and the other wil be lucky to get out with 40. Had this happen to me and a friend just moments ago. Combat is... alright but could be improved especially accuracy of melee wepons (fists and frying pans especially) Steam friends/party system is pretty bad I could only invite 2 of the 4 friends I know who have it and the two of them were said to be offline even thoughthey weren't. They had to send invitations to me because the game on my side said they were offline and wouldn't let me invite people. A ton of little things such as the fact that you can't pick up ammo while being shot at that really get on your nerves especially in combat. It's a big mess. Cheating is a big big BIG problem with this game. People cheat their maps clothing and even weapons to death. While yes the developers are getting on top of a couple of the issues they haven't really solved much. I have been closely monitoring this game for a couple months now and the cheating problem is better but not by much. Overall PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds isn't necessarily a bad game. The big problem is just certain Early Access issues I guess. However with this game being out for as long as it has I expected a lot better optimization and a lot better qualiy of life in the game. Unfortunately this is not the case and I am sad to report I will be requesting my first game refund. I may pick this game back up later but not until at least a majority of these issues are addressed and the game itself is officially out of Early Access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-13,0,0,604,True,Recommended,Great game overall. Optimization in the Asia Server is widely received(Players from NA/EU are playing in the Asia Server too) Great DEVs for listening to the community with constant patches greatly improving gameplay each time mehAn In depth review for gamers still undecided. Special thanks to http //steamcommunity.com/id/aps97 for a well constructed detailed review.IntroductionPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle royale 100 players open world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo duo and squad (3 4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward you hop off a plane loot weapons armors and equipments from buildings and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle royale game out there yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known PUBG has had a highly successful launch securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle royale PvP look no further. You've struck the gold.My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion Pros1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle royale PvP games are mostly in Early Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no scoping bozos. A learning curve definitely exists not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi realistic weapon recoil and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles weapons weapon mods clothings and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV the game supports both FPS and TPS.Cons1. Currently very performance demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very low fps even on high end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum virtual RAMs can't help your 4 gigs RAM PC. In terms of GPU one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from &lt 30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke. I also suffer from extreme fps spikes with my GTX1080.As a response to comments' feedback for my 1st cons list The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops crashes and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high end rigs. It happens randomly I don't measure the frequency.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover but 2 seconds later blood spurts out of your chest you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO and Dota 2 you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game devs better fix this quickly.As a response to the comments' feedback I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally 1 or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid The controls are NOT reactive horrible for a PvP game.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to driveConclusionDon't lose all hopes because of my cons list remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!P.S I already addressed my low playtime hours issue in the comments section. Please kindly read all the comments if you believe my playtime hours is insufficient to write a review.UPDATE Never expected my review would go up top on Most Helpful for this game. So I've decided to not take down this review after having more playtime hours. I'll update it if there're any significant changes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-24,0,0,380,True,Recommended,Product received for free. A fantastic game that is truly immersive and creates moments of intense tension. The game is varied enough in terms of loot and location that it can sustain your attention for ages. It is not perfect weapon variety is somewhat lacking and the play zone does somewhat gravitate to certain areas it is a fairly hardware intensive game that is fairly rideen of bugs even if it is an EA game.Still this game is infinitely fun with friends and is incredibly satisfying and i would highly recommend the game.Also pan OP pls no nerf,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-13,0,0,63,False,Recommended,"7/10 I'd rate it. The game is good but the downside is that being an North Americaner there are a lot of people of Asian descent you end up playing with which makes the cultural and language barrier hard when you're trying to team up with them. They really should region lock this game... of the entire time I've been playing I've only been paired up once with an american.Another downside is that the game has one primary game mode which is a fast paced ""Hunger Games"" style. It would be nice to see something that requires more time and strategy to win or just an open survivor game to where you could bleed others slowly and make it more of a chase rather than a 15 minute rush round.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-30,0,0,171,True,Not Recommended,Ok this review is way way waaaaaaaaaaay over due as I have been having these problems for so f***king long its stupid.Let's get one thing straight I loved key word loved PUBG (Player Unknown's Battlegrounds for those that are autistic). So when I first time I played the game it ran lovely with 30 fps all good I play on a laptop fair enough but slowly I start to notice it cuts out my discord voice chat and I have to disconnect and reconnect to the chat after PUBG renders in that is then it starts to just sort of leave me on the loading screen and I can hear the plane cruise over the map.......F**king lovely the game is almost unplayable though I'll can play about 3 games or so before it does it. So I just sort of delt with it but now this the latest update its actually UN F**KING PLAYABLE every game now it does the loading screen thing but sometimes it doesn't do the sound part. I'm actually so done with PUBG its the reason I quit gaming for about a month all because of this. btw its not because of my parts its because of poor oppitise my friend that also plays on laptop as worst parts then me and runs it at 30 40 fps. so inconculsion PUBG was fun but it's jsut rooted and the servers are pretty horrofic to so DO NOT BUY this game until its fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-15,0,0,221,True,Not Recommended,Played for over 200 hours and alpha/beta tested this early access game. I enjoyed it quite thoroughly. Ultimately the developer sold out to microsoft for xbox exclusive and patches slowed down to a crawl. My largest gripe with this developer and game is that they went on record saying that the use of Autohotkey for button mapping like crouch jump or mousewheel to fire were not bannable. Proof https //i.imgur.com/kjYmwlY.pngI was just recently banned for what I assume was the crouch jumping and using mwheel to shoot they won't tell you why. At minimum they should have made an in game announcement that all .ini tweaks and macro programs running in the background were going to be prohibited. They did no such thing.

2017-08-07,0,0,146,True,Recommended,I'll give PUBG a positive rating overall albeit there is a bit to be desired still.The game can be pretty punishing in solo queue if you don't know what you're doing. Otherwise if you can generally survive until there are only about 20 people remaining the game can become super intense in a good way... or at least until you get sniped by someone across the map. But getting to BE that person who snipes another and take out all their progress up to that point if in my opinion worth those times you're the one being shot at. Getting kills in the game is satisfying and frustrating at the same time. The game tries to put on a face of realism in some ways but does the opposite in others. As an example healing in the game is ultimately dependant on the type of healing items you have with you and bandages are pretty useless in the grand scheme of things because of the high amount of time they take to use and the little amount of healing they accomplish.The gun variety is ok in a mediocre sense. Honestly once you find an assault rifle and/or a sniper the handguns shotguns and smgs basically become worthless by the end game. And I don't know if anyone else has this problem but the shotguns seem wildly sporadic with their accuracy which is peculiar for such a powerful close range weapon.Overall the game is more enjoyable to play with friends but can still be enjoyed if you're willing to put in the time and effort to git gud.On a side note with the most recent update apparently the devs of the game decided to break their promise on what they were going to do while in early access but I'm not as bugged by it as others even if it was pretty bad to lie outright to your playerbase like that. Hopefully this doesn't prove to be a signal for the future as the game has a lot of potential for future content.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-01,0,0,172,True,Not Recommended,I'm back for more! I'm editing my review to be more specific and less whiny. Hopefully you all fnd this helpful. Quick summary would not recommend unless you are playing with friends. I'll point out some specific gripes I have with this game now.Cons Cars and bikes with sometimes flip over the smallest rocks or ridges leading to damage or death. Not a fun way to go in my opinion especially when it's out of your control. I seem to have a lot of trouble with the server and lag in this game something I don't have trouble with (except very infrequently) in my other games. This is a constant every game occurence and has been responsible for my death multiple times. A more personal con is that this game doesn't seem to balance excitement very well. By this I mean that I can go 99% of the game without seeing anyone and then get shot and killed by someone I never see. Or get into a very brief firefight and have the game be over. It just seems to me that you spend almost the entire game gearing up for a big fight only to die rather quickly. It's not a waste of time but it definitely feels like I could have spent my time better. Don't get me wrong its a fun concept and it is early access which is why I'm still playing it. I've decided to give it until a little past release and if the devs fix the issues then I'll keep playing. If not I'll put the game down and most likely won't miss it much.All in all would not recommend for someone unless they are playing with close friends or are willing to take a gamble on the devs fixing quite a few issues.Editing to state that in my past few games I have had extensive periods of network lag leading to myself and my partner being unable to play. In my last game it was a total of 9 minutes with the longest period being two minutes. Incredibly frustrating to say the least.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,0,0,48,True,Recommended,You know there's a lot of games that get a lot of hype. Some of those games really just don't live up to expectations and others well others go above and beyond. PUBG is definitely a game that soars above expectations and really delivers an amazing multiplayer experience. PUBG really puts a new twist on shooter combat and creates an intense drive for players to survive down to the last man. And yes before you ask there are single duo and 4 player queues available. PUBG doesn't force you to play with random strangers if you don't WANT to play with random strangers they even let you choose to only hear your squad's voicechat if you so wish! There's also a ranking system but instead of making the game more stressful it only drives the player to succeed. You can approach the game with stealthy slow tactics or just run in willy nilly and try to take all the enemies down with you. This game offers a genuinely enjoyable multiplayer experience whether you enjoy tactics or chaos playing on your own or working on a team FPS combat or third person shooter combat playing casually or hardcore.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If I were to pick between PUBG and H1Z1 H1Z1 would get my vote as of right now. I really want to like this game but there are too many small issues that push me away. Also what is this whole thing with the streamers calling anyone who kills them a stream sniper? Like get a grip you got killed fairly.

2017-07-05,0,0,565,True,Recommended,Lets put it this way if you don't have time to dedicate to this game go home. Not that you need time to be amazing at it once you know the items and which attactments goes to what guns you get a grip on where to land depending on your playstyle and tweak the graphics settings so you don't get twitchy frame rate drops you're basically set to have fun. There in lies the time commitment though once you've got a grasp on how to be good then it's a race to the top. At least for myself that is I prefer the survival type of gaming not only because i'm not the best sniper as of yet but your kill rank contributes only 20% to your overall ranking so staying alive no matter what is more important in order to climb in rank and if you're good at that then 20 25 minutes per game is standard. And this game always leaves you wanting more.For those of you who are in it for the gun play and long range kills maybe this game isn't as gratifying since you don't get the tension of tracking every sound around you and the prep it takes to camp a location and strategize leaving a camp to acquire another but for myself this game allows you to have fun or be super seerious and still have a good time.There's also the play with friends aspect but that's more for fun in my book I prefer the solo grind and knowing my placement depends on my own personal decisions. The last thing to mention is this game is already great yea there may be some few things to whine about but in general it's made up for. AND IT'S ONLY GETTING BETTER three months into the alpha release and the Devs have shown that they actively listen to the community but also manage to suprise us with each patch whether it be new weapons operating optimizations that are noticable or as simple as making the circle less predictable.In the end if you have a PC that can run this game buy it now. If you plan on upgrading your PC in the next six months to the point of being able to play this game buy it because when this game drops for real if it isn't $59.99 I'll a brick thirty bucks is cheap for this level of content and remember it's always getting better new maps being hinted at more guns better mechanics this is a must have game.#IDon'tEvenPlayShooters #Top5kNASolo,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-31,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,Very poor game. Most servers will have over 100 ping. They say it's because of growing population but without a ping that's at least as good as 60fps there's no reason to even play. There is huge bullet delay almost no hit detection and yeah I'd say over half the players who play are cheating. This game isn't worth the money and is a ier and probably the same as H1Z1 except this one doesn't function at all. The rewards in this game are very paultry and are just wearing clothing that you literally get as the process of the game. In the same manner as H1Z1 they want you to buy those boxes with money as each box becomes harder than the last to get. For example if you lose every game expect around 22 points if you didn't hit anyone. This will happen to you alot due to cheaters or due to the fact that most allies will not speak your language unless you are Chinese or playing on EU. The first box is 700 next is 1400 next is 2800.The game is trying to be a survival/tactical battlegrounds but item drops are more than random. Go to a warehouse while someone else is nearby? Search the entire warehouse? Find a pistol! They found an automatic weapon with armor and a helmet and because they are cheating they also know exactly where you are. Enjoy.Doesn't matter what server you play on if https //pubg.disquse.ru/ registers as over 100 ms there is no point. Not worth buying this game on sale even if it was functioning as long as there are so many cheaters that the game actually announces it as a badge of honor. 1.5 Million cheaters out of 3 million concurrent players is absurd.

2017-07-23,0,0,136,True,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is one of the best battle royale games of all time With regular updates few cheaters and great gameplay I couldn't stop playing. Pros Plenty of loot. (Guns Armour ect.) Play with up to four players. Pretty good optimisation. Worth every penny. Regular updates. Make new friends. Cons The ocasional glitch. (Falling through the map Camera glitching out ect.) Loss of social skills. Your friends and family think your dead.Conclusion In conclusion PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is an overall excellent game unlike others that developers created and soon abandonded the developers pay attention to the community and are currently developing new maps gamemodes and gear based on what the community wants I highly reccomend you buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Then you will die instantly to someone you never saw.Sometimes you will see someone that doesn't see you and then you will kill them instantly.3/10 Funny at times but ham handed and childish.Ideas to make this a game that is actually fun Increase max health to prolong periods of combat and action Increase effect of gear so that it is actually useful Add direction indicators to aid a player under fire in having a fighting chance (Cause you know some people are deaf or deaf in one ear. Some people don't want to play with headphones.) Increase vehicle amount to allow players to mobilize across the map early game Decrease military grade SMG and AR weapon spawn (why grab a pistol when a UMP and AK are 30 feet away in any direction?)

People seem to get annoyed at the down time in the game that comes with the looting but this is mostly just a problem for Competitive Tournaments. I played DAYZ a lot and it feels good to loot up and then actually be able to fight someone. Updates for this game also happen quite often and it is obvious they are working hard on it.

So in a nutshell you win a chance to buy a key D 2. Have been experiencing random crashes lately. And usually when you have the sweetest game going on. Annoying 3.

We want to feel like we are overcoming the odds to defeat our foes. Killing dozens of enemies has gotten boring it lacks both personality and weight. PUBG gives meaningful weight to our choices and not just in a dialogue tree but within the gameplay itself.However I can't honestly recommend it right now because the game is filled with technical issues.

One map in the game. The advertisements show guns like snipers which are rarely ever found. You can't outrun the blue field when it is closing in on you. Within 5 minutes everyone is running around with M16's. Might as well start the match with them. The other half of the time there's to much useless crap spewed everywhere and you have to run through 10 houses and not find one gun. I have poured a full clip into someone and not killed them. I've been shot one time and knocked down. There's no balance. No skill in a guy with an M16 hosing down player's with melee weapons or nothing.

The fear that time is running low that eventually you will run into another player and it will only go one of two ways. You will either kill or be killed.However Game is buggy and glitchy with each patch seeming to do little. (Except from the launch patch which improved game performance and graphics but still didn't run completely smooth.)Vehicles can kill you if you don't come to a stop before you try get out.Maps are big but it ain't great when there's not much to do.Two maps which are both boring.Microtransactions added during early access with plans for many more.Streamers get automatic VIP status and are allowed to be absolute Cheaters are prevalent with little apparently being done by the devs.The creator seems to think that he pioneered the Battle Royale genre and gets y when other people copy the success claiming they're all copying his 'creation'.Even though I gave it a bad review I'd say it's still an interesting and fun game with some friends.Just don't expect it to be the raved up masterpiece that everyone claims it is.(Also I know it happened indirectly but this seems to be the cause of the new cancer that is sweeping the video game industry where every game feels it deserves a 'battle royale' mode.

2017-05-09,0,0,185,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is one of the most fun games I have played in a while. By no means will it win any awards on graphics story content or originallity but it is however an all round joy to play. Considering this game is in early access Im surprised on how great it already is. This game is great to play with a group of friends and you will undoubetdly get an adrenaline rush playing. Especially when it comes to the last 10 players. There is a nice variety of weapons and loot at the moment and Im sure as the game is updated more will be added. It is however poorly optimised as I find my FPS can dramatically drop even at low settings. The servers can also be extremly laggy and Ive also experienced the entire game crashing on me. However do take into account that this is early access and Im sure as they update it these problems will be fixed.

2017-04-15,1,1,33,True,Not Recommended,At this stage in EA PUBG is such a mess tech wise. Constantly dropping to 1fps while jumping out of the plane and for seemingly random other reasons. But not the reason I don't recommend it.This is based only on solo queue not squads or duos.My main gripe with this game is in fact the core gameplay. After 30 hours. Almost every single time I have died (99/100) before the very last circle is do to someone I did not see. This is a huge problem in solo queue. There is no way to retaliate and no sense of progression or accomplishment the last 10 min you spent running around was just a waste of time because you didn't find a level 3 helmet and took a headshot while you were running or driving. Each match is on a scale of pretty fun &gt complete BS. I find that I'm either jumping into an area with 2 10 ppl and somehow I end up in the 1 house without a single gun or I jump to BFE and don't see anyone till the last 20 survivors. Every single game I have to loot anywhere from 5 20 structures to feel ready for the last circle.When you're not getting shot out of nowhere or when you don't die in the first minute or so there is just this huge time gap in most games where nothing is happening and I just run around collecting gear for 10 mins and play about 2 mins of endgame. It gets repetitive Start New Game Collect Gear................................. Die collecting gear. GOTO 1 Travel to safe zone....................... Wait............................................. Win or Die. GOTO 1Also there are so many little annoying things that make the game frustrating a hell. The main thing... how the action button (F) works. Hit F to open a door... nope sorry that didn't work try again oops you hit it twice and it slammed in your face. Jump in a vehicle quick... nope... go ahead and stand there for 2 seconds before you can do anything. And just the collision detection of the game and jump mechanics. I'm sure all this little stuff will be fixed though.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-16,0,0,642,True,Not Recommended,I'll start with the cons as they can vastly ruin your experience if you're used to smooth gameplay.Cons Bad servers &amp High latency as a result players often teleport around at the beginning yourself sometimes spend up to 2 sec to open a *** door or loot an object on the ground. Numerous bugs for example you get stuck sometimes while switching weapons and are unable to select your weapon for a good 15 sec which equals death when under fire. For a survival game this can get really frustrating very quickly. Very vad optimization runs like garbage. I have an i7 5820K &amp 1080 both overclocked and still hit 40 fps in towns on lowest settings. Gunplay is slow switching weapons is slow. Bullets dispersion is too high at close range unless standing still which added to 3rd person cam highly favors camping vs active gunplay. Very narrow field of view &amp no setting to adjust it (for now). Pros Looks good on highest settings (but unplayable). Map well designed. Weapons balanced even with a handgun you can take out a geared enemy at close range if you go for headshots. Gun customization varied &amp usefull attachements. Teamplay is a blast (if slighty unforgivable but that's the nature of the game). To sum up fixing server issues &amp bugs should be a super high priority as it can really kill the mood when playing. I'm aware this is early access but EA should be about less content while still having a game run smoothly.I don't recommend it for now while those issues still remain and will of course change my review when the game is fixed. Early access games often tend to promise and not deliver (and why would they when they have already sold to most clients anyway).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,125,True,Recommended,tl drThoroughly enjoying the game so far makes some good improvements over previous iterations of the battle royale scenario. There are some issues but (for me) nothing game breaking. If you're interested in the game but don't have much money/decent system or you expect perfection from all your games then I'd hold off a month or two then reevaluate.HistoryPLAYERUNKNOWN has been a staple name in the battle royale game mode for the past few years. I had some good times playing Battle Royale in Arma 2 and then again in Arma 3. IIRC he won an award in the Make Arma Not War competition in 2015(?). This guy knows what he's doing. Unlike some other early access games from relatively unknown devs Brendan Greene has a good track record with this exact thing. He then worked with the H1Z1 team for a while as a consultant I believe on their KOTK mode before going out on his own.Pro'sRelatively easy on new playersSatisfying afFairly quick pacingModding and custom game modes on the roadmapUE4 engine gives plenty of opportunity in terms of reliability and ease of use (esp. for modding in the future)Decent variety of weapons and customisation alreadyCon'sIMO map is okay but I'd like to see another perhaps smaller map with some more opportunitiesNot a huge variation in terms of buildingsColours look a little washed out overallEARLY ACCESS SPECIFIC CON'SOptimisation is incoming (Part 1 ETA April)Limited range of servers currently (AU servers within a week probably SA and maybe NA East/West EU East/West)Main menu takes ages to load after every game???Can be laggy at timesSound could be improvedOverall polish neededI may add more above when I think of new things!OtherI can see with the BP system and the containers that there is likely to be microtransactions and/or Steam Marketplace to buy (hopefully just) cosmetic items. This should in theory be fine servers cost money to run after all but I hope that nothing will give real benefits in games. I honestly doubt this would happen but the possibility is there. The same goes for DLC. I hope any potential DLC doesn't fracture the player base as it could make finding games frustrating and boring.RE Performance I have a 3770K 16GB RAM and a 1070.

2017-10-26,1,2,976,True,Recommended,A great Battle Royale game you can play Solo Duos or Squads. Voice chat is available text is not don t really need text chat. I recommend a headset with a mic. Also is demand game on your computer check requirements.So basically you start at a spawn island before the match you fill up with 90 100ish players. Then the game puts you in a plane and can parachute out to different spots on a bigger or small island playable arena. Now you have to fight to be the last player alive hands if need be. Pick up loot backpacks (you need one) guns attachments melee weapons meds armor different clothes if you want. Blue Zones push players closer together they get smaller and increasing damage each round first round moves quick but slow damage. Fourth round also moves quick. There are Red/Bombing Zones that randomly dump bombs which will damage or kill you sometime you have risk it and move through them. There are high loot places/buildings (Warehouses being one such building) also more likely to encountering more players at those locations. There are low loot places. You parachute farther from the plane path and you are less likely to encounter players early on. Commonly dropped locations are School/Apartments Po i and Military Base. There are vehicles (cars SUVs Motorcycles Boats) to help you move along with gas cans. You can also run players over. If you playing Duos/Squads a player that is normally killed will be knocked out and a teammate can revive them the revived player has little health and generally needs to heal to survive. Also different weather effects beside the common normal day sunset (my favorite) rain and fog. (night/other options are rumored for the future). Yes the game is still in early access server issues at times lag desync some bugs cheaters (mostly using aims bots you will notice a name with a bunch of numbers/letter kill people on the kill feed on the lower left of your screen) but I think they will fix most of the issues and they have been fairly good about some fixes could have come quicker.

The premise is great and I got to the last 6 left alive twice in my first few games but the game is terribly optimized it keeps freezing up during gameplay its pretty much unplayable for me sometimes it freezes for a few seconds sometimes its up to 30 seconds by which time when it unfreezes i've been shot and am dead I suspect my character is just standing still like a sitting duck while this freeze is happening.i5 3570k970GTX8GB RAMWin 7 64Tried all the suggested fixes nothing worked. Will wait for its arrival on PS4 then maybe give it a go again as it does look fun but for a game that's sold 5 million copies and is still in the development stage so poorly optimized it doesn't bode well for the future. 4/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm fully engulfed and love every aspect of it. Sure for an Early Access game it has its few bugs but nothing is gamebreaking. The dev team is fully committed to the community and ongoing development of this game. Great things are on the horizon for optimisation patches as well. I've read that some say the game is too slow paced. Simply NOT TRUE. You choose how fast it is. If you want straight firefights and heavy PvP action jump into a large town/city and you get it straight away. You can jump further out and float to a further destination for a more relaxed situation and gear up then move to the PvP. Really all in your playstyle.

Yes the optimalization is bad. Yes there are some sound bugs. But the core gameplay is really good. If you have to compare this game to any other game H1Z1 is the one to come up in your mind. The basics are the same. You get dropped on an island and the goal is to survive and win. The biggest difference is that everything is up to you. You decide when to jump out of the plane you decide what to loot where to go. The most fun I got so far is just 4 man squad ( with friends ofcourse ). You experience so much together. Funny moments intense moments. You can find attachments for your guns ( which is a big + over H1Z1 ). The voice chat is very good. We had a 3 man squad and had 1 random with us. It almost felt like he was in the discord with us. If you look for a BR that drops you on an island with 99 other people. A BR that gives you joy excitement. Buy this game. it's not cheap.

2017-04-23,0,0,545,True,Recommended,This is an awesome game. If you like survival games and enjoy playing with friends then I would definitely recommend picking this game up. There is definitely a learning curve getting used to this game compared to some of the other Battle Royal games out there right now. It seems to find a good balance between H1Z1 and DayZ kind of gameplay. There are currently a lot of issues with the game. There is lag with the audio desync issues etc. However the devs are addressing these issues and this game is only going to get better definitely worth every penny even in its current state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-01,0,0,151,True,Recommended,Havnt played much but from what ive played its a more realistic h1z1 You actually need to spend some time looting to get a good rifle then atachemnts for it. Player skill and knowdlege means more in this game then h1z1 Both games have the same objective but completly different styles This is more realistic slow paced and more satisfying when you get that headshot off and win the game! Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!!!!!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-05,0,0,38,True,Recommended,I love survival games even though I am absolutely terrible at them but then again I am terrible at every game I play so keep that in mind as you read this review.The graphics on this game are not really what I would consider great but to me as long as it doesnt look absolutely horrendous I am fine with that also I realize this is early access so not a real big deal for me. The game does get choppy sometimes which can be a real bummer when encountering someone youre about to murder. But this is not a constant problem but does happen in every game I have played thus far. I am hoping this will be addressed in an update at some point but then I remember the game Dayz that was early access and still not finished after like five years so I am not sure.The game despite its flaws is actually pretty fun. I like the whole idea of slowly shrinking the playing field in an attempt to force people to murder each other. Other than that its a pretty typical survival game. Its not terribly difficult to arm yourself get backpacks and medkits. Essentially items are not scarce in this game. I love the fact that you start the game not knowing what weapon you will be using or if you will have multiple weapons to chose from. I like that you can upgrade your weapons and the fact that items arent scarce it makes upgrading them pretty easy. The downside is that the upgrades dont really do anything. I got a scope for my rifle but couldnt zoom in...even though its a freaking scope. The only positive to that is you dont have to worry about snipers at least for now they make actually change this so the upgrades actually have a point to them. I mean yea you can get a bigger clip and hold more rounds or a silencer but nothing else really has a point as far as improving your aim or being able to zoom in.I dont think this is a great game at least yet it definetly has potential. It is fun as it is right now but there does need to be improvements made and I am hoping the development team doesnt slack off like the developers of Dayz did and chose not to finish the game at all. Overall even though I am terrible at this game I still have fun. But the most annoying part of it all is when you get killed your game is pretty much over and you gotta start the whole process of getting into another game again which does take more time than it should. I was hoping for a spectator mode to watch the remaining participants and maybe even learn things I didnt know before to better my game nope dont have that option which really pisses me off. They do however give you ample time to scavenge before limiting the playing field so you dont feel too much pressure to get armed before moving to the playing field. I dont know I dont want to tell you how to spend your money. I like the game but I am not sure its worth the price right now maybe wait for a sale or for them to finish the game itself before buying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-09,2,1,1260,True,Not Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a very fun game. It is a battle royale where you fly down from a plane and grab random loot and shoot everyone you see(other than your friends obviously). There is a circle that closes in on the map and you must always stay inside or you will die slowly. I love this game but there are definitely pros and cons.PROS Fun time wasting. Various guns and shooting types and stuff for your liking. Easy to learnMany more that I can't think of off the top of my head.CONS Server lag Optimizations... Laggy as bro. Guns don't work properly sometimes Hackers hackers are literally everywhere. * Edit Hackers have definitely decreased. Developers dont like to update the game until the last last last LAST second. It's been out for over a half of a year and they aren't fixing it. Vehicles get stuck and you blow up instantly. Falling through map.All though there are so many bugs with the game right now and way more cons than pros I still believe in the game and I know when it first releases it will be smooth and great. If you want to play the game please get it when it releases unless you want to experience cancer. Thanks for reading this and I hope you like this review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have spent so many hours running around and collecting stuff and hardly killed a soul. It is the same over and over again and you do get fed up with doing the same thing.

2017-04-16,0,0,114,True,Not Recommended,As a sidenote before I get into the review I just want to say I really like this game. Playing this game with a buddy or 2 is super fun. I really want to see this game go places. With that said do not buy this game in it's current state. I abosolutely hate it when devs release early access games. This game doesn't even feel like its in a beta state. There are some areas where FPS will drop to 10 15 and even when FPS is still good the game is super choppy. There is always a delay when hitting f (the interaction button) when you want to do anything. Whether it be picking up a weapon ammo opening a door or getting in a car. I have problems with hitbox registration sometimes. It feels like I put 15 rounds into someone before they die. Some weapons that have a full auto setting are bugged when you use full auto especially the micro uzi. It will seem like they are only shooting 1 or 2 bullets at a time when in reality they're unloading a full clip into you. I've had many issues with sound bugs in the game. Some examples are when you're in the plane the audio will cut in and out. The sound effect of a reload or bullet casing hitting the floor will almost always play when you switch weapons. I also have problems with the aiming system. When you have any type of scope on any weapon and aim with that weapon a black box will appear in the middle of your screen and pop in and out of view blocking any shot you could have on someone. There are SO many more bugs I can cover but I dont have the patience to type them all out. To make a long story short this game REEKS of an alpha build game and is not even close to being worth 30 bucks in its current state. Wait till it goes down it price or goes on sale to buy it. Also cheaters are ing rampant in this game but that comes with any new and popular game that is released nowadays.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That said supporting mods isn't a bad thing and and adding a ""mods/no mods"" mode select down the road would be a nice option. Also you aren't really playing for anything other than cosmetics so this is less of a deal breaker and more of a detractor from the fun.Limited game modes so far (Free for all as solo duo and team and thats it)Pros They took out a lot of what makes survival pvp games infuriating and kept almost all the good stuff. The game requires tactical thinking situational awareness and patience almost as much as good shooting skills. The system of a diminishing play area and a large map help keep the game fresh while the fact you start every game from scratch means you (usually) don't get upset when you die and lose your gear.TL DR I usually hate pvp games and I enjoy this game.

2017-06-03,0,0,428,True,Recommended,TLDR Wholly addicting. A game purpose built and done as close to perfectly as can be expected.I have fallen in love with this game. Most nights I found myself playing til the sun comes up and by no means am I good at the game. As of writing this I have a 33% win/loss ratio (about 66% top 10 ratio). However the adrenline rush of almost making it is something I have never felt from agame before. I can feel my heart thumping when I get down to 10... 8... 5... 2. I think that' the real addiction. The thrill the rage when you get/miss the final kill. I understand my experience also seems to be the minority. I have no problem pinpointing sounds I have no problem with lag (though net coding seems to be quite an issue but what game isn't it) I have never seen a hacker.Pros The rush like no other Excellent Sound gunfire vehicles footsteps are bit loud but what can you do. Good selection of loot/guns just enough to not be confusing and not too many as to be worthlessly similiar each gun has its purpose. Vehicles Good map design wide range of situations one can find himself.Con Net code I am definitely not the only one who has shot someone in the back 4 5 times (with blood splatters mind you) only to suddenly be killed by the same person because none of my shots connected on their end and they also probably were facing me to start. This happens only every 1/5 games but its immensly frustrating for an otherwise smooth experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,355,False,Not Recommended,Back in PUBG's release in early 2017 it illustrated some very promising aspects to become an outstanding battle royale game and had potential for incredible development. That was before the money and fame got to the developer's head of course.As it's popularity sparked throughout and to the end of 2017 the development of the game was clearly comprised of money and simply lack of care and interest which has ultimately caused it's downward spiral and has resulted in the poor state it's in at the moment.Broken game? Let's release a purchasable battle pass!An early 2017 PUBG saw the developments listening to the playerbase however moreso recently all the decisions regarding the game have just been based on money and microtransactions.Countless bugs have existed and they seem to be in no rush to fix them albeit most of which are game breaking. You can often find yourself blowing up randomly upon entering vehicles shooting through one way fences being in launched in the air in certain vehicles.Updates are also very sloppy and seem to do nothing as they constantly break the game causing it to go into maintance for an indefinite amount of time.

2017-06-14,0,0,1054,False,Recommended,Cons Seems to be a large number of cheats? Yes. There's no denying that. That being said Bluehole do actually seem to be trying to combat the problem... I personally believe that the popularity of cheating comes hand in hand with the ability to sell digital items for use in the game for real money... Those who are using the cheats to gain a higher balance in their Steam Wallet would be doing it for other games who offer the same thing because thieves like that kind of free money but that's not really the dev's fault... short of stopping the tradability of of ingame items I think the cheaters are here to stay until they get banned and have to start up yet another account...People can whine and moan and carry on all they like but at the end of the day leaving bad reviews for something that is out of the dev's hands... bit childish to say the least... but that's gamers for you..PROS Absolutely love this game. Yes it's early access but unlike some other early access games this one has some solid work continually going into it.This is by far the best (in my opinion) casual basic FPS you will ever come across. You can go solo partner with a mate or squad with 3 mates. Everyone gets dumped on an island find your own protective gear offensive gear and go hunting or sit back and wait in a safe space. You can shoot people you can hit them with a crowbar or machette or even a frying pan hell you can run people over! What's not to like?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I love winning and knowing that you managed to win out of 100 other players is a feeling like no other but on the flip side there is nothing more rage inducing than being top 10 and being sniped from a mile behind from someone still outside the zone.

2017-04-18,0,0,81,True,Not Recommended,"The following review has been written during a very early early access.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale third/first person shooter with a semblance of realism behind it. 100 players enter through a plane and only one two or up to four can leave as a winner. That is honestly all you need to know about the game. There is next to no story and even if there is some backstory it is not needed to enjoy the game at all.Lets start with the good stuff The one map that is in the game is fairly large allowing probably even more than just 100 players to get lost in it. The sound system while glitchy is fairly good for a game of this theme. There are some problems but I will explain those in the cons section. Guns sound pretty well explosions are loud and generally the sound is just about right. Movement options are fairly great. Very reminiscent of ARMA 2. The game is really fun with friends. It has potential.Now the bad stuff Gunplay. While semi realistic most of the guns either feel like they lack any punch or they have way too much punch. From my experience there are numerous occasions of shooting someone several times (lets say 12 times with an AKM) and your opponent is still running around as if nothing really happened. And then you have weapons that touch you anywhere and you explode. Feels like the game would be better if it chose either strong weapons but a lot of cover or weak weapons with movement being the most important thing. Right now the weapon you find tends to dictate whether you are gonna have a good time or not. Not your skill. Map design. While I appreciate how large the map is there is a major problem with it. I hope you like to be sniped out of nowhere because that has been about 90% of all of my deaths in this. Players know which weapons need very little to kill you and since the maps are very elevated and scopes are fairly common most of the time you are gonna just shake your head and wish the game had a damage indicator. Shot recognition. While the sound design is generally great being able to tell where you are being shot from (and we are not talking about silencers) is almost impossible. Quite often the sound can be coming from one direction and you are actually being shot from behind. This has been proven by several video makers and streamers with some of the best headsets on the market. Lack of any tactics. Sniper is king in this game. The moment you find a weapon that can take a scope and the aforementioned scope you become the king of the game. This would be ok if you could in some way make sure you gain these. Usually it is entirely 100% random who gets these and if you do not find one in the first 5 6 minutes of the game you might as well disconnect cause that there is game over for you. There are no defensive measures in the game. No mines no traps. Not to mention even the sneakiest movement still makes so much noise that only a deaf person would be caught off guard by you. RNG. If I say that sniper is king in this game then RNG is the queen. The circles are 100% RNG. You may think you have jumped well gained some gear killed some people and then you notice that the circle has moved far away from you and the way towards it is bound to have at least 10 snipers waiting specifically for you. When it happens once you are miffed but its ok. When it happens ten times in a row you really feel like throwing the computer out of the window. Optimalization. As of writing this review the game is barely playable. There are people who can play the game just fine but majority of people with both bad and good RIGs are having trouble playing this game no matter the settings. Again even video makers and streamers with beasts for computers have reported major problems with optimalization. Lets not even mention constant crashes falling through scenery being blocked by invisible walls etc. Lag. As of writing this review majority of people are having major connection issues. Even people with legit really good broadband. For me for instance it is actually better to play on NA server... while I live in Central Europe. Rubber banding will be the death of thee at least a couple of times. Hit recognition is terrible because many times you unload 5 shotgun shots into someone and they kill you with a couple of pistol bullets because on their end you did not hit them and the servers ""decides"" who was right when it synchronizes. Hackers. Anyone willing to look into the darker corners of the Internet can see the market for the hacking tools for this game bearing major fruit. Why? Because it is an early access game that grew way too quickly for it s own good. Not to mention it is made in an engine that is by my knowledge very easy to hack into. It is sad and all we can hope for is that the developer will find a way how to deal with this menace. Right now it is almost more probable to find a hacker than to find a clean player. Rules. Anyone who puts ""These rules are neither final nor exhaustive we reserve the right to suspend disruptive users even if their behaviour doesn t fall under any of the above rules directly.""Is a fake person who just wants to power mongrel other people. Basically the devs are saying they can ban you for anything even nothing at all. Stay away.TL DRGame has a lot of potential if the developer decides to fix the major issues balance the game a little and add to it. It is currently in Early Access so it should not be a problem. I cannot recommend the game in it s state though I will continue playing it because even through all of it s problems it is a fun game with friends.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-01,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,This game at first was extreamly beautiful and fun but the longer I played and the more it got updated I found myself just ignoring it less and less. The game runs poorly even after full release and the developers rather line their pockets with cash instead of fixing their game. For the longest time this game also was shoving the newest map down your througt. The developers just keep dropping the ball more and more and unless they release a giant update fixing the bugs and actually making the game fun I can't recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-30,1,1,208,True,Not Recommended,"Well here we go...PUBG is a fantastic game at its core but most recently it has been plagued with Bugs in game advertisements (holy you make how much money and you have to advertise your own game IN GAME WTF) and overall bad optimization. I personally have a 1950X GTX 1080 Founders Edition 32 Gb of ram etc... and I cant even get 60 FPS on high settings. I know it is not on my end due to other games running completely fine but this one is just crap. Secondly you add in advertisements for your own game in the game itself. You guys have profited at least 1 million dollars and you had to put in graphics in game that say ""Watch our ESL game coming up (like anybody cares)"". It makes nobody want to watch it and it is just sad that you had to steep this low.Lastly the bugs. Holy the bugs. This game on my computer alone crashes at least 2 3 times per game due to unoptimization and some major bugs Get your together Bluehole and fix this game. Overall I would love to give this game a ""Yes"" recomendation but with the current problems and ads (in a $30 game that we have to pay for) I have to say no.

However this game really needed this huge thumbs down because of the cheaters in this game. You know I can handle chinese ers teaming but what I certainly can't handle is the hackers in this game. Hacks like aimbot wall hack and speed hack to name a few ruins this game soo much and these hacks aren't just used by chinese ers who suck at the game but almost every server will have a pathetic little scripter. Until this game get's a better anti cheat system and permanently ban players who cheat along with their IP this game should never leave early access and is just a waste of money. 2/10 would not buy.It s been a couple of months since I wrote this review and every single word until now stay true. The hacker problem has not change but significantly became worse and not to mention the optimisations sucks. Of course as any devs and company they will add loot boxes which get this they promised they weren t so a big you to that. 1/10 this game sucks it s great and all but the community sucks microtransactions sucks and the devs sucks. If you want to waste money on this go ahead but I would rather suggest investing on games like rainbow six siege where the devs actually care about the community and player base.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-26,0,0,50,True,Not Recommended,Game's average score of 60% is quite fu cking generous.Bluehole is the home to some of the worst programmers in gamedev. I chuckle every time game thinks for 2 3 seconds to show me the most basic ss settings window. Or how it reloads the scene to go to main menu... Oh wow. I didn't work with UE in professional capacity yet but coming from other engines i programmed a demo in UE that had better User Experience and much more though out behavior performance in a week. And for network interactions it is clear that they use the basic UE components not even remotely optimized for such use case.And after greeting you with the most shameful use of UE it moves on to the worst jankiest gunplay you can imagine. Every gun feels completely wooden with recoil and spread that doesn't make sense. Animated and aligned to camera so poorly i'd rather shoot out of my cat's And i'm not even talking about (lack of) such nuances as informative sound and overall game balance. They game is too far from it and is unlikely to ever reach that point. And although it says my ping is around 80 100 i usually have around a second(!) of actual lag. Combat goes like that we shoot at each other while shaking and sliding around then someone dies randomly. Aside from bad code predictably it's optimized like Although my 6800k/1080ti tank through it most of the time i still get framedrops.It's nothing different from any other survival game thrown together out of random assets copy pasting scripts to make it barely work by a bunch of 16 year olds. And since it first came out it is in perma early access of course. And of course since they are completely incompetent the game updates(typically for early access crap) at snails pace. And changes that take a normal team hours these duma sses can't(and can't be bothered as well) cobble together in months. All the viralness doesn't make it a tolerable game there's nothing good about it and perma early access doesn't justify such poor quality and overall incompetence. I'd advice to wait for another game in this genre that is actually functional.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Great move on the death cam you now not only show how bad the hacking situation is yet you still won't region lock or ping lock servers to prevent these filth from infesting other regions.Its that bad that 9 games out of 10 you die by some azz hat with aim bot. Watching deathcam and all i see is the ground because thats what his hack does is shoots the damn ground and im dead..OR the instant movement to your location because he has aimbot and wall hacks..Come on people wtf.. Its sad because this game is so much fun to play it just isn't fun when there is a way to prevent like this from happening but it won't fill there pockets..If your happy to play with unfair non english speaking people then by all means play your little heart out..If your smart and an actual gamer you wouldnt even bother with this sheit until they put something in place other than crappie BE,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-02,0,0,248,False,Recommended,"This game is not what you think. There is a whole secret code thing going on in this game. Some penguins pretend that they are babies (known as pookies). They sit around and act like a baby (basically typing in baby talk into the chat function) and dress a certain way with a certain color skin. Then then try to get picked up (yes you read that right) by a ""mumu"" who is a mom figure. The pookie penguins will say things like ""Pick mwe!"" (that's the baby talk). Then if they get picked up they will go back to her igloo and do whatever the mumu says. Then there are things called ""Pookie Contests."" You go to a penguin's igloo and all of the pookies dance around and say cute things and try to get picked. There are also all sorts of things going on with this basic storyline including mumus nursing their pookies giving birth to their pookies and sometimes abusing their pookies. And then she may dump the pookie whenever she feels like it. There is more weird stuff going on too that I won't get into. If your child is a new member they will be a pookie. How Disney thinks this game is ok is beyond me. They sure talk up a good game with all of their nonsense about moderation. Then Club Penguin sponsors some cyberbulling education program. What a joke!

It's a slippery slope and impossible to prove most times save for when people drive up in a vehicle and honk which also gets you banned apparently.It's apparent that the devs words mean next to nothing when it was stated they wouldn't be releasing microtransactions until after Early Access.

Most of the negative reviews are from people with sub par gaming rigs/don't understand what Early Access means. Of course there are other issues like hackers (haven't seen any in my 320 hours at time of review) annoying bugs and a China region specific Ad related issue (at time of review).Good bits Fantastic range of weapons which are mostly balanced and all have their uses. Core mechanics work well with major potential for improvement/other modes &amp features. Development team have released a lot of updates. Every game is different. Real world military tactics work well. You can play in your own preferred way (going for kills/wins/fun/sneaky etc) The rush of getting high tier loot from a drop Bad bits While they have optimised the game significantly since EA release the game is still very unoptimised. Sometimes you get killed because of bugs/glitches/major sudden FPS drop. No Region lock. Main Menu UI is a tragedy. Pre game lobby is a mess. Audio has been in need of work for months (levels/clean up/improvement/direction),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

HACKERSFor a person with 200 hours (and counting) i havent really encountered many hackers they are there but i havent really ran into many (dont get mre wrong I hate hackers as much as the last guy but for me they havent been much of a problem).OPTIMAZATION The game does have bad optimazation but if you have a ok computer ( 1060 gc i5 8gb of ram or lower or higher for all the parts you'll be fine). it does lag here and their but it does get better as time goes on.CHINESE The annoying chinese people in this game are like I said ANNOYING but really you only have to listen to them at the begining of the game ( plus if you just dont want to hear them at all just mute game chat). But I do feel like they should region lock china bc most of the hackers are chineseCOMMUNITYThe community really isnt that bad (except for those dang annoying chinese people) people say like ""oh nice kill man good luck"" but thats not all the time basically 80% of the time people are just quiet.DEATHS I have had my fair share of bs deaths but who tf cares really.

After I haven't played PLAYERUNKNOWN 'S BATTLEGROUNDS a day like my brother I borrow account to play the game I gave then he called me that he blew a games killed 15 people let me see if account is being checked I didn't care about I asked him did you use hacking or auxiliary software he said no I haven't asked. My brother wouldn't spend so much money on the game because it would cost thousands of yuan or a few hundred dollars for an auxiliary software in China. When I was playing a game at home the first two weeks several friends asked me to play PLAYERUNKNOWN's BATTLEGROUNDS and I went to the game account and found that the number was blocked. But I didn't know the English when I went to buy a VPN and my friend told me that my number was banned. If I quit the game to stop me I have nothing to say. But there is no need to permanently ban the ban and a few days of banning it as a warning. And that's not what I wanted. It's a computer glitch and a network problem.

Random errors prevent the game from launching since the official release update and requires multiple tries sometimes you'll start a match and all your friends are landing but your screen is stuck in permanent load and never tells you and you close and relaunch to find your stationary character unsurprisingly has been killed by someone who got to actually play the game this round. Fixing the install doesn't solve these issues and the PC is more than capable of running the game smoothly.

2017-11-23,1,1,933,True,Recommended,Despite the fact that there are a few hackers due to them being able to edit source files along with some server instability here and there the game itself is still enjoyable. I for one like complexity in games which is why I enjoy the mechanics in this game over any other Battle Royale type game on the market as of right now. The devs have been putting forward patches that add new weapons and features to the game. Sometimes each patch takes a step back in progress and causes some instability but with every new game that is released that is to be expected. Plus devs are quick to fix any hiccups that patches may cause as well.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-18,1,1,1047,True,Not Recommended,"tl dr version Game runs like a potatoe and the worst part is that performance is actually getting worse and not better. It would be forgivable if it was making improvements. Bluehole is in way over their head. They haven't a clue. Wait for a competitor who actually knows what they are doing to bring you a ""battle royal"" game. This is by far the worst early access game I have ever played. Not because the gameplay or the content are bad. It's because the performance and optimazation are game breakingly terrible. Unless you have a 3000 dollar computer build be prepared for constant frame drops and lag literally any time you do something more demanding than standing still with no other players around. With a 3k computer you'll still get problems but most of them will come from the terrible servers (assuming you can actually connect to them).",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-09,0,0,727,False,Not Recommended,I have almost 600 hours in this game and while I love the style and game play I just can't recommend this game at this time. There are FAR too many hackers. I read an article recently that claimed that out of the 4.5 million games sold 1.5 accounts were banned for hacking/cheating. To be honest in my experience that really doesn't even approach the real number. The big failure of this game is its inability or lack of interest to do something about the hackers.So for now while I love the game I just can't recommend it do to the absolute hack fest that has been going on of late.P.S. Oh and they REALLY need to do something about hopping and shooting. It would be very simple to disable a weapon when jumping or hopping just like when climbing BUT again that's something they don't seem to be interested in I guess.P.S.S. They need to region lock the game. The Chinese hackers and laggers have killed any chance of enjoying this game. The developer needs to pay attention to this or very soon the only servers they'll need are in China. If hacking and cheating is cool by the Chinese that's fine but how about we put up a Great Wall around them so they can't come out and play with the adults?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-24,0,0,1704,False,Recommended,To whom it my concern this is the game I've been waiting for my whole life! PUBG is just absolutly perfect for someone like myself that doesn't want some crappy silly slapped together storyline (I can use my immagination for that if desired) as it has no clear storyline and jumps right into competition without much of an intro and basically just one rule be the last one survivng. You can take the game very seriously or just have fun messing around by yourself or with your buddies. The game is very unique and exciting at times it can make your heart stop from excitment I swear! PUBG has very big and immersive maps to play on leaving no two matches being the same. It can seeem very challenging at least I thought so but satisfying when you finally start to feel confidant and perform better. Best game I've Played in many years!

I can't tell you how many times I've peeked someone then gone back behind cover only to be shot by the same person who can't possibly be able to see/hit me. Poor optimization is another big issue. So many people have a texture bug that makes he game unplayable for the first minute or so of you being on the ground. Instead of fixing that they devs decide it's a better idea to add more broken weapons and micro transactions. These people clearly don't care about their game or fixing it. It might be in early access but you'd think that they would focus on making the game better and more optimized rather than adding things that make them more money. With the texture glitch structures are not solid. If you land at shelter and have this bug you can try to go in and it will put you under the map where you can easily win the game without any items.

In fact there is clearly less optimization as i am no longer able to join a game without crashing. Seriously the devs have been focusing on pumping out more content each patch which most should be kept for the polishing stage (i.e animations updating sounds etc.) rather than fixing all the core issues of the game (i.e crashes BUILDINGS NOT RENDERING FULLY server wide lag spikes etc.) Constantly had issues with this games buildings not rendering for the first few moments of the game which usually results in death or having to run away till they render.All these issues have dozens of forums pertaining to them yet what are the devs response after they are made aware? Microtransactions? what a joke... and they already are hosting Esports tournaments.... how dare you.P.S Hmm you would think they would be able to fix this broken game with the experience the dev team has prior to creating this game. Not too mention the over 100 million dollars they made which could go to expanding the team and focusing on core issues... where does all that money go?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-20,0,0,1062,False,Not Recommended,Problems in order of highest importance.1. Region lock the ing game. Nobody wants to play against someone who has ing ridiculously high ping. If you won't do that then have ping that exceeds 200 incapacitate players until it drops below that threshold. If none of this happens we will all continue to assume your engineers are college drop outs or that you just don't give a about equal play and are money hungry jews.2. ing do something about your hacker problem. You are very well aware that most of the hackers are Asians and continue to ignore them. Region locking would kill off almost all the hackers and the unfair ping advantages.3. Your games optimization is STILL atrocious. Big cities gunfights or small zones destroy FPS. I'm surprised this game is even playable for people who have builds under a grand.4. Your new map ing sucks. Not only is the terrain ing awful but you add in the absolute worst possible vehicles to the map that makes it almost pointless to even attempt driving unless you get the motorcycle.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-07,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,"I've had almost nothing but fun with this game from it's start as a mere baby Early Access title through to it's maturity and final ""launch"" as a Microsoft PC and XbOne juggernaut. The combat is rewarding the scavenging is quick enough most games that it doesn't get overly repetitive (this is further mitigated playing in groups as allies can find you gear as well to ease your search.) The gameplay feels tighter than all the BR games out at the time and whiule there were (and are) bugs abound overall the game has been a fun and worthwhile experience....... BUT...Recently the game has been plagued with a plethora of issues. Cheating and ""hacking"" going on in a HUGE capacity like so many. Seemingly all from Chinese players to boot. Players killing me with cross city headshots using shotgun hipfire getting sniped through the back of the head in a truck that they don't have line of site on the list goes on for cheating alone.Then you get to the server and lag issues the black screen when loading into a game all the way up to ejecting from the airdrop.Also lootboxes... in a paid title it's a bit sad. I was fine with the boxes being gained solely through gameplay but being able to buy them outright through the steam market or through buying their in game currency... But now 50% of the time you'll get a crate that you HAVE to pay to open and the drop rates for ANYTHING good are absolutely atrocious. So atrocious in fact that these items are sold on the marketplace for literally thousands of dollars. It's absurd.In the game's current state I'd advise you not to pick it up. As a game that's supposedly ""complete"" as in 1.0+ there's way too many bugs but the biggest issue is the developers inaction in regards to the cheating situation. It would be a simple matter to region lock the game so the Chinese players who are statistically doing a majority of the cheating have to play on their own server with each other. There should be 0 problems with this as there's clearly a large enough playerbase in China to warrant thier own server. This would also alleviate lag issues in regards to ping where shots you fire and kills you should get don't register because on their end they hit you before you even fired a round.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-04,0,0,188,True,Not Recommended,TL DR For the moment I would not recommend the game. The game has a lot of fun to be had especially if you play with a friend or two. However the fun is overshadowed by the amount of friction the elements of the game create. Wait for some patches to iron out the issues. The price is steep compared to what you get right now.The game on absolute lowest settings makes even high end rigs work harder than they should. It turns my usually quiet gtx980 into a wind tunnel on commission for NASA.All of the games calculations and actions are handled as far as I understand on the server end. That in turn means that anything you do or rather want to do is first sent as a request to the server. The server then handles the request and sends the visual representation back to the client. Depending on how fast the server reacts as well as stability of the connection to the server this can range from something you barely notice to an extreme element of frustration. As an example if you want to open a door you press the interaction button. Then you wait anywhere from 100 milliseconds to 1½ seconds for the server to handle your request. The door is then opened in the game world.Watching your character desperately trying to pick up a first aid kit or the UMP you need to protect yourself for the 5th time in a row is just asinine. The experience is only worsened when you pair it with the intensity of fire fights. Waiting for the server to wake up as you attempt to claw your way into a car while you are being shot at turns the asininity into infuriation.The vehicles all seem rather top heavy as they can easily topple over and land on the roof from a slight bump on the road.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is what i think of PUBG.Cons A Lot The game is not optimized at all although yes it is in ""Early Access"" for a game worth $30 USD its sad. Also blue hole is trying to get pubg into pro league type stuff. The game is still in development and they are already trying to get the game in pro league. Unless the game is basically finished their is no way in hell they should be doing this.The game is dependant on ""RNG"" which is bad. Why you may ask let's just say their is you and one other person. You go in a building and so does he all you find is a trash pistol but the other guy found a UMP and a helmet. Lets just say it will not end well for you sorry bud.The game is boring admit it. At most if you are like me will only get about 80 to 100 hours. Out of PUBG . Most games you will never see anyone till very late game and when you do you are trash because you have not gotten in a firefight with anyone yet. Or you have games where you will see people everywhere but you will most likely get killed because there are people everywhere. The market it aids. So you are telling me that you are selling a trenchcoat that you can literally find in game and put on for over $500 USD. Kill me and what's worse is the clothing adds more space to the amount of items you can carry so yes PUBG is pay to win or well succeed a lil bit more.Back to the game is not optimized at all at the top of my review i used to get 120 FPS on pubg. I have a GTX 970 but ever since they added the stupid first person only gamemode i most games barely get 60 FPS. On top of that the game is super buggy half the time i can t even load into one single match. But blue hole and the stupid that wanted his name on the ing game are too ing busy with Pro league and a ing desert map. Really you guys have so many problems with you stupid game fix them first we all know how bad you guys first pro league was.Pros surprisingly ..I gotta admit pubg is a new type of battle royale it's not your everyday game that releases every year it's new clean and fresh .Summary In all respects this game could ve been a good review if they fixed all the problems. In my opinion i cannot recommend this game at all maybe if it goes on sale then sure go for it.

2018-01-02,0,0,75,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Gameplay has issues software has a lot of bugs and the development is slow and focuses on things other than gameplay and bugfixes.GAMEPLAY HAS ISSUES Not everyone may agree on this but this has bothered me the most about this game so it is going in my review. The gameplay sucks.The gameplay area is shrinking by a blue circle when you are outside this shrinking circle you die. They do this to drive the players towards each other which is nice. You have to keep moving and often running or die. The problem is that the circle is shrinking WAY too fast for this type of game.The game is slightly realistic in that a few bullets kill you (or one well aimed head shot) which means there is often not much time (if any at all) to shoot back when an opponent shoots you first. This causes the game to be often about stealth. You don't want to be spotted first. To survive you must spot the others before they spot you. But that does not work when you are forced to run. Thus the game is often like this Drop from airplane loot loot loot run run run KRAKAKAA! dead no chance to shoot back.The solution which for me would be acceptable is simple make the blue circle shrink like 3 or 4 times slower. Yes the game will take longer but that's what realism is. Otherwise just give me 4 times more armor so that I have a small chance to shoot back.SOFTWARE HAS BUGS Most reviews will tell you about this too. It often crashes there are graphics and audio bugs in the game and you can get stuck in places. Also the user interface is poor. Typical early access quality but this game is not early access (anymore) so it goes in my review.BOTTOM LINE I like the concept of battle royale. But the way it is implemented in this game is not working very well for me. Also the software needs a LOT of work to be of any decent quality.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-20,0,0,360,True,Recommended,"PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds' overall rating on Steam is a decent reflection of how well the player experience is. It is a mixed up mess. I am reviewing this from the US so I have not experienced or witnessed accounts of the so called ""horror stories"" that Chinese players and the like have unfortunately come across with this game. With that said the game is a technical mess. The inconsistent frames the poor optimization the devastating hit detection and the occasional server disconnections create an unfathomable frustration in all queues of the game. I can recall at least five instances of technical issues alone costing my squad and I a win and when the technical issues combine with the problems within the gameplay it almost feels unfair. Do you enjoy constantly running in a videogame for 15 20 minutes while simultaneously dodging incoming fire from multiple squads maintaining a steady stream of healing and looting the houses you pass for anything worth picking up? Well then you are in luck. About half the time I play this game I find myself on the run from the in game death zone that steadily shrinks the map down as the match progresses. If you're lucky you'll find a vehicle that can fit your whole squad and take you to safety. If you're lucky you won't get gunned down by another squad camping inside the edge of the zone as soon as you get there. Basically just get lucky and you will win. The game can hardly get the simple stuff right. I can't vault over a fence or five foot wall or even a rock for that matter the parachutes in the beginning of every match get stuck on everything and take forever to land you on the ground and the response times for in game objects you can interact with (like opening doors and getting in and out of vehicles) is clunkiness at its finest. That is what this game is clunkiness at its finest. The definition of early access trash. And I love it.8/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The desync can be terrible at times it doesn't matter how good your computer or connection is.You WILL die behind cover many many times (probably the worst thing)You WILL spray someone from point blank and half your bullets won't register causing you to dieYou WILL headshot someone with a sniper only for the bullet to not register because the server thinks they shot first again you'll dieThis doesn't seem to be fixable or I would imagine the devs would have resolved it already.If you can move past this and try to not get too frustrated at these things (I've failed at this many times) the game is great and I would recommend it to anyone who likes FPS.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've been trying to stick to PUBG for a few months now but the quality is just not increasing to meet my demands in all honesty. Graphics even when on Ultra for me appear to be something equivelant to an un modded original Skyrim for console.I just recently played 3 games after a two month hiatus from PUBG only to encounter non stop hackers. (I.E. someone killing 20+ people in about 15 seconds in a Solo game and other games where a floating player is teleporting around and shooting people.) Reporting doesn't seem to be doing much seeing how when I last religiously played PUBG the same hacks were being utilized.Honestly if you want to play a Battle Royale style game then Fortnite is probably my best suggestion to you even though I am not a fan of building your own enviornmnent instead of adapting to what you're already in in FPS style games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-02,0,0,978,False,Not Recommended,Bluehole are slowly sorting out the glitches.... and that's the issue the word 'slowly'. Bluehole try and put the onus on the customer when it comes to a bug/glitch. A common themes from BH 'have you tried this' have you tried doing that'... er how about trying to get a patch out! Battleye..... some of you will know what this means i now do since pubg and it's ruining the game for me. And yet again there doesn't seem to be any urgency to sort this problem and it's a massive problem for a lot of players at the moment (in a nutshell it stops you from playing pubg after a period of time). And before anyone comments yes i have tried (well my mate has tried via Team viewer every suggestion put on the forums but hasn't worked). And i never had an issue with battleye until the end of March 2018. Over 90 hrs played without any issues until battleye reared it's ugly head.And if BH don't sort it very soon this will kill pubg especially that fortnite is the same genre and free!The game itself is easy to play but hard to master with quite a steep learning curve when it comes to tactics and weapon attachments etc. There's only 2 maps and the latest one is quite boring. It doesn't give you the option to only play the original. Why they haven't got day/night cycles where you have to scavenge for night vision goggles glow stick and flare guns i don't know. It would bring a new element to the game. Plus a random weather system would be nice. And occasionally it would be nice that everyone spawns with the same gear i.e. a helemt vest an assault rifle and pistol etc.. that would make it a level playing field for a change.Pubg has so much potential but at the moment the perception is that the devs are only concentrating on money and getting more players (the new mobile version is out which is pretty pointless imo). Get the basics right first BH before trying to branch out!Would i recommend pubg at this time.... no. There's too many glitches and the perception is that the devs aren't doing anything about it. There's a distinct lack of communication from the devs as to when bugs/glitches will be put right. Don't buy for now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-20,0,0,484,False,Not Recommended,First of all As a Chinese player who temporarily lives in the United States I want to talk about geographical discrimination. When I saw Blue Hole chose to match Chinese players with Chinese players I feel very angry&amp sad because it chose to push the error to most of Chinese players rather than opting to update their anti hacking mechanism. Many Chinese players who do not cheating have been quitted this game cause by the behavior of blue hole That makes them feel THEY WERE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST Cheating occurs in every game every region and every server. This is a very common thing.You shouldn't blame the Chinese players.Another thing is PUBG's hardware requirements are getting more and more excessive. Minimum configuration as GTX1070 means what? U can even play GTA5 with A High with it remember! PUBG just is a mmogame! U ARE NOT A STAY ALONE GAME!!! The money players will spend on a 1070 can buy 20 PUBG(s).Blue Hole chooses to continuously improve hardware requirements instead of paying a certain cost to optimize the game.This illustrates the company s attitude towards players.If you saw it discounted and wanted to buy and it happened to see my assessment. Listen to me give up this game choose to play rainbow6 battlefield1 or fortnite with me these games are much more fun than f****** PUBG.Could you add me to your steam friend? If you are willing to experience some interesting games with me首先 作为暂时居住在美国的中国玩家 我想谈谈地域歧视问题 当我看到蓝洞选择将中国玩家与中国玩家相匹配时 我感到非常生气和难过 因为它选择将错误推给大多数中国玩家 而不是选择更新他们的反黑客机制 许多不作弊的中国玩家已经因蓝洞的行为而退出了这场比赛 这让他们感到他们受到了歧视 作弊发生在每个游戏 每个地区和每个服务器上 这是一件很平常的事情 蓝洞不应该让中国玩家背锅 另一件很重要的事是 PUBG的硬件要求越来越高 GTX1070的最低配置意味着什么 你甚至 甚至可以用把GTA5开到高配置畅玩 请记住 PUBG只是个多人网游 你不是一个单机游戏 玩家花在GTX1070上的钱甚至可以买20个PUBG蓝洞选择持续改进硬件要求 而不是花费一定的费用来优化游戏 这说明了公司并不重视玩家 只想着捞一笔就跑 如果你看到它打折并想要购买 并恰巧看到了我的评估 听我一句劝 放弃这个游戏吧 跑来找我我玩彩虹六号 战地1或堡垒之夜吧 这些游戏比f ****** PUBG更有趣 如果你愿意和我一起晚些有趣或者奇怪的游戏 就把我添加进你的steam好友列表里面吧,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is the first game I've ever played where I could actually feel my heart pumping particularly in the final circles when there are few people left.Unfortunately scriptkiddies are ruining the game. Since the game was published in China the number of hackers has grown so much that I'm seeing at least one scriptkiddy every game. TPP is so plauged with them that the game mode is literally unplayable (just played 3 TPP games died to a hackers in 2 of them). At this stage I can't recommend PUBG. I love the game but the sheer number of hackers results in the game being a frustrating waste of time. Until they take major action (such as a ping cap which prevents players from playing on servers that are physically too far away from them) do not buy the game.PS I have about 60 wins so I'm not just 'trash' at the game (not that I'm a god or anything xD),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-07,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,Player Unknown's Battlegrounds was a game that was created after seeing success of games like it. Like H1Z1 one of its main influencers it's a battle royale game where you collect weapons around a set map and fight to the death with one winner left remaining. Though sounding like a pretty simple concept for designing PUBG Corp formerly named Bluehole has failed to meet the mark like other better games of its same genre. Fortnite to give an example is a free to play game that has a much more polished design than PUBG. What was PUBG Corps response you may ask? They decided it would be a better idea to threaten a lawsuit that to actual fix their own game. That doesn't even get to how poorly they've taken care of cheating.Cheaters of PUBG congrats. You have nothing to worry about. At the time of me writing this review the anticheat put in place doesn't consider any of you a threat. Instead it goes after innocent players instead. Feel free to keep on cheating till PUBG Corp gets their act together. Teach them a lesson.All in all if you want a battle royale experience that will give you a rush I recommend a free to play title. Realm Royale Fortnite of even H1Z1 now are all free and much better than this pile of utter garbage. Until the developers get their act together please don't give these guys any money. For a game this long in the making it feels like a game built off of kickstarter donations. Leave this game to rot until a rework has been created. Thank you,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-27,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battle Grounds more commenly known as PUBG is one of the First Battle royale games That blew up. After Brendan Greene started working with the team who created another Battle Royale game Called H1Z1 King Of The Kill he decided he wanted to take is part on the whole Battle royale game and created his own game PUBG. The game gets more hate than it deserves. The cons of it are that there are many hackers Lots of bugs and how unoptimized it is. The Game improved alot since release and has optimised the game. You probably couldnt even run this game on a gt 1030 when the game first came out now you could probably run the game at around 1080p medium settings at 60fps maybe more. People say that he doesnt care about what the consumer wants and only wants to add cosmetics to make more money but its not really true there have been so many problems fixed since launch. Yes the more popular BR Game is Fortnite Battle Royale but player count shouldn't determine which game you should get. I would give this a 8.5/10Edit Most bad reviews are from people with patato pcs or ones who die to bugs alot. dont know if its true because i havent ran into more than 3 bugs in the 30 40 games ive played so far one of them was me getting stuck in the ground and moving very slowly which i fixed by just proning another was trying to pick items up without dragging them into my inventory and the other was just me crashing. if you have a pc over $300 you should be able to play it. hell ive seen it being play with a gt 1030. If people tell you that you cant play it with anything but a $1000 pc dont listen to them. My Laptop has a GTX 1050ti i5 8300h 2.3 ghz multi core processor and 8gb ddr4 ram with a 256gb ssd and the game runs perfectly on high and medium settings. while this is a $800 laptop with taxes included you could probably get the same build in a desktop for around $400 $600,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-20,0,0,827,False,Not Recommended,About to hit that 700 hour mark sadly. Although not be a large sum I believe it will entitle me to some opinions. Large player base for a game filled with bugs hackers inaccurate hitboxes and a ton of t... When I first started playing PUBG it was refreshing filled with game play experiences never experienced before from any other games. The concept was still new at the time even though Bluehole wasn't the first one to come up with the battle royale mode they had a pretty damn fine Interpretation of it. Learning how to play the game was exciting! Call me old school but I'm the type of person who sticks to one or two games and rarely tries out differnt games. When I when won my first chicken dinner which was about my 100 hour mark it was exhilarating my heart was pumping hands shaking and hungry for more. Been a long time since I felt anything like that but soon as I continued my fruitless attempts at claiming the ever so elusive dub some of the reasons why it was so damn hard to come out on top was because the game itself was never going to let you have the chance to win it in the first place. The game is a walking living breathing bug you look at it the wrong way and it'll come flying at you and kill you in the most random way possible but me being me I didn't let it bother me too much I had faith in the Dev team to fix the issues in time...(Oh how wrong I was) These guys do not care for their consumers as long as 51% of the player base stays content. (Chinese players) Which brings up the next reason why I choose to not recommend this travesty of a game. Hackers are out of control in this game and Bluehole shows no sign of stopping them any time soon. There will be a hacker in your game atleast every two to three games and trust me when you're in that top 10 thinking about that dub and all of a sudden you get a shot to your head out of nowhere only to find out it was a hacker that pisses you off. Again I was naive I trusted the Dev team once more... I was patient forgiving and tolerent. Not a huge baseball fan but like the rule implies three strikes you're out. Where do I draw the line? When Blueballs Entertainment decides to give me a bann when I'm the one who's been killed by hackers the one who plays the game fair. Are you kidding me? Worst part is they don't even give you a reason why they banned you. Thanks Bluehole I think I know why Fornite has a larger player base than you guys. Sorry for the long rant if somebody managed to make it down this far I was looking forward to playing some games this weekend but was pleasantly suprised by the bann message instead. Just PUBG things.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's really fruststrating if you survived to the last 12 or something and then you get a disadvantage because someone in the squad just freezes. Get it fixed and i will totally recommend this game again. Until then keep your hands off its not playable anymore!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-13,0,0,853,True,Recommended,PROS Fantastic game for the survival nut and competitive player. Using every advantage you can to survive and come up on top in this post apocalyptic Battle Royal style arena.The gun play is wonderfully satifying and the unreal engine allows for good reactive shooting with very little latency.The game is beautiful if you ever want to be at a disadvantage while playing on ultra but even on low it can be very enjoyable to look at.CONS The resource hunger of this game is insatiable. It want to use all of the system ram then move it into the vram while hitting your CPU like some sort of deranged video encoder. But after the first minute of dropping frames and unreactive doors the game runs smoothly. (Running on a pretty high tier PC)Vehicles need work but I'm not going to harp on about a game that's still in alpha. For an alpha its teathing problems are made alot better by the holy refresh button on the top right.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-31,0,0,42,False,Recommended,PLAYERUKNOWN'S BATTLEBROUNDS is a fun fps/tps open world survival multiplayer game. For me at least i've experienced very few in game bugs/glitches. Now before you buy or consider buying I feel oblidged to inform you of some things to be aware about. Firstly you should have a microphone as the game has no in game chat like other multiplayer games like CS GO. Despite saying you should have a microphone you don't technically need a microphone as the game doesn't require one in order to be played you can still play the game without one and communicate to an extent with gestures/taunts. But if you plan on doing co op or as the game calls it duos or squads (where randomly assigned 4 player squads are created and fight to the death) or customly created duos and squads communication is of the essence. Secondly you DO NEED a good computer to run this game as I've heard people say the game will just crash if their computer doesn't meet the bare necessities. Now on to the in game review. The player has access to a unique array of various firearms melee weapons vehicles and equipment. This game also features cosmetics yet they are not game changing. Finally my only true official complaint is that the loading time can be painfully long but I have reason to assume this will change over time (I hope at least). All in all PUBG is a pretty fun game that's aimed can work for both casual and hardcore players. Also beware you'll find a few squeakers here and there as well as your the occassional edgy fucc boi/girl who think they're cool by saying things like everyones favorite word and such but these people aren't that big of a problem unless you're easily offended. My overall score for the game 7 8/10 fun game except the GODAMN ING LONG RELOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-22,0,0,53,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. This game has positive things and negetive things. Positive the game has good graphics the models looks pretty nice and real.The game has a big map alot of houses for loot and the map builded very nice. The winners are usually the peoples who are using the best strategy (not allways) and you can play the game in few ways Going to school/military base/goergapool/milta power (places that have very good places and alot going to there) and the best will survive and escape with very good loot. Second option is to go to a place with few houses and loot there.you will get there worse loot but its safetier. There is alot strategies but these are the most commons. Negetive on some computers if u put the graphics on ""very low"" there will be some bags like missing texture so if you want the game will run good and smoothly use avarage computer for playing this game. If you know you have a shity computer (like my computer) i recommend not to buy this game. There is alot of bugs in this game that apear while the gameplay that need to be fixed. The game is on early acces so this is the reason for the bugs but there is updates and bugs fix everey long time so there is still alot of bugs. In addition there is alot of cheaters that making the game not fair. Some players like camping.They using the first person look camping in a house. They hiding in a house and waiting for someone to get in the house and then killing him with a shotgun 1 shot.This is 1 type of camping. Totally this game is very nice game and its very fun if you have a computer that runs it.Maybe the gameplay will improve and the bugs will be fixed. Its just matter of time.

2017-03-26,0,0,4,True,Recommended,"So in PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds things I've noticed 1.) The textures are nice but need a lot of refinement when you're moving around or going in and out of a scope. 2.) There's a glitch anytime I look upwards where the lower left corner of my screen has 2 black pixely triangles. Happens the most on wooden floor textures. 3.) There's floating books going off the shelves in some of the houses. 4.) Voice chat likes to glitch out and not work along with that there's open mic in the pre game load in as well as before you drop which is really loud and annoying. 5.) It's a bit wonky clicking things to pick them up along with getting in a car. (Use tab to pick up items instead of mashing F) 6.) The cars are a bit awkward to drive compared to other cars. the camera is VERY CLOSE to where the car takes up most of the screen and it's hard to see your surroundings. Realistic but compared to the car mechanics in other games like GTA borderlands H1Z1 KOTK it's weird.7.) DON'T. JUMP. OVER. CHAIRS. I got glitched out over one and did the falling/flailing animation and as far as I know.. You're ing stuck my man. I tried moving around frantically jumping crouching proning shift running ect ect. Nothing works. If you get stuck you might as well just exit the match.8.) The Parachute mechanic leaves a lot to be desired. It's awkward you press the right arrow key it shifts you left and same vise versa. When you're almost on the ground it slows down and takes quite a bit of time to finally be able to walk (Which gives enemies time to get guns and pewpew you.) Overall the game has a lot of potential though. I'm looking forward to the monthly optimization updates. The gun aiming is A LOT better than H1Z1 you can zoom in find scopes the scopes vary (red dot holographic 4x 8x ect) there's A LOT more guns. In the spawn you can play around with the guns too. There's a bit more character design you earn points as you play matches to unlock things (unlike H1Z1 where you only got stuff if you BOUGHT COINS and gambled it.) The plane does go in a straight line but you can decide where you drop. If you're not in the safe zone and you get caught in the blue electro magnetic field you can at least see where you're going (It hurts though a lot more than toxic gas) If you die you can spectate your teammate and If you're ""downed"" a teammate can get you back up.I give it a 7/10 atm. H1Z1 still feels a bit better than PUGB HOWEVER PUGB JUST came out and has so much room to improve. Lots of potential. &gt I do reccomend buying the game and giving it a try me and my friends had a great time last night. The game is playable atm and you can have a lot of fun. Make sure to watch some streams before going in and reading some of the tips before starting a game. RIP H1Z1 KOTK February 18 2016 March 2017 Early access for life",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-28,0,0,237,True,Recommended,One of the best games I've ever played a really great game overall however some things need fixing.First of all optimization.Probably the worst of all. The game could sometimes just get stuck for a few seconds and you can't do anything about it even if you run it on lowest settings or with a really high end computer.Second clipping issues.I don't know if it's only me but I've noticed quite a few times where the physics are just derpy af.I landed on a roof of a warehouse which had a lot of holes in it (not sure where it is) and I just hovered above the holes.

Banning people who are suspected of stream sniping really just feels like it's motivated by the devs appeasing major streamers by banning people to keep them happy since twitch has been a huge source of their popularity. Turns all the streams into lynchmobs whenever the streamer gets shot and doesn't feel like it was fair (surprise it happens to all of us).Some people will like this game a lot sometimes it's enjoyable but I always end up wishing people wanted to play a different game.TLDR unless you're definitely into this type of game save your money...It might get better over time but considering the direction it's going it might just collapse and lose most of its playerbase too.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-09,0,0,557,True,Recommended,Absolutely fantastic game. This was my first Battle Royale type game ever and although I was hesitant to try it it turned out to be one of the best gaming choices I made. I discovered it by winning a BETA key in a random stream. Had never heard of it nor its development. Had never cared for BR type games (I had watched friends play H1Z1 and I hated the fast paced arcade style).However when I started playing it it was SO fulfilling. The suspense the joy of finding good loot and especially the satisfaction from getting kills. Although all that stuff is great the biggest thing I love about the game is the SUPPORT from the developers. They constantly update this thing and improve it every. single. time. I had a gripe about the game that I thought would never be addressed then lo and behold they're coming out with a big patch to fix it (the vaulting animations).Whether you have played BR games before or not I would highly recommend PUBG.

2018-03-16,0,0,548,False,Not Recommended,"Oddly enough this game was better in pre release alpha than it current state as of March 2018. The game has more crashing issues now than it did in alpha. Cheaters are more prevelant and not much has been done to fix 99 percent of the cheaters other than call the playerbase affected by the cheaters Xenophobes. The game is no longer enjoyable and I cant recommend it.Before release the game ran pretty good on my Vega 64/Ryzen system. After release I was barely able to target anyone for a kill. It was like there was some kind of input lag. I ended up upgrading to an 8700k with a 1080 Ti (pretty much to enjoy this game again). Sure enough I was back to getting 1 4 kills per game again until the 1.6gb March patch.After the patch the game wouldn't even launch. I spent days spamming crash reports and googling trying to see if anyone had a fix. I ended up disabling most of my startup programs and it started right up. The next day I forgot to disable the startup programs and it launched fine so I dont know what the issue was. The group of guys I play alongside haven't been so fortunate. One teammate launches and works half the time the other teammate never launches at all so he is no longer playing with us. The game is still broken after a week while bluehole keeps announcing the next great feature and plans they have for PUBG.Cheaters.... you're suppose to be able to watch your killcam and see how your enemy takes you out from his viewpoint. I just left a match where I was gunned down and the killcam was fixed on me (from an over my shoulder viewpoint) didn't even catch a glimpse of my opponent. Unfortunately when you report cheats you only have a dropdown box with a few choice selections. If the cheat or hack is not covered under one of those what is the point. The devs are too busy raking in your cash adding more cosmetic items and announcing the great things they are doing for the game (while there game is crashing and burning) to fix the cheat issue. If 99 percent of the cheaters being banned are from China region locking that country would solve 99 percent of the cheat problem. Tired of this companies lack of fixing issues while pursuing other platform launches and selling licenses to generate more revenue.Quit making and announcing your ""great plans' for your game Bluehole and fix it first.They also do server maintenance in primetime hours for the USA...very frequently very annoying.In all I don't recommend the game and it gets a thumbs down until they fix the issues and apologize for the name calling.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-01,2,1,584,False,Recommended,Let's be honest here the game is fun to play. With over 400 hours played on a i7 6700hq and gtx 960m laptop the game had issues and needed to run on 1600x900 with low settings to maintain 40 50 FPS. It was still doable and I was able to still be relatively competable with my friends who have built PC's. I recently built a pc (Ryzen 7 2700x and zotac gtx 1080ti) and it is like playing a different game. I am playing on 1440p resolution and run about 100fps on average with high/ultra settings. I am able to see players at a distance and my performance in up close combat has improved tenfold. On both PC's I have ran into a minimal amount of issues. Before it offically released the issues were more prevalent but after release I rarely run into any issues such as lagging out or game crashes. I am disappointed in the optimization by Bluehole but it does not deter me from playing. The addition of keys for $2.50 to open crates that you buy with ingame rewarded currency is about the dumbest thing. The game lacks motivating factors to play without friends. While I do like the addition of gun skins and different customizable clothing I feel like they need to focus on making the game playable without issue for the majority of players before adding things that do not affect gameplay. I play for the competition. I have played the past 2 seasons of Fortnite after many hours on PUBG. Fortnite's challenges and battle pass idea makes it worth getting on everyday whether I have friends to play with or not. PUBG still feels more competitive but the games can drag on only to be sniped/shot in the back/killed by the blue zone. If you are wondering if you should buy this game with so many bad reviews I say buy it and join the fun. With a proper PC it will be worth it. However if you are on the fence and your PC is on the lower end do not buy it. It will feel like a waste of money. It is like playing on a nintendo 64 while your competition is on a PS4.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've enjoyed the game a lot so far and I'm excited to try out the new features that are yet to come like new maps guns movement mechanics and complete character customization to name a few.

My $1 000 PC could roast hotdogs while I play this game. I've been killed by countless cheaters yet I'm getting banned. They had the genius idea of adding loot crates to the game. You get a random crate and IT HAS A CHANCE OR REQUIRING A KEY THAT YOU NEED MONEY TO BUY. I have 21 of them. Most of the customization items I've unlocked are just different color shirts or pants. And not to mention the skins and clothes look like at least it does if you want to win and have your settings on the lowest possible settings so looks more boxy. Lower settings make things like grass and foliage smaller and if you turn your render distance all the way down grass stop loading after 100m or so. It's like they don't play their own game.

Bog down the server making it laggy for other players and sometimes making it unplayable2. they lag and rubberband on NA players screens making them very hard to kill3. They scream "" China #1"" 4. Overall ruins the experience of someone who actually is trying to win Another issue i have is with the camera while you are in a car is crazy terrible and often gives me a headache due to it sometimes being very rocky and while ADS the camera wobble is absolutely over exagerated and also causes motion sicknessOverall Idk how to feel about this game I will wait for full launch to see if anything changes but until then i stand sorta in between and until some of the cons are fixed i will side with the negatives.*EDIT*So the chinese situation is worse. Now everytime you get a game there is a hacker I highly do no recommend buying in its current state. Greene and others are against the region lock of China claiming that is banning a whole country. That is utter bs its restricting them to their own servers how is that banning lol. I swear people are stupid. Another isus is this games netcode which has a hard time running at a steady tick. Analysis shows it runs from 2 30 tick usually on the lower end of spectrum around 12 This makes the game quites in terms of bullet detection and even input detection.

Battlegrounds wastes no time putting player right in the middle of the action as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km islandItem distribution is randomized but players can t count on finding a good gun early keeping player safe . It isn t out of the ordinary for someone with only a pistol to take down someone with a fully loaded SCAR L assault rifle since good gear is only half the battle / the other half is wit As players outsmart each other in deadly games of cat and mouse those still standing are forced into ever closer proximity within the confines of a deadly ever shrinking force field until just one is left alive P/S Victory is an exhilarating reward matched only by the suspense that emerges from the battle to achieve it .

2018-06-20,0,0,352,False,Recommended,Sanhok is a refreshing addition to the map pool compared to the slower pace of Erangel and Miramar. The increased loot drop rates of ARs and DMR/SRs as well as the smaller map size allows for more action and more fun. You could drop at a random set of houses with no names and still be fully geared and encounter a fight in less than 5 minutes. While the devs have added microtransactions they are purely cosmetic and do not forgo gameplay and mechanical updates as seen by the addition of a new map new vehicles new guns new scopes and various balance changes which helped break up the monotony of the M4 meta. PUBG combines great gun gameplay through its mechanics customization and variety. WHile the gun mechanics are not as skill based as counter strike as there is more rng when spraying it still satisfies my desire for fast twitch skilled first person shooters. The bolt action sniper rifles feel sublime to use. That being said PUBG will challenge even the highest end PCs and performance problems are especially noticeable when hotdropping. The thrill of the battle royale gamemode and PUBG's great gun mechanics overshines its performance issues and keeps me coming back time and time again. I think PUBG gets alot of underserved hate its is not a perfect game but it is still an enjoyable experience and the definitive battle royale experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-14,0,0,67,False,Recommended,7.5/10Pros Looting and building your best character as quickly as you can is rather fun. Being in the top 10 is insanely tense. Few games have made me as anxious. Having 2 3 and 4 man squads is awesome. It takes away from the tension sadly but replaces it with a tactical aspect through communication and teamwork.Cons In general an overhyped game run by terrible developers. Some of the news that I've seen come out of this game is atrocious and I won't be supporting these turds in the future. Gun play is quite mediocre. Pretty sad for a game that's based around shooting. Poorly optimized. It plays like a jerkier version of Fallout 3. Gameplay is not smooth at all. Hackers seem more prevalent compared to other games I've played but that may be due to the game's popularity. A decent amount of bugs. I've had to quit twice now just because the game wouldn't let me out of my vehicle.I'd recommend it for fans of shooters stealth and looting games. Unfortunately it's nowhere near as polished as it should be. I would highly suggest not giving any money to this developer in the future unless changes in management and customer feedback/support are enacted.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

""Buuu huu the Devs said that they wouldn't release paid content until full launch.... wahhhhh!!! Bad game uninstall!"" is every single review I'm seeing atm. If you don't want to buy a key to open a crate for an event that the game is having well that's your problem let everyone else spend their money on crates with cool costumes inspired from an awesome movie!This game is incredibly well made and stands apart from all it's competitors (H1Z1 KoTK Arma3 PUBG Mod etc.) The physics in this game are much better than other games (even though sometimes they might feel a little weird S ). You can play this game without spending a single cent after you've purchased it because you get apparel and costumes for free ingame currency just for playing the game! So who cares if they're adding 1 crate which costs a little to open the money goes for a good cause and you don't have to open the crate if you don't want to! Oh yea btw they're adding 2 other crates that are free to open alongside this 1 crate! Maybe try your luck on those crates instead of saying ""Buuhuu microtransactions!!!!""Final words Great game! Great theme! Great gameplay! Optimization is being worked on every month so even the most low end pc's will manage to play this game at a good framerate!! Only have 42 hours on this game right now but that number is only going to get bigger as I play this great game every day going forward!BUY THIS GAME IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME!!!!!!!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,1153,True,Not Recommended,Great game if it wasnt for the developers unfairly banning people who they say are using cheat bots. I don't even know what a cheat bot is... A few months ago they were having major server issues and you have to wonder if they are making up excuses to ban players in order to make room for new users who will buy their product. No help from their customer support only a failure to admit a mistake was made. I think its a scam and I would NEVER buy another product from these developers again. The fact that STEAM supports and sells this game puts STEAMS integrity into question. Imagine going into wal mart and buying a board game. A few months later wal mart shows up at your door and takes back the game that you purchased and accusses you of cheating. ABSURD. Would any of you stand for that?!?!?! Don't support criminals... Do not buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-07,0,0,330,False,Recommended,"Summary PUBG is an amazing game that keeps getting better. With each update comes something new that enhances the game and makes gameplay increasingly more fluid. The guns are all pretty much balanced (there could be some tweaks here and there). The RNG in the game either is heavily in your favor or heavily against you such as when you drop in a town with your friends only to find micro useless's and P92's or if you have to play marathon runner to get to the circle (THIS IS A YUUUGE PROBLEM WITH THE NEW MAP!!!). Vehicles are mostly realistic and have truly come a long way since just this past summer when i started. Overall rating 7/10 but unless you are really picky or you are really bad at the game you won't realize it is anything below 10/10.The BIG issues This game is riddled with hackers specifically from asian countries. These guys join the lobby and instantly start shouting ""CHINA NUMBER 1"" or some similar chant but with a different country that is basically a key indication that you have some hackers in the lobby. Good thing is that you can usually beat them if you out flank them and don't expose yourself. Most of these hackers can either shoot through walls with hip fire instant head shot destroy gear with single shot use super speed instant death by grenade without cooking or fly. I haven't seen the ones that fly or the ones that run as fast as a vehicle in a couple months. It is very easy to identify hackers now that we have the replay feature so if you think someone is hacking you can record the clip and report the player. I think there is an option for further reporting that you can use the video clip of on the player unkown website. Hackers only really ruin 9 out of 10 games the one game they don't ruin is because they messed up and got out played or the circle killed them. When I first started this game my buddies and I could win a couple games in a row or at least play more than 5 minutes without getting killed by a hacker. Now it seems you get into a game and as soon as you land you'll die from a pistol head shot through a wall from a guy half way across the city hip firing. THE FIX Region lock countries and it will fix most hacking issues for North American players. Most of us just want to play the game with our friends act like badasses or just troll. Most of us our sick of playing with people from another country who yell ""F*** America America number 0 China number 1"" while hacking to kill us effortlessly and then t bagging our dead bodies. This is what needs to be done if an anti cheat system can't be enabled that solves until there is a solution that solves the problem.FUTURE SUGGESTIONSTo end this I would like to suggest that in the future there be a feature for purchasing/renting or self hosting servers. I think it would be a great addition to the game especially for those in it for the e sport aspects of the game. This would open up a lot more local tournaments. Also please consider adding different options for each map such as larger teams and more players on specific maps. The new map definitely could be a 200 person map. Another suggestion before I wrap this up please add a map that is smaller but made only of cities.Thank you for reading!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,Didn't find it enjoyable really vast amount of the games is usually camping and hoping you get the jump on someone and the other part is hiking/jogging around and hoping the next building you go check doesn't have a guy with a shotgun in prone position facing the door you're about to open.From a technical stand point the game has some annoying inconsistencies with its hitboxes and the latency can at times freak out causing weird desync. Frame rate is usually solid but has some parts of the map and moment where it can suddenly drop from a smooth 60 fps experience to 30s mixed in with some weird stutters.I picked it up since i saw how crazy popular it was getting and from the videos i saw online it seemed fun even have two friends who go it so i thought I'd give it a shot too but when i went to play it solo and in duo with a friend i simply didn't enjoy it the base gameplay experience is not fun for me. If you enjoy that's great for you and feel free to thumb down me to oblivion.

2017-04-21,0,0,354,True,Not Recommended,Hello this is both a review and a public service anouncement.I would like to start by saying that this game CAN be imense fun and very enjoyable with company. However in its current state I can not recomend the game to anyone. It boils down to this the game has a good sense of what it wants to be and has great potential to accomplish the task of being the best in the genre but at this current point in time (being April 21 2017) the state of the servers makes this game nearly unplayable and the combat extreemly inconsistant and will surely begin to frustrate you more and more over time. This is disheartening to me that by mearly upgrading the server and client tick rate (which currently stands at a net average of 33 ticks) the majority of the games mechanics would be quite smooth. (Instead the devs current focus is the leaderboards.),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Do not get me wrong i still think its a bad move for an early access game to release payed for stuff.... But again it doesnt affect the over all game.In my opinion i still see it as one of the most ballanced games i have played in terms of that everyone has access to the same stuff in the map (guns and equipment) this firstly means you wont go against someone who has a loadout so that they can just join and dominate. As well as in the game if you take risked there is a chance of you finding good ""loot"" quicker but in later game i havent seen this give anyone to much of an advantage.The only time you will see my recommendation go to un recommended is if they start adding crucial game elements as payed for content for example this being map packs or guns things that make you pay to experiance the full game ""cough"" every battlefield ever""cough""And lastly if you dont like the idea of payed for crates dont buy them there are still ones that are unlockable through ""grind""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-20,0,0,918,True,Recommended,Some players have huge issues with the optimization of this game. Lag/Desync hit reg issues. etc. etc.Before reading I want to state that I have no perforance issues with this game Have over 200 Wins 500+ hours at the time of this review. I have played since release. I only play First Person servers since their introduction because 3rd Person is not and will never be a fair competetive playing field and introduces elements of gameplay and advantages that you have no way of adapting to other than adopting a play style of proning behind this cover and looking over it with 3rd person because that's what everyone else does.***NOTICE*** If you optimize a game and then add new content you have to re optimize the game. OVER AND OVER. Optimization comes at the end of the development cycle not at the beginning. I am not listing or focusing on new bugs introduced in patches as they are normally resolved promptly by the developers.***HIT REG LAG / DESYNC***I have looked at dozens of steam profiles of people complaining about these issues and they are either running the game on a third world toaster complaining about performance. Or they are from some country that has ping to the PUBG servers and cause their issues you can't blame the devs when your internet connection is whats causing problems. ***MY OPINION ON THE GAME***Pro's**** Developers have added content and stayed true to their development cycle since the release of the game pushing out constant updates.* With the addition of First Person servers getting shot from that guy that's watching you on the other side of the wall or behind that tree no longer happens. (IF your aim is better than theirs and you are looking around you instead of atthe floor that you are looting you will get gayed very little in FP and die to mistakes you made.)* Added in game feature to report players.* Developers listened to community feedback on key issues and removed looting delay that was added in an update.* The game runs and feels immeasurably better than it did at release. (Any player that has played once or twice a week since release should be able to agree with this.)* Developers have stated that they DO NOT issue bans based solely on reports. But that they review many aspects of the players match history before issueing a ban. ( Players accused of stream sniping have their match history analyzed to find patterns Ex. When a streamer on the server dies they disconnect and re queue to get into the game with that streamer again. ) * Developers released a statement saying that they are going to have less frequent weekly updates so that they have more time to internally test and fix bugs before releasing patches. ( This will only be good for game development as recently some of the new patches have introduced more issues than they fix which renders the game unplayable for hours while the bugs are patched out but usually doesn't take more than a day. ) *** Cons* Banning for using a car Horn near a streamer is not harrassment. This is something that does not warrant a ban or any punitive action. (Kill the guy in the car or get over it if you sit in a building while he's honking stuff it up your and grow up.)* There are random invisible hitboxes in fields and certain places on the map that can stop your car dead in it's tracks. ( Developer has stated that players experiencing this should record this happeneing and post on the forums so that design team can fix but this has happened to me in about a dozen different locations and shouldn't be the responsibility of the player to resolve. ) * There are server issues that cause everyone to receive a network lag detected message this mostly gets resolved after a second or two but sometimes you have to leave the game and queue for a new match.* When banning players the developers should also include a link to a private report that the player can view to see a list of any and all evidence that was used when they were issued the ban. (With the exception of cheat bans which are obvious and easy to detect based on Head shot percentage and other stats.)* Clothing items currently take up a decent amount of spawning space in building with normally 1 3 clothing items per building in some cases. ( Makes the looting process longer because it's taking the place of a gun or other item that could have spawned in its place. ) *** Overall Review ***I would reccommend this game to players that understand that there is a chance that the game will not run as smoothly as they are used to with other titles regardless of their hardware specs. The game is half way through it's development cycle and players with less than high specs should wait until optimization near release at the end of this fall to purchase the game to avoid headaches.If you have issues with 3rd person game's and RNG aspects try first person for a more balanced and fair experience that rewards skill and decision making over abusing 3rd person peaking mechanics.Do not buy the game if you live in a region that is far away from the servers that they have available they have added servers in several countries since going into EA so wait for servers to be added closer to you to avoid lag and desync issues.If none of the above applies to you I would reccomend this game especially if you have friends that are already playing it because it provides a very enjoyable and tense experience that will bring you a lot of enjoyment (And sometimes frustration),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,14,True,Recommended,"Its a good fun game. its just all the combat you love in a survival crafting game without the extremely boring and awful survival and crafting part. Solo is just as fun and faster paced than teams and teams is still fun with friends. However right now the updates seem to be pretty unoptimized. Right now you pretty much need 16gb of RAM . If you dont youll get crazy stuttering and get put at a pretty bad disadvantage. with as much attention as this game is getting I hope and expect these issues to be fixed fairly soon. (I have a 1060 6gb with 16gb RAM and an i5 2500k 3.4ghz CPU and I still get micro stutters and FPS drops on ultra. Before when I had 8gb of RAM If I had google chrome running in the background the models and textures of houses wouldnt load in for up to 2 minutes after landing on the ground PLUS stuttering on ultra. You can imagine that it puts a player at a disadvantage. After I upgraded this issue stopped but I still get FPS drops and micro stuttering)All this said I HIGHLY suggest you completely ignore the community. Its all the internet arguing you could ever want with the awful twitch hivemind to add flavor (and frustration). With little to no mic chatting in the game this is fairly easy to do though. I wont get into the PR of the game and the controversies I have my own opinions on it but thats a discussion for the ""Discussion"" page and the forums.NOTE I wrote this review before the paid loot crate update and Microtransactions.

2017-05-27,0,0,168,True,Recommended,One of the absolute best and most refined survival of the fittest games I have seen. This title is up for coronation as the king of battle royal.And to no suprise? the person who put the genre on the map (Playerunknown) turned his mod into a beloved gameplay franchise that will shape how survival is played for years to come. Even despite consulting for a competitor this game has knocked daybreak on its ace and has already become one of the best in its class for fast paced survival.This game is as fast paced and brutal as anything seen in The hunger games yet has all the survival elements in place to insure your survival or failiure. Every choice you make from the timing of when you jump out of the plane to what weapons you choose to scavange to where you choose to loot and where you move will decide the fate of the game for you. and your choices must work with the world of chance and risk if you want to take that chicken dinner in the end (Win the game) The game starts everyone on even footing just a parachute and the clothes on your back. and 40 minutes later everything you do from finding healthpacks guns armor vehicles etc will decide if you are the last man standing or one of the 99 corpses in a battlefield that progressivly shrinks in size to insure that in the end everyone must fight to survive. or die.The gunplay is smooth and incredibly well refined as well the movement mechanics. while the server mechanics like picking up stuff and getting into cars is still shaky at times many rolling patches have already made the experience better and better. The hit detection is Favor the shooter but in 30 games i have played so far i have yet to find a scenario where a death was because of the failings of the game.All in all I think this would be a universally stupid decision not to pick up this game if your a survival or a FPS enthusiest you will find that both here and always look forward to the fresh start.

It seems like every other week there is a new loot crate that you can buy but it takes months for them to relaese a patch to actually improve the game. When I first started playing this game in 2017 it felt very primitive but I was sure as it got bigger and bigger the Dev's would optimize the game so it feels smoother to play like a game in 2018 should. Today it still feels very primitive like a game I would have played back in 2009. This game will die as more and more larger titles come out with battle royal modes within their game.

I just didn't want to return to this game because it had nothing exciting. Most of your time will be running and looting cuz of the overly large map. The new map is doodoo as well. Im not hating the people who likes this game. Im not hating on the game entirely as well. The developers are a big part of it. The FPS use to be but after the full game release it got better.

For example yesterday late game after noticing during all match a guy killing 4 and 4 and 4 and 4 we get to final ... 3 vs 1 ... we go one from each side and we all died same time basically far away from each other killed by the same guy... so yeah...Apart from that love the game... love the gear building system... cars who actually kill people when you hit them with car (if you play h1 you know what i mean...) and considering its still Early Access its really good. Solo its a bit hmmm meh... boring... specially cause of campers but duos and team its awesome!UPDATEDunno if its just me but usually when i am inside certain houses when i try to overshoot from windows (being close to the window or far from it) doesnt work... from inside to outside cause i do get hitted from outside to inside... so if its possible to get the hit from outside why its not from inside ?! Doesnt make sense... Fix this please!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,38,False,Recommended,Day 1 of EA already better than H1Z1. Good mix between the very arcade y style of H1Z1 and the harcore realism of Arma. The devs have made an amazing progress up to this point during the betas before going on steam. Unlike most EA releases the game is already in a state worth the price IMO but it has only just launched into beta and will get a lot more features and polishing during EA.The only downside so far is performance but the devs specifically said to first implement features and then start optimization once it has reached EA so they are only starting with it now. I average around 70 80 fps with a 4690k and 970 which is already good enough for me but if you are using either a 144 Hz monitor or are on the lower end of the specs you probably have to wait a month or two until optimizations start to be implemented into the game.I highly recommend this game!Launch Edit Good optimizations new maps and weapons all came during EA. With 3 million concurrent players a day this turns out to be one of the most popular games of the decade. rightfully so.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,261,True,Recommended,I played over 15 hours of the beta and wow is it a different type of game. I have over 40 hour on h1z1 and this game beats all those 40hours in just 17 hours (2hours on steam). The game is a bit slower but combat is amazing every gun including the crossbow has weight and power. The realism in bullet time/drop is also good not amazin. Im going to list some pros and cons so you all get the jyst of the game. Graphics 8/10For its genre of game the graphics are good but not amazing on ultra settings. I have everything on ultra except for grass and the game still looks pretty damn good. Gameplay 9/10The game runs smooth for me. I have a i74790k and gtx 1060 and for the most part i run it at 50 60 max sometimes drops to 45. But for the most part the game is well optimized and is in a lot better state than many games. Gunplay 8/10Every single gun in this game has weight and power to it. I once made it to 3rd place just with a suppressed revolver because every gun has damage. Bullet time/drop is good and can be improved but is 100x better than h1z1 physics. Animation 7/10 (10/10 for guns)When it comes to guns 10/10. Everthing else from healing to picking up items to drinking and jumping needs to be improved. Animations feel clunky for those sore of things and bunny hopping in this game is a no go because the gunplay is so good. Another thought is the 3rd and first person play its amazing its a mix between arma 3 and TC wildlands. Its not clunky and over using its has a sense that this game should have a single player mode or survival. Sound 8/10Everything has power to it except for melee weapons. The footsteps in this game remind me a lot of seige or escape from tarktov.Overall the game is really good in this state and the developers are consistently updated fixing and adding new things to the game wich makes this game an amazing pick.OVERALL A _______8.5/10_________,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,229,False,Not Recommended,"I can't recommend people to buy this game anymore. The devs don't seem to give much of a to fix the issues after a year and it runs embarrassingly badly on a rig that has a 6700k and 1080 TI. They prioritized adding keys and chests before adding the new map. The new map has been in the ""experimental"" server for ages but now they come out with this ""event pass"" that costs $9.99. Nah. The game is decent especially if you don't care too much about bad performance and bugs. The gameplay and gunplay itself is good. But again I can't recommend a purchase in the state the current game is in. I'll change my review back to thumbs up when the bugs that have existed for over a year are fixed. Old review before all the cosmetics and no fixes whatsoever Overall I recommend the game. I have almost 200 hours and I've enjoyed most of them. The initial early access was very rough lots of rubberbanding and hacking but it's come a very long way. I still don't fully believe that ""1.0"" will solve all of the issues as the test server was kind of crappy too but I think the game will continually be developed and whatnot over time. If you aren't patient and willing to deal with lots of maintenance as well as a ton of little one off issues (like randomly dying when you spawn buildings not loading etc...) on occasion don't buy this game yet. Give it another few months. Pros +Very engaging gameplay for the most part when you die or up it feels on your shoulders and not on your team (contrasting to a MOBA like DotA 2 or LoL)+Gunplay is fantastic when there's no lag+Big variety of guns and attachments+Two maps now! They're both great+Devs seem very engaged with the community can always appreciate thatCons Servers still lag like hell at times Game can be unoptimized on sub $1500 rigs even with a GTX 1080 I still lag on occasion. Still a handful of hackers which can absolutely ruin a game. This is in all games unfortunately. Again overall I'd still buy this.

2017-04-11,0,0,611,True,Recommended,This game has come leaps and bounds since my first (negative) review. It is a fun shooter that is even more fun when playing with others. Unfortunately for many they have to pair with random other players. It is definitley preferential and beneficial when you can load into a duo or squad lobby with people you are friends with.The issues you will likely run into if you don't have friends as teammates are as follows Player/s will not have a microphone or have chat muted and thus cannot hear call outs for directions of enemies desired movement plans or gear call outs. THIS IS A HUGE DISADVANTAGE.Players will not be matched in skill level since so far there is no skill based matchmaking in this game so you may end up with someone who makes so many rookie FPS mistakes that it seems they are entirely new to shooters that aren't point and spray. Problems/ things I would recommend to be changed to the devs.The BIGGEST problem right now is that the servers aren't region locked. This results in you getting a bunch of teammates that do NOT speak your language typically they are asian in origin and speak no english. They also play drastically different compared to North American players and European players down to their basic tactics and decisions they have a VERY different playstyle which usually does not pair well.Unable to cancel a reload like you can cancel a heal. An example of when you would need this is if you are prone and then realise you are under imminent threat and need to rotate on your cover. When prone and reloading you are completely unable to move and unable to cancel and are at the mercy of your enemy and the time it takes to reload.Bandages taking up a massive amount of space in Inv. considering how little they do for your health regeneration.I and many like minded daily players would love it if there were a change to the level 2 kevlar helmets. Specifically that with Kar98 rifle which shoots the same size round as the AKM is a 1 hit headshot kill when the player is wearing a full health lvl 2 helmet. I would recommend that at the least the lvl 2 helmet should richocet a round off of it and only take some damage. If it is a square and centered hit on the helmet that is different but if it is off the top or sides the round should richocet off and just be a graze as this is EXACTLY what the real life Kevlar helmet is designed to do.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game to me is trash the thing that ruins this game for me is how poorly it runs on my pc. I don't have a beast pc but Its still decent I run games like gta v (which is an old game but it still takes a bit to run) farcry and other games like that at around 60 fps this games textures and graphics aren't even good its silly how you can hide in a bush and camp without being seen. this game has the same the same problem with games like cod the player and environment are to similiar. And if you say that I don't like it because im bad is a silly argument. I play tons of games that I suck at that I enjoy. This game is also boring you can go a whole game without seeing someone then die from someone you don't even see. and yes you can go into more populated areas but this game is mostly luck you can go into a house and only find pants and a shotgun and the house next dorr has a ak and level 3 helmet. so if you do land in the more popular areas you have to pray to god you get something decent. Also the bugs this game is buggy to and if you say ""thats because its early access"" shut the up because early access if just a way to realese a buggy game and make money off of it. Look at ark that game sucked it had similar problems to pubg. It was a buggy game but at least you could have a ton of things to do in it.

I also see in reviews ppl crying bout how bad optimized is this game they have fps problems on ground and when they enter plane screen laggin or graphics still loading. Lets be realistic you need better gpu/cpu and ram even an ssd could help. You cant complain when you play from laptop or a pc with a crappy gpu/low ram etc etc. People think developers can fix fps problems for their bad pc and guess what? aint gonna happen. Also you bought the game you know that the game needs ram/gpu in order to run smoothly with no fps drop stop complaining refund the game or play it again when you upgrade/buy a better PC. Their last patch fixed a lot of problems i play on high graphics solid 50 60 fps.

2017-12-23,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Good game. Alpha was a little rugged when it first launched and it suffered from many graphical and optimization bugs. For me personally however ever since the 1.0 release I feel it is much better optimization wise. I went from having 22 50fps pre 1.0 launch to 90+ fps post launch. I honestly dont see what all the negative reviews are about. For me personally I have had 0 problems with the game and I think many of the people here complaining are nitpicking things because they dont have the required specs to run the game or they just wanna be hipsters and leave a negative review. I have an i5 4460 and a GTX MSI 970 4Gb. That is LESS than what is actually recommended to play this game and I have 90+fps so unless you have anything less than a 760 I honestly dont see how you would have trouble playing this. Everything that I have seen so far since its full release has been better than the early access. So forgive me If I seem like im putting the people down who leave negative reviews but from my PERSONAL experience the game is WAAAAAAAY better performance wise than it ever was before. Dont let some of the reviews hurt your view of this game. Its worth it 100% Edit For those of you wondering I play the game on high settings with my rig so yes the 970 is very efficient. Also as a side note I've found that by playing this game it doubles as a chinese phonics simulator. There are soooooooo many chinese playing on NA servers it is ridiculous. I have no idea why but be prepared for some mild fustration and communication problems unless you speak fluent mandarin chinese. As for me there is nothing funnier than an angry chinese man screaming gibberish when he goes down or dies. 10/10 would leave to die again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-23,2,1,225,False,Recommended,The game was very entertaining in the beginning for a couple of games then it seemed to get extroardinarily repetitive. I would like if they added bigger teams because I would like to play with more friends and if they added another map it could help the repetitivity. The game although I know is in early access needs a lot of work. The game so far is still really fun for the time if you play with friends. Update I am so glad that they did this update where they added a new map new weapons new vehicles. This certainly helps with the repetitive gameplay and adds a new element to the gameplay as the new map is completely different from the other one. Especially the new feature vauting. Vaulting over walls just makes the game less glitchy rather than trying to constantly trying to jump over the same wall lol.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-24,0,0,343,False,Recommended,"Alright. I waited a little while to put in a review on this game. I don't do many reviews which I'm going to be changing very soon. This game however needs a good somewhat detailed review so that people purchasing it know exactly what they're getting into. So here goes.First lets start with a little explination of the game. This is a battle royale much like others that are out there but done better. The only thing that you start with are the clothes on your back. You drop into a very large map/arena with 99 other people. Everyone then loots buildings and warehouses for weapons armor ammo etc. There's a large white circle that changes every 3 minutes or so and gets smaller and smaller. If you're caught outside the circle as the old circle begins to get smaller you will take damage until you catch up to the new circle. There are vehicles that spawn in various locations that you can use to get closer however be aware that the noise from the vehicle is easily audible by people nearby. There are 2 maps as of this review that are both large and honestly well done. There are a lot of complaints about both maps myself being one that complains frequently about the new one although i wouldn't really change it. The objective is to get as many kills as possible and be the ""last man standing"" to get the ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"" phrase at the end. There are loot boxes that you open in the lobby that cost BP which are points you earn from dmg kills and wins throughout the match but these boxes are only for asthetics and offer nothing to get an edge over anyone else.This is one of the most balanced pvp games that i've played to date. I personally don't like very many pvp games. I play things like Battlefiend 4 Battlefield 1 Call of Duty Gears of War etc. but I'm not very fond of them because unless you play them constantly most people have advantages because of better scopes and weapons. This game is nothing like that. You drop in with nothing and so does everyone else. This is the third highest game i've put hours into 1st being FFXIV second is GTA V and this one. You'll hear a lot of complaints about this game from people that just suck but it is a skill based game. I'm going to go into con's in a bit so stay with me.There are 3 ""modes."" You have solo duo and squad. You can play 1 man squad 2 man squad 3 man squad and 4 man squad as well. There is also a perspective lock. You can either play on TPP(Third Person Perspective) or FFP(First Person Perspective) servers. TPP definitely has a camera angle advantage but FPP is a lot of fun as well.Another thing to note on the positive side of this game is how easy it is to make friends. Jumping into a random squad is absolutely toxic as it is in many other games of this nature however you often find yourself grouped with people that are looking for people to play with that are friendly and ready to rock some domes. I personally have met at least 8 people over the course of 3 days just joining random and saying ""Hey you seem cool want to join discord?"" and viola you have regulars to play with that are usually pretty awesome.Now to the negatives PUBG needs to fix this damn lag. You'll drop into a courtyard and look up at the massive amounts of parachutes raining down on your head and immediatly dash for a weapon. However touching down first will do you no good when the room you're searching is just a wooden room with a pole in the center because all the textures weapons armor chairs tables and anything haven't loaded yet because the server is lagging behind. Also picking up a weapon and all its ammo to reload and wait 10 seconds for the ammunition to load into the weapon finds you dead as well. Another problem with the lag is ""rubber banding."" This means when you walk 5 steps you're suddenly teleported backward 3 of them and it happens over and over for at least 20 seconds before stopping. You can see how this would be a problem when you've got 2 people on your and there's a beautiful SCAR L sitting on the floor in front of you but you just can't get to it!!!Having massive amounts of people from other countries on your server is awesome for filling rooms but for helping with lag issues. I can't explain how many times i've watched the kill cam and seen myself run around a corner and the person that killed me shoot at air and yet i somehow died. Look at the name!! Its Xioyu or Chiang or Yukaketo. Wonder why the kill is lagging behind? There was supposed to have been a ping lock implemented but its not working. Hopefully that will be fixed. The cross country server implementation also leads to wonderful groups where the person doesn't speak your language at all and with nothing other than a single marker you can lay on the map to communicate with you're not going to have a very well executed plan to run up on another squad. Hopefully we have the choice of a region lock in our near future here.Another issue you'll find yourself breaking keyboards over is the incredible amount of clothing laying all over the ground that serves no purpose other than to better fit your environment. While this might sound exciting at first its not very great when there's a gun sitting under a shirt and someone right on your trying to kill you but you can't get the gun because you keep picking up the stupid f***ing shirt. You don't keep the clothes if you win so there's really no point other than to satisfy the person behind you while they stand there laughing pointing an S12K Saiga shotgun at your back watching you play dress up. There's a bit more to go over but i'll save it for a little while and i'll edit this review later if some changes are made. Plus i have a friend who wants to play right now so i'mma haff to go do that. But all in all i would say that this is one of my favorite games and it pisses my gf off constantly because i'm always on it. So i bought it for her and now we play together. Nothing better than when she's sitting beside you on the laptop overly excited because someone walked up a staircase as she stared down it with a shotgun and blew their helmet clean out the window. It's a great game amazing when played with friends and can be one of the most frustrating experiences you'll have but it does battle royale better than any other and I say 30 dollars is cheap for the amount of heart pounding exhileration you'll get when there's less than 10 people left alive and you're stacked on armor and ammo waiting for the finale of murder and chaos.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-24,0,0,186,False,Recommended,"It's actually a pretty good battle royal game. Fun and Challenging for both your self and your PC. Matches usually last 30 mins but new players can last for a couple of minutes or so. That's understandable because it IS battle royal. You might need to pump a few hours into the game before you get the grips of it.There are plenty of tips and tricks videos on YouTube that I suggest watching before you even buy the game as it does require skill and technique to enjoy it. At the time of writing this I am still a newbie with only 60 hours of gameplay in and still my average rank per match is on the lines of 15 10th place because of making tactics before hand.HoweverThe cons of PUBG (PlayerUnknowns Battle Grounds) is the servers and the people in them. Yes I get that I'm in the EU but do I really need to play with chinese people and other foreign speaking people? As PUBG has a ""ground breaking"" voice chat system anyone can talk at the star of the game. But the thing is with that 99.999% of those people are foreign. Not like I have a thing with them it's just I want to talk to people that speak the same language.And with the new 1.0 update out the servers are as slow as ever. With millions of people playing at a time the servers are just overloading. Poor PC performance + Server lag death.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now i get on once every two weeks for two games tops. gun mechanics changed miranmar was great at the sart then they started changing it. added new guns changed the old guns added crates that needed keys started adding more and more key added the battle pass put a game thats behind a paywall behind a second paywall if you want any awesome looking skin.. i do NOT recomend this game. i was 110% against fortnite in december now im starting to think its not too bad.. their servers work not too bad with the tickrate i get over 144 fps in it (my pc isnt exactly weak) which is not even dreamable in PUBG unless you turn down their battle pass actually gives you stuff if you dont pay for it and if you do it gives you even better stuff!!Blueballs get ur together. fix the tickrate for once optimize the game like crazy STOP adding skins behind a paywall (at least untill the core game is fixed) you already got money from me for s sake.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-09,1,2,131,True,Not Recommended,"This game by all standards SHOULD be great and to be honest it mostly is how ever the white zone frequently towards the end closes in a tight circle in a field meaning it falls down to who ever is lucky enough for it to be closest to them to win and this isn't rare since most the map is large empty spaces meaning only rarely when it closes in a town is the final zone actually fair there ARE good outdoor areas with lots of grass to hide in but there are also ones that are almost completely barren and also because the map is so open a WAY too large portion of your games will end with you being sniped by someone you can't see fighting a guy in a building from the outside?

Also if you do not own a monster PC be prepared to play the game with ""cake like"" buildings. DAnyway just because it is a fun game ( optimized) I still recommend it. ** Update 2018 09 12 **So I have played pubg more than I should've. I've uninstalled this game because of the poor network code ruining almost every game for me. I did not play pubg for about 4 to 5 months and after a long holiday decided I will give it a shot again. Thumbs up on improving many aspects of the game especially the netcode it is much better but there are still a lot of desync issues happening etc that needs attention.In my opinion this game has / had so much potential but being a developer myself I can tell you right now fixing something that is broken is almost impossible to get 100% right. It is almost better to just dump the legacy code entirely and re write the game from scratch with proper developers at hand.I have a love hate relationship with this game and I do enjoy to play it with my friends.Finally living in South Africa this game is not easy to play with a latency of 200ms+.

After 21 hours of playing I can conclude this is a very fun game worthy of its price tag. But this game is not for the feint of pc I run a AMD FX 8350 4Ghz 16gb ddr3 hyper x fury ram gtx 1070 FE and a 500 gb ssd. I run at medium to low seetings and get around 40 70 frames. large cities are still to much for my pc to handel but optimization will come in the near future.Pros its $29.99You can customize weaponsgun play feels smoothvariety of clothing weapons and vehiclesDuo and Squad modes work well while also highlighting your squad mates Cons Optimazation could be betterEar when you first spawnopening doors takes some tries when laggingif you can look past the normal alpha state problems then you will really enjoy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It has a lot of depth whether it be in it's shooting or interesting mechanic of building allowing you to play minecraft hunger games at the same time as counter strike. It has other interesting mechanics too such as vaulting. Fun fact PUBG was the first game to ever have vaulting.

Ive made top 10 by stealthing and avoiding combat. Squad Experience even better. Get on discord plan together and set up your team. I thought this was the most fun part of PUBG. FRIENDLY FIRE so watch your shots. The game gives you a compass to help direct your team where things might be wether its enemies or a town.Character Customization if thats what you want and thats what you like...you're SOL. If you dont care and you just want tactical gear or camoflauge colors to blend in you're still SOL because you're gonna GRIND FOREVER.Things Id like to See A shooting range would be nice simple offline add on so we can dial in our ranged shots.

2017-11-06,0,0,617,True,Not Recommended,I've put in a lot of hours into this game! One of the reasons I built a PC for the first time ever was to play this game. It's Early Access so it's expected to have some bugs and issues. But unfortunately this game has been plagued by hackers and cheaters! It's become overwhelming and lately I've found myself playing other games. Bluehole bans these cheaters/hackers but the ones who get banned just create a new account and purchase the game again. The purpose of them rebuying is because the game has crates that you can open with Battle Points earned through kills and wins. They then sell these items on the marketplace for real money. It's ruined the game for me and many others that I have played with. Also pressing F for 25 minutes to loot items only to get killed by someone that's hiding in completely nonsense spots feels like a waste of time. This game requires VERY little skill. If I could I would rate this game a 6/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,0,0,342,True,Recommended,Pros After the 100 hour marker for playing this game I managed to get my first game. This was after 100 hours! Since I usually play deathmatch games like CS GO or Unturned (Sandbox) But they all involved combat I've almost never have won an arena game in my 3 years of gaming but playing this game has trained me into being more aware of my surroundings and gave me time to come up with new looting tactics that can be used in later on. This game is all about pressure especially during the top 10. Ya know? Whenever I kill anyone or if I get jumped It really gets my heart pumping trust me if you like being under pressure this is the game for you.Cons There are a lot of stream snipers so watch out if you've got a big audience on Twitch. Also this game is REALLY buggy but there is sometimes a workaround or maybe you just need to restart your game. Since this is in Early access that's expected.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-07,0,0,318,True,Recommended,This will be short and sweet. People can say what they would like about the unoptimized part or that it's lacking content. Ladies and gents it's early access. For $30 it is so worth the money in every way. If you want a game where it gets your blood flowing like the water coming out of your faucet this is such a game for it. Yes sometimes it can be frustrating but for a competitive early access game it is very well done plenty of weapons and gear along with devs that are trying really hard to follow through with everything promised. There are already two new maps more vehicles and weapons planned along with vaulting and possibly take downs. With that said the person behind the game made Arma 3 Battleroyale and helped with H1Z1 so that goes to say he won't be giving up anytime soon. If you want a game that you can just sit down and play that is easy to learn this is the one. It will take many hours of your time. Yes it has hackers here and there bugs ect but almost every game does. Especially early access games such as this. So if you can look past that get this game.

All settings had to be set to run programs as administrator. Another review reccommended that you run it in compatibility mode if you can't get it to launch which worked except for it would not load the steam account. The steam account failed to initialize when compatibility mode was activated. In short the game launched and was fully functional after I activated administrator privileges and deactivated compatibility mode.

2017-09-20,0,0,658,True,Recommended,Oh Boy PUBG. Where to start 100 People. Last one standing wins. I just cover aspects of the game as any outside drama can be researched elsewhere.Pros + Decent weapon variation+ Fun Co OP play. Duos or squad super fun+ Different play styles can work here so it's open to be played however you'd like.+ Large Map+ Ton of variations for the weapons also adjusting to the play styleCons Buggy as br&gt Buggy as br&gt One map so far Cosmetics being sold before the game is completed Buggy as br&gt Honestly for how buggy this game is I love it to death. It's the closest thing I've gotten to Mod DayZ ( current DayZ BTW). This game is thrilling and every game feels fresh to me. The bugs are plenty Stuff not spawning until after you land. Cars flipping left and right. Ghost sounds of actions that never happened. Landing with your parachute leading to like a 15% health loss. Cosmetics clipping through scopes making visibility impossible. A TON of bugs. But I enjoy this all the same.Be cautious. If you're like me and needed to feel the thrill of playing DayZ Mod again this game is for you. If you can look past the bugs and inconsistancy of parts of the game its truly some of the msot fun I've had in a very long time. If you want a polished game this is not it.I recommend this game purely on the basis of how much fun I have not whether or not Bluehole deserves your money.

2018-08-05,0,0,600,False,Not Recommended,i've had more than enough after 600 hrs spent. i have played maybe 2 hours solo the rest was with friends. most of them stopped playing. i un and reinstalled the game a couple times after being frustrated again and again. i seriously don't know how i could rack up so many hours in this game while at the same time enjoying so little of it. i blame it on social pressure and that half my friends list wanted nothing but to play pubg for the last year. surely spent about 100 of those hours in menus alone. what's good? gunplay feels good and semi realistic in mid to long range engagements. the maps have some nice vistas. playing in a squad with friends can be fun. that is actually all i can think of. i kept playing like many others in hopes they'd fix the rest up but they never did. what sucks? almost everything else. controls? still janky as hell with no real flow from running into vaulting or basically doing anything. netcode? still bad framedrops when you encounter other players like in dayz rubberbanding you or the enemy believing to be in cover while actually lagging behind and really hanging out in the open hits registering after you turned into cover you yourself killing people in dubious ways that feel undeserved graphics? while the maps look alright as long as you're not moving the player models are like advanced ps2 models. seriously wtf is wrong with the hair on the player models that's not hair. wtf bluehole. also there are still many graphic bugs and glitches in the game. bodies and weapons floating in mid air parked vehicles appearing to have an epileptic seizure is a common thing. the game has no artstyle at all and what original assets there are are not very impressive or beatiful. gameplay? it's fun from the point you get the hang of it and get better as long as you aren't burned out already by the games jankiness. i haven't played all the br games out so i can't comment on the balance of the map and circle play much but i think it works alright in sanhok and erangel while miramar is a borefest. how much you get out of it ultimately depends on your willingness to try and git gud so to speak. the game will never really reward you for it tho. this is because the game attracts hackers and gives incentive to camp and ambush. if you are good at this game you will constantly be well placed and probably even win regularly but you will also be killed cheaply a lot of the times and you will start to camp and play like a coward yourself. i found that at that point where you think of yourself as being somewhat good at the game it's less fun. because there will be all these rules in your head what is alright to do now and what not. and then the game will become like work. you will argue with your friends in the squad and people will be because everyone thinks they know the game and that they are smart about it. this game produces bitter burn outs one dude in my friends list actually told me he will never play again with a mutual friend after they had a falling out in pubg. wtf... what else? ing lootboxes terrible cosmetics you wouldn't even want your character to wear every update that adds something makes some other thing that worked fine worse every new gun is op at first then later nerfed to hell and back. the new challenges are terrible. war mode is fun maybe once every few weeks this week i checked back because war mode was the only thing i enjoyed playing lately with my friends and some of us wouldn't even bother with regular matches anymore. they made a mode where they just took out all the guns except the .45ers. wtf bluehole. this supposed to be war mode. this is just normal squads on sanhok with less guns. who thought this was a good idea? war mode is cool whenever it makes the game less tedious to play. so short rounds respawning high powered guns basically a death match. metal rain is at least an interesting concept. but this weeks war mode is further confirmation that bluehole actually has no clue what makes this game fun and just shoots blind and every once in a while happens to hit the mark. i got the game key from a friend back then but would never shell out 30 bucks for this. if you really need to check this game out try to get it somewhere for about 5 bucks that's what it's max worth is imo for the little actual fun you can have with this game. the only way i'd reinstall this again would be if they would revamp the game from the ground up and actually addressed all these issues but i have no hope for that. they will continue put out lootboxes they are planning to monetize custom servers as well and that is all they are working on money making schemes. i hope brendan greene will not put his nick in the title of a game he worked on because that would be an instant no buy. if you put your ing name on it you should be about fixing it not doing fancy talks at conventions about esports. have you even played your own game? actually forget what i said about getting it for 5 bucks. buy a different game or play fortnite instead. i haven't played this a lot but i actually wholly enjoyed my time although i thought i'd hate. it's a real professional game while pubg is almost a glorified asset flip with decent gun play that gained cultural significance by accident and peer pressure. don't believe the hype avoid at all cost. i could have learned a language in those 600 hours that is also semi fun but at least it builds up your intelligence in character. playing pubg is like planning an assassination on your own soul and intellect. save yourself,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,224,True,Recommended,"If you like drinking a cup of tea in the Afternoon then perhaps this game is for you. It is very relaxing from the scenery to the explosions that appear randomly in the map. It puts a new meaning to the song ""What a Wonderful World"" kono subarashii sekai fukuwa so in summary this game is one hell of a drug once you start playing it you can't stop and if you stop you get withdrawal syndromes such as ""Inability to stop playing the game"" I had experienced this and accepted PUBG as a new lifestyle perhaps I can make a living out of this I thought to myself but never the less back onto the topic. PUBG is a very great game made by someone named PlayerUNKNOWN. This game is truly a phenomenon and there is no any other like it. It is truly a unique game with different mechanics from other games. In this game you can run across the map for straight 5 minutes pick up stuff from the floor shoot stuff and best of all drive stuff. This game features everything that you can possibly dream of. I always dreamt of a game like this and now it is REAL that's right. THE FUTURE IS NOW! This game brings a whole new meaning to ""gaming"" it reinvents the term ""gamers"" into another name it is known as ""CAMPERS"" that's right. Not only can you pick up drive and shoot stuff in this game. YOU CAN ALSO CAMP! Oh boy where do I start you don't even need a tent for camping there are HOUSES all over the place and you can pick from Mansions to small houses down in the suburbs or you can just settle for a bush if that's what you'd like camping is fun in this game you get to meet people and maybe say hi and shoot them afterwards or you say hi and they shoot you afterwards either way works but wait we are missing out on something... ain't it a bit sad if you are camping all by yourself? WELL NOT ANYMORE! This game lets you CAMP with YOUR FRIENDS. THATS RIGHT!!! Your FRIENDS! (well if you have any) You and your friends can turn a house into a camping spot and sit down as you wait for the circle to close in this is what I like about the game. The CIRCLE its a circle you know and I love circles. They are round and have curves in this game you get a CIRCLE but not just only one but TWO CIRCLES!!! There's a good circle and a bad circle one is named Mr. White dood and there other Mr. Blue dood apparently Mr. Blue dood doesn't like being blue and electrocutes people who are OUTSIDE it Mr. Blue Circle wants attention you see it wants people inside it (that sounded wrong) so it can grab all the attention and watch each and every one of you destro hug each other and say hi. Now we have Mr. White dood he is a much more introverted dood and stays away from Mr. Blue dood it hates Mr. Blue dood. As soon as Mr. Blue dood touches Mr. White dood Mr. White dood immediately runs away to another spot but within the radius of Mr. Blue dood. But while all this Love and Hate relationship happens with Mr. White dood and Mr. Blue dood you and your friends are probably discussing about life while inside these circles more often your conversations should start like ""Nice weather we are having"" and it starts from there to Advanced Nuclear Theory. &lt &lt Last Words&gt &gt The last thing I'd like to say about this game is that... this game... this game is really special... its... its really something that I think is gonna stay with me for a long time. I'll be playing it when I am depressed I'll be playing it when I am happy heck I'll be even playing it when am asleep.

2018-04-15,0,0,87,False,Not Recommended,I cannot recommend this game. The vehicles are weird to drive the animations feels like every limb of your char weigh 2 tons and the servers should be better. Plus the loot system is dumb who cares about useless tshirts and pants ? Give some bullets or scopes or any actually useful stuff instead ! If at least you could do like H1Z1 and scrap the clothes to make bandages but no 100% useless. At this point it would even be better to find nothing. And this dumb loot systems makes luck a big influence in your games. If you can't get some scopes your options are rush someone hoping he can't aim or hide and hope no one sees you. spoiler hope rarely works.It is still kind of enjoyable but it needs some improvement to make it really enjoyable. Well at least i can farm and sell crates to get my money back ...EDIT They finally improved the looting system it was long overdue. Ah and now that they disabled trading the crates directly between players they are worth almost nothing (a few cents). So you can't even get your money back unless you play thousands of hours.Oh and the new map is nice much more action and a lot more loot to loot making luck a lot less important than other maps which is nice.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Bullet drop.Anyways it's got everything you would expect from a Battleroyal game.You are dropped onto an Island to duke it out with other players The player last standing is the winner and that is all there is to it.However as simplistic as that sounds there is a lot more to look at then just that.This is a tactical shooter tactics can overcome many obstacles even if your weapons are a lot less effective then that of your enemy One well placed shot in the head and your opponent is gaurranteed dead... unless they have something to cover their head with ofcourse.Many a things can be used for cover Buildings Stones... heck even grass.With all this in mind and... Well I could keep on going with cool sounding stuff.... This game does have it's flaws..Most of which are EA problems.You currently as of writing this can find many bugs of sorts I shall name a few Crashing Flying buildings Graphical glitches Lag Frame drops Micro stutters and the list goes on.But even knowing all that it is still a blast to play and I can highly recommend you get this EA game if you have the money and Computer to run it Just don't expect a finished product...

2017-07-06,0,0,317,False,Not Recommended,"Edited 2/21/2018Disclaimer This review is based on the game is at the time of this review. If it improves or degrades in the future I will update the review accordingly. First of all the idea for the game is outstanding. The battle royale style game play is a lot of fun but there are quite a few hurdles this game needs to overcome to live up to this hype.1. Hacking Hacking is killing the game. If they don't do something soon this game will fall into obscurity in less than a year. Supposedly Bluehole has implemented some antihacking measures and they have implemented a reporting system with replays. I'd say about 30 50% of the games I play have obvious hackers. The most common are the no recoil aimbot and the ability to see players through objects and terrain. 2. Performance desync and hit detection I have been 10 yards behind someone lined up the cross hairs on their head and waited a moment to steady my aim only to see my bullets pass right through another player. Another time I watched the replay and it even showed the bullets going through the player's ear only to do no damage. A second or two later the player moves and they take damage ... to the foot?!?!? What the heck is wrong here? You have games like Planetside 2 that's been around forever and it's able to outperform this with hit detection. The same goes for melee which is a hot mess. If you land in a populated area like Hacienda or the School and get a melee kill it's more by chance than skill.3. Reliability and stability The game still crashes at random times. Sometimes it takes 5 seconds to load and sometimes it takes 5 minutes to load and you're falling into the ocean. This is on the same computer running an Intel Core i7 4770K with a RX 580 and an SSD. The lobby still needs to be restarted from time to time and sometimes you get the ""not allowed user"" error which makes no sense. Again the game has great potentional but it's not worth $30 for such shoddy quality. How many millions of dollars have they made and they still cannot address these issues that aren't present in games much older? This is all really frustrating when you see the developers releasing new clothes and hats without actually addressing these issues. We don't want more clothes we want a working game. You've created a new genre of games and you're losing your following to other games that have picked up the battle royale genre. Fix your stuff.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game completely freezes when you're getting shot at. Effects are so damn resource intensive that sometimes your game may crash goodluck surviving red zones. Getting one tapped by a revolver from 50 ft away when you have a Level 3 helmetPros Decent playerbase Sometimes the updates may fix something.

However there are some bugs and things that can make the gameplay really frustating sometimes. 1. Every 5 match or so i get game breaking bugs that leads to my death ingame. 2. There are 2 maps in the game. Some people like the new one some the old one. But the fact i cant decide which map I wanna play is really really bad. Because.. 3. .. i have a really bad pc but i managed to run this game at aceptable FPS but the new map is really heavy for my pc and i like to play the old map 10 times more but sometimes i got to play the new map 8 times in a row and there is not much i can do.But these are the only downsides of the game like i said i can play it really good even tho i have a really bad potato pc the guns are cool and feel amazing the looting system is nice cosmetics are cool the maps (even tho the new map is really tampering with my fps and loading time) are both really good ok etc.I'm gonna play it now and in the future but i hope those things gonna get fixed cause these are some game breaking bugs for me.(and im gonna upgrade my pc in the future cause this maybe fix one problems from the list P),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-02,0,0,331,True,Recommended,Overall not a bad game although I'd suggest waiting for a sale to buy it or until its official release. Combat isn't bad gameplay is intuitive and fun. Character customization is minimal but not a big deal. Gunplay is decent although 9/10 times you'll just wander around for an hour collecting items only to be sniped or shot by a passing dune buggy pair. Weapon mods are cool and well executed. Graphics are a bit intensive I run on low and I've got a decent mid tier PC. Map is often slow to load and you'll find a lot of heavy lag spikes early game. Overall pretty good for early access although it definitely has its quirks to work out. 7/10 would wait for full release or sale.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,711,False,Not Recommended,"I have really enjoyed playing this game since Early Access but cannot recommend it in its current state. It has been a great way for my friends and I to come together as a squad and despite the many bugs and development hurdles it has remained fun.However it is now absolutely riddled with hackers (who are almost exclusively Chinese) and the fun has stopped. This past weekend we had a hacker (aimbot/ESP/etc.) in 9/10 games. Any sort of skill or effort to get to the Top 10 is nullified when someone named laozhengxiou29994301 guns you down from 400m away full auto with an AKM. The replay/kill cam system has made it very easy to tell whether someone is hacking.What's worse is that the developer refuses to take action or even acknowledge the issue. They are actively suppressing posts about it on their official forums and on Reddit. In fact PlayerUnknown claims that ""region locking"" would be xenophobic! But he also stated that the vast majority of bans are Chinese players. Thus I'm forced to conclude that BlueHole/PUBG sees only dollar signs and couldn't care less about remedying the rampant cheating. Some people suggest playing FPP since cheating is less common (but not unheard of) but that's no solution at all. I enjoy TPP and the hackers shouldn't be the reason I stop playing it.So I've decided to stop playing PUBG until the developer acknowledges and fixes this issue. It is sad to see the game go this way but cheating has absolutely ruined the experience for me my friends and many other players.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-16,2,1,115,False,Recommended,"EDIT As of the 1.0 launch the performance issues have been mostly fixed and you will notice signifigant performance improvement I know I did.What I likeGame is fun easially the best in it's classVariety of quenes allow you to tailor your experience to your particular friend groupShooting feels good (hit detection is wonky but that's nearly impossible to get perfectly)Feels tense and exhilirating when you get down to the last few playersGraphics look good and convey the wasteland run down aesthetic well enoughWhat I don't likeAdding lootboxes in EA after the devs said they wouldn't be included until full launchDevs banning people for ludicrous reasons including ""stream sniping""Devs banning people for accidentally using ""exploits"" in a horrendously broken game (it IS EA so I'm not faulting them on that front)Abysmal optimization (At least on my rig GTX 1060 6GB 8GB RAM i7 3820 3.6 GhZ also can't fault the devs for that as it's EA) the game will freeze lag and function poorly more often than not and almost every game will fail to load the textures on buildings when landing making it so I can't loot inside buildings and most times I just end up dying.In conclusionOverall if you only care about gameplay and don't mind the questionable ethics of the developer then I cant't recommend the game enough this is an extremely solid foundation that will only improve with time and what better time to get in on the action than before launch. However if you have a hate boner for microtransaction lootboxes and favoritism towards streamers then you might want to skip out on this one. If you're like me and don't have the best PC avaliable (or at least one on par with or less powerful than mine) then I would suggest waiting for the game to progress more and recieve some much needed optimization updates.

2018-01-25,1,1,520,False,Recommended,After nearly 400 hours on this game I'd have to say it's my favorite competitive game. The massive maps with 100 players is something unlike any game I've ever played. It's quite a good game I love it and I'd recommend it to anyone that hasn't played it. While the game's optimization isn't the best if you have an OK gaming PC then you can run it on low.There's a massive problem in this game that all PUBG players can agree with me on. The hackers foreigners on US servers and low ping players. Ever since 1.0 game out I've noticed a lot of hackers on the game recently more than there have been which is never good. I've seen hackers shoot through walls cross map I've seen hackers run across fields going speed of sound I've seen it all. But note that hackers are only in a small amount of games but you'll definitely see one within the first 10 games.Foreigners. I'm not xenophobic but the problem I'm having here is communication. When you get queued up with chinese players in English servers it can be irritating. For example you've got low ammo and you need your partner to hand you some but he speaks Spanish there's no way you're getting your ammo because he doesn't understand a word you're saying. Low ping players (aka people from other countries). This is a massive problem. When you are hiding behind a corner you'll be dead before you see the player because they're lagging so bad. If you shoot them first you'll be dead before they're downed. ThIs is the biggest problem in PUBG. Something needs to be done.I love the game it just has issues like every other game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-12,0,0,352,False,Not Recommended,I really can't wait for a real studio to take on the battle royal concept and do it right because Bluehole has got to be one of the most incompetent game developers of all time. This game has so many issues that are a huge turn off Chinese ping abusers and cheaters some of the worst hit detection in a multiplayer shooter unstable performance even after early access and the list goes on. Bluehole has done absolutely nothing beneficial to the game's health since 1.0 in fact all they have done is add in loads of microtransaction loot boxes. The concept of this game is seriously addicting and I've had plenty of fun in the 250+ hours I've played but that doesn't excuse the laughable progress this game has made since early access. If you are looking to get into one of these types of games I'd start with Fortnite. It's free runs like a dream and has a very active development team.

2018-02-03,0,0,265,False,Recommended,great game for gun fanatics. unlike fortnight you feel totally in control of the gun. PUBG takes the realistic aproach to a battle royal game bullets take direct paths out of the barrel rather than in fortnight the bullets come out of the hip. with a wide varaity of gun attachments and enhancements PUBG is all about strategy how and when will you advance which gun to take what attachments to use what item do I have to drop to grab theese meds. Overallwhit a gtx 1060 gets you stunning visuals at full ultra settings and 60 fps.

Vehicles will flip after the slightest contact with anything. The low tickrate is absolutely unacceptable for a game that aims to be an esport. Text doesn't render properly in the main menu. Having to reload the whole game from scratch is something you'd expect in a free webgame not a game costing 30 dollars.

2017-05-25,0,0,136,True,Recommended,A battle royal of 100 players you can play in teams of 2 4 or solo. Player's drop into a map loot weapons health items and attatchments for said weapons.A wide range of weaponry from fully automatic rifles to grenades (rpg's and other explosives are not included).Positives of the game so far Gun play feels nice and impactful bullet drop off is not really an issue so newbies will feel right at home just aiming as normal. Vehicles work well and usually have enough fuel to traverse the entire map abundant enough to be found in tough places but not abundant enough that you'll find one immediately everytime you drop. Smarter play styles are endorsed and rewarded long term as combat is very explosive (sometimes literally) and due to the power of weaponry often short lived. (This is good becuase those skilled enough can fight their way through but people like me can just sneak around until late game).Negatives New and therefore bugs are an issue I have an i5 6500 and a gtx 1060 6GB 8GB RAM and I'm having issues with gamer performance I can only imagine what lower end cards and cpu's are performing like I will not get above 40fps (everything on low). Pistols feel a little weak they will win a fight for you (as long as you can aim) if your opponent is unarmed but in a situation where you are fighting against others that have rifles I wouldn't expect to ever win unless they don't have body armour on or a helmet and you get constant headshots rendering it (in my opinion) almost entirely useless. May or may not be a negative stronger weapons feel strangely abundant it is unlikely that you will go through a game without seeing an m14 or finding a shotgun (even if it is the double barrel one). This doesn't leave much for a 'search' aspect of the game other than to pick up meds or to pick up grenades or the start where there is a nice mad rush to find a gun asap.My personal opinion is that the game is pretty fun I haven't got bored yet (I get bored easily),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,754,True,Recommended,I've played my fair share of BR games and this one by far is the best I have seen. I'm only 2 hours into it at the time of this review but after the initial 2 hours of any other BR game I absolutely did not feel as satisfied as this game has made me feel. Some notable moments Running across the bridge (stupid I know but I was out of time to get to the safe zone). A buggy is coming at me from about 200 yds away. 30 rounds in my M16. Switch to semi auto line up my shots and I kill the guy driving it. The buggy comes to a stop right in front of me. I loot the guy quick grab the buggy and head into the safe zone. Waited prone by an airdrop knowing other people were close. Sure enough two guys run at it and start blasting each other. One guy drops and the other runs to the airdrop. He goes prone next to it and I wreck his from behind a tree. I end up with the airdrop and both of their loot. Right off the start 4 of us are dropping into a small group of houses. I sprint inside and go right upstairs hoping to find a gun. I find a UMP and ammo inside a room. I hear footsteps downstairs. I shut the door to the room I'm in crouch and lock my sights on the door. I'm frozen in place so I don't make any noise. I hear the other guy come up to the floor I'm on and run around inside. As soon as he opens the door I blast the out of him and drop him.Overall the thrills and tactical strategic type pace in this game is incredible. It's not arcadey like H1Z1 and it's not a walking simulator like ARMA. It's a perfect mix of the two making it enjoyable for anyone who even remotely enjoys other BR games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-25,0,0,164,True,Recommended,Amazing game. I played during the beta weekends and they've taken everything good from the Arma mod and H1Z1 and combined it together.

2018-06-21,0,0,438,False,Recommended,Gameplay I enjoy this game really much. The game is fun addictive easy to get into but hard to master. You can really see the difference between a good and a bad player even with the RNG of the circle and finding loot. Complaints I don't understand all the people whining about the devs. The devs are great and let normal player like me play super early versions of maps like Shanok. So not only streamers and pros get to experience and give their thoughts on maps in early development. Personally i played Shanok before most of the textures were even added and I could give my feedback on the map. Another complaint is that theres alot of bugs in the game wich is absolutely true (most involving vehicles). These bugs does not bother me at all for me they are just fun. However if you are bothered by bugs just avoid crashing ur vehicle into other vehicles and everything should be fine.I feel like most complaints come from people who just lost a game due to a bug or they got killed by a hacker wich is kinda dumb. The reason the game has negative reviews are because of people raging (I believe). Cheaters I've also seen many complaints about cheaters but I have only experienced 3 cheaters thus far and It does not really bother me too much. (3 cheaters with 380h played). Tips A tip to the devs however is to remove the red zone. The game already has enough RNG with loot zone car spawns and the fact that your playing agains 99 different people every match.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Some lag spikes throughout the game but they're spaced out enough that you barely notice and it has done nothing to diminish my playing experience (2 3 big lag spikes). Takes some time for the main screen to load (I haven't timed it but probably around 30 seconds) which is a little annoying. I was disconected from host once in 24.4 hours of playtime which definately was annoying because I was doing particularly well that game. Still one disconect out of 24 hours and 40 something games played is a lot better than 3 disconects per every 4 games you play (Looking at you again For Honor) I heard that the game will be optimized in about 5 weeks but I haven't confirmed if thats true or not.

2018-02-08,0,0,1085,False,Not Recommended,This game is so overhyped and obviously being used as a milking cow to get more cash.Graphics are ok on ultra but the game is so badly optimized that you need a beast to be able to see and play with that detail. Not that you would want to because it makes enemies harder to spot.After the new update the fps drop is horrible making the game near unplayable unless you don't mind constant stuttering.Even with a GTX1080Ti this game doesn't run smooth.The game suffers from horrible servers with to low tickrate. When you get shot before you see the enemy comming from behind the corner then you know what i'm talking about.Cluncky controls and movement try looting a house in first person. Yes first person because thrid person is just cheese all over as people can just peek around corners without ever exposing themselves. Randomness is your worst enemy.Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters ....

I did play the Battle Royale mod games such as Day Z Rust (although they're a different concept).I've been playing this game for almost 6 hours now Solo and Duo with a friend. I have to say for being an Early Access it's FUC**** AWESOME. It's really fun to play with friends and graphics and optimisation are pretty decent for being an EA. I have an i7 3440k (up to 3.9 ghz) RX 480 8GB 16GB RAM.. I have set graphics to medium and in general I have like 65 70fps in cities it drops to 50 55fps so it's pretty decent in my opinion.I would totally buy it if you plan to play with friends in the future (you can start Solo why not).

Antichrist's Third Temple will have 8 chambers a chamber per main religion antichrist will be crowned in this temple during crowning he won't read the ""belief prayer"" correctly (rejecting Christ and acknowledging himself) when he will take his gloves off to make sign of the cross incorrectly (just for show) many people will see his big nails and will reject him Patriarch (who will be crowning him) will say that this is the antichrist antichrist will kill him. Also antichrist will kill those priests who disagree with him at the 8th ""wolf"" Council others will worship him when a bird dies at his feet. Roman Catholics Satanists and Buddhists use the same mudras if you see these mudras on an icon then it's not Orthodox icon Orthodox icon has IC XC symbol (Jesus Christ). Roman Catholics pay drunks and s to pose for icons passions of drunks and s transfer to those who pray to these images. Normal Orthodox icons are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Gaad in Ruski Satan hence Americans blasphemers because they always say ""Oh my god!"". Santa (word for Saint in Satanic languages) Satan hence Spanish + Italian + Portuguese blasphemers. Anathema to Satanic languages triple anathema. Learn Church Slavonic no curses in it curses prayer to Satan. All religions except Orthodoxy worship Satan. On bread for communion IC XC NIKA (Jesus Christ Conquers) plus cross Orthodox hexagram plus Dusha Maya antichrist. Jews and Muslims pray head down (either standing bowing or kneeling) this is Satanic prayer. Orthodox look into the eyes of icon energy goes their way they get healed head and shoulders come together to reject Satan slowly and then fast to normal showing allegiance to Christ and not the devil. Hands cannot be on groin or behind back either put them crossing each other on chest (right over left) or just by your sides. Legs together so that a demon doesn't run underneath your legs. Clergy who will not ""put Buddhist icons and serve antichrist's blood"" will be killed only 7 churches will be left as Pelageya of Ryazan predicted. In 2006 and at other meetings fake patriarchs and bishops signed a bunch of documents betraying Orthodoxy by saying that all religions worship the same Supreme Being triple anathema don't let heretics tell you what to do. America will be last country to switch to Euro. Three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers 1st big earthquake in Russia 2nd (bigger one) in China 3rd (biggest of the three) will be in America. NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia but will not get past Ural Mountains bio genetic weapon will be used against Chinese soldiers (they will run back to China and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze Siberia to 200 Celcius stadium size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop Chinese aggression) radiation from this hole will be massive Chinese will try to keep quiet about it a lot of people will fall into this hole. Scientists don't see dinosaurs because of radiation. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists wanted war between Russia and Germany from June 11th to October 11th on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) 2016 (in their twisted logic). Tube people demons. Clones demons. Human costumes that demons wear demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud (Shroud of Milan) on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson Lenin (el deity in Hebrew nine no in German so when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator) and Yosef were possessed by Azazel now Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. WW3 happens 7% of people will be left after people are tired of war they will elect the antichrist as one world leader don't vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran one big shake one giant step forward one giant collapse. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet result megatsunamis 1km high). Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel so save knives crowbars shovels wood burning stoves etc. Also save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. Eat natural food because nanochips cells of aborted fetuses bug DNA and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold reject vaccines medical care medicine etc. because nanochips are administered thru IVs implants fillings etc. If 1000 1500 nanochips are in your right hand then you can't make proper Orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. Seraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrected after WW3 for a short time Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. Those who go see Seraphim of Sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases if you want to see him then hurry because he won't stay longer than a few weeks. Earth is flat stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity) pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them go for their nerves. Save the birds but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted slowly pray the Jesus prayer.Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old. He flies very fast deceived people will say that ""Christ is here Christ is there"". Sometimes he wears blue robe over left shoulder while red robe is underneath. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

""money money money we want your money "" *Blueball 2018*2. this game is a hardcore goat simulator. 3. where do you live? what internet do you use? doesn't matter you'll still be killed behind cover.4. landing in the MILITARY BASE and finding 2 pistols in a whole building.5. you hit the enemy 4 times and it shows you did only 50 damage to HP. PUBG legitimate reason? ""you hit his hands dumbfack learn to in aim"" *Blueball 2018* although some people can say the same but not if I say that his hand are covering his whole in upper chest. in level 4 armor there. ( https //www.youtube.com/watch?v _CTjd6k kKs )6. ""we are pushing a weapon balance patch"" *Blueball 2018* patch review AR is now broken and you need to learn the new spray pattarn over again.7. need bug fixes? better net code? we hear you guys. alright lets add more cosmetics! ( see negative reason 1 )8. sometimes your sniper shots goes straight through your enemy head. (confirmed with live records and x0.125 slowmotion. im talking about long shots and it seems that enviroment (like trees) are not rendering right or the players are seen at a wrong position than where they really are I can't really tell but the first about tree rendering is true)9. you can't trade (already been 3 weeks) anymore so pubg make more money from the market.

I honestly am waiting for Island of Nyne because I heard it is Competitive lag free and about the developers actually fixing the game but I wouldn't know until it is actually released on EA.Also there is Ring of Elysion I believe will be a better game then PUBG in the future. but that depends on PUBG and since it depends on PUBG we can be tell that this statement is true.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you are willing to play the game and lag in areas even with a beefy computer just for the graphic's then I guess this is the game for you. The only things that they have done better then KOTK is the aiming and the dropping from a plane system.

2017-03-23,0,0,273,True,Recommended,I've played 40+ hours of the closed beta and this seems like the most promising game of its genre. The Developers take player feedback well and adjust accordingly and quickly. Everytime me and a friend brought up a problem it was fixed in the next patch. This game beats all other battleroyale type games even in its early stages. Its got a large variety of weapons (and they just added the SKS since CBT. WOOT!) attachments that are universal and some are unique to certain weapons a vehicle system that doesn't promote jumping out of a car going 90kph a great map that has many unique locations. Sure it needs some work but the optimization has started slowly but surely and gets better with every patch. AND REMEMBER KIDS. ITS IN EARLY ACCESS.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-11,0,0,263,True,Not Recommended,Company has total sellout practices which affects the game in many ways. Both in development and in features. Console release being the latest one to affect such but not forgetting past events either(like the chinese ad issue&amp microtransactions). Development has been slow lately due console release and bugs still varied in countless ways. SSD being one of requirements to make game playable(yet not listed so in official requirements list). Even free beta testing from players doesn't help them to remove the bugs and warping. Not to mention cheaters.This game is a big hit though and 1.0 will probably bring last patch of huge influx of new players in to the game. Therefore fun time for new players to still enjoy the game. I still wouldn't recommend this game though unless you are a hardcore fan of the series and can't get enough of it elsewhere. Even then you should really look if you want to support this kind of company whose only success was excellent marketing plan.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The vehicles work you can generally tell if someone is around (open doors missing loot) and cover from trees bushes fences etc. The thing that I like the most having played Fortnite first is it takes away the ""Cartoony"" aspect of the game. The first time a sniper fired at me and missed scared the crap out of me. The sound is quite atmospheric. Shots echo in the distance the C 130 overhead sounds authentic and bullet stikes and misses put the fear into you.

Blast some er twice with a shotgun from point blank range and nothing registers while he's killing you in a shot or two with his no recoil insta head shot revolver. Play squads and every match without fail you have some fkn retard on the mic streaming his music or just acting like fktards act. this I'm uninstalling. Bluehole is a fkn joke.

2017-07-30,0,0,156,True,Recommended,Overall the game is fun you might die a bit of times until you get used to it and more experience but again overall fun. Most of the negatives I seen for this game is mainly about the new microtransaction thingy which doesn't seem to bother me becuase I just like playing the game don't care for the looks of my character. Also the performance I've seen that people don't like the performance especially people with lower end specs but the game is being patched monthly with better optimization new weapons and nerfing and buffering. This game is pretty good game bound to be out done by a future game but probably not for quite some years.

2017-12-29,1,1,50,False,Not Recommended,At this games current state officially released out of early access and an update since release I can't recommend this game t people who haven't already purchased it. By all means if you pay this game don't stop. The game itself is good not without fault but that's a similar common criticism with any game. However this game imparticular has some nasty optimization issues still. For example my current rig main components AMD APU A10 7850K MSI GTX 1080 8GB the game sees better frames on 4K and 1440p than on 1080p! Despitet this this is heavily biased and can't (fully) be blamed on the game as there is a limiting factor in this equation my cpu. But still the game remains incredibly unstable post official release which is to some unnaceptable myself partially included.Furthermore the game graphics aren't that bad either to be fair to Bluewhole their graphics are not the worst however the anticheat needs work not a fault of their own necessarily more Battleye's but nevertheless it could still be improved as cheating is a prominent presence in this game. The actual gameplay wouldn't be too bad if the prior poor optimization issues were fixed. A recent addition to the game which I believe appeals more to newer players is the ability to vault through gaps which seems insignificant however when being flanked compared to before this is a game changer now everyone can use this move whereas before only a particular type of player could. From personal experience this has caused issues and lead to my untimely demise.Overall Graphics 7/10 Gameplay 7/10 Content 5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,0,0,53,True,Recommended,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Do you like COD ? Do you like counter strike ? Well maybe you should buy OVERWATCH if you haven't done that yet because this is not a fast paced FPS here you'll have to use your surrounding and your brain so forget about having high reflexes and such and let me explain you the pros and cons of this game.But first please note that FOR NOW if you are looking for a game that will let you gain level and the more you play the more you'll get skills point and such well then this is not in the game you play and every match is pretty unique you win/lose earn money buy a crate that contain a random cloth and you keep playing. There is a leaderboard and a ranked will come at some point.Pros A good variety of weapons You can customize aim sensibility and keyboard (and probably a controller) One match should last around 30 minute average if you are not a run and gun player Every match is different with some fixed elements that allow you to improve The map is huge and is pretty interesting Patching every weeks and one big monthly patch. A smart player can kill someone with fast reflexes Lots of tactics to use depending of the mode 3 mode Solo Duo Squad (4 players) 30$ for such a game is a good deal You can customize weapons by adding mods Not a pay2win (there is no ingame shop) Being cautious is rewardingCons 1 map (they are working on new maps) not fully optimized yet so having a bad PC won't help you Luck is a part of the game that is upon all of the players you may get lucky or not. It's a minor detail but it can bothersome especially players that talk about having ""skills"" they will get very annoyed. No kill cam server busy on week ends but who would knew that so many players would join the early access ? Not me. Some bugs and glitches but it's an early access so it's common.Overall If you are looking for something that is not an fast paced generic FPS and you want a game you could play all day or when you feel like it then this is probably a game for you.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-04,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,"This game has it's moments but they are few and far between. I play this with a few friends and we manage to make it to the last few people standing just about everytime we play. But after a while you start to notice the flaws that make this game not so great. One example is we have run into obvious hackers in about half the games we have been in. By ""obvious"" I mean running faster then a car in circles around my team or taking the full force of a granade and running away. We report them as we see them but we keep seeing them. It's even more noticeable in the end game when your down to just a few players who kill you through buildings or appear in random spots you were just stareing at. So in a game you play with about 100 other players give or take a few at the start. Thats almost a guaranteed hacker every match. Also the NA servers are flooded with non coopertive asian players who don't speek english. We have a three man party most of the time leaving us to pick up a random in team matches occasinally. But 90% of the time it's an asian player who either runs away as soon as he hits the ground team kills one of us or runs around stealing all the ammo for guns he's not holding. It was funny at first but it's getting old quick.Lack of any creative features aside from the five or six base models and haircuts is kind of odd concidering you have to pay 3 000 credits to change them. And most of the cloathing you unlock is boring and pointless considering you can pick things like that up in game. The coats are upwards of 30.00$ on the marketplace so It dosent surprise me that evertime I open a box it's the same white hat or a plain t shirt that I already have. So the tactic quickly became sell the crap items I get and buy one of the better looking ones from the marketplace. But the marketplace is already flooded with these crap items so nobody is buying them. So now I have 3 white hats I can't do anything with. And a bunch of stuff that I don't ware. If you can get it on sale for half price it's probibly worth your money. I wouldn't really recommend it otherwise.As of 11/07/2017 I'm running into hackers too much. Played two games worth noting in the last few days. One had an asian player who single handedly cleared the map and won. He was taking out teams of four left and right with a sub machine gun. When he made it to us he took us all out with one shot. Two of us had all lv 3 gear so there is no reason why we should have went down that easy. the other was us vs. another team for the win. We noticed they had no gear on and took no damage. Needless to say they won. So it really begs the question. What's the point in playing a game where there is no progression and you have anywhere from a one to four in a hundred chance to actually win and a 50% chance to play against a hacker? This game needs work but it already made it's money. And I made mine back selling the stupid clothing items the game out as prizes. So I guess what I'm saying is If all that drives you is a floral pattern shirt and a pair of goth boots then this is the game for you.Also I'm fairly confident this game uses micro trans matchmaking. I sold a few crap items and bought a pair of black pants and a gas mask. The next 10 games were the best I ever had. Every shot landed people wen't down after two hits and I made top 5 at least 4 out of the ten times. I bet if you pay attention to it you'll notice this too.Well just played the new update 1.0 got to 2nd place in a singles match and didn't get any of my points after being brought back to the main screen. 750 BP god damit!Now I just won a game of squad on 12/23/2017 and the game fleaced me for another 245 BP. Do you get punnished for winning now!? I have the screen cap to prove the only squad match I have played so far was a win. But no points again!As of 1/31/2018 Most hackers I've seen in a game yet.

2017-11-11,0,0,400,True,Not Recommended,"""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a fresh take on battle royal games that has taken the Steam store by storm. Its really enjoyable and a fresh new experience in which I have spent over 200 hrs on. PUBG was a fun to play early access game which millions of people have bought and participated in it being the top in action genre. However ever since the weekly and monthly patches has stopped I am sad to say the game has gotten boring. While I appreciate that the developers putting a lot of time and work into pushing new content I am concerned that the Xbox One version of PUBG has taken priority over say optimization and realistic features which affects most of the community seeing as the majority of players are on PC. So while I am glad to see PUBG on other platforms I would prefer they fix optimizations and glitches in the game first before starting a venture into Xbox. Overall I would recommend PUBG to people who are looking for a fun enjoyable time with friends That being said since optimization for the game is taking so ridiculously long I have not been enjoying the experience recently so I would not recommend the game as of now."" Kerrman7 Personally I love the game but many other things are also broken and unfixed. The game is still in early access but this is the time for the developers to pull together the reviews and work on what the commutify wants and general optimisation rather than making new events just so they can sell cases and make money. If many vehicle glitches and bugged were fixed I feel like the game would reach wider audiences but for now the game is still in early access and I hope to see it reach full release but until then I would not recommend this game for average consumers 2 out of 10.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Get shot at from a random direction.5. Try to find where you got shot from but you cant because all the bullet sounds ricochet off of everything.6. Die never seeing your enemy once.7.

WHEN YOU KEEP SHOOTING SOMEONE EVEN IF HE HIDES BEHIND A ROCK OR A WALL THE BULLET STILL HITS THE PLAYER THIS IS ONE SMALL MISTAKE THAT HAS GREAT EFFECT ON THE GAME (SO PLEASE FIX THIS!!!). ALSO THE GAME WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU COULD HOLD YOUR BREATH WHEN YOU CROUCH SO YOU WOULDNT MAKE AS MUCH NOISE WHEN MOVING AND/OR SWICHING BETWEEN WEAPONS (FOR A BETTER STEALTH ASPECT ON THE GAME) AND ALSO WHILE HOLDING YOUR BREATH YOU MOVE SLOWER AND HEAR SOUNDS (GUNSHOTS OR WALKING NOISES) BETTER. IF THIS IS IMP.LEMENTED ON THE GAME IT WOULD BE MORE ENJOYABLE FOR EVERYONE. DONT JUST ADD WEAPON SKINS FOR BETTER PROFIT ON THE GAME AT LEASE MAKE THE GAME MORE REALISTIC (LIKE CSGO) AND FIX ALL THE BUGS AND ISSUES EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. I JUST HOPE YOU COULD READ THIS FEEDBACK ON THE GAME AND TRY TO ACTUALLY ASK THE MANY PLAYERS PLAYING THIS GAME FOR BETTER IMPROVEMENTS ON THE GAME. THIS GAME HAS A POTENTIAL AND DONT LET THIS GAME BECOME LIKE OVERWATCH OR H1Z1. MAKE THIS GAME FOR THE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME NOT FOR THE PROFIT YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAKE. OVER ALL... THIS IS A VERY GOOD GAME. (IT WOULD BE BETTER WITHOUT THE ISSUES IT CURRENTLY HAS). !!!PLEASE READ!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-22,0,0,36,False,Recommended,A great battle royale game... Has a lot of originality unlike some I think it's a lot better than fortnite as well mainly because it's focused more on who can shoot better rather who can build better and I like that simple aspect of the game. The only concern is the absolute trash anti cheat they have and the fact that they do very little about it. Other than that if you like fortnite but are looking for something more realistic and challenging (and with cars) I'd 100% suggest this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-30,0,0,518,False,Not Recommended,I love this game. I really do. But my main issue comes from what the devs are doing.These devs aren't trying to make the game any better if they are attempting to sue the competition that provides the engine their game runs off of provide greedy and microtransactions that would come in when the game was 'finished' push out the game to XBOX (which was a ing travesty) etc.I really like this game because it offers combat that I like. It offers me combat that Fortnite doesn't. I personally wanted a shooter like PUBG for a long time and I am thankful. However if the developers continue their incompetent behaviour the game will die. I want this game to do well but with the direction of the game as it stands it will continue to be plagued by bugs and poor optimization while the developers at Bluehole do nothing but do Class A drugs and make more money off of it rather than make even more money and make the game better.I would not advise you to play this game unless you are stubborn like myself for thinking this game will get better. I also advise you check out Fortnite as Epic Games are doing a decent job at making the game (as they provide consistent updates fixes content etc).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-08,0,0,250,False,Not Recommended,Updating my review on it. The game itself playability wise is a lot better. They devs seemed to have smoothed out any rough edges as far as performance goes. My beef is when you're actually playing. Be prepared to run into hackers because there's a lot of them. Thousands being banned every single day but they just keep coming. They originate from the countries that are supposed to be playing in asian servers (They have a few choices as far as servers go) But they head to the North American servers instead. It genuinely ruins the game and a region block needs to be put into place. Hopefully the devs will get the message.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is so bad that talking to your friends (and you can do it in every other mulriplayer game) is a really great ""pros"" here.Cons You do everything in super bad graphics with really boring overall gameplay Running in really bad graphics. Boring looting some boring loot. Riding cars that handle like crap.The rare moments of shooting someone are good but mostly all the time you wander in some buildings trying to get some stuff talking to your friends 'cause otherwise you will die from how boring this game is.

2017-10-15,0,0,234,False,Recommended,As someone who once considered Player Unknown's Battlegrounds to be extremely buggy and basically unplayable I can definitely say that the game has improved tremendously since it came out of EA (Early Access). The game used to have constant hitreg issues vehicles flying in the air asian cheaters etc.. but 99.9% of those issues are fixed. Of course Bluehole should stop trying to milk the game by adding the event pass and paid cases considering the game is $30 USD but that doesn't take away the fact that the game is actually finally fun and playable. As someone who played in early access and quit due to the unplayability of the game due to cheaters and bugs I can confidently say the game has been fixed. Thanks Bluehole for actually paying attention to these bugs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-02,0,0,698,False,Recommended,absolutly love this game definately one of my favorite games. personally this is my favorite battle royal game out of PUBG Fortnight and H1Z1.

2018-05-08,0,0,102,False,Recommended,PUBG is a game with a simple concept be the last one standing. Simple in theory hard in practice (Unless your shroud but dont lie ur not so yeah struggle). Pros Guns feel great and every gun feels unique Vehicles have simple controls and are easy to understand Very easy to bring salt out of your teamates and teamkill them (but you never heard that from me) Winning feels very rewarding.Mixed The game contains a lot of bugs and glitches which can be both hilarious and detrimental to your gameplay and enjoyment out of the game. Maps are diverse and unique however limited in selection. Map selection was only added A few days ago whilst having multiple maps for more than half a year. People bring their tents everywhere they go A house with 20 rooms? camp in a corner! Grass with very little visibillity? Set up shop for 5 minutes!Cons Third person mode is very annoying to play in as people can camp round corners and shot you way before you spot them First person remedies this and the only real way to play PUBG without generating salt. The game is updated rarely and takes forever to add new content fix bugs and balance guns (which has only happend once in all of the games lifespan). Has limited modes and incentives to keep you playing the game. Microtransactions are cosmetic only however they are tradeable and are random to recieve. Toxic community and will talk you when you down them.In Conclusion is this game worth it? I believe so. The game at its core is very fun and very realistic. Player Unknown has nearly perfected the battle royale mode but lacks to provide the game with the support it needs to stay relevant. If you likre Fortnite give this game A shot you might like it and vice versa its ok to like both games. But at the moment falls behind Epic and fortnite due to lack of support for their game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-08,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,I don't recommend this game for few reasons which Ill include later.First of all the game is very fun among many other fun games like Fortnite (which I don't play but tried a few times) and other Battle Royale games. BTW PUBG is not the ORIGINAL/FIRST battle royale game.Its competitive very good looking and closest to realistic.About the weak points 1)Unoptimized yet power and resource hungry.2)Hackers all these random headshots spikes and so on sometimes happen due to hackers exploiting the server....3)The BIGGEST PROBLEM WHICH MADE ME HIT THE THUMBS UP IS GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!Developers greed for money and EARLY ACCESS GAME with MICRO TRANSACTIONS it just says it all about the future of pubg.

To be completely honest I think people are just tired of the game. I realize that im extreamely late in buying the game and I don't have allot of hours logged in the game and I still have allot of fun every time I jump out of that damn airplane. The people I ask in game and most of the people posting negative reviews have allot of hours in the game. I don't want to say that the game is shallow but 800 hours of jumping out of a plane and doing almost the exact same thing is bound to get boring. If you're on the fence about buying this game just do it. I think it's worth 30 big ones if not for the 25+ hours fo fun that you are guarenteed from the game at least from my point of view.

First off i'll say the game's 1.0 release was not by any means a 1.0 release the game is still riddled with bugs and clunky mechanics that will urk the calmest guy in his most solitude state. Hackers currently take over the population of the game and sometimes it feels there's 2 3 Hackers per game on Third Person luckily First Person there's a lot less of these vile little cretins running around.The game is a lot of fun in short bursts with friends but it has A LOT of problems broken promises from Developers a vile and draining gambling microtransaction system that isn't even done well at all simple things like Skirts cost up to 300. The right? If you're like me and love customizing your character before an epic battle you can absolutely forget about it with this title and a lot more it's the pinnacle of what's wrong with the gaming industry right now greedy corporate bastards.Now if you can overlook a lot of problems more than what's said above and just have some mindless/competitive fun with friends then pick it up it's not an expensive game by any means you get your money's worth in hours of fun with friends but there's stuff i just can't overlook so for now the game is a thumbs down.

2017-08-04,0,0,493,True,Recommended,"DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY OPTIMIZE THE GAME I've been looking forward to playing the game after watching some Let's plays on Youtube it seemed like a fun squad game to try out allthough expensive at this point of the development.Scrapped 30e and bought it thinking I wouldnt't have any problems running it since my specs are better then the system requirements not by far but should've been good enough especially since i ran The Witcher 3 on medium even though it had higher requirements. Instead even when I've put the settings to ""Very low"" which makes the game look like it was made 20 years ago It still feels stuttery. I don't get that much FPS drops and it's playable but it just doesn't seem smooth and so many times that's the cause of death in a 1v1 fight which really shouldn't be the case for any fps game.All in all stay away from it for now unless you have the highest end possible gaming PC also don't trust the system requirements they aren't enough to make the game playable for you. For 30e it isn't worth it IN THIS STATE (especially now that the servers lag constantly too). If they optimize the game fix all the server issues and gamebreaking bugs go for it it's a fun game although not as fun if you don't have a squad or at least one friend who owns it. EDIT AFTER SEPTEMBER UPDATE I've marked it positive since they've actualy done some optimization and the game seems to run decently now although still with terrible graphics. Everyone knows the games fun by now and if they continue optimizing like this it should be a guaranteed purchase for everyone. So at this point id recommend it it's fun it's competitive gather some friends and have a good time just make sure you have a good PC first that's well above the requirements still if you don't want it to run at below 30 fps )Also i just want to emphasize this agian DO NOT BUY IF YOU JUST REACH THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. The actual minimum requirements are the stated processor a GFX card that's at least a generation above what they wrote an SSD hard drive (the game has rendering issues and it gets rid of the most annoying problems if you have one) and at least 10 GB of ram. And that's if you want to run it on 1920 1080 with everything set to very low IN THE GAMES CURRENT STATE.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

ANd the optimization,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-02,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG I have had on record since day one of Early Access release and since then I can say there have been a lot of changes to the way the game looks how it's played and how far it has come. I was excited to play a game of a new genre and had potential to be a Number 1 seller which at first it was and credit where it's due. But since the official release and port to consoles all I have noticed is that the devs are just throwing in new bits of content and adding new ""features"" into the game without fixing certain issues that have been around for a long time. The Driving in PUBG has always been something that I have left to someone else simply because it's broken. You can be driving in an open field and hit an invisible wall or the smallest obstruction that any vehicle can easily drive over with no consequences at all and the vehicle you're in will ragdoll for what seems like forever taking out the integrity of the vehicle as well as the HP of the passengers inside. Countless amounts of time this has happened to me and my squad and the result has always been game over.The new items within the game both Cosmetics and new Weapons have been nice to look at and can somewhat seem like a luxury to find the clothing I'm not too bothered about as I'm more about spending the time within the game on the lookout for opponents however the weapons especially can seem a little scarce from time to time. The addition to more weapons and higher tier items has lead to less likely ""good"" finds seeing as Supply Drops seem to be rarer than usual (Although this could also be down to the other players getting there first in which case fair play) however it's rare to find another player with a better weapon than one that would usually spawn. Now the elephant in the room. Loot boxes. Why? Simple answer Money. Before the official release and for a short while after the loot box system worked amazingly you get rewarded with in game currency depending on your performance in game similar to an XP system. You then use the credits earned in game to redeem a random loot box which would then give you a cosmetic item. It was nice to have something new every once in a while but again I was never really bothered although having a squad with the same outfits was fun at times. Now however they have put a real life price on the loot boxes as like most Valve Titles with their loot box system (CS GO Team Fortress 2 etc) you now have to use your REAL money to open a box. Sure it's less than 2 to open a box but that's EACH box! Surely the grind to get 700+ for a single box is enough of a struggle for some! One thing I have had an issue with since day one is the abysmal loading time of the game itself. This is where most people would go ""Just get a good PC"" but considering I have spend close to 2k on mine with the specs more than the recommended requirements it should load quicker than the time taken for the game to start and for your player to drift to the ground. I'm sure you've noticed those AFK players at the end of a drop one of those would usually be me for the first game but i shouldn't be a free kill as I easily have the requirements to play this game!I have realised that the developers aren't keen to help players with genuine issues with the game and would rather ignore the situation or retaliate. A friend of mine purchased the game and had ""Issues with his account"" and when he queried the dev's they said they couldn't do anything about it. Most would get annoyed at the fact that they've then wasted the money on a game the developers won't let them play so he told them to fix it. The outcome? Permanent Account Restriction! THE DEVELOPERS BANNED A PLAYER BECAUSE HE COULDN'T LOGON! How many other developers or companies would ban someone from playing their creation most would do what they can to fix it. I had similar issues to this with content that I purchased on another game not being available and after various forms and forum's it was fixed with a compensating item in game to make up for it. The game that I was having issues with was Star Wars The Old Republic by BioWare. BIOWARE! They can be atrocious at times with their support considering it's EA but even that beats what I have seen from the PUBG Corporation.Most of the players in game seem to be just as bad at times with the option for Voice Chat always being disabled simply because the toxicity of the players. I decided to enable the chat just to hear what was occurring and all I heard was people screaming down the microphone a barrage of people trying to be funny by repeating common phrases and memes and then the abuse from one player to another mostly resulting to very explicit and racial language.Overall the game was pretty good and enjoyable at the beginning but now the devs seem to do nothing but add more content as opposed to fixing the game. The attitude from the devs is absolutely appalling and they seem to be more interested than raking in money from those that want those loot boxes as opposed to keeping their reputation. The playerbase seems to be a Chernobyl based on the toxicity and the gameplay itself has become a bore. Considering the more recent reviews on this game have been negative and their players leaving I can confidently say that they won't have a leg to stand on in the future. Needless to say everything that I have earned in game is being sold on the steam market to compensate the time I now realise I have wasted and if there was an option to refund this game I would do it in a heartbeat.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-04,0,0,614,True,Recommended,This game is probably one of the most fun games I have ever played. At the moment the servers go down quite often but that is just because there are so many people playing (1.5 million at the time im writing this) and they only expected a couple thousand in the entire early access. If you are patient and have other games to play when the servers are down this will be the best $25 you will ever spend on a game honestly I might like it more than CS GO a game I have put 1.2k hours into.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-16,0,0,305,False,Not Recommended,Can't honestly recommend this game to anyone at this point. Devs don't care about hacking or fixing bugs. Instead they work on releasing new skins and crates every month as more of a money grab. Miramar is a terrible map which needs a lot of fixes. Not happening. Vehicle physics are terrible. Game lags and glitches every other match. This originated from a mod but yet no SDK even though developer said plans to but we are no longer in early access. SDK would allow the community to make quality maps way better than Shitmar. Devs got their money and they no longer care about their community.

2018-03-29,1,1,14,False,Not Recommended,First off this game in itself is great. In my own opinion in terms of gameplay its the best battle royale game out right now. The problems lies in the sheer amount of foreigners you will end up playing with when you solo queue. This problem completely ruined the game for me. Every single time you queue you will 100% have at least a squad of chinese players in your game. Communication with these players is completely impossible and it hurts overrall gameplay experience tremendously therefore,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I recently stopped playing due to the influx of cheaters and the game just getting super boring. I've played over 300 hours of this game and it was always fun to play win or lose. Now it's just a game full of cheaters and takes way too long. A lot of people have made the switch over to Fortnite like I have because of this game being in a bad state with barely any updates. If changes came to make the game fun again with little to no cheaters I might consider playing regularly again. I do not reccomend this game as of now it's unoptimized has a ridiculous amount of cheaters and bugs and games take way too long.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Don't get me wrong it has improved since it first came out although the performance on the new map is horrific. Their servers are a joke considering how much money they have made you would expect them to invest in them but nope. They are showing no signs of them being fixed as on the new 1.0 update it's back to square one with the rubber banding.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-16,1,2,342,True,Not Recommended,The best thing about this game is when vehicles bug out in a funny way (but you will most likely die and possibly take your team with you). I'm glad this game is getting cucked by fortnite. The list of bad things about this game is endless and the fact that it costs 30 squids is an insult. The graphics are playstation 2 tier but even PS2 games actually loaded properly and you couldn't buy in game tracksuits for them for 40 squidwards. You'd think with all the money this game has made it would be improved majorly but no. It's still utter garbage especially if you're not dicking around with a team of mates. If you don't like dying due to not having a NASA level computer to load buildings quicker than others to grab a gun faster or having bad luck then I would not advise getting this game. Despite all of the hype caused by streamers there is nothing worse than stressfully looting for 15 minutes to be sniped by someone you don't even see and then having to restart. Disconnecting for a few seconds has become even more torturous. Maybe 1 percent of people use global chat by the way to make jokes or whatever. Don't hope for the same shenanigans on twitch.The fog map can be very entertaining however the rain and thunder map is painful as those sounds assault your ears 4 times louder than they should. I could go on about hit detection etc but I'm losing the will to live. I have no chicken dinner goodnight.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Instead of fixing the problems BlueHole is focused on adding lootboxes and hosting pro tournaments which the game is clearly nowhere near ready for.Don't buy it unless it goes below $10 dollars and even then it's probably more worth it to spend on something that's actually good.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(hence the ''Yes review'')Pros A lot of tactic involvedGreat concept for a good game A lot of fun playing with friendsMany different gunsTraveling avalible by boat and carHuge playing field (maybe a little too big tho)Cons Right now there is a huge problem with rubberbanding (player teleporting to previous location) this might be because the full game just launched and alot of players started playing at once tho.95% of all the games consists of camping or runnning for 20mins looking for people and getting killed by someone camping in a city.Camping. nuff' said.Summary Its a really great game with alot of potential but i'd like to see more improved servers (im sure the team is working on it but still)I really would like a bit smaller maps to force players to engage in more firefights.As i said awesome game fix these two things and i would love it even more but please prioritize the servers and the rubberbanding problemThank you for your time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Some more cons You can not reload and open doors (They are working on this) Slow pick up times with F you have to tab and pick up items Driving is horrible at times with random bumps random little rocks you can get caught on but turning and driving does feel nice inconsistency with shooting and damage Very RNG in the beginning but that is kinda hard to fix Random lag spikes but has much better hit detection than H1Z1 ALL HONEST AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE (Let me know in the comments if you agree and disagree we don't want to agrue that won't fix the game),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,50,False,Recommended,A mix of Arma and King of the kill. Not an arcade style battle royale like King of the Kill but based on the same principle. This game is more slow paced but ramps up with intensity as time goes on with a consistently shrinking circle and the player numbers dwindling down to the last man or team standing. You can play as solo duos or as a four man squad. Each queue is specific so you will never join a game as a solo against a squad or duo. Personally it reminds me of the exciting looting elements of the DayZ (Mod) and the intensity of not knowing where people are along with the terrifying moments of sprinting across an open field expecting a sniper shot at any moment. If you enjoy battle royale type games and are looking for one that is a relatively slower in its pacing you will definitely want to buy this. The devs are very active in the community and are quite consistent and frequent with their updates.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I am not a pro but this article it's just to make sure that everyone who wish to buy this game can know what PUBG is. First i need to claim that if you use to play Fortnite then you can't say much and judge this product i know there are lot's of people saying that Fortnite is way better than PUBG in different ways either Graphics Weapons Maps and lot sort of things but i don't want to argue any more. But just saying PUBG is a mature game for those gamers who extremely like battle royale games. PUBG is really similar to H1Z1 if you use to play it then it's good for you although i never ever tried H1Z1 before because it's dead. PUBG has two maps it's a 50% chance to get any of the map. So you need to know every looting area in both maps such as military base or El Pozo(first is the old map second one is in the new dessert map). I prefer Old map for the ""noobs"" because it's easier to see those people hiding in the ground. There are advantages in PUBG like 64*64 ultra big map and vehcles and sort different guns. There are disadvangtages too for example there's a guy in chille suit right next too you but you just can't spott you and you got killed by him using a frying pan.That's the end of it it's a extremly good game please add me if you want to play together.

2017-08-31,0,0,827,True,Recommended,though the game is entertaining i do have a few complaints. points i feel can be too easily earned if you know how to do it and those who fight to survive dont get many in comparison. Say you go afk and last 3 and a half minutes you can earn perhaps 75 coins while a player that lasts to rank #34 with no kills earns 119 there is no reason to play if the reward is slim to nothing. I would base the coin on an evaluation on distance traveled by foot vehicle kills and most importantly rank. The time you survive is irrelivant in this situation. These simple changes would change afk strats and force people to play for the advantage making the game more enjoyable for everyone. Out side of this the game is wonderful a few more weapons to add to variety for common weaponry (and more use for the pistol they are initial spawn use at best) and this would be 12.5 times better than before. Im not a big fan of games where you can die in 2 seaconds if you dont see the other guy first but this game encourages more gun fight situations,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-12,0,0,279,False,Not Recommended,Good game with bad optimization and anti cheating. With OC 4770K 4.4Ghz GTX1060 6GB and 32GB RAM and all low setting excepet view distance I can only get about 75 avg fps in 1080P game. Some of the low objects seems walkable but in fact you cannot go through it unless you jump. Lived in the U.S. but I suffered rubber banding in even NA server. Also anti cheating is a huge problem for this game since most of us met those who cheating and kill your easily. It ruins the game experience.It's hard for me to recommend this game to others. So just play if you friend will play a squad with you.P.S. After the official release there are still so many people cheating.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You accepted them as a part of the mystique of an early access title.The gameplay remained this fun sense of stealth tactics and teamwork (for duo/squad). It's that gameplay has kept PUBG afloat.Since 1.0 the performance has gotten much better and with any hope the game will continue to get better. I feel like the 0.9 version to 1.0 was a massive step in a legit shooter that stands the test of time up there with the Battlefields and Call of Duty's.I have enjoyed reliving DayZ (the Arma 3 mod) days I do want to see the streamer only 4 5 v 96/95 zombies mode come to be a legit queue hopper in the future I think it will bring a fun alternative way to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-06,0,0,164,True,Not Recommended,A great core concept that is poorly executed in nearly every way. The servers range from bad to hit detection can be laughably bad and most of the game comes down to RNG. But instead of fixing these issues the developers decided that they needed to add paid cosmetics to an unfinished game to fund a compettitive tournament for a game that by definition isn't compettitive.

I feel (along with many others) that it's done so perfectly.

2017-07-26,0,0,1265,True,Not Recommended,I've got quite a bit of playtime in this game and I can wholeheartedly say that despite loving this game (for the meantime) it will soon be ran into the ground by the sketchy development team. Bluehole has repeatedly lied about early access features microtransactions and is putting more time into developing cosmetics than they are into actually improving the gameplay. Optimization is poor and don't expect to be able to smoothly run this game with anything less than an newely built system. Server latency and Connection is poor and has not had a thorough revision since the release of the game. PUBG has sold nearly 5 million coppies and refuses to create dedicated servers. Instead they decide to use a third party ( Amazon if memory servers me correctly) to host games for the almost 400k players on at any given time. Expect the game to randomly discconnect mid round. Expect to get shot through walls expect to fly off the road if touched by another vehicle. The bugs in this game are horendous and often (about 1 out of every 10 games) causes it to be unplayable. We are talking everything from not being able to control parachutes to not being able to aim on a vertical axis. This game needs some serious work and based on the lack of progress shown the lack of developer support and the uyndeniable greed by the developers within the next 6 months I can gaurntee that this game will be dead. The developers will cash out and leave the players with nothing more than a half finished game and $30 less in their wallets.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One negative thing that can be said about this game are the performance issues which aren't that prominent since the 1.0 launch but are still present another thing is the CHINESE why can't Bluehole just give them their own server since OC and NA servers seem to be getting the brunt of their hacks and teamkills it just doesn't seem to help bluehole in any way since this could lead to a chunk of the playerbase quitting.

Erangel the island map is pretty good i especially love dropping school. the other map Miramar is fine but i do feel like it needs more work and more stuff the loot especially has a worse roll then Erangel. the guns are nice there are a good amount of different guns and the gun machanics are nice and pretty realistic. vaulting redzone and the blue circle are quite nice and im glad that the creator himself wants to improve the blue circle especially.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The graphics are good and all that that nice i guess.Also i dont like the new map (Miramar) i feel like it should been filled with more action but the developers did the opposite and put 20 towns instead of like 2 3 large towns and 3 medium and then 1 or 2 small towns.My opinion may change after 1.1 but i don't know what to expect from it.

2018-01-30,1,1,143,False,Not Recommended,unoptimised unbalanced poorly designed janky mess that will go the way of dayz due to lack of support and maintenance of the devs.controls like your a tank stuck in a lake of syrup and has some of the most tedious gameplay that essentially boils down to running away from a blue line and then getting killed in the top ten because the rng gods have frowned upon you. If you want a game with player choice then you should play this game because the two choices that you're lamped with at the end of every single game are just simply amazing. Run out into the open and be cut down by bullets or actually attempt to move up in a tactical way and die to an electric blue force field. omg such choice. I can really see how taking away all semblence of decision making and player agency in the final moments of the game while one or two players are sat happy in their little safe zone not having to move while every other player runs towards them like a headless chicken really is the best way to discover the best online fps player.player unknown is quoted as saying in an interview that the best player should win every game this however is not the case as he has just made an rng s**t show of a game.This game has almost as many problems as dayz and if you did even five minuites of digging online you would see countless reviews from people taht know wtf theyre talking about absolutely decimating this game absolutely murdering this game with words because it is just a tedious repetitive janky mess of rng s**t,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The Game devs dont really give a about bugs being in the game the only thing they are focussing on is more ""content"" but even that is such a slow progress if you metion there playerbase as of now. 2. So many RAGE Hackers! All hackers you meet dont give a about anything they are just walking around with esp Aimlock and autoshoot enabled. On top of that the devs seem to like them cause they do nothing to stop. 3. Trust me this is the most important one of the three.

2017-10-19,0,0,140,True,Recommended,This game is good fun when alone and magnitudes more fun with friends in a squad. PUBG can be fun for those who have little military knowledge like myself and enjoyed as a fun tactical shooter alone or with friends. However I have realised how greatly realistic some of the features of the game are in simulating real combat while playing with friends who have a basic to moderate level of military knowledge/training which some people may find to be a selling point.*Since many people seem to be review bombing this game in relation to stream sniping bans I would like to highlight that neither me nor anyone I know has experienced this I think it is affecting very little people compared to the number of people jumping on the hate bandwagon and the issue seems to be happening less as time gone by so maybe the devs have listened to the complaints?Conection I haven't had too many issues with servers or connectivity in the Oceania server Although a few of my games have started with some server lag this corrected itself after a few minutes and has only affected a vast minority of my games (2 games out of between 30 50). A lot of people also seem to be complaining about connectivity issues so i'm not sure if i've been lucky or if this is mainly affecting people in China or other northern asian countries and North America.When i first played I had a game or two that was interrupted by the game client crashing this hasn't happened for many months and I found to be acceptable at the time since it was quite new to early access.Updates and new content are regularly being added as well as bug fixes so it seems like the devs won't be pulling an ARK SE on us.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It didn't even tell me that I have been outside the playerzone and didn't notify me of that. There was poor caracther customizition and nearly every hair color looked about the same. The sound just diasipered.I like the servers fast to join. There was no lag I did notice and runs smooth on old graphics cards network speed. Very active community updates and people playing it.I hope this game will get better at a time I will still play it.I will change this over time.2017 10 15Wow the game doesn't remember what region I'm on.Lags so much that you don't see people in vichels.2017 11 25Still you sometimes can't see peoples in vichels when they are really near you.When it rains it lags.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-06,1,1,1791,True,Recommended,tl dr This game is fun. This game is life. This game is love. And a little bit of rubber band. 8/10 will be 10/10 once some minor fixes are implemented.Do you want the battle royale type of game then this is it. You can't compare it to any predecessor except for the actual game mode. The weapons have a good balance the military grade loot fixed locations really does create another dimension to the tactical aspect of the game. Do you want to jump straight down and challenge up to 15 20 people for the scarce loot in a smaller city or do you wanna fly far away maybe grab a car and go to a remote location for your loot? This game offers it all. The cars are not as illogical as in H1Z1 and this took a few games to get used to. I truly do love that end game is not about driving a car in 150 km/h jumping out to 2 tap people. This goes for both solo duo and squad. Mainly because if you jump out while your car is moving you will take damage. Hell you might even die because of it.The weapons and attachments this aspect can be kind of random. At times you'll find yourself with every attachment you might want sometimes you simply won't. It's an even mix of rng and you actually planning if you'd find something of interest early of the rounds. The weapons are evenly balanced and with full attachments no gun really sticks out of the mix. In my opinion this is one of the best aspects of the game. If I had to compare the weapons to any other title I'd say Arma.The only negative thing I have to say during this review would be the rubber band lag that has been occuring on the servers for quite a bit since launch. I still play through the rounds every time that's how fun this game is. The developers are currently working their asses off to polish this game and I'm sure it won't be long until they've sorted all the issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-12,1,1,1077,True,Not Recommended,Brought to you by Sellout Inc. Player unknown also worked on the infamous cashcow H1Z1 and worked hard to bring you the same level of support for bugs and hackers. The worst game optimisation I have ever experienced. Terrible server lag at the beginning of every game. Sync issues that cause bullets to either miss or hit and do no damage. Render issues on slow pc's that allow players to walk or drive vehicles through walls on a regular basis. Buggy title screen. And that's just what I recall off the top of my head. These are all known issues that have been present since release. Not to mention the aimbot and speed hackers which dominate the higher ranks. The game may be in early access but that doesn't mean a free pass to treat the community like ****. This is the top selling game on steam and they seem completely incapable of fixing issues that we've all been shouting at them about since day one. Instead of fixing the games flaws they would rather battle Microsoft for a console release.It's a real shame because this game is really fun. Especially playing with friends. But its issues ultimately lead to frustration and that is killing the community. The biggest streamers seem like they're on the verge of giving up the game for good. If the community dies in early access I don't know whether or not it can ever be revived.At the rate it's going I'm not getting my hopes up that PUBG will ever leave early access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-19,0,0,274,False,Recommended,This has to be one of the best multiplayer games I have played in a while since cs go. The game is very stable and very well polished the gunplay is great. All the items and guns feel good and unique. The map is fantastic the land is diverse and does never feel boring and repetitive. The game is not very glitchy and seems bug free. The game in general is great and very satisfying. Its also worth noting that there i am economy built around this game like csgo and TF2. Which meand you can get items worth hundreds of dollars!!! The only difference is that instead of random item drops and opening cases or crates the game rewards you with coins. If you get enough coins you can open a crate fo free!!! Which means you can get an item worth hundreds of dollars for free and the price for these crates are reasonable and you should get them every several games you play. I defintely recommend this game if you like online multiplayer shooters. The game is satisfying as hell definitely worth the 30 bucks.UPDATE I just want to update that this review was posted before all the t that did with banning people and adding updates that are making the game glitchy and buggy. It can all be fixed easily and the game used to be great but they have to fix it and also add more content. My cousin got a global ban because his random squad teamed up against him with another team and tried to kill him so my cousin killed a few of them in return. Fix your this is unacceptable.

Reasons as to why you may not like it You don't have proper specs to run it you can't handle the aiming system you're impatient and think the game will be perfect while millions of other people are on at the same time you are. You get dropped onto a map with 100 other people and there are more textures in this map than imaginable. You will have troubles sometimes.

2017-10-22,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,First I would like to say that over all this is a good game it has a good idea behind it but i find that many of these ideas where either dropped or pushed off to allow this game to be let out (hence the early access). I am well aware that this doest represent the game in its final state but as in its current state i can not at all recomend this game.Heres why I have a glitch everytime i load in that forced the buildings not to render this makes it impossible to loot or do almost anything in the game for around 1 2 mins. Now this is the most vital time in the game as most players are killed in this time frame. I had assumed that maybe my computer couldnt run the game but after hearing the same problem from multiple friends with MUCH better computers then i have i can only guess that this is a problem within the game itself. Now onto the most glairing issue the conflicts. I can not even begin to explain how poorly this game delivers on combat as most is either so close only shotguns or full auto weapons will be very effective or your going to get sniped from so far away you cant seen them (personal favorite). I can't tell you how many times i would get great gear and weapons only to die instantly after walikng outside. Now i believe that this isnt something that ruins the game entirely bu it does make matches feel extremely futile as i would loot get good stuff see no one at all then as soon as i would leave the town or city be dropped by a someone i had zero chance of fighting. As i have around 16 hours of gameplay at time of writting i can admit that around half of that time was spent looting just to die almost instantly. Now i dont belive that dying in a battle royale is unfair its the whole point of the ing game. But when you allow player to die from reason at all it seems pointless to try in some matches when i feel like im the only one without a rifle with a scope. I would also like to mention that even though all of the above problems can be very detrimental to gameplay i've found that playing with friends or good teammates can negate some of the problems but obviously not all. Overall i find PUBG to be a fun game with around half of my matches being fun and enjoyable even if i die (which is all part of the game) meaning the game has potential but needs a lot of work to get it there. I recomend buying this game much later when the content is better and more reliable across all matches.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-29,0,0,157,False,Recommended,PUBG is a great game in my opinion it is very fun and a great game to play with your friends. I am however dissapointed in the fact that i can barely get the old map and every game i play is the new map (most of the time) which can make the game very repetitive and the new map is already starting to feel dry. Even with this though i always come back to this game as moments can be very intense and exciting (or rage enducing). This game has flaws like the cheaters that flood games but I am very lucky as this rarely happens to me and Bluehole has done a DECENT job with handling these hackers. Also the game has bugs like getting stuck in a tree or a rock but this has only happened to me a very few times considering that i have 100+ hours and it is unlikely to happen but when it does it is extremely frustrating. IFor the casual player this will be a great game to mess around in and for the competitive player this is the game for you and it is so satisfying to win the game and when you win the grind will be worth it. The game also is demanding so dont expect to play this on your nvidia 210 gpu but in all seriousness i have a high end gaming pc and i dont experience any issues but i know that this game isnt the best performing pc game but hey its still better than console. And despite the flaws of this game i really recommend it because it is fun to come back to even after immense frustration. This was totally worth the $30,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-31,0,0,77,True,Recommended,Great fun with friends. Some issues with the game crashing every now and again when loading into the pre game lobby but the game is still in Early Access so some issues are to be expected. This is simply a game of survival. Find the best location to exit the plane with the least amount of players around you while also looking to land in places containing a plethora of weaponry and armor. It's both a PvP and PvE game. The PvE is very limiting in that there is a border which reduces in size over time (with warning) and also certain 'red areas' of the map which explode every once in a while. Had a ton of fun playing the game so far hiding in cars in the open with players somehow failing to notice us and allowing us to survive until the last 2 teams alive in duo. Tons of fun. Some of the guns don't quite work to the best of their ability for example I shot somebody 2 times in the head with a shotgun from point blank range and they did not get downed which is slightly annoying but hopefully these issues will be rectified with future updates.Definitely recommend the game if you're looking to have fun with a good group of friends. I will say there isn't really an end goal to the game as all you do is play to win each round and rack up a ton of BP (in game currency) to purchase rewards which include clothing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-03,0,0,862,False,Recommended,Mmhm where to start. When I first bought this game I wasn't really passionate into it and didn't give much care. The only reason I bought PUBG was because of how much attention it got but I was mainly playing CSGO so I didn't bother playing much. However when I started getting better at the game I thought Holy Sh*t this is pretty good. I gave PUBG more attention until my friends eventually bought the game. This is where the fun started. I was fully into PUBG I swapped over from CSGO to PUBG but as everything the more experience you have with something the more flaws you find. I have eventually gained enough hours to confidently write a review. And so PROS Great attention to detail (Scopes attachments bullet drop map scaling zeroing with weapon scopes etc.)Easy to learn controlsAlways updated devs (Always working on bringing out new content and fixing bugs.)Very competitive (Don't expect PUBG to die anytime soon)Not too high level gapHackers are always dealt with (Once you see a hacker and report him he is gone for good.)Super satifying feeling when winning a gameInternet is not as a big factor (Where you could play in EU or Asia whilst in OCE and still have a good fighting chance.)The game is only at the early stages of its full release (PUBG as of now will only get better.)Friends completely help and change the PUBG game (PUBG is 120% better and more fun with friends.)You can make a few bucks from PUBG! (The more you play the more points you get. With these points you could buy crates and open them or you could sell them for steam bucks. As of now I have made 50 bucks just playing off PUBG.)CONS Game breaking bugs everywhere (Vehicles exploding randomly 2 bugs found in school where you could peak through the walls and even shoot enemies getting stuck randomly looting glitches etc.)Devs prioritise the wrong updates (Where they release new content without fixing the fundamentals of the game.)Beast PC to run at constant high FPS (I have an i5 8gb RAM GTX 1060.However I have the game set to VERY LOW as if I go higher such as high I achieve a good 80 fps but always stutters down to 20 fps every few seconds which essentially makes the game unplayable. Probably due to RAM.)Sh*tty servers (I really mean it. I have had the dumb main menu tell me how the servers are too busy and that I had to reconnect. A few times it took me almost 8 minutes just to get into a dumb game.)No map picker (PUBG now has 2 maps however I feel like the latest map is not my style and compared to the first one I dislike it. The devs however did not implement a map picker into the game and you are stuck in the inevitable void of wishing you get your preferred map.)Conclusion There are more PROS and CONS of which I have probably not listed but these are the ones which are most significant in the back of my head. I could imagine PUBG as a really cool looking friend but the more you know her the more b*tch slaps she increasingly gives you. It has so much potential and I still am positive about PUBG but I have my faith in BlueHole and hopefully it will only get better from here on.P.S. I absolutely suck and hate Fortnite but it's because I still haven't had much experience with it and I definitely recommend PUBG over Fortnite IMO.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-02,0,0,194,False,Recommended,A few points addressing issues other reviews have reported Never had optimisation issues Bugs are common yet only ever minor always resolvable with a reboot or the main menu reload button. Oceanic servers have great ping and are unfortunatly flooded with foreign players usually from Asia however I have never experienced a capacity issue and have always been able to get into a server.Been a long time fan and after playing both major competitors I can say I prefer this over Fortnite by a longshot. Unlike Fortnite PuBG is a lot more mature and is followed by a community of serious and competitive players. In PuBG you wont find any party buses or emoji dance offs Just sheer gritty challenge.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you're charging that much for something you're stating that the content is at least worth that much regardless of the potential future state of the game or what your intentions are to improve it. If you expect people to pay this much NOW then it SHOULD be worth it REGARDLESS of its development state.2) Being early access is not a 'get out of jail free' card for having bad anything in your game. If anything you want these things highlighted so that THEY CAN BE FIXED. NOT HIGHLIGHTED NOT IGNORED BECAUSE ""IT'S EARLY ACCESS "" IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG RESOLVE IT. You are CHARGING PEOPLE MONEY FOR THIS.""X has this issue too!""/""Hey X has this worse.""Does not justify this game having it especially if it's critical to the core gameplay.Performance If you have the power to whack it up to the good settings good for you. You'll have no issue here. If you don't then you'll have to suffer a poorly optimised game for now. Have fun with those fps drops and bad latency. Or if you want just let this burn a hole into your library.And now what matters.Gameplay This game relies heavily on RNG. What loot you get and where the circles start. It's not a completely cardinal sin but it sort of reduces your skill as a factor in how you'll perform.The circles move way too fast and hit way too hard the progression from stage to stage is so fast it's no wonder multiple games are being played at one time people are forced to have to either have no gear at all because they have to evade ""the magical blue field of doooom!"" which will absolutely destroy you if you're not in the area it says by the time it starts getting to you then it also provides an unfair play to people who are just waiting for you to turn up and pick you off as you come to the area to try and escape. It's entirely down to luck if you get good enough loot to survive and the right weapons that you can use to fight. But if you're already in the circle good for you! You'll get to contend with the next major issue which is Hitreg. The hit registration is absolutely atrocious in this game. I've emptied entire clips into people and hit nothing but then they hit me back and I die. I've dealt absolutely no damage with shots that should have hit. Good game. It IS possible to kill people just not when you need to. But even if you luck out enough to actually be able to hit someone that STILL isn't enough because...WHERE ARE THEY?! Sometimes you're just in a good position with good stuff scanning the landscape. And then a shot hits you. Unfortunately the sound you made while being hurt masked the direction the shot came from that is if you could even tell if that shot were to miss. So having no idea where the shot came from you attempt to get into a good cover against a person that you have no idea where they are. Except you're dead now. You've just been killed by apparently no one. Good stuff. And yet when it's your turn to be the predator when it's your turn to look for the people to catch off guard and have them wondering where the you were you can't find anyone. No one's visible. At all. You look all around the area before it starts to close in again. Where are they indeed. Then you keep looking and you fall victim to the invisible sniper.I guarantee you that you will spend a lot of your time dying to just any random person completely out of nowhere. And you don't even get the chance to do the same.Other Wanna drive? Have fun . Your car is extremely loud and offers no protection to you if someone decides to shoot at you. And even worse if you absolutely have to get out to avoid and/or fight someone you MUST stop your car dead. If it's even moving a millimetre an hour you're gone. Bye pal. Now. Just one of these would be okay. Not all three. This is ridiculous. The distance you could cover? What distance. You're overturned because your vehicle weighs nothing and will happily overturn at the slightest thing. Even if you drive carefully the fuel you start driving with is quite little which you can top up with a can but is counter intuitive when you consider the completely negative utility that is driving a vehicle....So why am I recommending this?Really all I'm doing with that is promoting discussion.

There is literally nothing of value to be gained from listening to the public chat.Now that that's settled let's tackle the gameplay. Is it fun? YES. It's like Battle Royale meets Hunger Games. You and up to 98 others get dropped onto an island with nothing and have to fight to find weapons and gear to survive. But can the gameplay be improved? Absolutely. There are definitely lag issues and for a $30 game one would expect more from the servers. That said I think the whole ""the Chinese are ruining everything"" outcry is a bunch of whiny bull. Look at my hours played. I'm on 29 hours as of this review and I'm a top 2.3% player on Third Person Solo. You can find ways to do well like... say NOT running around shooting everything that moves? You get much better ranking for survival than you do for killing others so it pays to remain unnoticed.Anyway enough of that. Can the graphics be improved? Absolutely. Does it suck to get killed before you even know which direction you're being fired upon from? Absolutely. Are the physics a bit wonky? Yes.

2017-10-10,0,0,89,True,Not Recommended,This was a tough review to write as the game is incredibly addicting but has so many aspects of the game that just feel off or unpolished. Even though this is a game labelled as Early Access and is doing great in sales there are many things that the team should be prioritizing. So far the early access cycle for me has been akin to that of ARK's it's been very fun fun enough to overlook the current negatives. However the more I play it like with ARK I begin to tire of the countless issues the game has and that the dev team seems to avoid dealing with. The large problems with the game are the way the servers are handling traffic and client side problems. With these two problems there is a lot of lag and problems as hit detection is purely client side which can cause a lot of problems with things such as Desync. Another problem with the game is what seems like PR defensiveness about their game. This is shown from having issues with Fortnite having a Battle Royale game mode and the fact that they advertise in their game to Chinese players because they don't want to have servers in China so they advertise for a proxy service. If you are able to get past all the rather serious issues (most of which are not listed) and not get into a game with a Hacker or Streamer (Stream sniping is extremely over reported for) then by all means buy the game but in its current state I cannot personally say I think it's worth the 36.99 CAD the game costs with the state of optimization and connection quality,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

With a variety of scenarios and locations to do battle with your team mates or face off against the masses alone PUBG has gone the extra mile in designing a mind blowing location for the battle to take place an endless series of options to choose from and the honor of being the best. This Survival game tests your skills in PVP strategy and gives you the sense of adventure you are always looking for. Starting out in a plane on the way to the island you can make the choice of where you want to leave the plane. Parachute down to make your way towards the designated zone to do battle. This may all seem easy enough but with a deadly force growing closer and closer you are forced to face your opponents in a volatile environment where anything can happen. Search through buildings and scavenge for resources and means to defend yourself. Modify weapons. Take advantage of vehicles to ensure you get to the safe zone first. Party up with a friend or create a team of four players to ensure a solid victory. Customize your character with cosmetics attained by earning points for every game you play.Check out the trailer for yourself! https //www.youtube.com/watch?v ODWCbu_cuqkAvailable for purchase on the Steam Store http //store.steampowered.com/app/578080/,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They will have terrible reaction time and bad ping. They will still win. Why? Because they already turned the corner and shot you on their end. 300ms ping guy walks around the corner sees you and shoots.150ms to tell the server he walked around the corner plus your ping for the server to tell your computer to display them.The death cam will show you staring blankly off into space as if you never saw them turn the corner. People with high enough ping can peek kill you and pop back behind cover before you even see them.The region locking everyone is requesting is a bandaid solution mind you. The netcode is the root issue. I wouldn't recommend supporting this developer until they do something about it. It is so atrociously bad it makes the old CoD4/MW2 engine netcode look like a masterpiece. It's quite dissapointing they've made no attempt to fix this core issue with the insane amount of money this game has made.

2017-08-28,0,0,138,True,Recommended,A simple design a lot of fun. HOWEVER the developer opted for the short term cash grab by implementing cosmetic loot crates before fixing game breaking issues. Vehicle physics are graphical issues abound and accusations of stream sniping are met with instant bans no matter the situation.Worth the money if you're playing casually ($30 is a great price point) but it's hard to justify sinking too much time into this game with all the bugs and questionable design choices.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-03,0,0,294,True,Not Recommended,TL DR Game was great concept but rough around the edges. Developer was slow to fix problems made money got complacent and the game is now infested with Chinese hackers.8/10 at launch 3/10 in current state. I bought it 3 4 months after launch. It was well worth the $30 dollars I spent for the amount of enjoyment I got out of it. If I had purchased the game 2 months ago I could not say the same. The game is early access and so there's a lot of major issues including optimization and glitches which can be discarded as typical early access phenomena. That said major issues with the game's engine have been unresolved since launch obvious client side exploits have existed without any acknowledgement from the developers and the game world is laughably strung together. This game is not competitive. The sheer fact that ANY tournament was held is an insult to the consumer. The game itself does not lend itself to any sort of esport. One of the biggest elements in PUBG is luck. The drops you find the circle's positioning on you vehicle spawns and more are all almost entirely out of the hands of the player. WHICH IS FINE. But the only reason it's fine is because PUBG is a GAME. It is not an esport and should NEVER be viewed as one. Furthermore the state of the game is absolutely pathetic for any sort of competitive environment. Grass doesn't render in after a short while which means you can be camoflaged on your screen and completely in the open on another player's. Objects render in differently depending on distance so that tree you're hiding behind could be slightly to the left on someone else's screen. Water is an impenetratable shield against bullets (watch the ending circles of the Gamescom Invitational to see why this is an issue.) The vehicle physics are an actual meme. Literially they are the running joke of PUBG. Now for the client side issues. From the beginning of the game it was obvious that too much of PUBG was in the hands of the client and not the server. If your teammate had poor ping he would run faster than you EVEN WHEN HE SHOULD BE SLOWER. Now to be fair this is an issue that can and should be overlooked in the context of an early access game. However these issues were completely overlooked in the development schedule. Instead of addressing the issue that would no doubt lead to major hacking problems the developers ignored it issued slap on the wrist punishments to a handful of .ini tweakers and proceeded to focus development elsewhere. When we needed engine work regarding anti cheat we got a grenade rework that still doesn't work properly. This led to the massive hacker infestation currently plaguing the game. Needless to say the ease at which the game can be hacked is hilariously sad. Speedhackers and aimbots run amok in at least half the games played. Worse yet hackers can shoot through terrain from miles off. You can be killed inside a house by a person sitting in a field 3 miles out from you. One of the saddest points in this game however has to be watching the developer grow complacent. The amount of small QoL updates and new guns/weapons has dropped from bi weekly to bi monthly. More time has been spent by the lead dev tweeting at streamers than discussing development progress on the game. It's very obvious at this point that PUBG has made it's money and it's done. It'll continue to update of course but it is not eager to make itself into a better game anymore. The game that was seemingly immune to the early access curse has fallen to it. I could go on about the state of the game but all you need to know is don't buy. Wait. Maybe when the developers get organized and commit themselves to making their game legitimately great will it be worth the buy. Right now the game is so overun by hackers that it's lost the only element that made it playable fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-27,1,2,282,True,Recommended,PlayersUnGrownBattleFields.. I mean PlayersUnknownBattleGrounds is a game focused on an aerna style gameplay. You start in a lobby either Solo Que's or teams up to 4 (duos and 3 4 in seperate games). First you are greeted with tons of lag fire and screaming normies. Dont worry by the time you hit the ground about 5 will have disconnected (YAY less threats!) You jump into a C 130 with the other 99 players and fly over the map in a straight line that changes every game. You will look at the map and find a place to land (word to the wise dont land at school... you WILL die there ) once you land if you have a pc you may have to wait for buildings to render (Those Clay lookin a** buildings) if not you enter the house and start looting. Finding guns ammo gear meds and hopefully a damn scope.If you have survived long enough Congrates! (ur not ) At this point you want to focus in on the wall and find out where it is heading and beat it there while dodging bullets and a car or two for those scrubs that accualy use the cars considered to be ear for those around. the circle will close in at sections of time to keep the game play going. OH! Almost forgot those OP loot drops that come around once in a while good luck surviving that Anyways the game goes on till your dead or you got winner winner chicken dinner! Overall the game is great concept art balance. But there needs to be big opimization fixes ( a I5 6420 GTX 1060 PC shouldnt be on all low.) But with some time this will be fixed9/10 is my rating for the things that need to be fixed minus(ing) a point on my scale.

2017-11-15,1,1,178,True,Recommended,So PUBG (Player Unknown's Battlegrounds) is one of the most hyped games in the WORLD even in beta it can be better than many games. As every single thing there are positive and negative aspects in PUBG TOP 3 POSITIVE ASPECTS Variety. Most of the games are repetitive however PUBG is not one of them. In every game there are lots of possibilities and situations which makes PUBG a dynamic game influencing players to adapt themselves in each situation. Shooting and mechanical system. PUBG's Shooting system is the main atraction of the game so it had to be good and IT IS AWESOME! So satisfying and clean all hitboxes are basically perfect. PUBG's game mechanic is as awesome as the shooting system for those who don't know the game mechanic is what makes it different and authentic. I have played many FPS and Battle Royale games but no one has such a good system. In PUBG there are pans that can defend you from bullets there are scopes (2x 4x 8x red dot holographic ...) and there are so many tactic in each game which makes the game more difficult but also more dynamic. Graphic. One of the most important things in a game is the graphic. PUBG's graphic is amazing! The vegetation in general buildings texture and my prefered one the sea graphic makes us more excited to play it. Congrats to PUBG team the graphic is amazing! TOP 3 NEGATIVE ASPECTS Rendering problems. PUBG requires so much RAM for rendering the map. I have 12RAM and it still don't render perfectly most of the time. FPS.PUBG is not a game that everyone can play because it requires an awesome config but it's expensive too you guys could make some things softer like Vegetation in general make the texture a little bit more simple and things like that. (Create a graphic mode like that would be nice!) But the people who has an awesome config could keep playing in high graphics. Training. It's not a 100% negative point but a sugestion. You guys could create a training mode for those who can't shoot or adapt themselves to most of the game situations. (A game that if you die you instantly spawn again in a random place of the map or a place that you choose) RAM and RENDERING chart RAM Does it render well? 8 No. 12 It depends. 16+ Yes. Originally posted by stan /id/steamstansteam/ ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-15,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,I really wanted to get into this game but after spending 16 hours I was left with very conflicting opinions. Before I begin I want to assure everyone I am trying to avoid completely bashing down this game as I am aware it is still an early access game and I know the game is subject to change. At this time however I cannot recommend it at this stage in development until I see some much needed changes.To begin I'll weigh in on my opinions about the game and underlie particular pros and cons. What made this game enjoyable for me and what makes it very disappointing and even unplayable. I'll start with the cons as this is a negative review.CONS TERRIBLE PHYSICS (Vaulting is coming soon to compensate for the bad physics but jumping may still be awkward after the change) EVERYONE IS A BULLET SPONGE!!! (Players often absorb 6+ shots to the body before they are killed while headshots are an instant kill. Seems fair enough but there is a bigger issue that needs to be addressed due to the reward which I'll mention later) ACCURACY GOES OUT THE WINDOW WHILE STRAFING!! (While in 3rd person the character their weapon and the reticle all remain static while strafing but weapon spray becomes astronomically unrealistically god awful while moving rendering you a useless shot. Will also mention later) INSTANT DEATH AFTER EXITING VEHICLES even when it's only going 5 mph GAME IS NOT OPTIMIZED BLOCKY UNTEXTURED BUILDINGS AFTER LANDING (Doesn't happen to everyone but plagues a lot of players. Also they cannot be entered until they load which leaves you out in the open.) PROS FPS BATTLE ROYALE GAMEPLAY MAP LAYOUT IS BALANCED VERY EXHILIRATING GAMEPLAY (The action is there. It's very heart pounding exciting and sometimes terrifying) RNG (Can be frustrating at times but every now and then you stumble across some lvl 3 gear immediately upon landing. Also it's a rush to loot everything before all the other players)As far as the headshot mechanic goes for being as brutal and rewarding as it is gives a huge advantage over other players that aim for the torso. Weapon accuracy is nearly 100% while standing still and something like 25% while strafing (obviously not fact checked but feels close to it) so when I try to avoid enemy fire by walking sideways I cannot aim at all and miss most if not all of my shots and the other player usually wins the encounter. If I stand still to fire accurately I become a silly pencil stick baiting for an easy headshot. At the end of the day this game leans heavily towards rewarding headshots clearly way more than realistically aiming for the torso. This is my biggest gripe!To wrap it all up I have a long history of playing FPS games like Battlefield Call of Duty Black Ops and even Delta Force (very nostalgic game for me) and when I play PUBG and am forced to abandon old habits like moving while gunning and shooting a sponge and not dying the game becomes very discouraging to play. I really want to see some more improvements in the following areas listed above. In the mean time I'll sit on this one for a while and keep checking back to see if any of these changes make its way into the woodworks so I can recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-18,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game now beyond my refund period to try and understand why this game is popular. I thought it looked bad when it came out. However I bought it because I thought I must have been wrong considering how many people that play it. Nope my intuition was right.So I'm just gonna make a list of things that are just flat out bad (there are so many things that this review would be an essay if I went into any detail) Game objective and strategy Aiming bullet and hit mechanics (extremely important for a multiplayer FPS) Netcode interpolation and real time mechanics (extremely important for a multiplayer FPS) Character movement (extremely important for a multiplayer FPS) Progression Matchmaking User interface Art and graphics Performance Physics Community Anti cheatList of things that are good ???The fact that this game doesn't have any meta really says it all. The game design is just so bad that it's hard to find any interesting winning strategy. Basically it boils down to what random stituation you happened to be in once you encounter an enemy and 1 minute later one of you will be dead depending on that state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Which despite what people are saying about broken promises which are arbitrary as it is a test of the system a completly optional addition and it supports the gamel. Not to mention the fact that these claims of broken promises are irrelivant in what world does a private developer need to adhere to a promise that they mentioned in one off conversations.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game focusses on realism which is why it's more unstable than Fortnite which is a little kids game. Yes PUBG has bugs yes PUBG is more unstable but the game is being worked on and is a good game already!Stop with your excuses of getting killed by a cheater cause the chances of that happening are very slim to none some people are just very good at the game (Watch Shroud on Twitch). Also the better your computer the better you will be I play on a Laptop and that does definitely affect my performance! But even though I play on a laptop I have already been in the top 4% of the world and currently after the update in top 40% and rising quickly.Stop with your excuses play the game grind it and you will become good at it even if you only have a mid range laptop like I do.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,406,False,Not Recommended,This game is so much fun but as of right now it is filled with nothing but cheaters. Mostly they are Chinese cheaters but there is the occasionally non chinese cheater. If they cannot deal with the cheaters like they haven't for quite a while now they need to region lock the servers to at least temporarily band aid the situation. Of course that means Chinese players will be absolutely screwed but at least it will somewhat help for the time being. Something needs to be done out of the last 5 games I have played 4 of them had deaths due to cheaters hackers auto aimers whatever you want to call them. They are going to be the downfall of this game. It has never been as bad as it is right now. I want to enjoy this game but dying in the final 2 because of a cheater is getting tiring. Just dying at all because of these cheaters is tiring.Yes this game is popular but everyone can only take so much before this game dies.

I've been apart of games where nothing but spam fire hits the rock ahead of me exactly where my head is. Constantly there's cheaters and nothing has been done to combat it.

2017-10-26,0,0,777,True,Not Recommended,I thought a game that sold so well would have a very decent server. PUBG proved me really wrong.There is a certain time everyday (around 10 p.m +8)that my friends call it a 'girl server period'. We have to keep refreshing the UI in order to connect to the server.What disgusts me is that BlueHole is not trying to fix this at all but selling 'The only official accelerator of the game' instead.Besides the server problem this is a game for cheaters.Imagine you looting for 15 minutes and then getting a head shot with a AKM from 1KM away.Self aiming is not the function that destroys this game. It's the function that allows you to see through walls.This gives cheaters a huge advantage and you wouldn't even know they are using hacks.I understand there are cheaters in every other game but I don't think Bluehole is doing a good job banning cheaters.For those of you considering buying this game I would recommend you buying a hack as well so that every player can be equal.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One box that happens to cost a 2.5$ key made everyone just straight up jump on the trigger train cuz of a single broken promise It's saddening to see so many people bashing on the game so quickly without giving it a second thought. Does it affect actual gameplay? No. Does it Affect the actual experience you get with your friends and so on? No.So why do people jump on this trigger train as if a company breaking a few promises was a sin or some sh*t. Companies have done this before and sometimes for fair reasons too. All in all people are legit stuck in the past thinking that if one company fails others who does similar actions will go the exact same route. Cmon...People should stop being so sensitive and take action once it truly matters when actual foul play is at bay. Once they decide to legit do something VERY shady that's when I'll agree that it should be stopped. But until then Calm the f*ck down people. It's just a few cosmetics for crying out loud give the game a chance to grow to it's fullest before straight up bashing it to the ground.Anyway.

2017-08-12,0,0,481,True,Recommended,The game is great it appears very promising however DayZ looked like a great thing and it has ripped countless of people off for a game that is still in early access. No real development and they have taken millions of dollars from people who were expecting real time updates and bux fixes only to be screwed over for something that will never end up being finished. Hopefully this game does not end up like DayZ.There should be a clause in early access games that forbid them to factor in any additional money making activities until the game is out of early access and in its release cycle. Early access games should be forced to provide a release date within 12 18 months of being in early access.I am not a fan of paid crates or boxes or buying things unless its cosmetic additions only especially when the game is incomplete.When did society allow game developers to sell us games that in some cases never get finished or continue releasing DLC content which is really a cover for things that should have made the game at the release date? (Numerous developers are guilty of this).I would hope this game reaches a proper release without ripping those off who supported them in Early Access however I am not happy with the monetary system they are talking of bringing in. Finish the game then add anything you like on afterwards don't screw those who supported you.For now in its current state I will recommend it. Lets hope my opinion stays that way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes I suck. But I have fun and I rage when I play this game. Other games has me sighing but I actually rage while playing this game sometimes. And having a game that makes me rage is fun for me since it means it is challenging. And this is challenging. The element of random combustion is one that I include here. Or crashing with a vehicle.Are there issues and bugs?Yes. But I'd like to remind you that this studio is also named after the game they developed. By that I also realize that this might be the first game of its kind they have developed. This is a big open world game where one or a team of up to 4 stands on the hill as winners. Or chicken dinners. Also known as Battle Royale. At the same time they are relatively fast in isolating issues with their patches. Compared to EA at least. And many big studios. I'm running on a soon 3 years old laptop. I'm running on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 4720HQ CPU 2.60GHz (8 CPUs) 2.6GHz Memory 16384MB RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M with Display Memory 10168 MB Dedicated Memory 2019 MB Shared Memory 8148 MBAnd it's running on low on everything except textures and view distance that is on medium for a constant 30 60 fps. Yes it's bad but consider that its open world. After a recent update it started running a lot better than ever before.Playing this game solo is fun and quite challenging and it's you against 90+ others. Playing together with a friend using some kind of voice coms such as Discord is even more challenging. Coordinating where to look to shoot the same target at the same time as you try to listen to footsteps and movements outside is hard. But honestly it is way more worth it in terms of fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To sum this up this game is great if you have friends or if you dont have one you could make friends from randoms and or the great amount of discord servers dedicated for this game. For it's price its a far better experience compared to other 'active' early access titles.Would truly recommend this game to people who seek Thrilling and Suspense gameplay!

It's a prime example of poor business practices. The game has only come out of ""Early access"" as a gimmick so it would shine ahead of the other games yet it functions and plays like an incomplete game. I refuse to believe 1.0 is a ""finished product"". The game is slow the loot system is horrible and the servers are the worst in any battle royale game. It runs pretty well but has slight hiccups during gameplay and the beginning of games are rubber band fests. Personally I'd give this game more time. It's DEFINITELY better than a good chunk of its competition but it has an undeserved stigma attached to it just because ""everyone plays it"". We can't be blinded by mob mentality. Just because your friend group owns it doesn't make it perfect. Game is great! I'd recommend it if the game wasn't a buggy mess.

This is consistent for every week ive owned this game. I can only speak to my own personal experience but ive never played any game that has had weekly server matenence during peak game play hours. Seems pretty careless (esp. considering the US is a large fraction of the gamers playing). I get it we arent all in the us. Sure. but why not meet in the middle. Do the update in the morning instead of the evening. The gameplay is not incredibly consistent. The game itself glitches in odd ways. Sometimes you cant jump from the plane sometimes you cant hear anyones mic's sometimes you cant see your crosshair when you ADS. Sometimes your shots dont register. Sometimes you shoot a guy 4 times and hes fine. Sometimes you are driving and all a sudden you are dead because there was a ""wall"" there. For some reason you can ""hit"" people if they are standing next to the side of a car...? The actual game play itself review Spawn time is too long and doesnt reward any kind of fast paced game play style. The community of players is toxic. Most players camp for the entire game. The game play seems to reward this kind of behavior. With the addition of new items the game is starting to feel like it has too many things in it. As said in above paragraph the game is rather glitchy. They even tried introducing special events yet they dont do them consistently and some of them are just not fun at all. The loot crates are pretty dumb and people who buy the clothes in this game is insane for spending money on virtual cosmetics that get covered up by the neccesary game items.

Sometimes you do rage AF. But at the same time that's what makes this game so awesome. It's not a game where you win every round. It takes some skill to win. I'd say you should buy this. If you aren't a person who rages every minut then you'll like this game. Because of the fact that many people actualle put time into this i'd say you should buy it.

The game also like to lag a lot not FPS but servers and there's a lot of glitches when riding in cars. You will also find that you either land and die to someone who has better loot than you by pure chance OR you spend the whole game looting and running only to die to someone that is camping in a house or on a hill.

And there has been ACTUAL harassment from these foreigners but since i cant see their names or who is talking i cant do anything about it. Have had several gloating about being in a NA server just so they could get wins and things up for ""American B itches"" and wish they could kill us for real (not joking they actually said this).

2017-09-16,0,0,445,True,Not Recommended,Player unknown s Battlegrounds is one of the most disappointing first/third person shooter experiences I ve ever had. There are elements in the game that work really well like the map and its diversity The ability to play a battle royal game in groups and the way you gather loot. But there are so many holes in this game on every parameter that you sit back amazed that they held a tournament on Twitch when the game is so broken. One of the first things you notice is that the shooting and general weapon mechanics don t work. Unless you have at least a 8 times scope then you ain t hitting where you aim no matter the distance. Pistols the VSS the Saiga 12 shotgun and the SCAR L without a modded sight are completely useless. The SCAR L because the Iron sights don t work in any way and the Pistols and the VSS because they don t do any damage. The VSS is for some reason chambered in 9mm parabellum like the UMP and the UZI but does the same damage as the Beretta 92fs. A VSS is in reality chambered in 9x39 which is closer to a .50 BMG round but ingame it s beyond useless. The Colt 1911 does less damage then the 92FS which makes no sense and weapons firing the same caliber do different damage. The AK47 Kar98 and M24 fire the same caliber ingame bur fire totally different rounds in real life and they don t do the same damage ingame for some reason although firing the same caliber. THe weather in game is the worst I ve ever seen. If it s raining you can t hear a car drive right by you because the rain sounds like a Immortal concert and the fog makes it impossible to see more than 5 meters in front of you unless you have a good scope. After release of the beta there were a ton of cheaters and there s still the problem that if you turn down the graphics in game grass and bushes disappear in the distance so you can see people lying down in the grass 500 meters in front of you without aiming. How the loot is spread out across the map is . You can find lvl 3 gear in one house and multiple weapons of high caliber with attachments all over the plays in one house and other times entire towns have nothing other than pistols and lvl helmets! Players land at a spot and get lucky and that s what this game is all about . Luck. On top of all that the sound of gunshots and when you take damage is the worst I ve ever heard. You can t here where a guy is shooting from no matter how close he is to you. The sound of the shot bounces of every grass straw and tree and all you can do is run for cover and if you get hit you have a seizure and tinnitus because the sound of you getting hit is like to iron skillets smashing together next to your ear and a moan on full volume from your character. There is zero satisfaction in playing the game if you don t win because of all these stupid features. There is almost no skill involved in this game because you can t win with loot and you know there are players who have looted one house and they ve gotten all the goods they want and are camping in the middle of the zone waiting for you! Ohhh and I almost forgot the melee weapon the pan can block .300 winchester rounds .. A ing pan! And we re still waiting for the vaulting mechanic to be put in the game so that we can jump over 30 centimeter high fences!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But before you get this game here's a check list for you to complete before buying the game Is this game listed below 20 dollars(I got mine for 15 in April and have seen a few price drops since)?Are you DMG+ in CSGO?Do you have a 970/1060 or better Nvidia GPU?Do you have 16G ram?Do you have a 144Hz/165Hz monitor?Have you played H1Z1/ARMA3 before and wouldn't tilt if you encounter cheaters 5 games in a roll?Do you have steam friends with decent mic that will play Duo/Squad with you using Discord?If all the answer is yes then I have confidence that you will very much enjoy this epic game. There's a play style for everyone. Now whenever I hear gunshots I run towards them the best way to get loot/kill fast and win the game IMO.

2017-08-19,1,1,231,True,Recommended,Even though PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is still in Early Access it s already a groundbreaking online shooter. Each game starts the same way but its remarkable ability to feel like a fresh new adventure every round has kept me coming back for hours on end. It manages to approach the Battle Royale style death match made popular by games like DayZ with relative simplicity without sacrificing the essence of the hardcore survival sim creating a tight focused and no frills experience that places it leagues above the competition.Battlegrounds wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km island. Even this first act is a critical decision and must be part of your strategy jumping early lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition but may also place you farther from the center of the arena where the fighting must inevitably funnel towards. Jumping late might give you some distance from other players giving you some early breathing room before entering the fray. Jumping right into the center especially in large cities where most players drop will place you right in the middle of the action.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is actually doing it's job and tbh doing it well considering 90% of the player base is either in china or across the country from the pubg NA server itself. PUBG's server lag is different it's pretty bad but overall is a pretty good game and can be flukey at times and you will ""look"" like you just got shot around a corner when really it's just what the enemy see's not what you see. So please don't be cancer and just blame lag because it's ""mostly"" not the games fault and your just a bad player. Also don't say its bad when you only have 150 hrs because you have no where near enough hours to be able to judge a game. It's good has its flaws and will fix them when they can.

2017-10-11,0,0,100,True,Not Recommended,The game sucks. And I will tell you exactly why. The gameplay itself isn't bad. It's the engine that is garbage. I have a pretty decent PC (check profile for specifics) and this game is almost unplayable if you don't have a system with 16GB of RAM or over. If it doesn't all of the buildings will not load in for a decent amount of time. I'd say about 5 15 minutes. And that can be HUGE because need loot. And you can grab guns but it takes awhile to get them in your inventory. And if you want the game wait until it comes out of early access because by then the engine will hopefully be optimized by then. If not then these people are lazy and money s.

Dont be a victim of the hype train.Edit3 The game is not really good with its netcode so you actually have to deal with your ping and someonne else's you are shooting at it takes a few ms's to actually check that you have killed that guy despite shooting a guy with a shotgun 2 meters off you you have to pray the ping gods to make the kill to be yours besides of that you have to deal with winning and not receiving your reward for winning which is very fun to wait for it and never get it. This game is all win guys all win for them. In my opinion as a alpha this should be free to play till they get their together. Game is frustrating even if you win what can be more fun that ? )Update 2/aug/2017 CRATES!!Crates you can open with keys keys that you pay with real money hahahahahaha well this is bluehole i already did a review about bluehole and milking android/ios games so why should be here different we all just got baited.

2017-08-29,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Great! Finally I rebooted my windows...after some weeks. Game just frooze to death.The game should be called UNPLAYEABLE'S BATTLEGROUND. It has zero optimization. Despite the fact that it lags in ALL matches (no I don't have a bad internet connection) the textures takes time to load after landing I couldn't do anything sit and wait for eternity. From the 2.7h registered I could REALLY play about 30min (maximum). So yes this game has zero optimization (EVEN ON THE LOWEST GRAPHIC SETTINGS). The concept of the game is interesting but this developer is just an amauter in game developing. I hope a serious developer take the same idea and release something that can be called a game.Did you notice that it is early access? Obviously I did I just didn't expect that I'd need a XEON latest CPU or an Core I9 with 64gb to play this game.Ok thanks Steam I can ask for refund.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Bugs started happening more often and people were tired of getting 0 content (other then a few guns)When first person was added everyones was like ""Finally a solution to camping"" but it made camping worse which overall made the game worse. This added with the poor hitreg and poor server issues made the game start to die out. You can hit a guy twice in the head with the sniper and he wouldnt die you would see blood and you'd think you have a kill but he somehow 1 taps you with an m4. Dont get me wrong this game was amazing the bugs in it weren't even that bad but after 300 hours and alot of bugs which were added because of the new content just made it die for me personally.Once the new maps come out i guess this game might get a second chance but atm its just a money grabQUICK EDITPeople are complaining that the game is unoptimized but how can you optimize a game which isnt finished?

2017-11-21,0,0,759,True,Recommended,This is an awesome game and I really do recommend you buy it. There's many pros and cons to this game however.Pros It's a fun game but challenging and if you're that kind of gamer that loves challenges and PVP this game will defintely suit you. It's not pay to win usually a lot of games are and this game is totally fair (Mainly because it's a battle royal game). To be quite honest there are as many pros as you make it. The satisfactory of winning your first game whether it'd be a solo duo or a squad the feeling is amazing and it still stays intense so it will definitely keep you entertained for a while.Cons This is not bashing anyone this will only be constructive criticism. Many of you that are thinking about buying this game you probably heard of the devs I myself do not know all about this but from what I hear the devs sort of favortise the streamers and make outright bans. (Again I'm not bashing anyone because the game is still awesome). The game is really frusterating even the best of players cannot win every single time so if you're a player that usually gets frusterated easily then it's time to tough it out. Optimization it's an early access game so of course they're going to work on more major stuff so I'd suggest for now that you might want to get some good specs and if you don't then you might want to wait a bit before you get those better specs (I have a GTX 1050 TI 4gb and I average around 50 60 frames but it doesn't feel as fluent).You definitely have to try this game out and when you do believe me you will not doubt it anymore!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

UE4 is great but the whole graphics and texture feels like playing a 10 year old game. Not to mention that it's still power hungry since it has not been optimized yet.I am still recommending it to everybody as the game is still in it's early stages and there is room/time for improvements.

2017-08-05,0,0,102,True,Not Recommended,I would have actually recommended this game to everyone I come across that is until recently. With all this popularity and funding behind the game you'd think that there would be improvement as far as optimization of the servers and make it more friendly for people with low budget PC's. But just like any other company they got the money first and have left everything on the back burner. They sure did hurry up and add Microtransactions to the game! Sure does make the game so much better that I can pay $2.50 for a pair of track pants. Makes you really feel apart of the game. Hey BLUEHOLE I'd rather spend the $2.50 for you to fix the damn servers!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-05,0,0,53,True,Not Recommended,"There are plenty of stuff wrong with this game such as Connection issuesRng loot will make you loseRng circle will make you lose 9/10 timesSound effectsRarity of vehicles (Seriously the major cities should have more then one or two vehicles.)A game which rewards you for playing on lower graphics setting (Setting foilage to low so tactical players cant take cover in bushes or tall grass)Jumping over anything takes one or two tries most of the time No campain. Regardless of the genre a game without a campaign or story of any kind is like a half a game. This problem is made all the more worse when you take into account the second issue. The the biggest sin of all for a survival shooter the shooting mechanics are terrible and not fun. Especially for beginners. Because of how wonky and unfriendly the shooting is in this game without a campaign or way to practice the only way to get better is the 3 or 4 seconds one will encounter in combat. For veterans who are already use to the system they dont care but starting out in this game is fustrating for many and many do quit because of this. Enough about the game's faults though. Here is the real reason you shouldn't buy this game. Back in the day a game in BETA was free. It was a small window where you could play a small portion of the game for FREE for a LIMITED TIME. Now however people have been suckered into buying games because steam labels them as Early Access. Call it whatever you want but at the end of the day you are paying for a game that is not complete and may never be finished. Complain about the bugs in the game and the devs just grin and say ""What do you expect it's still early access."" They of course say this while they are fanning themselves with your money. When they finally can be bothered to work on the game they patched in micro transactions so they could make even more money. Its no big surprise that companies only care about money but it would be nice for a change for a company to be honest and make a fully polished bug tested game before selling it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-05,0,0,128,True,Not Recommended,BUYER BEWAREUntil more is done to optimize this game the listed minimum specs cannot be trusted and in a game like this that is very important.Running with specs beyond the listed minimum but running things at the lowest possible settings I still encounter terrible dips in framerate and slow rendering which is damning to gameplay. Trying to enter a house is difficult when it refuses to load looking like a solid brick of splotched playdough with no doors.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-08,0,0,98,True,Not Recommended,"So let's be honest and straight forward Don't buy this game until the situation has improved.The core gameplay idea is nothing too new considering it's been taken from other games in the first place and lots of similar games are popping up all over the videogame landscape at the moment but that's how the business is at the moment nothing new nothing we consider bad anymore anyway. While PUBG brings some interrestings concepts together and was fun to play for as long as it lasted the negative arguments against the game outrunned the positive ones rather quickly. It didn't matter if we ended the round top 10 or top 50 frustration was all that was left after each and every game.Why? For several reasons. I've shortened the list to the most severe aspects for a good start Don't expect to be good at this game if you don't have a very good aim. You either have to step up to the skills of others very quickly or you will end up as canon fooder in literally every round. For at least that's one aspect I like Aiming helps you step up to the better loot of your enemies and with a good shot even an inferior situation can potentially be turned into a win. The map is brutally underdeveloped. While it at least doesn't feel too generated it has been put together with little to no effort feels absolutely loveless in design and when you come across a stone wall that floats more than 30 centimeters above ground you can even see the lack of effort that has been put into the map. But luckily the devs are up to the challenge and will bring up even more unpolished and unfinished maps. Sad to mention that these issues could be fixed in a week or maximum two weeks of map design if someone really wanted to. Just aim for the head. Going for a solid body shot has literally no value in this game. If you waste 29 of 30 bullets for one headshot you will win nontheless. Worried about missing your shots cause your enemy hits you in your belly while you aim for his head? No worries your character doesn't even flinch when being hit in the neck or arm your weapon stays steady in every situation for as long as you don't flinch yourself at least. Anyways a lucky headshot will always do more damage than 5 solid shots in the body always. And that's what makes this game so ridiculous. Not even does a single headshot (or two not that it matters as bullets seem to seek out for heads anyway) takes you out directly even if the enemy doesn't hit you in your head directly you have no chance of knowing where he is in more than half of the situations. Why you ask? Cause your character is painless! Remember? He doesn't flinch. Cause he doesn't know where the bullet hit him. And why? Cause the community thinks that 'hit markers' that point in the direction where your body hurts is 'casual' and makes the game 'too unrealistic'. While we're talking about realism. This game blantly tries to claim to be a realisitc battle simulator and while we better not talk about the concept of a giant energy wall that kills everything that is behint it slowly and painfully and that moves over the map in semi random circles (we'll get to that later) there are a lot of things that couldn't spit on the word ""realism"" more than a 'hit indicator' would do. Naming some of them No Stamina &gt Infinite Sprinting Infinite Jumping. No exhaustion &gt Aim steady even while jumping. No flinching &gt Cause no one cares about being shot anyway. 'Full' fuel tanks last for about 2 minutes &gt Feels like we're powering electric cars with fuel and wonder why they don't drive. Godzilla Footsteps &gt Cause everyone can hear you walking through five stone walls. Infinite revives in squad mode &gt cause headshots don't hurt that much if your buddy is around right? And many more features like that. The wall basically spoken this is a mechanism that aims to draw the players together. The circle randomly spawns when all players have landed and reduces its radius at intervals. Everyone that stays outside the circle will receive continous damage that increases each time the circle has reached its new position. Where does the circle spawn? That's absolutely random. Will there be a player perfectly in the circle waiting for you? You bet there wil be. While that is at least a situation you can be sure of you can't be of the actual circle position. At least 50% of the time you will find yourself at the most distant point possible of the circle and you will be constantly running for 10 minutes straight in order not to die to the stupid wall that is most of the time faster than you can run anyway. So if you have no vehicle (which spawn so rarely that you can consider yourself lucky if you find one but ironically won't stop spawning once you have one) you're as good as dead anyway unless you have a ton of medkits with you. Loot Is Deal with it. Loot boxes Lets not talk about the concept of an early access title with real world loot boxes trying to get a glimpse on what market counter strike owns there and what money values flow around there. It's just a cheap attept to make even more money than they already do by selling copies of the game. Blantly spoken the 'cost for their gamescom tournament' is just a cheap excuse. Cheaters Tons of. Starting with anti recoil macros for logitech mices which are capable of nullifying your recoil for every assault rifle and submachine gun (and are ironically not banned from usage) over people simply deleting textures to see transparency instead of black textures (and therefore can just strip the game of grass and brushes and the like) and stuff like player outlining names of drops and players showing all over the map etc. etc. Horrible. Oh... and did I mention that you have to turn 'foilage' down to not think you're hiding in knee tall grass while everyone else can clearly see you resting on a plain dirt texture? The client bugs out 9/10 times preventing you from queueing up opening loot boxes changing your loadout seeing your stats and at least one crash in 2 play hours.While it would be generally okay that there's still a lot left to work on considering this game claims to still be early access and tons of client bugs substantiate that claim very strongly the devs are just pumping in content and ignore the most urgent and most annoying bugs and circumstances that would need treatment as soon as possible. But lets be honest with ourselfes as long as developers keep pumping 'new content for free' we don't even ask about such fixes anyway right? Cause they're doing 'so much for us already'. So we kinda create that mischief ourselfes. I'd say give this game a year or two until it is polished up and ready to hit the shelves but until then the hype will be over anyway and people will have moved on to a different game. So buy it if you're willing to jump the hype train and throw money out of the window but don't expect it to be worth it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are exceptions in some superior players who somehow are able not to get shot in the back. I heard somewhere that the game should be more about strategy rather than sheer fps skill. Well for me it feels like a bullcrap. Game is designed the way that payers holding pozition are much more in advantage then the pushers. I can recomand the game for snipers and ppl who enjoy somewhat realistic gunplay however if you like to be in midle of the action and you are not god like Shroud then this is not the game for you.

Other than the fact that the develeopers are all money hungry hounds preying on the consumer by holding professional competitions only updating the micro transaction issue and any complaints about compatibility or cheating went right over there heads until apparently recently and I highly dount the work they will do to make the game run better will be worth much.

2017-04-23,1,1,207,True,Recommended,i was on the edge whether to get this game or not as i didnt know if my rig would run it. (gtx 970 old 2nd or 3rd gen i7 3.4ghz 16 ram) as i struggled with arma 3. I decided to give it ago and it runs fine only thing turned right down is shadows evrything else is on high and i get 70 80 open areas with smaller buildings etc and it drops to anywhere between 40 60 in built up cities etc which im fine with aslong as i can see people moving and i can shoot them its good enough for me. If you can run it i would say go right ahead and spend the money its a great game weather you play it alone or with a group of friends even duos is great. As soon as you jump out the plane (your choice where) your heart rate jumps up and the adrenaline kicks in. If you land next someone find anything to kill the person with even if its a frying pan just get a weapon before them. Play it how you like go all guns blazing if you want but with out a silencer you are more than likely going to do die and get shot from across a field. Or stalk your enemy and take them by suprise work with your team and surround the enemy in a barn and they wont know whats hit them. In total i have been playing for 30 hours which is nothing really but its took me this long to finally win a solo ( heart rate was well over 100 at the time acording to my fitbit) and managed to win a group game aswell.

2017-12-23,0,0,361,False,Not Recommended,This game is by far possibly the best battle royale game out in the market. However I'll keep my opinion short. It lacks really core things. First of all close combat fights are a joke. You literally pray to the RNG god on who's bullet will be registered on the server side. Second the game officially got released with most of its major bugs that were know since day one like car collision and item grabbing. Finally maybe the most important thing is THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF TIME. I mean it for real not to bash on it. The amount of time you'll spend on finding a match waiting for the player ready time waiting for the plane to get to your possibly most wanted location drop of free fall land find a gun and get into the action. If you are short on time or want to experience fast shooting and killing atmosphere this game is not it. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME. You'll spend all that time I listed above just to possibly get killed because you weren't LUCKY enough to find a gun OR got your gears BUT the game favors random people and you'll spend your time AUTO RUNNING to catch up to the safe zone only to waste your meds on rehealing and getting duck hunted by someone who had the favor of safe zone.Buy and only play this game if you are really in desperate need of wasting your time by playing a game.

The quality of play is quite bad.I know this is an early access game but focus is on making money rather than a quality game why's that?Answer High pricetag smaller playerbaseSmaller playerbase less demographics for improvementLess demographics pointless early access.A pointless early access which is nothing more than a safetynet while you cashgrab and ditch the game.We will see but right now if you want a few rounds of a Battle Royal game download Last Man Standing as its free and can easily satisfy your want for now.TL DRPrice is too highBad quality gameplayBad performance tweaksNo community focusNo in game punishement / penalty systemDeveloper focus is money over production.This is my accurate opinion.The game can be fun they just don't care or at least don't show they care.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have read reviews of players having 'fps lagg' while they have better than me in their pc (Probably lying kids to look cool) But I'm running this game on ultra except for two options these are on high. And it's pretty smooth no sign of 'fps lagg'. And yes.. lately the servers are lagging in the beginning of a match.

2017-08-19,0,0,223,True,Recommended,at 107.6hrs i can say this game has proven itself to be an awesome addition to my gaming collection. Other games that have played similarly turned me off the Battle Royal style game. When i saw this take off i thought i would give the game type another chance and i am not disappointed.the gameplay is awesome i love the new First Person mode they put in. I enjoy that FPP and 3rdPP are seperate. The looting system is decent and the customization is good too. The spawning of vehicles and weapons is random enough that you can get screwed pretty hard but you dont get screwed too often keeping the game fun. Ihope to see new maps soon as people have figured out where the best spawning locations are now. This game almost plays like a full release and we are still in early access. totally worth trying this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have experienced minimal bugs that isn't the issue but the current lack of variety and it being in early access renders it not worth even 20 maybe 15. When it comes out of early access and is a fully realised game then it may be worth nearer the price it currently is. I will still recommend it despite the disagreement over price however as I feel the game is a neccessary asset to any modern steam library especially if your friends are playing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-14,0,0,434,True,Recommended,I LOVE WIENERS!!!!! &gt (Serious post please read on)Ok now listen up this is a serious post and i wan't people to see it so upvote it or however it works if you wan't my wiener because i feel like this is my first review on a game ever anyway.Im getting so sick of all these negative reviews on this game is it because there negative and that im a fanboy? no.It's because everytime i check the reviews on this game theres more and more negative ones and to make it worse there all just complaining about being banned for trolling streamers.Before i get to the stream bans let me give you my full review on this game.Do i recommend this game? Of course it's alot of fun you can tell because i have over 100 hours and i play it atleast once a day. i see people say this alot latley but no im not a dev kiss i personally enjoy this game 100%.I have never wrote a review before so im just going to do this cons and pros thing. PROS *Good Graphics*Fun looting system (to me anyway)*Gun fight's feel nice and feel smooth (once again for me not sure for others)*Gun's feel realistic and bullet drop seems normal*Car physics are great to me*Easy and simple controls*MORE COMING SOON (maybe) CONS *Yes graphics are nice and all but the game isnt that well optimozed? I can't really say because i don't know how to optimize a game so i have no say in the matter.*There seem to be quite alot of bugs from what people say i personally never see these bugs but it is early access so there sure to be fixed*MORE COMING SOON (Tell me what i missed because i can't really thing of more right now)i also forgot to mention there were alot of negative reviews on this game about micro transactions.I feel like this reviews should not be getting upvoted it's so bloody stupid. There all personaly reviews just complaining about it when it effects the game 0%. When microtransactions came out i just completely ignored the update because i didn't care i don't understand what people are complaining about THERE COSMETICS.Now to end this post with the banned reviews.1. Theres never any proof they were banned and someone pointed out that this guy played the game this week after claiming he was banned.2. There is a 50/50 chance you could of been banned by the devs for trolling but come on... be honest.3. They all just happened to run into very popular streamers you say you werent trolling but how do we know you didn't do it twice i don't know how stream sniping works and if its easy but lets say you wernt stream sniping.And in the 1 out of 100 chance you got in a game with a streamer how did you know it was a streamer?and out of all the people you honk your horn at it's a popular streamers and last did you hold down the honk button around him untill you died? otherwise how did they know who you were and reported you. plus they wouldnt ban you after 1 time. My review on horns I also wan't to give you my review for horns alot of people say why even add horns when you knew people would troll with it and that there useless for me thats not true. USES *Hold down the honk outside of buildings people are in and while they have there attention on you trying to find you someone could sneak in and kill them*If you don't have a mic or do idc you could do two quick honks at your team letting them know you wan't to go )*Driving can be boring so it's fun yaknow*MORE COMING SOONAnyway end of review sorry for it being so long i like to type and writing this review was fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes you drop into a map and try and kill other people over and over and over again but it is NEVER the same any round. Some of the hilarity in the game really makes it shine. I personally only play in FPP as I feel 3rd person is for people who need the camera gimp and it also feels 100x more realistic.

2017-03-24,0,0,742,True,Recommended,"Well this is kinda stunning i think this is one of the best Battle Royale Currently out on market.you've got three pistols three shotguns five assault rifle's two light smg's two heavy smg's and three sniper rifle's. its not much to go on but you are actually able to customize them. like put a red dot or a holographic sight. Or why not a silincer on a sniper riflle. They wont even know what hit them!The combatmechanic are way more accurate compared to other Battle Royale's gamesfor instance a double barrel shotgun kills you in close range no matter if you've got the best armor or is amazing shot with assault rifle's. you will drop dead on the floor.you can adjust the bullet drop on the assault rifles I haven't had the fortune to have a sniper to try it out yet but i can say it about assault rifles. (to do that you need a customizable scope)its a bit hard to spot others unless they are moving around feels a bit like ""arma3"". The map is huge and there are alot of space to hide on.so you could either play full tactical or you just could set up ambushes.Another good thing you cant jump out of the moving vehicles and one tap people You have to slow down or almost stop before jumping out unless you want to die.like in other games don't mind me i am just going 110 on the road ow a person jump out and boom headshot. dosent work That way. its way more hardcore!you can choose your spawn location or where you want to drop so if you've got a friend with a slow pc You could give him extra seconds before jumping out of plane.on the negative part i have had some fps drop's and some server intability when the game was a bit laggy first 5 minutes but hey its still early acces and That stuff was expected.an improvement I would like to see set two different communication channels one for proximity chat and one radio for the group. Currently you talk in both which is not that good for a full tactical play. but i assume most players use third party communication while playing with friends so its not an issue!This game is worth every single penny I spent!

2017-12-03,3,1,563,True,Recommended,This game is full of hackers lots of game breaking glitches for example I have been killed in the top 10 many times simply because my gun wont shoot full ammo just a regular M416 and when I left click the majority of the time nothing happens my gun won't fire and I end up getting killed because of it. There is no reason to want to play the game when you simply CAN NOT shoot you're gun to defend/attack its game breaking. And again the amount of hackers/cheaters in the game is insane Also the massive problem of people living in Asia joining NA servers constantly and then they have an instant advantage because they are so laggy they are impossible to shoot at and actually land a shot before they spin around and kill you through a wall and its rare to join squad mode on an NA servers and actually have english speaking team mates huge language barrier. The game is a really good idea and it can be super fun to play with friends but its just not consistent with good performance and not running into game breaking glitches is impossible most of the time.

2017-12-18,0,0,1001,True,Not Recommended,Lots of people will tell you that this game is pure and absolute garbage and they are correct. This game is incredibly unoptomized and no matter what specs your rig has there is no possible way to get a good frame rate. Bullets don t register there is lots of desync 9/10 times you get killed by some slap happy kid with a pan because out of 30 hits that showed up for you not a single one actually hit them. The devs are more concerned with making money and turning this game into the next big esport than they are trying to fix the fact that you need to have a quantum computer to have the game not crash every time you die. THAT BEING SAID the game IS fun. It doesn t have to be a well made game to be fun but it certainly doesn t hurt. I m coming up on 400 hours in this game as of right now and I have enjoyed most of those hours playing with friends. If you want my opinion do not buy this game if you are going to complain about how bad it is. I realize that the game comes with bugs and that many people don t like it and if that is you then you need to realize that it s still in alpha and that s what you get when you buy into a game that is in alpha that is still no excuse for them marketing it as a full game. So basically what I m saying is if you re going to buy it be aware that there are bugs and they are working on a huge game to meet everyone s needs so just be patient with it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,444,True,Recommended,Fun and ok...yeah...just ok. The game is fun for a while. Going between solo and squad mode is fun and playing with friends is even more fun. But something is missing. It's a big island with a shrinking playing field. Sure the game is still under development but I can't help but feel it's missing something. In a way it reminds me of Call Of Duty except for the massive play area equipment items and lack of special attacks (drone helicopter etc). But hey... don't forget there's 100 players lurking around...A friend uses a $1/hour standard for rating the games he plays and I think it's a good idea. For this game I'm not quite there yet but I will be in no time.Pros Game is Under DevelopmentLarge playing fieldLoads of playersFun to play with friendsCons Game is Under DevelopmentView is kind of buggy when close to walls or switching to first person weapon viewSuggestion Buy the game if you have other friends who play this and play with them. It's always fun riding in a car together when trying to rush to play area. Tense moments are highly satisfying when you're there with your friends and you pull through a firefight.The game isn't horrible but it's also not super great. But valuewise it's on or close to the mark. Perhaps not the most polished game but enjoyable nonetheless.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-02,0,0,152,True,Recommended,This game is a great game and I will recommend buying it however before you buy it take into account that this game is a very demanding game and if you don't have at least 12gb of ram you won't be able to play this game without it crashing every 5 mins. Anything lower than 12gb don't even bother buying since this game literally demands everything you have to play it even at the lowest graphic settings.

2017-10-23,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,7/10. A Good concept for a game however it has some issues i have to adress. 1. Microtransactions Really? microtransactions in a EARLY ACCESS game? you should be using the money you got from so many people buying the game to fix bugs not to implement M I C R O T R A N S A C T I O N S ! 2. Optimization please optimize your ing game.i have a mid spec computer and i can run games like GTA V just fine. but PUBG? i usually get around 30fps to 10FPS with FPS drops at times. Bluehole please ing optimize this game i beg you. 3. ''Stream Sniping'' i've never attempted doing this nor have i gotten banned but from other complains bluehole seems to be banning innocent users because streamers think that everyone who kills them is a ''stream sniper''. bluehole you can listen to the streamers who play your game but try and listen to us the users too!and that's it really ignoring those things this game is well between average and good.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Me saying this may turn one off from playing the game.BUT HOLD ON. IT GETS BETTER.PUBG though a laggy buggy piece of trash manages to be one of the most fun games I've played in years. The RNG element and high intensity of the end game allows for extreme replayability even though you're essentially doing the same thing over and over. I love this game especially when I'm playing with my friends. Hopefully with some performance optimization this will become one of the best games available on steam rivaling giants like DOTA and CS GO.Cons Poorly Optimized Buggy on all computers even high end rigs Lag Spikes common even on fast networks Developers don't seem to listen to the community Low tick rate servers lead to poor hitbox scanningPros Intense amount of fun Infinite Replayability Good Combination of Luck and Skill 10/10 Frying Skillet deflects bullets NO META,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PUBG has been the only game I've played since I got it several months ago though. Constantly being updated and improved yet already a perfectly good game at it's 27 early access price this game is a must have for any first or third person shooter fans.

2017-09-04,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,Yes I am aware that this is early access. That being said as it stands this game is not worth what you spend for it and I cannot recommend it in good conscience to anyone.Played for an hour and a half and encountered game breaking bug after game breaking bug after game breaking bug falling through the world character models not rendering until after you're dead getting stuck in an endless reloading animation loop and never actually being able to reload vehicles randomly flying into the air and killing you when they land. Needs a metric ton of QOL changes to make it worth the pricetag too. I live in Canada and it keeps putting me in their Asia server (unplayable amounts of lag) the amount of RNG is comparable to Hearthstone (Redzone following you play area dicking you over going through building after building after building and finding nothing not even clothes for your entire play) and just the general amount of lag is stupid (aiming at a player right next to you takes 10 seconds if they start shooting having to open doors again and again because they open but don't open and then magically close).And then there's the hackers aimbotters godmoders I've even seen someone nocliping. In almost every game there's someone cheating. This game is not worth playing for this amount of frustration.Honestly if you want to enjoy this game stick to watching YouTubers or streamers play it. It's like skateboarding with bricks for wheels it might bring a funny image to mind but when you try it yourself it just sucks.2/10NOTE I will be comming back and checking on this game every once in a while because the devs are working on it and it has so much potential to be awesome.

This series can very easily be the future madden killer with the right funding. The developers are constantly updating based off player feedback and the series looks promising as a whole.

2017-10-26,0,0,438,False,Not Recommended,EDIT Still the same servers with client side animations leading to 2 second delays. Dying behind a wall only to watch the deathcam where you didn't even make it to cover at all. Can we get refunds after 400 hours played? You guys should offer that.This game has so many good things going for it. It also has just as much if not more bad things most of them are easily overlooked and the game thoroughly enjoyed regardless of its negatives. However there reaches a point where gunplay (especially early game) is just basically a horrible experience with terrible optimization delays rubberbanding and all around low server speeds. They've had plenty of time and money invested and optimization has been largely ignored since the first few patches. I love this game. The amazing concept gunplay realistic(ish) approach. Even ignoring all the bug causes players to turn into Nightcrawler and pass through walls like they aren't even there or even drive through them in a vehicle. Still this optimization and just outright horrible server are enough to make this game not even enjoyable to play.Therefore(tl/dr) Great game however the performance issues just can't be ignored this long and still enjoy playing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-10,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,The novelty of this game is definitely apparent but when you start winning consistently and get to 100+ hours its novelty is outweighed by the bad netcode very average visuals even running 4K60FPS and poor developing which is starting to show with the inclusion of mechanics like paid loot boxes. But the one thing that ruins it above all is the hackers and streamers. It is absolutely rife with hackers especially Chinese as well as streamers who live on this game and use soft aimbots to make them look like they have skill in their streams. It becomes apparent how much of a problem with hackers this game has when you look at the statistics for hackers banned per week or month which may look good but hackers being banned from one account will not stop them from simply making a new one and carrying on. When this game dies it will die very quickly people who overcome the learning curve for this game like myself have no real appeal to this game anymore which is poor considering after 110 hours i am already done with this game not a great deal of time in this generation of gaming.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-07,0,0,534,True,Recommended,Awesome game. It's only going to get better. The only problem with the reviews are the people complaining about Microtransactions. I understand that the Developers fell back on their promise and wanted the game to be released first. And promises broken are not exactly worthy of trusting them again. But let's be real here... Microtransactions don't effect anyone but the people that buy them. So It's not a big deal. However... the point that they are trying to get across is that Microtransactions introduced in early alpha stages just mean to the community that they just want more money and that they won't deliver a full release game because they can make a bunch of money off of microtransactions. Well... I understand that point. But at the same time this game is so popular people are demanding it to be made well. And I think the Developers want this game to be a masterpiece as well. I'm not going to get angry about this game just yet. So far they've made many improvements and it is a game that is worth your 30 dollars if you want a game to play with your friends and have fun. To be honest this game reminds me of the type of games I thought about when I was little. A large scale game vs many players in a battle over a large map to see who will win. What kind of strategies will you try to develop? It was well worth my money here.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-04,0,0,691,True,Not Recommended,Game runs anywhere between 2 60 fps on low depending on where you land on the map. New FPP mode is as unstable as you could possibly fathom. Constant rubber banding teleporting and stutter on item pickup makes it impossible to loot or even navigate on any game mode now.They've got a good formula for a game but holy sort this sort of thing out. 25 for this atm is a joke.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-04,0,0,35,True,Recommended,Starter for all you people giving this game an entire poor review on microtransactions The game is not making you buy them they are simply put in by the devs to test ad work out any bugs with them. It's not like you need them unless you wanna walk around waring pink trackpants or a school skirt that adds no benefit whatsoever to your gameplay. CS GO does it as well and look at THAT game. Anyways review timeI absolutely love this game so far can't get enough out of it in all honestly. Ever since the First Person Perpective only matches have been added it's even more fun! This game is very easy to play and understand other than how weapon mods work even then it won't take long. Pros Very quick to get into a game shouldn't take longer than 10 seconds Fair no microtransactions that boost your gameplay Decent community Very fun gunplay! Doesn't take a quadrillian years to find a gun! *cough* DayZ *cough* Has a very dedicated Dev team! *cough* DayZ *cough*Those are some basic Pros but now the ConsCons Very buggy..but that is to be expected from and Early Access Game Poorly optimizedThose are the MAJOR cons most likely to be fixed in future updatesThis game has such a good future ahead of itself it's being updated left and right (even yesterday it was updated).10/10 IGN,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,174,False,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a really fun game but shouldn't not be fully released because there is way to many bugs in the game for example client side lag which ruins so many games for people and there is a thing which three of my friends and I experienced which is when you get shot at it freezes for a split second and you get killed (it isn't that we have a bad pc because we don't the average gpu is a 970. One of our friends has a 1070 and it happens to him aswell). The devs should have not released pubg on xbox until pc was finished or atleast there wasn't any game breaking bugs. PUBG isn't a bad game it is just the devs need to put a little bit more work on the bugs and not add new things until the main bugs are fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-03,0,0,248,True,Recommended,Ok... so. From my experience PUBG has been a really fun experience. Had a lot of fun with voice chat and especially with my friends when we go around just fuc**ng around it's the funniest thing ever. But I do have some complaints.1. The optimization even on some higher end computers the game can still run pretty badly. But you do have to realise it is still early acces...2. The desync Desync doesn't happen that often but when it does it can really ruin your chances of killing the enemy or even winning the gameBut if there is a downside there must be an upside aswell right? Yes you're correct.1. You can choose to have fun and mess around or tryhard and win every game.2. The graphics are amazing.3. The gameplay is really good and polished even though I said there is desync. ( which is really rare )4. It's worth it for a $30 game.In conclusion I really like this game it has been an amazing experience and like I said especially with friends. You have a lot of options for both winning or just having fun so I would rate this game 8.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The developers need to seriously fix this or I can't seriously reccomend this game to anybody. The game is also extremely poorly optimized and runs like crap on just about any good gaming PC even turning down the graphics doesn't do much at all.It's fun sometimes but because of how the developers handle bans and the games very poor optimization I can't recomend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,193,True,Recommended,Early Access it s already a groundbreaking online shooter. Each game starts the same way but its remarkable ability to feel like a fresh new adventure every round has kept me coming back for hours on end. It manages to approach the Battle Royale style death match made popular by games like DayZ with relative simplicity without sacrificing the essence of the hardcore survival sim creating a tight focused and no frills experience that places it leagues above the competition.Battlegrounds wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km island. Even this first act is a critical decision and must be part of your strategy jumping early lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition but may also place you farther from the center of the arena where the fighting must inevitably funnel towards. Jumping late might give you some distance from other players giving you some early breathing room before entering the fray. Jumping right into the center especially in large cities where most players drop will place you right in the middle of the action. The tension mounts during the descent as you get a good look at the swarm of players in your vicinity but things really pick up the moment you hit the ground as everybody scrambles for weapons and gear and the killing begins right from the get go. Backpacks for holding more items a handful of protective gear like helmets and police vests healing items melee weapons and a good mix of firearms are in good supply. But It's not just skill in this all out shooter game sometimes you need to rely on your enviroment to save you and sometimes your friends may not even be your friends in the end. In this game you're always on your toes and your head on a swivel.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Because you can do that in this game! It would legitimately be the perfect game for people like me who enjoy not just mass destruction but being forced to use strategies and outsmart 99 other people IF it wasn't so FLIPPIN laggy. I think out of the 30+ games I've played so far all but 3 of them I have lagged on. It's mostly rubber banding which is infuriating. Now whenever I'm confronted with another player It doesn't lag as much as it does when I'm just looting a building. Which is sort of backwards but lol it's good for me! Of course you can change that number and make it 98 other people with Duos and 96 other people with Squads. And wait it gets better you can go Solo and make it auto place you with one to three other people so you have to work together with complete strangers which makes the game even more complicated and challenging. It's not exactly Bluehole's fault that other people are OP XD so that's not what I'll rant about. Instead I'd like to see the weapons such as sniper rifles and M16A4s and SCAR L's to be a little more common in the little random houses and warehouses scattered across the map. In my hours on this game I've only picked up two rifles and the second one was from a fresh carepackage. Otherwise this game is the best game I've got on my list and it's going to stay that way for a loooooong while. &lt 3 &lt 3,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I mean why don't I get anything when I win? Sure it's satisfying when I won my first solo match I was beside myself but shouldn't I at least get a cosmetic to wear in game or something?

But once I felt the shooting mechanics I immedietly realized what H1 was always missing... A GREAT DEVELOPER. Maybe one the best I have ever experienced with a game. Everything they say they will do... They do... Its not just releasing half of what they say for one big update every half a year and then have the game offline for 2 days. Daybreak ruined a great thing and they only have themselves to blame... They were money hungry with the paid content. When all they had to do was just deliver on fixing there game. This game has made the developers millions of dollars and will make millions more. H1Z1 is now dead in the water. With a scramble to start being a good developer its to little to late. Battle grounds is here.... And its here to stay. Jump in. Jump out of a plane. And get to looting folks! STOP READING AND JUST BUY IT!(as far as this being an early access title) It wont be for long. Maybe half year tops. Because that is what the developer said. And that is what the developer will do. Yes there is a hacker problem (apprently) I don't know if I have expereinced any in my 200 hours of game play. But GUESS WHAT. The developer will do everything they possibly can and they will fix it. They promised optomization first. And every update is a HUGE improvement. So when they decide to tackle the hackers.. IT WILL BE UPDATE AFTER UPDATE fixing the problem as well. Sorry H1.. you are done SON!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-23,0,0,113,True,Recommended,PUBG is a really well made game especially for an early access game. While yes it is poorly optimized but you can look through the community guides for help on getting higher frame rate and/or less stuttering. (I recommend leaving the screen scale on 70 for me anything higher than 75 drops a lot of frames it also looks pretty much the same). (Also I reccomend you have at least a gtx 1050 ti for your graghics card if your someone who wants higher graghics and higher fps).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-31,1,2,0,True,Not Recommended,This game is pure trash. I am glad Steam has a refund system.The biggest flaw for this game is friendly fire and POOR optimization. Framerates are all over the shop affecting your playable performance. The graphics are rubbish considering the system resources it uses. Another big failure is friendly fire... The devs have enabled squad play except they can kill you anyway? Wtf? I follow my squad around for a good 15 minutes thinking they were friendly then they just shoot me? What a waste of 15 minutes.The gun shot sounds in the game are complete rubbish as well it sounds like mono you honestly can't tell what direction gun shots are coming from making it difficult to judge where to go. The player base is the next problem. It seems that the majority of players are trigger happy bags they don't care about survival nor do they think of a sensible approach when playing strategically.I know the game is in early access but to be honest I was generally bored with this game I haven't played a game this bad in over 12 months and I have played ALOT of early releases this has got to be the worst.Save your $40 and go elsewhere play Squad or any FPS for that matter there are plenty of Free to Play first person shooters that are better then this all round.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-30,0,0,508,True,Recommended,The game we all love to love and love to hate. This game has it all. It's a great idea and somewhat of a good product. But this game has many pros and cons.I personally watched pewdiepie play this game which brought it to my attention and as far as I can tell the game is absolutely fun to watch (because I have a bad graphics card so I can't run it as nicely as youtubers do you probably neither do you). The game itself when I play it is an absolute blast wether I play all by my self or with my friends. The gun arsenal is quite big comparing it to H1Z1 and Fortnite therefore it's superior not only because of the guns but because of it's more realistic and has better graphics (if you can render them anyways).But despite the game's great idea and the amount of content it is just bad after playing it for a while (which is logical but it's not getting boring as games usually do after a while). The game has poor servers poor hit registration poor physics (therefore it's not completely realistic) and poor optimization despite their efforts to optimize the game. It is certainly getting a lot better patch by patch but none of their improvement will be fully appreciated unless they improve their servers (and no it's not my internet's fault).In conclusion the game has a lot of potential due to the creativity of it's developer but despite his great ideas the game is running poorly making the game very irritating to play. I hope it will run smoothly after the 1.0 release as for now I wouldn't recommend playing it and also... I would like to say that playerunknown should play PUBG to see how it feels to play his game to have some insight. Because when he tells us that he doesn't play his own game it makes me wana smack his head every time my shotgun pallets go trough my enemy.I would rate this game 5/10 for great content horrible performance and the posibillity of the games improval.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It feels like they rushed it out the door a bit while the hype was high instead of polishing the game properly. It's a great game don't get me wrong. It just feels like it's still in beta.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-03,0,0,375,True,Recommended,Really like this game. Can't put it down. Think a more strategic/realistic version of H1z1 with better graphics and an overall better game. The guns feel super satisfying and nothing beats the rush you get when you are shot or do some shooting. The gun fights are great due to the different areas of the map. Urban forest water this game has it all. I would like to see some more maps added and of course improvements but its still early access and I think this game will be the benchmark for all other games of this type going forward.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,965,True,Recommended,Great game! The most fun I've had in a game.All the negative reviews even say its a great game but they are mad at the devs for testing the crate system a few months before the game is released.. THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS!Like come on people.. why would you want them to test the crate system after launch? The game is EA.. this is WHEN YOU TEST THINGS!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-22,1,1,505,True,Not Recommended,Okay so im gonna make this quick and short... So first off im writing this review because I think most of you need to be informed about this game right now. If you considering buying this game please consider that at almost every corner your gonna die by a hacker lag vehicle turning over and exploding random headshot by guy you didnt see 1000 meters away proning behind a tree in grass etc. Oh and also...... its kinda luck. If your thinking how the hell is an fps game luck? Well let me tell you! There is a possibility that you actually wont die by any of the things I listed and once you do good it gets you hooked. You get kill hungry and want to get more kills because of how good you just did. Then the game on you again and you die by a speed hacker. Another thing is sometimes whenever you jump out of the plane you get what i like to call a follower. Now what these followers do is follow you into the building your gonna get your loot from and this game is laggy. Trust me when i say its not my internet. But you go to get the gun and your press f to pick it up and your guy does this whole long animation thing where he bends over and picks the gun up and sometimes it takes 4 tries to pick the gun up! Well sometimes these followers somehow get the gun before you even though you were there 10 seconds before him and you end up running like hell. Straight out of the building and the same thing happens to the door it takes five tries to finally open it. By that time the guy is reloaded and down the staircase ready to shoot. You run out the door and you see the light not the sun but the light... the light of hope. So you run take 5 steps run behind a wall en then you die. You kinda scratch your head for a minute and think well how did he shoot me. So then you just go on to the next game and rinse and repeat. So basically what im saying is that there is so many BS kills and deaths and it gets really annoying. Dont buy the game just yet. Let it get optimized and patched up a little bit before you purchase. By the way for you folks that stayed and read this that whole quick and short thing at the beggining was kinda sarcasm.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-01,0,0,119,True,Recommended,The amount of negative comments for this game because of a broken promise is too high. Seriously people are going to bash on the game and give it negative reviews because of a broken promise for microtransactions that are simply cosmetics? They are doing this for a gaming invitational (which can cost alot of money for the people who dont realize that) plus this game has had 2 3 updates almost every month since the release and the difference between now and then is night and day. I got this game within a week after it released on steam (yes i know i only have 86 hours its because i waited for bug fixes and for the game to not be as laggy as it was) and its one of the best EA games ive seen when it comes to updates and bug fixing. If you are deciding to buy this game for gameplay I highly recommend it. Dont listen to the people that hate on cosmetic microtransactions that give no in game advantage they already said they were going to remove them after the event so dont buy them simple as that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-28,0,0,94,True,Not Recommended,This game have great potential yea its buggy and laggy and needs polishing but its fun and worth 30$. Adding micro transactions at this stage of the game sends extremely bad signal about the devs. Considering the amount of early access players that should boost financially the development of the game enough without the CSGO style keys. So i recommend for people to wait until the game is out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-01,0,0,409,True,Not Recommended,I cannot recommend this game for the following reasons Developer's censorship of community Poor quality client/server relationship The client which says it killed first is always right (Due to BlueHole's chosen network format) Developers want to sell a bare bones game that requires you to purchase cosmetics through CS GO lottery system Developers have much needed work for the basic animations and mechanics but they focus on flashy parkour animations? Developers need to fundraise $350k for tournament/charity even though they broke $150 million in sales Developers are keen on making streamers Gods in the community Broken promises Frying Pan (Melee) is capable of deflecting melee/bullets/vehicle collisions when positioned correctly. (Infinite durability) #Broken Lack of proper reason behind loot locations Inconsistent physics for players/vehicles Game's graphics determine whether you see players better or not. Disabling/lowering graphics means an advantage meanwhile beautiful graphics on capable PC's will suffer due to their inability to keep their renderer consistent and clean. This is a major problem in a game where sneaking/hiding is mandatory. The bottom edge of a player darkened while prone. Damage values aren't grounded in logic/physics. Bullets drop while traveling (aside from some...) however decrease in speed or overall penetration doesn't reduce damage received. As a result shotguns headshot at medium to long range dealing 40+ damage per pellet. (100 HP total per player) Weapon diversity lacks good melee options or even a basic military knife Parachute mechanics feel like you're playing Pilot Wings 64...... My bad Pilot Wings 64 had great parachuting mechanics for its time. I apologize... 1/10 wait for developer's apology or acknoledgement of mistakes wait for optimizations refund for mediocre development shoved down your throat.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That doesn't work out here) and it's very rng and luck based. So much that it just becomes boring and even frustrating unless you're really good at PUBG.

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-12,0,0,542,False,Recommended,Product received for free. While I really do enjoy the game.. There's just some things that I just really can't get behind. A head shot that according to death cam is a body shot? On level 3 armor? With a Kar98? Just doesn't seem possible to me when I've taken M24 shots to the chest even closer with level 3 armor.Pro'sThere is an absolutely huge player base making queue times super quick more often than not. Which means under 2 minutes to game start typically.Lots of variety in the weaponsGreat for playing with your buddies or just meeting new people and running squads for HOURS.Sounds are pretty accurate on locations of firing/vehicles moving through the map.Con'sLooting isn't equal (go figure right?) End up running to three or four different compounds just to get a full load out. I'm talking even past a pistol here.There are some really impossible shots going on that just don't seem rightYOU MAKE ME GRIND BP FOR HOURS AND THEN MAKE ME SPEND MONEY TO UNLOCK MY CRATE?! I should have the choice for a locked crate or not.Two maps have been released since I got this back in beta.. WTF brah?Overall I'd say a decent 6/10.

Everything about this game is addictive from its graphics its gameplay its quiet and its gun fire with bullets that whisper death in your ears. From the soft winds of Gatka's fields to the massacre of Sosnovka Military Base this game is a masterpiece. I just love it when unexpected guests show up at my dorsteps and enter uninvited. There is always a hungry shotgun waiting for them. And then is the thrill of running through the fields of gold praying to God that AR or SR isn't pointed at you.But the best of all feelings is the one when you run from the blue circle.

2018-01-17,0,0,601,False,Not Recommended,So I got 400+ hours in this game played it since February of 2017. Ive seen it evolve and change as it moved through early acces and went too full release. The idea is great. Ive had alot of great fun with friends galavanting around the map. Now heres the problem. Bluehole is too far up their own counting their money too care about those who got them there. Us the players. Those of us who played early access dealt with the bugs and glitches reported the issues. Helped them make a great game. And then they opened it up too China. Its not the sheer amount of chinese players playing the game its how theyre going about it. There were hackers you ran accross in early acces maybe 1 everyone 5 6 matches and that was a high rate. Now its every match. Bluehole themselves have said 99% of hacks are coming from China. Banned 1.5 million. one solution too cut down on it region lock. yes you can get around it but it makes it a little more time consuming too do. Also ban too either steam account or hardware. Even those that dont cheat they access NA or EU servers and with their ping being horrid they slow down the game for everyone else playing. Lag Spikes rubberbanding game crashing all these things are now rampant ever since PUBG hit the chinese market. Im not fully blaming the chinese players but there is definatly a correlation.

The gunplay is great each match is completely different and everything you do is up to you and your team. At first you have no clue what you're doing and every little thing tenses you up. Guess what that tense feeling never goes away!Every match is a totally different story whether it's due to the your luck with loot drop locations or even the weather! (Especially the fog)Negative Critiques This game has problems its main one being optimization. A must have is at least 16 GBs of RAM a quick quad core processor and an above average graphics card. (Optimization is being improved all the time)I have a pretty decent gaming desktop and I still have FPS problems on low settings mainly in cities/populated areas and when spectating other players. (Check profile for PC specs)The servers are a bit laggy every now and then but problems happen rarely.In Conclusion If you give the game a few breaks and a decent amount of time it will probably become one of your favorite games despite its problems every once in a while.

This was not true they have refused to listen to their community optimize their game and fix the hackers. But they added a solution microtransactions! When ever a problem arose they would fix it with another create that cost money to open for a small chance of getting good loot.

2018-07-16,1,1,208,False,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a work of art. Yes is may be $30 USD but what you get from it is pure high action quality. Yes it's compeditors have to started to grow out of it's league but in reality PUBG is a sublime work of art that works at it's own pace. If im going to review this game then I might as well bring up it's main rival ""Fortnite"" a game almost the same in playstyle. Fortnite offers reliable multiplayer compatibility high quality voice chat and an addicting playstyle. To the media Fortnite completly incinerates PUBG by popularity standard but if you think about it PUBG isn't mean't to be played like Fortnite. Unlike Fortnite PUBG requires it's players to have an enormous amount of FPP/TPP combat skill. You could go for weeks in PUBG to not even get intoi the top 3. Fortnite's play style is more ""by the book"". If you have good aim a twitchy finger good hotkeys a knack for quick non strategical looting and a full squad of people that can do the same you're golden. However In pubg looting is one of the most difficult parts of the game. For starters you can only have two primary weapons one pistol (or sawed off) and an unlimited about of grenades that have to have assigned hotkey if you don't want to drag them into you grenade slot via inventory. Oh... and one melee weapon for the trolls. Along with this hard to use (versus its compeditor) loadout you have gun modifications. Suppressors Flash Hiders Extended Magazines Quick Draw Magizines a combination of Quick Draw and Extended Magazines Angled Grip Vertical Grip Thumb Grip Holographic Sigh Red Dot Sight 2x Scope 3x Scope 4x Scope 6x Scope 8x Scope 10x Scope 15x Scope Backgrip Cheekpad Bullet Loops Shotgun Schokes you name it! Rather than finding upgrades of each particular gun (as it is in fortnite) You have to work your way up with gun modifications and even then they only give you slight advantages. Everything else is based on what gun you can have and your shoot and cover technique. Something SUBSTANTIALLY important to note is that you can build and PUBG. You also can break stationary objects other than windows. This makes Fortnite less about skill and more about how fast you can click your hotkeys. PUBG is all about cover if you don't have it you might as well be a sitting duck. PUBG 86/100Fortnite (in its league) 89/100",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Secondly pubg is very hardware demanding meaning that if you plan to game with a low end graphics card and cpu you are most definitely gonna have a hard time. Thirdly imo pubg is a team based game sure you can play solo but playing with other people certanly adds an extra layer of fun. Fourthly pubg has had many updates over time a lot of bugs have been fixed and new content has been introduced to the game.

They have made a ridiculous amount of money selling this game which would mean they could afford bigger and better teams to work on the game but updates still feel poorly implemented always cause more glitches and dont seem to address the core issues with the game (ping abuse hit detection low server tick cheaters the list goes on).

2017-07-26,0,0,63,True,Recommended,Its a early access game so take everything i say with a grain of salt might be changed in future.This game is very unoptimized on my mid high end pc i have alot of texture bugs which degrade my gameplay enjoyment when someone has advantage of actually going into buildings and taking guns while you have to wait until game decides to load in the textures and you can actually do something but in general i think the performance is pretty good i have GTX 1050 8GB of DDR4 and i5 7300HQ and i can actually run this game flulently at med settings 1080p one annoying if youre comming from games like CSGO is that you will be annoyed by all the campers who sit in grass and wait for you to push up graphics arent that good even on ultra and the graphics options arent that good for example you cant totaly disable anti aliasing and that frustrates me because i dont see point of AA if it makes your game way more laggier.I never actually really liked these battle royale games always wasnt fan of them cause they were based alot on RNG but this is something else i actually like maybe not the game i might play often but deffinetly a game i will play maybe once a week or so really like the looting aspect and the shooting mehanics but main annoyance is that texture bug i talked about in general i recommend this game for anyone who likes games like battlefield with large open world and for anyone who likes to strave for the N1 place in everygame.

2017-07-28,0,0,461,True,Recommended,OK you want to hear a real review of this game?First off this is the most fun I've had with a multiplayer game in years. Most of that was playing solo btw. Very intense the shrinking death circle to slowly push players into battle forces smaller engagements on a very large map. IDK if that was a PUBG invention or not but its damn brilliant. Squad play is most rewarding if you have a decent team to watch your back. Getting a win in team play or solo against 99 foes is very sastisfying AKA the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner. When you get it you will know. Early Access yes. Bugs yes. Optimization issues i suppose. YMMV. I have an upper mid range rig built in 2015 and it runs great.

2017-07-28,0,0,293,True,Not Recommended,Can no longer recommend this game due to greedy company tactics dishonesty false advertising and general ******* by greedy companies. Owner has not only broken his Early Access promises by charging real money for cosmetics during EA period but has also been trolling the community on twitter over the backlash this dude is a piece of **** and this should have been apparent by the way he jumps from company to company selling his stolen game idea and running away with whatever money he can farm. The game itself has had absolutely no improvements to functionality optimization gameplay or any other actually important aspects but has pumped plenty of time and effort into double charging it's playerbase for cosmetics. Much like with H1Z1 KotK we're seeing a pattern that apparently is directly linked to the greedbot Player Unknown himself. Once the game leaves early access you'll no longer be able to obtain any cosmetic progression in the game without spending $2.50 to randomly gamble with crates which is ultimately worse than just releasing paid cosmetic packs at face value. This game is a fun at first cash grab that is going to get worse with age and while I've had fun playing it (When it isn't crashing lagging freezing or killing me randomly due to the myriad of bugs) I'm definitely hanging up the hat so to speak.

2018-04-24,0,0,77,False,Recommended,"I can easily consider PUBG one of my favorite games of all time not only is it a ""battle royale"" type game but there is a lot more to it than that. The game was officially released out of beta but it's still buggy and not sufficiently stable enough for the high amount of concurrent players. A ton of things in the game need to be fixed//updated... A big part of the game is surviving a way to to that is finding a vehicle and using it to find resources. I LOVE the vehicle physics they're just honestly hilarious to play around with especially with friends. It's always nice to see what'll happen when you do ""this or that"" it could either go two ways you die from vehicle explosion or you get flung 20km into the air and then die from impact. The game has a very long way to go for example the shotguns somehow their range is unexpectedly high. I lost track of how many times I've smashed my headset against my monitor because I've been sniped by a shotgun across the street from me... I think that should be minorly adjusted. It brings to my attention that PUBG Corp or Bluehole decide to push changes to the UI instead of fixing gameplay issues such as framerate stuttering even on a high end PC and a lot more issues that would take too long to sit here and list. Other things on the more positive side In my opinion I think the weapon mechanics are perfectly fine and balanced the way they are atm but I would like to see another big set of weapons added because let's be honest here we've had the same guns since initial alpha release...Overall when you get past the negative parts and bullsh*t mechanics in the game it becomes a ton of fun especially if you got a squad of friends with you. and get that chicken dinner. It feels good to win Highly recommend if you got a group of friends to play with!Edit The March 2018 update dropped for PUBG adding emotes a friend system and a lot more including bug fixes. It seems to me that everytime they introduce something new into the game it interferes and breaks something else of higher importance. Because of the games popularity to load into a server though MM would take a few seconds. After the new update they ed something up like usual like matchmaking is really buggy (sometimes it'll get stuck on a ""Started Matchmaking"" screen) and as an addition to that when MM does decide to work it can take up to 1 minute versus the few seconds it took before. If bluehole is gonna keep adding to the game they have to make sure it won't mess anything else up because I'd rather have fast and reliable matchmaking rather than emotes but of course that's just me .. I still recommend the game positively because I'm sure eventually they'll improve their system and this won't be an issue. April 2018 March 2018 issues have been resolved ) I was surely confident they would recuperate and they didEnd of April/May 2018 Update Accoording to the patch notes for this new update new scopes were added new weapons new vehicles and some other loot and entity adjustments for gameplay improval.What we found out A lot more was changed that wasn't mentioned for example AR Spray Patters// Recoil Patterns... The patchnotes did mention a buff to the SMGs and a tone down for the ARs but they literally made them useless garbage... The M416 used to be the best AR you can find and no questioning it (statisically at least) the pure fun of the game. The dev team literally took everything good about the ARs and f*cked it in the a$$ ....So now if you want to engage in a fight that's medium/long range you are forced to use a sniper rifle or else there's like a 1/20 change you will nail a shot using an AR. Don't get me wrong everything else about the update is absolutely great but why mess with the ARs if everybody adored them the way they were. It's honestly upsetting because I've put so much time into mastering long range// medium range AR fights and now it's all put to waste. Probably the only good thing about the update was the changes to the M16A4 it's back! Before PUBG 1.0 release the M16A4 used to be an insanely good gun for medium range and finally it's back. It sure is really nice to have it back and I really hope PUBG Corp eventually bring back the ARs but again there's less than a 1% chance they'll do that since they are going through this path for their game where they want to make every weapon valuable and there's a chance you could win a fight with any weapon obviously exluding somebody with an AR versus somebody with a pistol because that's obviously unfair. But UMP9 vs SCAR L actually has a decent chance to win now especially since 90% of the loot you find is attachments lmao it's crazy how common grips are now. I'm finding myself with 10+ in my inv every game because I have no clue which are useful for what. Anyways I respect the desicion path they're making for their game and I'll for sure always support em' but man I will miss the old ARs more than anything else.

2017-10-04,0,0,490,True,Recommended,This game is seriously addictive for me personally I love competitive multiplayer games and this game is the first game that I considered to play besides Dota 2 it's as fun as it is frustrating you can play 1 match and die within first few seconds because another player landed in the same spot as you but just a few seconds before you or you can make it all the way to the top 10 or even first place if you play your cards right the game has a learning curve you have to learn the tricks of the trade if you want to survive.I recommend this game yes it has issues yes it has bugs just last night me and 2 of my friends we're playing we got ambushed in the open and was hiding in some bushes the guy took out both of my friends and he finished off my friend as I was reviving him somehow that triggered a bug that caused my character to stay in the same pose and I was unable to turn anymore I stayed alive by using my friends Medi Kits and bandages and managed to get our team in the top 10 that way hahaha. I've had so many laughs with this game it's really at it's absolute best when you play with your friends with Teamspeak. Criticism I have about the game It's terribly optimized the game requires a lot of work on the performance side.The game is more than terrible if you don't put it on a SSD even a SSD will do. Else you will spend the first minute of play with a broken game while everything loads it's very hdd dependent.Streamer bans? Luckily it has never happened to me YET! and I hope it won't I never ever cheat in any game and I will be very sad if I get banned for not even cheating which according to some of the reviews is quite the problem play fair and it won't ever be a problem for you.This game is huge amounts of fun once you learn how to handle all it's flaws I've had many nights so far where I played from after work till 4 the next morning even though I have work at 9 lol it's that addictive for me.

2017-12-19,0,0,42,False,Recommended,Previous Review 19th December 2017So it's been roughly a year since I posted my review so I figured I'd make a edit to it since I haven't in almost a year.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a highly competetive FPS battle royale which has 3 (soon to be 4) maps. You have Erangel The original map and my personal favourite. Erangel is the second largest map in the game. The reason I like Erangel so much is that it is fairly colorful (Compared to the largest map Miramar) and has many good looting spots etc. Miramar The largest map. This map is a very good map for sniping as it's mostly plain land apart from the buildings and farms on the map. Many people dislike it but personally I don't mind it as it's always fun to pick off people and watch them scuttle away from hundreds of meters away.Sanhok This map came out a while after Miramar. It is the smallest and probably the most popular if not just as popular as Erangel. If you want a quicker game this is the map to go for. Be wary though as it is 4x smaller than both the maps so the likelyhood is after a close encounter more than a quater of the remaining players will know where you are so be careful of that.Vikendi The upcoming map. It is snowy and slightly larger than Sanhok but still the second smallest map in the game. So far it seems pretty fun and enjoyable (from what I've seen)Now the question is this worth a pickup? In my opinion 100%. If you are looking for a more competetive game than Fortnite H1Z1 etc than this is the place to go.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-15,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,I thought this game might be fun so I bought it during steam summer sale.Boy was I wrong. Between the lag and the glitches this game is impossible to play. The game frequently hiccups during firefights especially close range. Sometimes I'm dead before I actually see an enemy come around the corner. Try picking up a gun when you land before someone else does and you press the action button 4 times and it doesn't do anything. Then you get shot by the guy that landed next to you and got his gun first.Aiming is impossible and since you only get a chance to shoot maybe once each game you can only practice once every 10 minutes. This means you have to play hours and hours before you develop any basic proficiency at the game. Even then you can't get a kill because of the previosly mentioned technical problems.I thought maybe this game would be ok since it had been out for about two years. Wrong again. Don't waste your time. Play something that works.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,113,True,Not Recommended,"Ah yes PUBG. Or should I call it the massive airsoft arena. Welcome to the game where your hits do not register and the ones that do only deal 20 damage. In this game you should enjoy emptying entire magazines of an M16 on an enemy and see that they become swiss cheese because of all the exaggarated blood effects but then still manage to get killed by him since your bullets didn't register and the ones that did didn't do much damage. But it doesn't only end there! The enemy does ALSO see himself turning into swiss cheese. Basically the player who has 5 ping less than you wins eventhough you saw them first and shot at them first.A game where you can lie down in tall grass or on top of buildings and watch your enemies without any risk. A first person only mode is coming but that is not enough. Either fix the netcode or put a ""hardcore mode"" where people die faster so the bullets that DO register at least kill the target.They added bullet drop and travel speed to this game so it is ""realistic"" however the guns are all pea shooters so there goes your realism outside the window.Instead of this generic peashooter game you are better off playing CoD or BF1 softcore mode. At least those games have somewhat better netcode.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

HELL NO U PREFERED TO REDUSE THE POINTS EVERY PLAYER GETS AFTER EVERY GAME CAUSE YOU ARE UNABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THESE BOTTERS U RUIN WHOLE COMMUNITY RLY BAD MOVE FROM COMPANY SIDE.5.Add new attacments and give 2 keys at 1000 random ppl who write their oppinion on your survey YOU EARNED MILLIONS IN 1 YEAR AND U REWARD YOUR COMMUNITY WITH 2000 KEYS something is going wrong in this company for example Fortnite had 1 day problem with their servers and gave to all players free cosmetics as reward for the waiting PUBG have problems from they day they released it.6.They saw that their game started to loose people because other battle royal games released and what they did? maybe add something that the others games dont have? OF COURSE NO THEY JUST COPYCAT FEATURES FROM THE OTHER GAMES.7.Bluehole gave private servers only at some youtubers and streamers at the start of the early access nothing rly changed untill today.NOT EVEN PUT AN OPTION FOR EVERY PLAYER TO TEST THE WEAPONS WITHOUT JOIN A GAME.8.And for last YOU MAKE TRADE LOCK! ok some ppl will say its for the gambling sites etc.Everyone who have IQ over 50 knows that these gambling sites are scam and the 3rd party sites where u can cashout your money i rly dont see anything wrong with that(these sites is the reason these games have so big communities) so don't be fooled by bluehole's words.Every item u sell on steam market steam take 15% from the transaction from the 15% the company that owns the game in our case Bluehole earn 7 5% so ask yourself ARE THEY RLY DO THAT TRADE LOCK CAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY?(Personaly i have earned over 150euro from pubg items and i think this is not bad not all kids these days have money to buy new games etc trading and selling skins was a way to earn some money and buy what they want.) useless updates fix game plzz,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,468,False,Not Recommended,The game needs some love from developers. The patches almost always mess up the game but are fixed before the new patch comes in and then break again with the new patch. Also there is a high spike in cheaters that use aim bots and wall hacks. Usually you can tell something is up when the player count falls under 30 within 4 minutes. It's hard to recommend the game because it seems like the developer is rushing to make as much money as possible before the game gets over runned with hackers.Update 11/22/2018 The game still needs work compared to other BR. I would just skip it at this point as the developer has no idea what they want to do with the game.

2017-11-14,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,"I'm extremely disappointed for this game because it had such an promising premise when it was still in early access when I bought it. The game was unpolished and unoptimized for the most part it was full of cheaters and various bugs/glitches but I was fine with it because it was still in early access.Fast foward to this day and what has changed? Not really much. The game runs a little bit better but its still highly unoptimized. It still has tons of bugs and glitches its filled with cheaters and as a top of the cake the gameplay is still very very unpolished.The only thing that has actually changed with the game is that how greedy Bluehole has become with it. The only progression system in the game is tied to the loot boxes and you need to use real money if you want to open those boxes.To make matters worse Bluehole recently added this ""Event Pass"" feature to the game that is supposed to add a little bit more progression to the game where you can unlock various cosmetic items. The core idea is cool but the problem with this is that it costs 10$ and you have to ""renew"" it every 4 weeks or so. As in whole this whole ""event pass"" is an carbon copy from the Fortnite's Battle Pass feature but its more greedy.I'm not gonna list all the problems that this ""Event Pass"" has but you can learn more about it from this video https //www.youtube.com/watch?v dKP69TUnQQAOverall I really wish that Bluehole would turn their boat and start focusing fixing and improving their game instead of implementing new methods for milking our wallets dry.Pros + Fun to play with friendsCons Unpolished gameplay Unoptimized Hackers No real progression system to work on Filled with greedy microtransactions 10$ Battle pass every 4 weeks in 30$ game is not tolerable !Do I recommend?No. Do not spend any money on this gamebefore the Bluehole starts to listen feedback because otherwise that money is only going to be wasted.Based on their actions Bluehole doesn't seem to care about their community anymore because they keep implementing more greedier MTXs every month or so while the actual problems with the game is left untouched.Verdict 3/10 Below average",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-15,0,0,468,True,Not Recommended,Well i am fully aware of the fact that this game reached the top playing multiplayer game of the current age. But as a multiplayer gamer i cannot recommend this game. Mainly because of the RNG attached with the success of this game. When i died most of the time i died because of bad luck as there were no vehicle spawns or the circle was too far away or it was on an enemy team. If landed on some landmarks which were located in the center most of the times youll die for bad luck as well by not finding any wepon where as your finding one. Camping in this game is hugely favoured as it is safe and rewarding without a good enough scope the last 3 or 4 circle os impossible. And the biggest problem in this game is HACKERS. 20% players in this game uses various types of hacks.So the gist of my review is that this game is bad if you want to have competition and skill based combat. if you just want to have some fun with friends then this game is very good as this will give you some good times. Except those times when youll die miserably by the hands of a hacker or a very lucky person with a better weapon or sight.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-12,0,0,170,True,Not Recommended,I've played this game for almost 90 hours. The desync and lag is terrible. Unless you play at off times. You die behind cover constantly. The 'Circle of death' is too fast so you have no chance of outrunning it if you are far away or don't have car. The circle does so much damage towards the later stages of the game that if you don't immediately head for the new circle you're dead. The guns are really nicely detailed but are far too inconsistent to really choose a favorite or superior weapon. My biggest gripe is how the biggest threat in this game is the circle and not the other players. Seems completely backwards to me. At least in H1Z1 you can at least tank some of the gas damage to get to the safe zone. I ve tried full boosting to try to outrun it and you still can t.If they would just fix the servers and desync this game would be amazing but i don't see them doing that anytime soon. I know it's still in early access but i don t feel like that s a good excuse for the constant dying behind cover when your character model is fully behind an object. This game feels like how Overwatch was before they upped the tick rate on the servers from 20. Wait for patches and optimizations for the game before you buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-28,0,0,153,True,Not Recommended,As a developer and 3d artist I have to say this game is amature at best it lacks any type of optamizations uses high resources and above all gets a constant game freeze left with message Network Lag Detected at first thought it was network issue. Checked for line jitter 30ms on the highest test 10 or less on average. Then checked upload and down speeds are more than sufficient next checked a ping test while playing and ping test did even better when game dropped maintaining a 80ms relay on average. Next though maybe Anti Virus or firewall so added exclusions to every binary file in the PUBG folder. Then closed out anti virus (Kaspersky) final step changed NAT type from secure to open and still having the same issue. I am more than confident it is not my network or computer not to mention no other network apps drop when I open them or games when I play them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Get killed by that same person with 2 pistol shots to chest.opening/closing doors and picking up items sometimes takes 7 clicks wich is way to long if you have someone running behind you who wants to kill you.A 5 cm ledge will sometimes stop you when running so you have to jump over it to keep going. And jumping forward from stand still ... noEDIT escaping a boulding through the window is a no go no matter how doable it seems.I really love the fact that you can't buy ingame things w/. real money but some more affordable clothes would be nice.

Fix the ear defening volume of rain and the plane God knows we all hear China No.1 and the N word in that sequence regardless. 3. Speaking of sound why does everyone have tapshoes on and why does a suppressor not suppress anything at all? No one should be able to hear someone walking around a building over... 4. For the love of God add a simple deathmatch mode 16v16 8v8 in the major cities or areas (ranked and ready for matchmaking) where you can spawn instead of parachuting with a pistol and a magazine. It's not that hard to success Socom or I guess Counterstrike... Just add a game mode like that and the game will grow bigger than it somehow already is. All you guys are doing is adding a couple game modes to your system. You wanna add a dirt bike you can do a flip on and a sniper rifle that shoots paintballs over stability.

2017-11-28,0,0,1018,True,Recommended,after 475 hours of playtime i can say that i hope most shooters and early access games take notes from bluehole and the dev team for PUBG. Yes i know there are bugs and people cheat and it sucks when you get killed but having said that patches are always coming out and issues are being resolved. every game has its issues and i like this game so much because they continue to address issues little by little. the game has changed in so many ways since the beta and the initial early access release. this isnt a game that is staying in early access forever or never gets any work done to it. it certainly can become monotonous playing the same game on the same map over and over again but it hasnt stopped me. if you are on the fence for this game atleast grab it before it hits full release soon. return it if you dont like it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Alot of people complain about the circle RNG cheaters etc. While I havent encountered many cheaters in my playtime (maybe 3) If these players would understand how to play the game in a way where they didnt die to the circle poeple in bushes etc. they might actually enjoy the game.

2018-02-21,0,0,159,False,Not Recommended,I delayed buying this game for months. I saw their rise to fame their greed their incessant belief that they were the top dogs on the market and anyone who conflicted with them(cough cough Fortnite) had to be taken down...and then all the bad started to leak out. I stayed away from this game knowing all of that not wanting to get involved and preferring to keep my sanity. Then my friend convinced me into buying the game and I dropped into my first match.It was an exhilerating feeling that first round. The high you get that high you want to repeat for round after round. Getting down to the final few winning your first chicken dinner learning the bullet mechanics and what guns you do and don't like what ones to stay away from....that fascination stays with you for a good 60 80 hours of playtime. You meet your first cheater no big deal you knew about them these things happen right? Then you start meeting more of them. First it was one every dozen games then every ten then every six. That number continues to fall until you're almost afraid going third person in NA because you're gonna lose chicken dinner to one guy who autolocks a headshot on your whole squad or fires with no recoil at a 100 meters away.Losing isn't bad losing to cheaters is especially when they recently implemented new anti cheating software that seems to have only allowed the rampant cheating to grow worse. And as the cheating gets set in your mind you start seeing more problems in the game. The way the vehicle physics work how a tiny clump of dirt can stop your vehicle short. Getting stuck in walls the game twitching to make a vehicle fall on you. The parachute getting caught then sending you slamming to the ground and nearly killing you. The lack of grass rendering at certain distances to make sniping wars in fields completely one sided. Queueing in duos or squads on NA and getting a full squad who can't speak any English whatsoever then proceed to kill you if you get anything good. This game could be great and its clear the developers don't care about fixing it rather then throwing more content at us and making as much money off this as possible. Don't buy this. Did I get fun out of my 50 hours or so? Yes and I can still enjoy myself and win chicken dinners. But the hackers and the little things the small issues that have been in this game since LAUNCH and they have chosen NOT to fix will tilt you off the face of the Earth. Save yourself the trouble these devs don't honestly care about you. Just your money. Did I mention keys you have to buy to open some loot crates too? 8),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,185,True,Recommended,Game is honestly pretty broken. If you look around the internet you can see a considerable number of pretty convincing accounts of improper banning and the fact that they always favor streamers. The biggest problem is how you get banned so easily. Pay $30 for the game and then if your game loads with a glitch and you do not exit and keep playing there is a good chance you will get banned. The issue with the streamers makes sense when you consider the nature of the came next to its sales model. In reality winning in this game is more luck than strategy. It seems like getting in the top 20 players is skill based but getting into the top 10 and then winning is mostly just luck. But in order to motivate people to buy and play the game they have to make it appear that you can win make it look attainable. And this is why I think they let streamers get away with hacking and try so hard to protect them and make them happy. The streamers are the commercials for this game. Overall this is my take I really enjoy playing the game for what it is. I know every time I load in it is a ssmall chance I will win but I enjoy playing with friends getting lucky kills and wasting the time. So if you want to buy this game to win and succeed I would say look elsewhere. But if you have $30 to blow and you enjoy laughing at rediculous buggy incredibly nuanced stuff with a group of friends it may be worth it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Particularly in early game fights weapons are almost impossible to pick up and enemies often only update at about 1hz or so. This is from someone with a high end PC and internet connection who has no trouble running most games.While the test server does improve performance in terms of FPS it causes the game to crash multiple times per session on average.

I've played all the way throguh the Early Access of this game and even played the Test Servers. This is THE FIRST GAME That has ever went from Early Access to Full Lunch on Steam for me. In the Time line that they set All the way too the completion and ""They are still working on this game"" it has been Amazing. This game Like Many other Game Titles that Are or Have become AAA does have it's ups and Downs. Let's Start with the Cons... As I like to Start with Bad news then End on a Good Note.1 It still Lags when you have a Full 100 Man Lobby. This Stops with in 30 Seconds of Landing...2 You still Run into Hackers I've ran into About 15 my WHOLE TIME PLAYING (Currently Have 290.4 Hours on Record and this will Grow.) Also what AAA Title Doesn't have hackers? AKA Sore Losers who can't win a single game they Play EVER...3 Still Has a few bugs but Not Game Braking.Thats all my complaints.Now Let's Move onto the Pros.1 Love the Gun Play and Gun Sounds.2 Combat can be Fast and intense (Only Game that Really Gets the Adrenaline pumping for me.)3 It's Fun as HELL to play this game with Friends and play it Solo as well.4 The Vehicles in this game (1) Sound Good (2) Feel Right when Driven (3) Seam to be Very well Blanced to One Another.5 The Developers Listen to What 95% of their Community wants. The other 5% Are Either Idiots Cry Babies Or Hackers.6 When The Developers say they are doing something It gets done and NOT HALF !7 It's Priced Well...So Well infact That I went out and Bought it for my Xbox One Yes it's Still $30 there too.8 IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN THANK ING GOD. It Takes Some Skill to earn a win even if RNG Bites you in the In conclusion The Mixed reviews are just that An Opinion Like me or of someone whom had either an Amazing Experience or a Poor One. I Love this game and Can't wait to see what the Devs come up with Next for this game. Don't just Go off of my Opinion or someone elses to see if you will like this game We all Know it's a 100 man Battle Royle and you're not going to win all the time every single day of the week. You need to play it and have your own Experience to Truly form an opinion on this game. Now get out there and Game on!!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,2,1,5,True,Not Recommended,The game has not one but the worst optimization I have ever seen. The game may be still in alpha but other similar games do run on my computer still when they were in alpha. I can not comment about the gameplay I have to comment only that the graphics do not load and if you do not have a high end pc you wont be available to play the game. To explain my situation I will examplify with other games. Rust is one of them. I had that game since its release. I played it in medium graphics since its release and always had over 60 fps. Same with games like CS GO which I bought last year and others. There are no games that have never run on my computer. Many of you may say your computer is garbage or the game is still in alpha. Thats not an excuse. The game was released over 6 months ago I played this game 3 months ago with a friends account and the game worked perfectly fine graphics loaded seconds after I started playing and my fps were over 50 constantly. The developers just do not care they literally dont give a f*ck about optimization. TL DROnly buy this game if you have a really good pc the game is probably great but is optimized.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-27,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,An incredibly flawed game with performance and lazy developers that take months to fix and update the game. Devs who side with streamers against their own players and run ads on their players after they have paid 30 for the game that isn't even finished. They added loot boxes going against their initial statement and showing us how little they care about their players. They just want to squeeze the money out of the consumers without even having a finished product Siding with streamers their main way of freely advertising their game Adding ads to the Chinese servers/version of the game since almost 50% of PUBG players are Chinese Added loot boxes to generate extra revenue and scratch the gambling addiction gaming is growing in us. Meanwhile over almost one year we are getting a couple of weapons minor fixes a vaulting system and a new map (Remember that a lot of the assets in the first map were bought). Keep in mind that this game already generated hundreds of millions if not billions. PUBG is just using their popularity in an uncontested market getting more money while still not making the game. So essentially you're just giving away your money for a barebones product with slow and greedy developers. This game is envisioned towards casuals that's also why they're porting it over to XBOne to increase their profits with an unfinished game. The 'PUBG genre' needs more games to compete with this one otherwise this game will be milked forever and become another DayZ. For now stick to free to play avoid wasting money on these unfinished garbage and wait until a finished experience gets released. This is no different from EAe and Ubishoft so stop being part of the problem.To boost its popularity they're trying to make this game into an esport which is stupid in its current state It's focused a lot on random elements to be considered truly competitive. This is a casual play with friends type of game that is still enjoyable to watch but not competitive enough to make a scene out of it.By the looks of it Bluehole or PUBG Corporation or whatever it is seems more interested in stopping people from making games similar to theirs essentially cutting competition rather than making their own game better and properly competing against other games. Truly shows how greedy they are.Even after release the gameplay is still broken with major desyncs server lag hitreg issues. You might think it's fun to play with your buddies but you'll soon realise how frustrating it is to die to rng or die to bad hitreg.After the release 2/10.

Aside the surviving aspects as drinking building or hunger mechanics pubg is just a shorter faster more action punched and a little less tryhard day z where your actual goal is to be the last man standing. At the beggining i was addicted and fell in love with pubg as it had all the aspects of a royale game i was looking for but still it felt like an unfinished game or even a mod to a game. Harsh visuals for the eyes dry textures low tickrates unbalanced weapons that you cant rely on grass is visible at 150m &lt or less so stealth is kidna broken too etc. Many bugs and clankyness deleted the ""competitive"" aspect of the game as long as you cant really rely on runing behind covers hiding in the grass or just trying to dodge a bullet as you can easily be shot while behind a wall because the server had a hiccup or you can miss a shot as the server had a huccup or you can fall of a cliff cos the server had a hiccup etc etc. Let asside the unwillingness to listen to the community or even respect it's costumers. 30euros game infested with locked lootboxes. I am not a hater of the lootboxes but as i see the game goes on and progresses it's development i clearly see that they are doing their best as they know that their game is dying to milk as much money as the can while they can . Started from nearly 0 locked lootboxes and now they even sell rare and costume cloth sets with a new set like every week or two. They fixed some problems with the stability and the frame rates but the netcode is still trash. They pioneered the fame of a genre they tried to remain the best but they misserable failed to stay relevant accepted that fact and as i stated before instead of listening to the community better the game or even showed some respect to us they just shove in your face their new cases and cloths AND freaking ????battlepasses????? like it's gonna fix my unstable game experience.TL DRAs the game develops it makes it even harder for the consumer to enjoy or want to play it anymore. Every new ""feature"" is indifferent passive or a new way to milk even more money.As i went forward and experienced other battle royale titles I can say that most of them do things to keep you intrested commited and ""reward"" you for playing and spending your time in their game. They do their best to be eye appealing bug free and most important fun and not exhausting for the player. They develop and better their games they dont stand idle or even worse do backward steps and destroy what they have firstly managed to build.PSPlease take my review with a grain of saltFiled lawsuit claiming another tittle ""copied them"" and with the latest patch the ""new"" reward system is nearly identical with that of title they lawsuited.Irony bipods impertinent to players apathy and struggle for relevance",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Plus with as many obvious hackers there are at times i wonder how many are a little better at hiding their hacks. Where the hell are more game modes? You people that recommend fortnite are dumb!!!! Fortnite is terrible!!!! PUBG is a million times better!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Honestly the devs got to fix this quick.. if they want this game to be the beacon for deathmatch type shooters then they gotta get it in gear. cause right now this shouldn't even be considered an early access.

There is no confusion about what your objective is when the game starts. Get in kill everybody else.Unfortunately some people have been using these review boxes to complain about cosmetic only pay to open boxes and their personal beef with the developers. The game is fun. Hands down the game is fun. You don't need to like the people who make something to enjoy the product and if you don't like the idea of paid cosmetic boxes don't buy them! I know I won't but it's not going to make stop enjoying the game with my friends because Bob from accounting spent 100 bucks on sunglasses and tank tops.It is an early access game so there are a few hiccups here and there (and world voice chat on the starting island is ATROCIOUS WOULD RECOMMEND MUTING THAT RIGHT AWAY) but nothing even close to game breaking.

2017-10-03,0,0,226,True,Recommended,"With high negativity circulating PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS at the moment I thought I would throw in my two cents.This game is fun frustrating goofy and rewarding. Each kill feels like you earned it each death feels like you've brought shame upon your family. After playing close to 200 hours I feel im finally able to grasp the layout of the map how each gun works and so on. My rig is heavily outdated running a Gigabyte 660 Ti In order to play this game I have to run all setting on close to the lowest possible so commenting on optimisation and graphical changes is out of the question until I update my hardware. but to say the least even with horrible graphics the gameplay doesn't change that much besides the long distance rendering and not being able to aim at far enemies. After playing for a while it seems you get used to this. Early access means early access When buying this game you agree to the terms and conditions that follow an early access development. You can't simply expect a game to be bug free this early in the alpha. Although it is frustrating getting killed by a ghost car clipping through textures that unexpectadly splattered you all over the walls in the so called ""saftey"" of a town house for all your hard earned loot you have to expect this kind of poor gameplay from a large scale early access title. Hang on to the game and play it later in the alpha and pre beta when the game has more bug fixes. The devs are obviously working hard to pump out fixes as shown with the 1 5gb updates every odd week. Server issues PUBG has suffered some serious server issues as of late with the the extreme popularity of this game it was only a matter of time. from one million players less than a month ago to 1.5 million last week and a new peak of nearly 1.7 million two days ago it is obvious that the initial servers can't keep up with the huge spike of players. a recent statement from the devs states ""First of all we would like to sincerely apologize to everyone for the recent server issues which resulted in long waits and any inconveniences "" and "" Despite our daily efforts there were some unexpected issues during peak times"". Until the upgrade of the servers it seems as though we will have to wait out the issue. More information on the server issues can be found in this article &gt http //playbattlegrounds.com/news/95.pu Even with the recent bad reviews i still enjoy playing this game a lot. I feel it will definitely be worth the wait when the game is finished even if it takes a long time.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The pan is level 4 you can only receive the Chicken Dinner while wearing one.9. There are 3 categories of equipment for guns. Weapons Ammo and Attachments. You will only find 2 of these categories and it will make you cry.10. There are snakes in this game I recommend good boots when travelling through long grass.11. The gas mask will not help you survive in the blue gas I know it's confusing.12. The map names are wrong. Prison and Shelter should be called Crater and Bunkers.

They are PURELY COSMETICS. If you do not like them do not buy them. Don't stray from this game because people are crying that they can't get something that is COSMETIC. If they want it that badly they can shut up and pay for it. I in my opinion could care less about the clothing. IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU ANY ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME. RANT.

2017-08-28,1,1,378,True,Recommended,"Hands down this is the best battle royal game to date!Pros 1) It's a challenge start to finish. 2) Looting is half the fun3) Games start fast 60 seconds at the most4) Playing with friends is also quick and easy5) There's 3rd person and 1st person modes6) Winning don't come easy. So it makes winning that much more satisfying.7) There's a refresh button on the main menu. So instead of restarting your game do to an issue you just refresh and move on. (Most of the time)Cons1) Driving needs work2) Servers have issues sometimes (restarting the game fixes it most the time)3) Jumping over anything taller then 2 feet is an art form mastered by only the most agile of gamers. (Climbing and vaulting is coming soon)4) More control over the sound would be great5) It's possible to get banned for team killing car horn harassment and stream sniping.Overall the cons will be fixed with patches. No big deal. Some patches will ""ruin"" the game in the eyes of some people. But that's early access for you. The majority of the negative reviews currently are people complaining about microtransactions. The microtransactions are purely cosmetic. And yes some things you get are camo. But trust me camo conceals absolutely nothing in this game. The ghillie suit is the only thing that helps with concealment and you can only get that from a care package in game. Good luck with that one btw.The only other thing is the banning. Team killing is damn near impossible. You knock someone out before they bleed out and die. So if you team kill you're doing it on purpose. Dude might have deserved it though. Horn harassment and stream sniping is another ridiculous thing. If your driving around laying on the horn you're an a## hole. And the chances of landing in a game with a streamer you just so happen to be watching is impossible. There are no name tags in game and you can't pick a server to play on. I enjoy this game and I get my a## handed to me constantly. But that adds to the fun. Buy the game and try it. Don't listen to the negative cry babies.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-16,0,0,39,True,Recommended,I think a lot of the reviews are being a little unfair. If people are getting banned for killing streamers then yeah that is really and needs to stop.HOWEVERThe game itself is pretty entertaining. Mildly frustrating at times but that's usually down to my own incomopetence rather than any fault of the game. You don't have to be the best equipped to win you don't have to be the most skilled with 98 kills to win and using your head a little can easily carry you into the top 10 or 20. Equipment feels well distributed and I haven't had any issues with major bugs which is nice for an early access game. Controller support is decent and the controls make sense out of the box though the game does play a little better with mouse and keyboard as you'd probably expect. Overall 7/10. Its fun and varied enough that most rounds play out differently enough and the game mechanics feel solid. I think the fact the game is based around one mode with somewhat limited features may be a letdown eventually but I got a good two and a half years out of League before getting bored so that's not necessarily the case. Just please don't add crafting.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-29,0,0,467,True,Not Recommended,As much as I have enjoyed this games over the many many hours. I can't give it a good review. Let's start with what they got right about the game.Pro's Gunplay The gunplay in this game is so damn good. It feels great when shooting. Super smooth and it feels like it does what a gun should do. Despite some bugs this is probably the strongest part of the game. However this only applies to mid and long range fights. More on CQB later.Multiplayer The ability to play with your friends makes this super enjoyable. Being able to play with 1 3 friends at any time is awesome. Loads of fun and some GREAT memories already.Gameplay Now the gameplay leads to a lot of intense situations like so intense your heart races and your hands shake and even to the point where your heartbeat is the only thing you hear. Also this game allows you to play any type of style that you want. Slow fast aggressive camper. It is wonderful the pace of the game is what makes it so damn good and allows it to capitalize on the intensity of the game. But there are some downsides to it. More later.Dev Team So it seems like the Dev team are super committed to making a full game and servicing it throughout its life. This is wonderful. Also they release regular updates and they do listen to player feedback to an extent.Con's Let's pick back up where we left off Devs Now I almost NEVER bash devs as I know it takes forever to implement fixes and patches and clearly I like them from the above comment. However there are some SERIOUS net code issues within this game. Like seriously bad. These have been there since day one. Let's say the net code one day one was a 2/10. After 6 months is pretty much a 2.2/10. Very little improvement has been made on this front and its gotten to the point to where I play one game and get so titled due to the net code issues. It does baffle me how they haven't made more improvements here. Optimization Riddled with more bugs than a 100 day old dead corpse. It's abysmal how buggy the game is. I have a PC that can run Wither 3 on max settings at 100fps. Why on earth do i struggle so god damn hard to even break 60 on the lowest settings for a game that is 1/10 as graphically advance. Also one of the DUMBEST things ever is when you land somewhere and there is no loot in that building/area so you continue onto the next one and then someone who landed after you had all that gear render and proceeds to shoot you in the back with a gun you never even saw spawn in.Overall this is an incredible game that brings hours and hours of fun to mine and many of my friends lives. However after defending them for months and months about their being seriously persistent issues I have begun to turn against PUBG. The bugs and poor optimization have made this RNG/Strategy based game into almost all RNG. I don't like the fact that one of the most fun games I have ever played will receive a thumbs down from me but I believe it is a deserved one.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-15,0,0,743,False,Recommended,Gaming has been coming along for a while now and I have been happy to year after year be delighted with new creations and on occasions new genres of gaming. This was such a year not only was I delighted with a first person shooter that feels very realistic and has beautiful eye candy but also a whole new way of playing Battle Royal. Since the release of this title there have been a few others to come forward and right now we can see that this genre is only at the start of its life. Yea! I mention this story here though as I feel this was the game that started the genre and will forever be told in its history in future. best part it's also really good.The game does require strong hardware if you want to win I started on a dated first generation i7 with a graphics card that would stutter on all settings at low(I called it pixel PUBG) but the reward of the experience when you do have a half decent machine is simply wonderful.Built on the Unreal Engine the world content is very beautiful. The shades and textures are a delight and I honestly find it hard to believe that things can get any better than this. Mind you I would have said that nearly 20 years ago with Unreal!There are many areas in which the game can improve but I have no doubt it will. New content creation and bug fixing is something we have all come to expect of titles as a given and surely this will be no execption. The creators have just completed a large round of bug fixing as well as releasing a new map in time for Christmas holiday Vikendi.Simply a superb game that has to be tried. I enjoy titles like CSGO but the scope of the world map is wonderful and makes for more unpredictable play. The visuals are great but the adrenelin is always pumping and that gets may vote every time. Great work PUBG Corporation! Keep the good stuff coming.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-22,0,0,266,False,Recommended,After roughly 130 hours I'm writing my first review ever of any game. I keep trying to play other games MMOs RTS and other FPS but I keep getting this itch that PUBG can only seem to scratch.First off I don't have a ton of wins less than 10 to be exact due to a few reasons(in my opinion). First the game is still poorly optimized for mid range systems. I shouldnt have to turn all my settings to very low to have a stable framerate when their is visually no difference between very low and ultra at 1080p. This also goes into poor hit detection and server lag that causes your perfectly lined headset to miss and your opponent to shoot you behind a wall they couldnt possibly of seen you behind.Second I love playing duos or squads but the community is indeed very immature and it's hard to find people who won't call you names or just simply rage quit or team kill you for loot. So i play solo.... a lot. Thirdly the game does have a high skill gap. It takes some getting used to the weapon and looting mechanics... when and when not to ADS or when to peek etc.. I died so often because I thought my enemy could'nt see me.Being an old school CS 1.6 competitive player this annoys me.Fourth(which is also kind of like my first) Is random framerate drops during CQC. Ive notcied added 16 more GB of ram and using a SDD while overclocking my 1050ti seemed to help but when you're fighting in a hallway and you're enemy just walks in front and their MUZZLE FLASH droped you to 30 fps from 144fps for seemingly no reason you'd be upset too.All those things aside the game is heading a much better direction than when i first played. I can actually play for one... I win games now. I've met some pretty decent duo partners.I defintely recommend this game if you like shooters if you dont mind a learning curve or dying a lot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also recently it looks like everyone is comenting on how bad the event pass is. Sure it might not have been such a good idea but let's not forget that unlike other games (yeah I'm talking about Fortnite) PUBG used to solely rely on profit from selling the game itself and from skin crates and other cosmetic items trade. Fortnite on the other hand has a greater playerbase sells event passes skins and all kinds of cosmetics which don't even have a counterpart in PUBG and has been doing so for a long time.

2018-02-07,0,0,737,False,Recommended,There are so many people that are not recommending this game just because of Chinese hackers. Sure it's definitely a problem but they are already developing a new anti cheat that has banned 1 million cheaters. The problem is going away.Anyways I think the gameplay is incredible. There are so many intense heart pounding moments. It's also a great game to play with your friends becuase you learn to communicate and adapt to the game. There's always that one game that just makes you feel so good inside and some games you want to throw your computer across the room. That happens along with pretty much every other competitive game. The devs have also optimized this game so much since it first came out in early access. They are also really taking their time on new features and things in the game to make sure they can get the quality you would want.Desync is also a pretty big problem and im not sure what they can do to fix it. But I don't think one or two flaws is enough to not recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,275,False,Recommended,95% of people are overly hypocritical of this game. Yes it has its problems but they are getting better. Most of the people who don t recommend this game all have 300+ hours. If a game is bad enough to where you don t think people should buy it why do you continue to play it?This is an advanced skill based game. Progress comes with time and the more you play the better you get at hitting the longer running shots. It takes longer to master unlike fortnite but the reward in the end is loads more fun. There are a few hackers here and there but the death cam makes it easier to sort them out as well as helps you learn from your mistakes. The game is always improving and the players are getting better.Love this gane to death and highly recommend it to everybody who enjoys open world shooters or exploring games,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I like the 'clunky' feeling the occasional person complains about because it's not CoD/Overwatch smooth and twitchy. It takes aim and recoil management.There are occasional bugs of course in 24 hours I've had 4 or so server drops.

I have a fairly basic rig as far as PC's go and I can run at 1080p on low settings around 80fps this is decent but when better optimised i believe il get the same fps on medium settings.Micro transactions yes they are just money grabbing. But if you don't like it don't buy it! You will get 0 advantages ingame if you have a rare frickin shirt. People should chill.

2017-04-25,1,1,54,True,Recommended,solos are 100% pointless. everything is RNG cheese and everything is laggy. for some reason only the solos suffer from this crazy lag. 2 out of 5 of your shots will never hit due to this lag. adding to the RNG fest. i raged supper hard almost every solo because of it. but on the bright side this game has teams. team games are the best. it is way less laggy in team games and you will only lose 1 out of 10 of your shots to lag. the tactical plays that team games have are very enjoyable. this game is a 6/10 for me it would be a 9/10 if it wasnt for server isues and the crap fest that is solo. ps i the way cars work is very odd and stupid in my opinion. for example jumping off tall things rarely does damage like in other games and feels very good yet steping out of your car at 4 mph will almost kill you. plus they flip on everything.i do recommend this game but only for the team matches if you pick up the game i strongly sugest you stay away from solo and stay away from cars.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The dev is a pr nightmare.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-12,0,0,40,True,Not Recommended,I have super mixed feelings about this game. On one hand it is a very fun very tense battle of survival that is great when it gets down to the last few. Just hiding on a hill waiting for people to duke it out is still as exciting as going in with your whole squad and whiping out a team of three. I love the tense fights where action could happen out of nowhere. The map is fun to explore and there is plenty of fun places to check out. The devs are optimizing well. I used to not be able to run this very well but now I can run it pretty smoothly with a few updates. So now even a few potatos can run this which is nice.On the other hand it's buggy and experiences a lot of what other Early Access titles have. Just go in expecting that. The player base is toxic as hell. Don't try to solo. Don't try to join a duo with strangers. Don't try to squad alone. It's horrible and most people don't speak your language. You might meet a nice kid or two or a cool person willing to grind with you but most often than not you get some person that doesn't know your language and they ruin your fun.It's fun. It's fun and challenging and getting that Chicken Dinner is really rewarding after slogging through a half an hour of tense gunfights. But the playerbase is horrible it's a little buggy (to be expected of course) and now the devs are dropping microtransactions on us.I'm really stuck between really loving it and really hating it and most of the time I'm really hating it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,1,3,232,True,Not Recommended,The game is fun if you dont take it too seriously. Creator constantly goes against what he promises or indicates IE not finishing PC early access b4 paid crate launch and announcing work on console edition b4 PC finish. The game can be summed up with accuracy being random selection from an array (even your first stabilized shot prone). which means every shot you fire is subjected to lots of RNG. No I don't mean sway or recoil from firing I mean RNG on the 1st shot. This occurs even at small distances of 100m which is unbelievable considering that is not a far distance for a AR or sniper rifle to fire. Little Recoil during jumping. Zero bullet penetration through most types of material(save doors and windows windows being far from perfect). It encounters a lot of problems when you are overlooking ledges trying to shoot often times your view will be unobstructed( in 1st person and 3rd) but you will still hit a railing or something dumb. Prone is very difficult to pull off near objects or on even slightly uneven terrain as the games collision detection is bad. There is minimal flinch on hit making an encounter progress in the fashion of targets spraying each other down with little regard to cover. There is no slow on hit(temporary or otherwise). Be prepared to shoot some one in the chest 3 5 times and then waste the rest of your clip to confirm the kill as they wriggle on the ground. As of a recent patch an AWP chestshot would not be a 1 hit kill (against targets wearing lvl 2 armor) and this gun is only and rarely obtained in dropped high tier loot crates. You can melee in the game and the damage has been tuned better but do not count on killing a target that is downed with melee as in 1st person or 3rd the accuracy is hot garbage at best. Most of the game revolves around a gimmick of the week or patch. First it was shotguns then it was the vector then the UMP. I imagine the game prolly is worse off for not being on arma but now has a wider appeal with its coding 33 tick servers and now is running on Unreal Engine (yay a small positive).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-16,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,While I have not personally suffered the developers of this game seem way too ban happy. If a squad member starts killing you and your squad you have to sit back and watch or get banned. Did you honk your car horn near a streamer? Yeah you're banned. This is a combat simulator. Toughen up fruitcake.Additionally we have been informed that weekly and monthly updates are no longer a thing.

2017-04-24,0,0,1137,True,Recommended,i have never gotten a game to 100h so fast in my life. Best game i have ever played I have a good PC so performance is not an issue for me i crash sometimes mostly when my friend throws a stun at me... I have bought this game for 5 of my friends and i will 100% buy this game for consoles later. It has realistic gunplay and good looking graphics many guns and attatchments. And is overall an awesome intense frustrating battle royale game definetly the best of it's genre. i don't recommend buying this game if you don't have a semi high end PC. solos can get boring real quick imo duos and squads are really fun though and if you do not have anyone to play with you can still search duos and squads and get teammates maybe make new friends or maybe new enemies i have found really cool people when being matched with randoms but i have also found some jerks. I would definetly say that this game is worth the 29 99 price tag.The game does not come without flaws though. I used to feel like every update improved the game performance wise but not so much content wise. Now i feel like it is the opposite of that but same amount of content less performance. The early game lag got better at one point but then with the Mini14 monthly update it got worse i got less FPS and more lag i sometimes tend to lag out of my cover leaving me exposed which is very frustrating. When this game is fully released it will probably be the best game ever imo but in it's current state i would give it a 7.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Played it now after 4 months pause and the performance and desync is currently even worse than before when 1.0 was released. For me this is unplayable seeing my shots hit like 10 times but after watching the death cam of the enemy only 1 or 2 registered. You can see this also when you watch streams on twitch by people who get paid for it and have super highend computers. They complain all the time how this game is but they keep playing because they have stream snipers and therefore much more kills and action than regular players.I have a GTX 1070 16 GB DDR4 and i7 6700K. Most of the time i have almost 100 fps but in fights and some areas on the maps it feels like 20 30 fps.

2018-06-22,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,I started playing this game around June of '17 which is a year to the month of this review. I enjoyed it at first and the gameplay was exhilarating despite the few bugs but I knew those were just the caveat of an early access game with a moderately small dev team and let it slide. However after about 6 months of this game not getting any real improvements began my gradual decline in enjoyment. Come January the game still has terrible game breaking physics glitches that get me killed every few games. Incorrect bullet registers lack of variety and still no significant patches. I decided to bury the game officially just a month or so ago and uninstalled it for the foreseeable future due not only to my loss of hope that it will be fixed but my realization that it most likely won't be fixed. Now that they've added paid DLC map and Event Pass it's become obvious that they're just going to try and ride the money wave off and cash out however they can. Goodbye PUBG it was nice while it was still in the early stages.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The only reason why you should be playing this game is with your friends thanks to the rather unfinished content and rather bland gameplay. However why the hell would you play this game to do that? Talk with them in real life walk with them or something. If you're dead set on computer games say you've got a friend from halfway across the world I bloody bet that a blithering free game can just as well do a similar or even better job than PUBG at providing a good experience for you and your friends. I hated getting dragged into PUBG with some of my lads 'cause the game sucks in my opinion. The map is not at all interesting and have I told you that the gameplay is just as dull? There's no substance to it. Loot shoot loot shoot until you die! It might as well be a Mass Murder Simulator 2017!Also they're not even finished with the bugs and the shady stream sniping banning business and yet they want to port to console... and they want to screw another company over because that company simply replicated the gamemode?

On top of this updates are pushed out into the game that dont work even though they have a test server that people use that would discover these problems and the few updates that do work on release annoy the loud part of the community who then complain and get them removed (examples Weather conditions and Blue zone changes).All in all I still like this game and I will still play it even though I ask why after every game I play even the ones I win.

The devs said that they will be releasing updates monthly to the game. I would also like to mention that there is an actual bullet drop system crazy right? Another aspect i like about this game is the fact that there's an actual learning curve learning how to use the weapons correctly with the zeroing system and being able to become more fluid with the controls in the game to benefit you.

2017-08-12,0,0,399,False,Not Recommended,The game was good extremely enjoyable even but then they absolutely broke the game.Before the microtranscation patch the game in my experience ran flawlessly and I had a great time. In fact I enjoyed it soo much to the point where I sank 90 hours into the game. Then the patch came...Not only has this patch shown that the developers can not make a promise (no paid micro's during EA) it also completely destroyed the stability of the game. As evident for many users constant game breaking freezes and buildings not rendering for certain people completely make the game unplayable in many situations especially since these issues occur extremely often in around 50% of the games I play now. Somehow due to a recent mini patch these freezes have been able to blue screen me something which has not happened for years. Keep in mind that PlayerUnknown himself is making questionable decisions and that the dev's believe that stream sniping deserves bans (it does not as the streamers can fix it themselves). Absolutely disgusting. I will still play the game as I love it but the dev's have become untrustworthy.1.0 Update 300 hours in (Edit on24/12/17)What a dissapointment this was. I have been playing on the PTR (PTS etc) since it came out and I can happily say that the really important problems have not been fixed. Easily the biggest issue is the severe rubber banding that still occurs in every single match I play varying from severe to barely noticable (usually severe). This affects the early gunplay massively as everyone is teleporting around plus it becomes really difficult to loot on a map that is scarce with loot in the large buildings. Additionally your early game foes may not be experiencing the rubber banding absolutely spelling your doom when they find you. In fact this problem has made me begin to despise playing this game as most games cause me to die not from a lack of skill or mistake but the network just ramming me more than the other guy 3 metres in front of me. Furthermore I have begun to hate the new map as they decided to prioritise it to a stupid ratio so its always the new map compared to keeping it balanced with Erangel. How could I possibly enjoy the new map when every experience is downright trash and the good moments only happen when the lag stops? I feel as if this really ruins all of the great things that they added with this release such as the new UI Sounds Replay System Guns and Improved Framerate. The fact that they released the game and didn't fix the rubber banding ed audio (red zone) and directional sound despite the fact that it was in the ptr is just a spit in the face.Edit They seem to be finally addressing the lag.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They are implementing microtransactions in a game that costs 30 dollars upfront. There is rumors about a ""premium pass"" which is basically a battle pass and that was the last straw for me. Another big downfall is the custom servers we were promised that they would become public later on and recently there has been discussion about putting them behind a paywall. PUBG has become a game full of empty promises and run by devs who have stopped caring about there player base and only focus on trying to even shine a light at fortnite.

2017-10-15,0,0,140,True,Not Recommended,This game might be the most frustrating game I have played and very overrated. Here are some reasons why 1. I suck at the game. This might be one of the biggest reason why this game has been so bad for me. I agreed that if I can play like twitch players this game can be very satisfying to play with. But unfortunately with some level of previous FPS game experience like Cod Battlefield and some causal CSGO I am not good enough to enjoy the game. And that should be fine as long as I can improve and get better. But the learning curve for this game is insane. I have played games that are noobie unfriendly but I have never seen a game that is this punishing for new people. Here are some reasons . There is no matching system. You get into games with people who have played this game for months and maybe with good passive FPS experience.. This game has 0 tutorial it teaches you nothing and everything you learn are from dying and dying. Even the basic aren t so obvious to the new people such as you can t jump out of a car and start shooting right away like what bullet goes to which guns what equipment does what. The game expected you to just somehow know these. Once you have past the basic now you get to the point where there is hidden tricks that impacts the game so much but you never get to learn such as how you should Tap pick everything instead of using the suggested F such as how to drop to ground faster (which I still don t know but you know there is a way because everyone is so much faster than you) how you are not suppose to use the strafe or hold to aim because they are literally useless or how to jump out of windows. Until to this point your games will be miserable and the only participation you have is feed other people like a dummy. I don t understand why this game has to have hidden tricks to level the skill cap like how am I suppose to know to bind my keyboard so I can jump out window how am I suppose to know you can tap W to fly further??? And these details fkin change the game so much that if you don know them you are so done. 2. The battle royale game mode. This game mode is new to me and I feel addicted to this game but it has so many things that nobody speaks of. First you rarely win. If you are an average player you rarely win game. Imagine a game where you win less than 2% of the total game you played (or even worse if you never played FPS before) This is bad but acceptable as long as I can have fun the win doesn t matter. BUT NO out of 98% games you played there is little fun in them. You either spent 20mins to loot and start to do the circle and died without knowing what hits you or you dropped to the popular area and see people who knows the little trick pick faster and drop fast manage to kill an unarmed you. It is either one or another. And I guarantee they aren t fun and very very frustrating. If I play a MOBA or CSGO I know what happened what went wrong and I spent less time get to that point. But this game just punishes you so hard that don t feel like you are learning anything.3. The optimization of this game. This game is poorly optimized that means your computer probably can t run this game smoothly. People with 1080 plays this game in Very Low Setting just so they can have an edge In the FPS. When you are playing with 40 50 FPS you are at a huge disadvantage. I was actually so into this game so I upgraded my PC with a lot of money but in the end this game doesn t deserves.In the end I wouldn t suggest you to not buy this game but if you buy and you are new to this genre expect the following 1. Spent a lot of times exploring the game and get killed countless time before you understand the basic and maybe hidden tricks of this game from youtube.2. Expect to face dilemma which you either face the enemy right away in an unfair fight and die super fast because people drop so much faster and pick things so much faster than you. Or spent times looting places and get killed 20mins later and give everything you looted to other players. Which one ever is more fun for you I usually switch back and forth and close the game in the end wanting to smash something.3. Play with lag. Either the FPS or the Ping that you don t even know of. Sometimes I have to think about why am I playing games. Games suppose to be fun. This is definitely not one of these game. You can get good and rekt other people with enough effort but the road to that point takes more than enduring.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-12,0,0,215,True,Recommended,So to be honest I never really thought I would write a review for this game. But I feel like people hate on this game currently too much. I'm not denying this game has it's flaws but I seriously don't think this game is bad after all.Let's start with the negatives At the moment the game has hard FPS drops. No matter what you have as a graphics card CPU nor any amount of RAM will save you from them. On my medium gaming rig it's ranging from 50 140 FPS. Most of the time during the game it is at 100 140 FPS currently. With weather effects like Rain or Fog that are implemented it can be between 90 120 FPS while at the start of the rounds it mostly is around 50 FPS but after you drop it's mostly no issue at all. I'm playing in 1920 * 1080 resolution with graphics mostly set to medium except for Terrain Distance which is on Ultra for obvious reasons.The UI bugs out quite often. I think about 20% of the time you have to reload it over and over and over again to be able to just start a game. Currently the UI also has the bug that when you're playing Solo it automatically assigns you to an Asian Server for some reason which I find really annoying. It's just a hassle to reconfigure it although it's not hard to do.The banning system of PUBG is somewhat questionable. I heard that some people got banned for stream sniping while others were banned for teamkilling a teamkiller. While the first one is a dickmove they have since stated they reconsider how to proceed with that stuff. However I was never banned for that and I feel the majority of players didn't as well. The second one is an easy thing to circumvent Just don't do it or just play with friends. I know I only play in Squads / Duos with people I know. Otherwise the Single mode is also available.There is also a problem with the game having some questionable choices in the Arena you're playing in. Sometimes it's not clear from where you can really shoot your weapon without shooting a wall / rock / window board or something else in front of you. It happened multiple times to me that I suddenly shot something in front of me I wasn't aware of since I was completely unable to tell there was something obstructing the guns barrel. Those weird design choices are also reflected in the windows of buildings where you can see bars obstructing your view whether you're standing crouching or lying flat on the floor while anyone who sees you standing at the window from the outside can shoot you easily through the gaps. Also those obstructions are unbreakable. It's also rather annoying trying to shoot someone through the staircase railing when you're fighting inside the house. It can happen that you can't hit anything through those gaps while the enemy is perfectly capable to do so. I had it once that I couldn't shoot an enemy with 40 rounds.Sometimes this can also happen in an open field where you empty a whole magazine into an enemy and he doesn't fall over while he just one shots you. Even though you got hitmarkers all over the place for him you sometimes don't hit for whatever reason. The shotguns are currently way to OP capable of killing you as a fully T2 equipped enemy with full health in one shot on a distance of 20 meters and the bullet time is currently non existent. If you shoot an enemy and he shoots you at the same time and you drop first your bullets seem to disappear not hitting the target for some reason.Now you may ask yourself why this review is still recommending this game? It's because that the game is awesome even with those flaws that sometimes make me rage as I can't say this game is bad. Here are just some of the positive things I can say about this game The multiplayer Map is huge and even though you can run around not seeing anyone for 20 minutes straight you're still at the edge of your seat because at some point you will stumble over someone. Whether right at the start in the middle of the game or at the very end. The game makes you feel like you're literally in a warzone right now and one misstep can lead to your demise. In that regard it is also extremely unforgiving which makes it only more exciting. You don't want to lose your loot you scrounged up earlier in the game so you take fewer risks? Or do you want to have some fun and actively seek out fights to risk your own loot but get the option of gaining even more? Always a tough decision to make.Although it literally doesn't make any sense the reduction of the playable area in intervals is making those rounds really interesting. You find yourself on a large scale map where the playable area gets smaller and smaller and smaller. Forcing you to make a move on your enemies and pulling all the players closer to each other. Here it is also a tactical decision you have to make each time you find yourself in a different terrain. Seek out cover and take the slower route? Go over the field and risk getting spotted by your enemies? Stay outside a little and risk low health before encountering an enemy?The weapons in the game handle mostly really well. With the exception for the shotgun which is ridiculously overpowered at the moment. Otherwise all the other weapons seem pretty good to me as they are. Even though I can't recommend the SKS or VSS for personal reasons. In the hands of others they might be useful but I hate those things.The mix of seeking out a droppoint at the start of the game is a tactical decision as well. Places where there is more potential loot more people will drop leading to fights early on for supplies. But dropping somewhere where almost nothing is is making it easier to concentrate on looting alone but you possibly won't have the stuff you need to survive later down the road if you're not really lucky or find more unlooted places along your way.Looting at the beginning is also a great way to ensure some sort of fairness although the Loot Map is currently a bit weird. Sometimes you can find thousands of weapons in one corner of a house while all other houses are empty and sometimes you can't find a weapon for the life of you while the game is drowning you in weapon attachments. Still overall this ensures a certain fairness so that even players that come later into the game have a fair fighting chance instead of you leveling up and unlocking more weapons as you go so you can just choose them at the beginning of the game like other shooters do.The games driving mechanics were a bit clunky at first when I started this game but over time it has certainly improved. Currently the driving mechanics handle rather well and the cars actually behave like they're supposed to most of the time with a few rare over the top exceptions.And now to the last point. Improvements. Even though many gloss over that point and say there is nothing being done to make this game even better the developers are constantly adding stuff to the game. For example the VSS and Mini14 weren't in the game when I bought it. Back then the game was also really poorly optimized so I had FPS of about 40 FPS on average. Now I don't even have to fear drops of that number since I usually get over 100 leaving me with at least 60 most of the time. The developers are also clearly listening to their community and keep in touch even though it broke 15 million sales since they have introduced the First Person Mode after public demand. You still can choose third person mode if you like it better as well. They also added fog to the game which gives it sometimes an even more ominous touch and it makes fun to play in. As far as I know they're even working on different daytimes. They're also adding more to the current map they have outside putting more lootlocations into it so players have more choices. In the future they're also adding an entirely new map with dust storms which will make it only more incredible.So I hope you found this helpful. Since Steam won't let me write more ...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-25,0,0,161,True,Recommended,I have played H1Z1 and similar games. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a game with a lot of similarities with H1Z1 king of the kill but it is better in most ways.PUBG is a game where you can play solo duo og 3 5man squads you and 99 other players can parachute down from an airplane that crosses the large map when the game starts. Depending on where you chose to land you may have a lot of time to gather weapons armor and equipment before heading into the safe zone or you may have to engage in close quarter shooting shortly after landing if you chose one of the popular landing spots.PUBG is still in early access but is well balanced and well polished it runs well (apart from rare server lags (short durations) and the occasional bug. The gameplay is solid and the replayability is very good even though the map is the same no game is ever the same.Shortly after you land you are notified of a safe zone which appears on your map this safe zone will shrink as time goes by and anyone left outside will slowly lose health until they die this ensures that the game zone gets smaller as there are fewer players remaining and by doing so keeping the game exciting and challenging.Game 9/10 (very good game with well made mechanics)Content 7/10 (still early access there are a lot of guns ingame and a lot of possibilities but more are added every patch)Community 4/10 (there are not many ways to socialize if you play this game alone you will be shot at on sight ingame and the waiting time for the game to start is too low to socialize. A teamfinder tool could help solo players team up but does not exist atm.)Price 7/10 (the game is not cheap but imho it is easily worth the price. if you find this on sale i can see no reason not to buy it. if you think this game is for you and you are considering buying it all full price it is still a good buy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-12,2,1,93,True,Recommended,EARLY ACCESS REVIEW 13/6/2017A really ambitious design and idea but weak in cementing a demanding idea. King of the Hill game survive the Battle to be the King or Win with your team (random or your friends).Some servers have very weak connection synchronisation but some servers are very good. Overall its not smooth but its manageable in my opinion and players who are excited and thrilled to play this game because of its central entertainment objective please do not hesitate to try it out.For the feint of heart refrain from trying you will only suffucate in your own anger.TL DR King of the Hill servers have less than mediocre performance. Just a game roaming around and fighting against other players in a free for all or free for all with some exceptions to people teaming up in pairs or squads from the start.I'm not going to spoil the game for you try it yourself and only for those who know what King of the Hill means. http //steamcommunity.com/app/578080,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-15,0,0,41,False,Not Recommended,"This game is fun for the first few hours of it and honestly I am going to keep playing because its fun with friends but there are so many things that make the game complete trash.For starters there are micro transactions that prevent you from opening crates that you purchase with ingame currency. So not only do you have to work to get these crates you have to pay real world money for a ""key"" to open them.Another problem is that the way the maps and the games are designed the people who win 80% of the time are the ones who just sit in a house sniping people the entire game. Not my idea of fun.Also the weapon distribution is nothing short of broken. In some houses there will be terrific weapons while others nothing at all. So you get completely destroyed if you get the later house. Not based on actual skill but shear luck.This game needs some major work done to it.

2017-04-24,0,0,35,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS Has hands down beaten H1Z1 at being H1Z1 Pros Many weapons. Many vehicles. A huge map that is unique. Good weapon mechanics especially for an early access game. Its already massive fanbase. Unique concepts such as choosing where to land instead of it being random. Gun attachments are amazing. Nice graphics. Cons Very poor optimisation myself with a rather decent PC is getting terrible framerate even at Very Low and for the most part everyone I know who has $1000+ PCs are running at Very Low. Rain. Just destroys your PC. Server issues there are quite a few lag spikes that make the game unplayable at times. From what I have seen it is a tactical advantage to use low settings as most foliage is not visable and players stand out more. Pistols are so underpowered there is no use for them as a side arm unless you cannot find anything else. A rather ugly main menu. Lackluster character customisation. As it stands I give PUBG a solid 8/10 it has made me never touch H1Z1 again. I look forward to the continued development of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,805,True,Recommended,This game doesn't deserve anywhere near the bad reviews it is getting.IT'S CALLED EARLY ACCESS FOR A REASON. THE GAME ISN'T DONE. YOU WERE WARNED.Personally I've experienced server downtime lag when joining games and diconnections. But you know what? The game is ing fun. The game is hard you can't expect to win even 5% of games just by being around average. But I can't tell you how truly SATISFYING it is when you and your teammates kill the last enemy spraying bullets in every direction but his until you get that one last hit and are awarded the CHICKEN DINNER!!! There is a reason this game has so many concurrent players and it isn't because of the bots going for loot boxes. They wouldn't be valuable if the game weren't amazing already. This game is totally worth more to me than $30 Hell I enjoy it more than any $60 Steam game I've bought.Yeah there are issues but you can see the improvements Bluehole has made. I don't stutter or lag anymore when parachuting and landing. I NEVER get disconnected anymore as long as I'm on a NA server. The game updates such as bulletproof pans motorcycles and my favorite the Mini 14 have all added little quirks and new strats that make the game all more enjoyable. People think Bluehole making a surprise succes will somehow translate into instant improvements on all bad aspects of the game but they're wrong. Hiring 100 more devs into this little Korean company won't instantly magically mean they know how to fix all the bugs or have new ideas to implement into the game well. And we've all seen how fickle gamers can be when an update is added that they don't like. If you bought this game knowing it was in EARLY ACCESS and think you're getting ripped off you're an idiot.Buy this game so I have more fodder to practice my aim on. &gt )EDIT I do have one complaint still. Render distance for things like fauna and structures shouldn't change based on graphic settings since it is a competitive game. I wish I could play on full graphics without being at a serious disadvantage in terms of sight lines.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-24,0,0,824,True,Not Recommended,"Performance is abysmal even after optimising in game settings and adding launch strings.Server side lag and desynch is appalling.The client is absolutely awful ridden with bugs and will randomly dump you to desktop at regular intervals (even though windows key / alt tabbing are disabled).In game UI is terrible with the worst problems being getting stuck in inventory and clicks being 100 200 pixels to the left of where you actually have the cursor.Hit detection is poor and line of sight appears very buggy / rudimentary.There seems to be no compensation for the appalling netcode / server side lag when driving vehicles. If you are travelling at any speed and it resynchs the result most of the time is that the game goes to you laying face down on the ground dead with the text ""you have fallen"". Becoming airborne even with perfect synch is either a death sentence or instant wreck.There's also the issue of bringing the vehicle to a COMPLETE stop or even rolling back very slightly but then realising that the server was lagging and being presented with a screen showing your body 10 20 metres behind where you thought you were the vehicle smoking against a tree and the text ""you ran yourself over"". On the other hand occasionally you'll crash or jump out at full speed and sustain no damage whatsoever. There's no consistency.This said as a squad based game there is some potential and fun to be had.As a single player game especially with the terrible server lag and extremely poor directional audio (the worst of any similar game I can remember) it's entirely geared towards camping ... which is incredibly dull and against the spirit of the game.On this note there needs to be an option for randoms to queue up for duo / squad.Avoid at all costs for now. Re evalute in 6 months.People continue to criticise DayZ (rightly) and refuse to play it due to ongoing issues ... but its issues are absolutely nothing compared with what Battlegrounds currently faces and in a massively simpler game using an immensely easier engine to work with.Whether it lives up to any of its potential remains to be seen.

2017-08-24,0,0,168,True,Recommended,"What a game this is. For only coming out in March and being an ""early access"" game it sure has taken off. So far selling 8million copies which is quite crazy. Though when some people look at this and see that it is an early access game they might be turned away because many of us know what happens to many early access games. They never get finished. Anyways the look at this game seem to be quite promising. The developer is constantly working on the game updating it and fixing bugs to make it a better experience. Even though this may seem like a game that is already out there (like H1Z1 KOTH) this is different and offers a more fair and oddly simple/complex gameplay. Anyone can jump in and learn to play. The game teaches you how to play you die you play again you then learn that you must not die. Very simple idea complex on how you play it and what you make it. Here are some of the pro's and con's I have with the game.Pro's Easy to jump in and play Fun to play with a group Well BuiltCon's Controls can be a little odd Optimization is poor right now (obviously it's EA so it will be fixed and i'm not too worried about it)Not too much to complain about as it's a work ijn progress but i'm thrilled to see where this game is going.

2018-12-28,0,0,221,False,Recommended,"Sonic 3D Blast also known as Sonic 3D Flickies' Island in Europe is isometric take on a mix of Sonic platforming serving as a spinoff to the franchise and Flicky collecting'n'leading hot action. It was developed by Travellers Tales and Sonic Team former doing main programmer job while latter came with game design ideas and some more. Well they did want Sonic 3 to be isometric to begin with. Also riding on whole pre rendered trend that went hip with Donkey Kong Country. Published by Sega in 1996 in the West only. 32 Megabit ROM the biggest that Sega Genesis can see at a single time.There also were Saturn and PC versions made near the end of development of this supposed Genesis swan song replacing the cancelled Sonic X Treme. Saturn had improved graphics redbook soundtrack different actual 3D special stages analog input. It's technically the best version. PC version was similar but lacked few graphics and had 2D parody of special stages yet had autosave feature.Sonic Blast on Game Gear is a different game despite fitting in marketing wise.The game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.I don't usually talk about mods but Director's Cut exists and it was made by game's main programmer so it's sorta semi official. None the less back to what Sega gives us there.Now technical part about Sega's emulation here The Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for ""Sega Mega Drive &amp Genesis Classics"" game that should appear in your library.It has Bedroom HUB which is the one with many features yet lags for many and Simply Launcher which lacks Workshop and Online but at least it works just fine for everybody.However Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time!Emulation itself mostly sound isn't that good but it does it's job. Also yes emulator supports quick saves.As alternative you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in ""uncompressed ROMs"" folder that program itself doesn't use just change file extension to "".bin"" or so. The file for this one being ""SONIC3D_UE.68K"".I also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. You can find it here on store page or go to ""manuals"" folder of game root and open ""S3DB_MG_EFIGS_US.pdf"".Robotnik has discovered that Flickies on Flickies's Island can actually travel between dimensions by using huge rings. So he trapped them all in Badnik robots to search for Chaos Emeralds. These robots aren't any different no dimension travel there. Sonic is back here and ready to save em all while his two gang members chill around.The core gameplay keeps the Sonic formula going. You can run around and you can jump. Seeing how it's isometric it has a separate button that you can roll with. Or spindash if standing still. You still defeating enemies by either jumping or rolling. Albeit using slopes by rolling doesn't play a big role here at all these are weak slopes. The controls have some inertia to it pleasently. Too bad Sonic can't immediately turn 180 degrees around he does a small circle. Still uses rings health system where as long as you have any rings you will survive a hit but then you have to recover all the scattered rings.It's a rather forgiving pleasant take on isometric style. You can run in all 8 directions. It hides nothing important behind walls. There are shadows for everything. The floor always has checkered tiles so you can measure borders are clearly defined. While Sonic is a bit too fast the game doesn't require much precision platforming. Well there are few but you can cheese most of them by using nearby spring pad or so. The levels are varied as well some having sorta puzzle elements. Spinning pads are great on the second zone.Protip You can break ice spikes in Diamond Dust by rolling into them.Powerups are back through breakable monitors. Invincibility extra life speed up so on. By the way Sonic icons that aren't in monitors aren't extra lives by medals. Collect 10 of them and you will get a continue. There are shields each giving you extra hit against normal stuff. Blue one is immune electricity red shields protects from fire golden one gives you active ability where you do Protip Get a red shield in a Volcano Valley or die.Each zone has two acts along with a boss one. The first two acts are divided into two three stages. And in each stage you have to save five flickies. That means there are only five badniks in a stage and most of them are static non threats. Not too exciting. At least game somewhat makes up with stage hazards. But the game is still too easy. Then you break those robots and have to grab birds. This is where Flicky inspiration comes in. The birds will follow you in a line and they can be broken off with projectiles after which they scatter around. It worked in Flicky which was a tight 2D game where you constantly get chased by cats you would die if they touch you and simply scatted lines of flickies if they touch those. With risk reward applied as you got score by bringing in bigger lines and that would lead to getting extra lives in a tough game. Here? Not a tight design it's just there. Projectiles may throw birds off but that just happens not something you pay attention to. Collecting birds over lava is pain. There is too much space nothing chasing you. Yea. It's just there just making you spend a bit more time in levels and thus isn't exciting.There is usual optional quest for 7 Chaos Emeralds. Actually they look like Halls candies which would explain why Sonic can't turn into Super Sonic. Super makes games too easy anyway. You do get an extra final boss and good ending however that's good. To get an emerald you must find Tails or Knuckles first just chilling. Both of them appear in each act hiding or appearing somewhere in previous stage once you progress feel free to backtrack. Last appearing in Volcano Valley. It does mean you can get two emeralds per act one from each. You get extra life on repeat. Just give these fams 50 rings. Though they will take and store any amount so don't bump into them.After that you get into a special stage. You run over bridge collect rings and avoid bombs. It looks incredibly smooth the best on Mega Drive. Albeit gameplay is a bit plain and is too easy. Still fun.There are usual bosses. Robotnik every time. Most often you just wait for him to get down and hit him then avoid his stuff repeat. Varied health. Not bad but not too cool.Protip For Volcano Valley boss instead of trying to get into pipes first you should curve your jump off side floor to hit Robotnik then you will be bounced backward onto pipes.Not much options. Just sound test and controls. Bare minimum!As for graphics. Well. They tried to do DKC thing with prerendered sprites because it was still cool albeit 1996 was somewhat late. Which isn't the smartest thing to do on Genesis as compared to SNES it has low amount of colors. Still devs deserve some love for managing to create smooth vibrant world. And fitting intro FMV into Genesis cartridge is just awesome. Too bad that ending is just a bunch of images with text.Music is great too. Chiptune goodness the best from few composers on the project.Overall eh. Mixing Flicky and Sonic is a nice idea as evidenced by game like Wiz'n'Liz albeit that one was only somewhat Flicky. But this isometric execution of it is weak. I still wouldn't call it a bad game. Pick only if you want some chill isometric platformer.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-06,0,0,385,True,Not Recommended,Similar to what other people said this is a great game with great potential. However the devs decided to add microtransactions instead of adding content. This game is in Alpha and although updates used to be full of content the last one did nothing except make the servers WORSE and add crates and keys that can be bought similar to CS GO. I reccommend holding off on this game until the devs decide to give us what we paid for.. A finished game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-16,2,2,202,True,Not Recommended,This game will give u the aids of a somalian pirate by the amount of cancerous bugs in this game that will crash ur pc 11/10 times. even with game lauchers that optimize your pc performance ie razer cortex the game still crashes ATLEAST 1 time a play sesh. The only reason to play this is to get a win and once u get that there is no point to play this piece of bug riddled game. And it may be one of the worst optimized games i have ever played i get about 50fps in this piece of looking game on very low settings and on destiny 2 on all high settings i get a smooth 90+ fps and thats just the ing beta do your self a favor and dont buy pubg save for another game try refunding if u can. 0/10 would uninstall again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-09,2,1,1231,False,Not Recommended,This game is hot garbage and will be milked until dead. Once someone comes out with a BR that isn't cartoony bs and they pull it off right (looking at you Battlefield 5) this game is toast.Some of issues that are still plaguing this game as of this review Bullets do not connect with target instead they pass through and hit behind them. lag/ping/network code is garbage adn you'll be killed when you think you made it behind cover becuase on the enemies screen you are still visible. Terrain is screwed up and you can get stuck easily with no way to escape other than killing yourself and either losing the round or hurting your team. vehicles are hot steaming piles of trash. they randomly explode fall through the map flip fly away or get stuck on the smallest pebble. You also take damage touching a vehicle if it is moving even 0.01 km/h regulalry knocking you or killing you. Animations hang or don't play at all often leaving you reloading over and over while the enemy is shooting you. Sometimes you can jump off a four story and take no damage then slide down a four foot hill and die. Player LODs are broken so often when you think you see the player peeking you really don't or they can see you and shoot you but the LOD model isn't visibleat all.Some clarity on some stuff Hacking is still present and prevelant. Less so in FPP than TPP but still there and it's really poisoning the game. * The two main hacks I've run across most in this game are Radar hacks and recoil controller. These make it so that the only way you're going to kill the enemy is that you snipe them from an unknown location and kill them before they see you. Starting a match in a location somewhere that has a lot of people and encountering someone with either of the hacks means you are at such a disadvantage that you might as well cram your kb/m up your a$$ and hope it doesn't comeback out ever so that you're not tempted to ever play this again. The game itself is broken apart from gameplay. Menus don't work the game disconnects constantly or doesn't allow you to connect with your teammates. TOXIC AF,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Before I bought the game I saw alot of stories (even widely known news articles) about the devs banning whoever the streamers want them to ban. A streamer gets rekt by another player 1v1? They cry to the devs and the devs permanently ban the player that killed them. Other than that when playing it I just can't understand why someone would say it's fun it takes a good 5+ minutes to get to the ground after trying to start a match and when you get there you're instantly killed by another player that already has a gun somehow.

2017-05-05,0,0,193,True,Not Recommended,This game has good potential but it is full of flaws. Starting with technical issues like superloud sounds from gunshot really bad optimization server lags hackers etc. This game is all about looting good items to equip yourself for battle but even with a lvl. 3 helmet a single headshot will kill you. Many a times you have absolutely no idea where the shots come from and the sound is not really telling you either. Pretty much every game so far has been me looting for 30 minutes moving from point to point till eventually I get shot from someone camping in a building or a bush.It also takes very few hit to take someone down even if they have full armor on. Which is complete t if you ask me whats the point of this armor anyway if it doesn't do anything. Maybe I will check back in a few weeks to see if anything has changed if not I am not playing this game anymore.OOH AND IT'S FULL OF HACKERS! !!!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game was really fun until it was opened up in China now the servers are absolutely flooded by hackers. When someone can shoot at their feet and kill your entire team of 4 located on the other side of a hill you have to warn others DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The Developer of this game really needs to listen to the community and region block China until they get a handle on the cheats. Then open it up again. If you lose control of the cheating block China again. Simple enough. However they have my money and don't care. So until you read they have blocked China keep your money and spend it elsewhere.

2018-01-20,0,0,87,False,Recommended,"I never really write reviews but I thought i'd voice my opinions.I feel like a lot of the criticisms on this game are unfair.It may just be me getting lucky but I've never really encountered a lot of hackers in my games.I think people who complain about lag should stop it (usually) isn't the games fault and for me I get more timeouts in Overwatch than this.I also don't see the huge problem with asains in the NA server yes it shouldn't be a thing but it really shouldn't be a huge point that you get a lot of asians on your team. If you play so much duo that that ruins the game for you buy the game for others or encourage friends to buy the game so they can play with you.Aswell I don't think it's fair to critisize the game on all your "" t deaths"". Although the game is not always fair I don't find it a problem (other when I die and get salty) enough to downvote the game. Maybe people should come to terms with the fact that they're not that good I did that a while ago and altough it was hard it helps me have a lot more fun.Finally I don't agree with the people who say that the game becomes unfun for two reasons. I personally get bored with a good game that I enjoyed 20 60 hours in. Only a few great games that I have I still find fun after 60+ hours into and it looks like this will be one of them. And it's not like I didn't enjoy those game either I still have fun. Now it may be because I don't play as much video games as *cough cough* some people and I can't relate on the scale that their talking about (200 hours+) but I feel like your setting yourslef up for failure if you think a $35 dollar game will entertain you for 200+ hours.Overall I wouldn't say that this is a perfect game without any flaws because it's not. I couldn't even mention all of them without losing my attention span. But I think the raw enjoyment I've had with this game overpowers that and thats why I think anyone thinking about getting this game should.

FIX YOUR DAMN GAME BEFORE YOU START ADDING MICRO TRANSACTIONS THAT YOU SAY GO TO FUNDING A TOURNAMENT WHEN IN THE FIRST PLACE FIX THE ING GAME BEFORE YOU START A DAMN ING TOURNAMENT. THEY HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM PEOPLE BUYING AN EARLY ACCESS GAME FOR $30 YET SOMEHOW THEY STILL NEED PEOPLE TO PAY FOR CRATES SO THEY CAN FUND A TOURNAMENT THAT THEY SHOULDNT EVEN BE DOING IN THE FIRST PLACE. and on top of that THEY ARE BANNING PEOPLE FOR BUGGING OUT IN AN EARLY ACCESS GAME AND BAN PEOPLE FROM HONKING HORNS ON STREAMS,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-11-14,0,0,257,False,Not Recommended,Came back after hearing some major fixes had been applied. At first it felt great responsiveness was up and the server seemed fine and then I had my first mid range encounter... I'm still appalled at how terrible the hit registration and bullet travel works in this game. Found myself still having to lead my target by about 10 meters while the guy is running at a fixed sprint when in reality I wouldn't have to lead them by more than a few inches to a foot at max in real life. Especially when this target is about 20 meters from me. As an avid shooter and veteran I can't get behind how terrible the leading still is in this game. After getting frustrated with that first encounter I had my second encounter in the same game where I managed to dip behind a wall to still be killed by shots that had been fired long after reaching safety.For some additional notes I run a fairly high end rig and have very good internet. My ping/latency usually never spikes beyond 50ms and on average sits around 35ms and in game I sit at a decent 190+ frames. Oh well I'm sure ill come back and try it again at some point but I still can't get behind the way the game operates even after all this time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-02,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,Absolutely unplayable. I play any other game with settings on max and no lag on multiplayer but this one lags and stutters so much it's simply impossible to even know what's going on around you. I'm getting a refund.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,52,True,Recommended,Generally against early access games but a friend of mine encouraged me to get it saying we would play it together and I don't regret it.

2017-09-06,0,0,192,True,Recommended,After putting in 107 hours into this game I can (hopefully) say that this is the best game in recent years running with Rainbow Six Siege for that title. Each round played is awesome i mix of tactics fun terror and epic win moments all wrapped up into a map with 100 desperate people trying to win. Yeah this game is Early Access it's buggy (Duh) and I'm not gonna lie has optimisation. Other than that it's awesome! First person mode is truly a blast but in my opinion 3rd is still better (Until OC servers of course). Solos are relatively fun duos are super neat also but SQUADS is where this great game can become an amazing one. Having intense shootouts with your mates versus some other guys and his mates is the best feeling especially wiping them all out. Please do get this game you won't regret it!Bear,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-30,0,0,1690,True,Not Recommended,Right from the start I got to say this is the best shooter I have ever personally experienced. The game has more potential than I could hope for but as of yet it still remains a potential. There are countless bugs holes flaws and simply annoying things in this game. Throughout the updates of the recent couple months the game added new animations and mechanics such as putting away the weapons when applying meds (tilts me every time I play) completely screwed up the jumping mechanic couple updates ago making you hop in slow motion almost while looking like an Easter bunny. Things like this alongside flipping your vehicle on tiniest bumps often dying if on a bike truly ruin the game experience for me. But none like the new circle mechanic. I have 2 000 games played with about 1 000 hours. But even being as devouted of a player even reaching top 100 two seasons in a row I am seriously considering taking a break from the game until these things are fixed.Recent update servers are garbage desync is beyond belief ping on my local servers is 1500 (and I'm on 100MBps up and down) you get shot behind walls your shots don't register if you drop to school or Yasnaya Polyana the FPS tanks to unplayable. At it present stage the game is broken AF and simply put it sucks. I would not recommend this game to a friend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-20,0,0,345,True,Recommended,I would recommend this game to anyone who plays shooters. Never before has a game gotten me so excited so angry or so blood thirsty as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

2018-09-20,0,0,355,False,Recommended,Most negative reviews are probably from sore losers. It's a game its gonna have issues and with such a large player base it will take some time to fix every issue. It's a BR kill or get killed but there are other ways to enjoy this game. I once convinced about 10ppl from a solo lobby to drop at Po ys Church (R.I.P. Spelling) and praise the lord. It was amazing. Until they declared me a false prophet and beat me down. I once witnessed my friend rolling around in a U.A.Z. blasting Phil Collins In The Air Tonight thru the lobby chat until he came upon an enemy team. He then crashed the vehicle and killed a member of the team. There was so much laughter from both sides they couldnt believe what had happened. I can keep going on funny expeirences but you should just buy the game and make your own. Enjoy!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You really have to sink a good few hours into it to get an idea of how the game plays and how some of the weapons function. This game might have plenty of guns but you aren't gonna be doing a whole lot of shooting. I recommend trying out some of the guns at the starting island. You'll probably suck at it the first few matches but with practice you'll get better. I'd recommend wearing a decent set of headphones whilst playing as it increases your overall awareness. Even something as simple as hearing an enemies footsteps or a door opening can save you. Remember to take off your shoes and close doors behind you. It's also surprising how tense and scary this game can be. Lastly turn off the voice chat. It gets extremely annoying. Overall I enjoy this game haven't had any problems with it yet.

2017-06-27,0,0,107,True,Recommended,Ive never had so much fun in a Battle Royale game before! For an early access game this game (aside from bugs and some balancing issues) feels worth the money.Pros + Long lasting fun+ Amazing with friends+ Getting kills is always satisfying+ Allows for a lot of different strategies (both good and ridiculous)+ Adrenaline kicks in when the safety zone is tiny and there's still 5 6 people alive+ Loot crates are earned and opened in game purely on playtime and points in game (Yay! No microtransactions....yet)Cons Only 1 map (as of this review apparently will be adding more later) Jumping in this game is awful Some loot is super common whereas others are too rare Bugs and crashes happen a fair bit on older rigs for sureOverall 8/10 worth $30 because it's very replayable,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is diffrent everytime so i can't get eanough of it. but it does miss some things I know it's still in early access but i'm gonna list some things the game needs.1.

Also very unfriendly to AMD cards if you have AMD powered computer unless you have the high end AMD stuff I do not suggest you playing the game.

2018-03-26,0,0,313,False,Recommended,PUBG precisely the market leader for games rnReview Firstly i'd like to say that the game is not as much fun without friends you can indeed do a Fill search where u get matched up with random people and have a good chance of making a few friends but overall playing Duos and Squads and Events is a lot more fun than Solo although solo isnt bad.I find the Cons of solo to be Quite a lot of running could get slightly boring alone. Too many campers hiding relentlessly. Quite a long game and you could die almost instantly though rewarding to win can be frustating sometimes. Minor things not too much. Secondly on the gameplay's part the game is hyper realistic. There is bullet drop realistic car in respect that cars can blow up easily and it isnt impossible to shoot through car windows also the cars have fuel. As for Ammo there are various types and the inventory arrangement is something you rather learn overtime the way i learned how to play in basics was by watching guides for beginners helped out a LOT. The weapon attachments are quite differing to range and that makes you the decision maker for how you want to play your style. There are a number of ways you can play according to your style whether be sniper ambush camper(Though Undesirable by other players can prove useful sometimes Con Leads to a slow and boring game from your perspective) assaulter rusher (The kind who generally dies easily unless played very carefully).One thing I'd like to remind you when you're gonna buy the game is that theres TPP and FPP Third person and First person now if youre playing first person its a hard chance that youll get jumped on out of nowhere as in third person you can look without actually peeking your character in enemy sight.Strafing Useful to dodge sometimes peeking corners overall it doesnt have too much usage but when in corner Tree to Tree fights or from cover it is very useful.That pretty much wraps it up if you have enjoyed games like Rainbow Six Seige Battlefield Counter Strike this could be your new jam )Overall Review 9.5/10PS Dont worry about servers lag isnt a big problem Yes can get small spikes here and there when picking up items but generally not a problem.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The in game reporting feature doesn't do anything and they request you report on the forums with evidence. Trying to report on the forums means I spend more time policing their servers for them than playing the game I PAID for.

This game is fun for a while but like anything it can get stale. I find it way more fun to play in squads with friends but solo can be fun sometimes. Hopefully the devs continue to update this game and make it better. The Sanhok map is a step in the right direction imo. The other maps are a bit too big and a lot of times you end up running/driving across the whole map without seeing a single player. The smaller Sanhok map fixes this by making all the major loot areas close enough to each other that once you clear out your drop area you can move to the next area and have people to fight. So it gives a good pace of looting and shooting. A lot of people their pants over the competitor to this game Fortnite. Imo Fortnite is a stupid cartoon baby game compared to this. I don't like the art style it seems so goofy and casual. Plus with it being free you know everyone's little brother is on there spamming dead memes into their mics with prepubescent nails on a chalkboard voices.

The concept and style of the game is all great but it's like they don't know how to do anything else right. They took months to reset the server to be playable and i dont think they've even started banning the hackers. The loot system for boxes is just stupid you have to pay in game money for the boxes which u get at random you don't get to pick which ones you want. and the one with the only really cool clothing requires a key that costs 2.50 so not only are you paying in game for boxes you get at random you also have to pay real money for a key and you only can get so many boxes a week. Why? what if i have enough for the boxes why limit how many i can get? Their servers are just laggy pieces of crap everytime i land the first 20 seconds of the game i pretty much can't move so i can't make any drops to high poplulated areas and i still rubber band and not let's not forget about all the dam bugs they need to fix that they've honestly had so much time to do. driving through open fields and hitting nothing causing ur car to flip and randomly blow up getting you killed. or when your shots don't register i've shot people so many times in the head and i watch my bullet travel right through and nothing. I would not reccomand anyone waste their money paying for this crappy game it's just gonna you off and make you want your money back. They don't listen to the community and im just waiting for someone to figure out how to make a game like theirs just better cause they will actually hear what their community wants from the game.

Its a nice fun game to play especially if you have a group of friends or even 1 since you can play duos. Its a nice loot system with levels and a decent amount of guns and grenades and mods for your guns to make you feel more powerful. ITs definetley worth the 30 dollar price. You can be casual and jump out at the military base or you can be competetive and actually compete for number 1 haha. Its a dope game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-31,0,0,239,False,Recommended,I have found this game to be fun and highly addicting lately (I'm one of the few that has left Fortnite and came here) even with its many flaws. In this review I will address some of the good and bad things I've seen in this game. This is my 100% honest opinion of the game at its current point.Main Pros 1.) I have never seen a cheater (not even once). I play split between TPP and FPP and I have never seen anyone hacking in either of them. When cheating is addressed and exaggerated by anyone who reviews this game they either are very unlucky to come across a hacker or they're lying just to lower ratings of the game.2.) The looting system is well done and I see it as one of the better systems out there. Back in the H1Z1 days I found myself stumbling around the looting and finding that even when I'd drag something DIRECTLY over the slot it wouldn't detect my actions. In PUBG it is very negotiable with how you loot (opening the inventory or picking up) and it is highly responsive to dragging items.Main Cons 1.) This goes directly to BlueHole please start to give a about your community... Do you not see that you're game still has and had potential?!? This whole lawsuit wouldn't be necessary at all if you just took a step up and won your community back! The reason Fortnite is succeeding is because Epic is so good at listening to critisism or obtaining new ideas from their community! it seems that the more you do to prevent other BR games' success the deeper a whole you're digginmg for yourself. This is my biggest issue with the game it's representatives.2.) Hit detection is one of the biggest flaws with this game. It is the sole reason (other than RNG) that makes me rage the most. Deadass I've hit a pebble on Miramar and my entire ing pickup truck flipped for around a minute resulting in me losing the game for no reason. This is an easy problem with an easy solution the problewm with this is IT ISN'T BEING FIXED STILL!!! If the devs come to their senses maybe when Sanhok releases they can fix some of the vehicle/player hitboxes as well.Conclusion This is a great game it always has been but BlueHole needs to straight up admit their wrong doings and pick their heads up off the floor. This game isn't dead yet but it will be if the right moves aren't made for this game soon. I beleive in it and I hope BlueHole can make the right descisions toward saving it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game gives you a sense of fear when you hear footsteps that aren't your own and respect for not shooting someone unless you are absolutly sure you are going to take them out other wise they will be taking you out.Anyways what i am trying to say is that i am addicted to this game and absolutely love it.Peace,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-21,1,1,408,True,Recommended,"Before i Proceed with the review i would like to address i DO NOT approve of Bans being brought apon people who have killed streamers and then get banned for ""stream sniping"". I do however approve of them banning streamers who are Breaking rules and thinking because they are streamers that they will just get a slap on the wrist. Since that is over with lets get onto the actual review.I feel after 300 hours this game is Repeatedly enjoyable the endless possibilities of this game make it a fun experience for enjoyers of the ""Unknown"". The Devs actually work on this game constantly unlike its Counterpart H1Z1 and care about the state of the game. They add new interesting ways for the game to be played like the Rain where you're hearing is less reliable in close quarters and makes things harder to see in darker areas (atleast for me). Then the newly added Fog Weather affect that makes the game a more Close Medium ranged focused game. Weapon wise they are doing in my opinion doing a good job at keeping them Reasonably balanced. Playing Solo/duo/Squads all offer a unique experience where ur either relying on yourself or teamwork to achieve a win.Also this game is only 30 bucks compared to 60 dollar AAA games where its only about money with the devs and not making a quality productAltho there has been a microtransaction sort of thing in this game Pubg doesnt rely on them and focus on them like Csgo and h1z1 heavily relies on them it doesnt add ""Pay to win"" outfits that gives the enemy an advantage. The driving for me can be a little weird at times but atleast ur car doesnt burst into flames after a small crash or rollover. But what is a game like this without some weird Vehicle physics that at times make no sense but can add a new aspect to the fun of the game. Also u can do tricks on a bike which is pretty Rad.Now to talk about the more bad things. I feel the game is pretty not the most optimized game in the bunch but for me it works fine.The planes are levels of loud never thought possible. Ctrl+M default to mute master volume while u take ur travel aboard the Loudest C 130 In the world.The fact that we can't make our own custom games without a partner ship is a disappointment but im sure thats bound to change when the game comes out in full release.In game all chat is pretty ing awful and home to open mic equivilent of /pol/ users. Can mute with Ctrl+TOverall i would recommend this game being the fact that its 30 bucks it has its flaws but it still in early access so u will see some of those going away and some new ones arising. I love playing this game with either serious players who make people accuse them of hacking cause they probably spend to much time raiding po i/school or casual goofballs who like running people over and honking their horns. There is a reason this game has sold over 10 million copies and with the xbox release coming and out of early access i bet it could even sell another 10 million.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-12,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,Decent optimization should be the basic of developping.Selling a game as unoptimized than PUBG is a shame. The game looks pretty nice to play I watched several game and would really enjoy it if it wasn't for this worse than ever optimization.The announced minimum configuration tells my PC (geforce 960gtx and an Intel Core I5) should run it nicely. Not at maximum setting but at least something playable.Right now all I can do is parachute with several image cluttering land and wait for the building to accept to load. Needless to say I'm shot down nearly everytime before I can enter any building. I let you imagine how fun it is to play at the moment.Unless something is done with optimization I strongly disadvise to buy the game.I'll review my advice once something is done.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-05,0,0,228,False,Recommended,The gun fights are realistic. PUBG put customization into weapons with attachments which was a cool idea and had me use scopes to see players off the distance.

2017-05-13,1,1,262,True,Recommended,VERY GOOD GAME. Even tho its in early access its pretty good. It is a very good game but for low budget pc's you will not be happy with the fps/outcome. But for high budget pc's its insanly good. I have a gtx 1050 ti 4gb and i play on all very low 1080p and i get around 80+ fps. Now for the cons. Their are so much glitches. When you reload the shotgun it could sometimes keep making the reload sound and reload animation aeven if you switch guns. The people who made this game are adding guns and different types of weather and not focusing on the fps drops and the server issues al all. They are also adding more cars. ITS NOT LIKE H1 IN A WAY. What i mean is if you ever played h1 and jumped out of a car while driving fast your would know you font die. But in PlayerUnknown BattleGrounds if you are driving fast and jump out you will die instantly Even if your are going slow you will still take damage. ALSO BUY THE GAME NOW BECUASE IT WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE WHEN THE FULL GAME COMES OUT BUT I DONT THINK IT WILL COME OUT OF BETA/ALPHA/EARLY ACCESS BECAUSE H1 HAS NOT EVEN COME OUT OF BETTA/EARLY ACCESS/ALPHA.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Then Submit the video.You new that a cheater couldnt go around chaning his name all the time.You thought you werent being Duped.What I don't like is all the above is been slowly been reversed..... slowly but surley they have undone all the hard work. You can no longer put in your own time to convince PubG that there was hacker in you game. What I belive is Steam is not trying hard enough........I really belive PubG was making head.Steam cant prove to anybody that a person caught cheating on there server wont be my next game.

2018-01-20,0,0,793,False,Recommended,My thoughts after PC Update 1.0 compared to the earlier builds of this game (Early Access) Framerate has vastly improved. I average over 110fps with Texture/AA on Ultra and everything else on medium. (i7 2600k/980ti/16gb RAM) Overall lag has reduced Replay system is convenient esp. if you're not a content creator or don't use recording software (Can view replays of up to the last 20 matches played) Redesigned lobby and lobby/system UI There are now 2 maps that are randomly selected (new desert themed map) Vaulting (not clunky and feels great) Driving physics improvements (Driving offroad is noticeably different and imo enjoyable and adds to the imersion) There is now a Deathcam feature Weapon &amp Ballistics improvements Elements of UI has been drastically improved. HUD/UI/Minimap have all been redesigned. Slight improvement of detail on weapon thumbnailsWhile this BR has been in the rough for quite some time after this patch it has definitely been a great overall improvement. There are some glaring issues though such as running into hackers occasionally (I've only ran into a few hackers with my +500 hours of playing and from what I'm noticing it seems more common in TPP mode) low tick rate on servers and the lack of region lock. Although those issues sound signifant the game is overall stable and I still recommend this game (even at full price) especially if you have some friends to play with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-22,0,0,1114,False,Not Recommended,It's a very interesting concept but the game is not that fun. Here's how most games go Spend 15 minutes looting. Sometimes you find some really good stuff sometimes not. You're eventually forced to relocate and you get shot and killed by someone you never see. The game is basically camping as much as you can and then using good strategy when you're forced to relocate. In most games it comes down to who is lucky enough to not need to relocate. Combined with the random loot there is way too much luck involved for this to be a good competitive multiplayer game. Since each game has 100 players and only one person wins you are going to lose most games. This is different from two team games where you will win about half of the time. This makes winning feel so much better but losing 30 times in a row isn't much fun. There are squad modes where you can play in teams of two or four. These are more fun but I don't think it overcomes the other downsides. The biggest problem I have with this game though is the netcode and/or server speed. It has been proven to be worse than any other current competitive multiplayer game. CSGO players often complain about the 64 tick rate (updates per second) but this game has 8 which would be considered unplayable in CSGO. In PUBG bullets take time to reach their target and drop based on distance. Combined with the bad netcode/servers it makes it nearly impossible to land shots. Even shots at someone right in front of you will miss. The best thing I can say about this game is that it's only $30.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,The idea behind the game is pretty cool but gets old fast. There are often moments where you randomly get killed by people you don't even know where are shooting from and moments in which you lose time waiting for someone to pass close to you and who probably will never know from where you shot him. Besides if you can't wait anymore and decide to leave your safe spot you get ista killed with headshot from 3 different guys who were actually camping the buildings nearby. The game is still a work in progress but right now for many people it has problems which make it almost unplayable like huge drops in fps and very long texture loading time that forced me to wait many times for the door to load before i could enter the building. People obviously will kill you while you wait for it to load. In my opinion the game feels boring already after 9 hours of gameplay. Anyways if they manage to fix all the technical issues it may still be a decent game. A game for campers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Even if you had a beastly rig you would still experience heavy stutters and random crashes.But dev must have been doing something about it right? yeah they released a mobile version and a xbox version that is even less optimized its a joke 3/10 Makes my rig look like a dishwasherGameplayWasn't sure wheter to include this in optimization or not you would wonder why well... because apparently bad optimization gives gameplay features... yeah! first of all i've never heard of a game introducing a feature like 'vaulting'It's like a dev told you in his next big game presentation that his title will have a huge feature called 'walking'.like wtf? you must be out of your mind to see that as an 'improvement' of the game its a necessary feature for the type of game but it was added half a year after the game's release and not only it came late it was now we need to talk first how they removed the third person fov .ini fix because it introduced 'unfair advantages' instead of introducing a 3rd person fov slider that wouldnt make it unfair since everyone could use it. now with vaulting in certain spots you can make you character climb trough floors or walls and see trough thats definitely a fair advantage! you want to know what else is a fair advantage? the game not loading textures! so you can go trough walls and see trough walls like there were none to begin with (and this was with tha game installed on ssd)3/10 phew phew shoot at enemies that don't see you wowNetworkWorse than optimization and trust me that's alot to say. The server's thickrate is a total joke lag compensation doesnt even exist you can't get to know how much ping you are getting because there's no actual way to know in game you need to go to third party sites to see it there's a huge amount of dsnyc and you can't even be sure you have actually hit an enemy from the blood splatters because if there's dsync in place your enemy might just still be full healt... a total joke 1/10 the worst i've ever seen they're not even trying hereSoundWhat sound? directional sound is non existent you might aswell play with your head in a oven over at your kitchen and still get the same informations that you would get by playing the game with a decent headset in your room without any noise. If you happen to hear anything you still won't be able to pin point the direction from which the bullet came from and you will look like an idiot taking cover from the wrong side like a pack of ing fruit now just think about how's it like to be shot from a suppressed weapon you litterally have no chance especially if the game forces you to go trough an open field. Oh and because the core feature of the game is to be 'realism oriented' you don't get any information by the ui from where you got hit because ofc if you get hit in your by a bullet you still wonder if the bullet was shot from the side or in front of you right? /s4/10 Tries to be annoying more than it tries to be realistic (i said realistic not good it doesnt even try to be any good)MovementIn this game you roleplay a blind drunk slug it litterally feels like that there's a ing delay for everything you want to open a door while you're being shot? ok sure just wait a couple seconds wait for the slow animation you try to walk in.. hit the door you character looses momentum and you have to wait for a total of 3 seconds to enter a door (yeah there is momentum in this game you can't just press W and walk that would be to easy! what were you thinking? nono you have to wait that that slug of your character actually initiates the animation and starts moving) and this is whitout dsync if there's any well then you might aswell play ping pong with the door because the game starts to register every imput you gave before opening the door so the door will open and then close again very funny indeed especially when you need to move fast to save a teammate. Same goes for jumping ostacles if you run full speed and jump something and hit it with your thumb's nail you get bounced back lose momentum you have to walk back get momentum and try again.1/10 just because you can movePlayerbaseYou got any problem? it's not tha game's fault! it's you! i have a gtx 550 4gigs of ram and an i3 800 and i get steady 100 frames!

Of course disclaimer the greedy ers had to go and throw microtransactions in the form of loot boxes into an unfinished game in early access AFTER promising that they would not do that very thing! With most any other game that would tank my review immediately as that is about as anti consumer as you could possibly be but its a testament to how good PUBG is that I still feel that the game deserves a positive review after the it throws. Just... maybe don't trust the good times to last too long the game looks more and more like it is going to turn into the flaming pile of that is CS GO.

It is hard and made for those who think that they are pros in FPS Games. But this game has crazy bugs. Sometimes it happens that when i land my parachute stays open and wouldnt close.

2017-08-27,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,If you are the kind of person who enjoys finding a nice corner in all FPS games and living your days out waiting for a couple of people to walk by in one game then you will love this game. I very much dislike this game because that is how this game plays if you play solo 90% of the time. This game is extremely slow paced if you are looking to win a game and there will be too many times where you will have absolutely no clue where you died from when you make it into the top 30. I would honestly recommend this game if you can always play this game with friends because solo is just a slow paced show. Playing this game solo just feels like a waste of time especially if you want to win because you will spend 40 minutes seeing maybe like 5 people and it will likely end with you having no clue where you are being shot from and then lose in the top 30 with only 3 kills and that you spent that much time in one game just to have absolutely no clue where the guy shooting you is at. If you are lucky you will drop in the center of the safe zone where you will then spend about 10 minutes looting and then the remaining 40 minutes in one room waiting for people to come to you and you'll still be lucky to see 5 people the entire damn game. Again if you enjoy almost no action (in solo) and enjoy games where 90% of the game nothing happens and enjoy having no clue where you die from in the end then you will probably love this game. I can see the appeal of this game but atleast in solo I cannot find enjoyment in a game where NOTHING happens.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Im getting constant 70+ fps some areas I get all up to 110+ fps ( changes back and forth 70 100 ) so after a few months I look forward to that steady 144. Textures on ultra effects on low and everything else was on very low.All in all i'm very satisfied with the game and highly recommend it for anyone who are looking for a solid shooter game.

Chinese ping abusers who deliberately join NA servers because it makes their ping so high that they are almost impossible to hit and impossible for them not to hit you due to THE LAG Loot spawns almost everywhere are almost all absolutely f(ri)cked and vehicle spawns may have 20 vehicles in 1 place and none throughout the entire map Extremely unreliable anti cheat Toxic community that is worse than CS at some times (good thing you separate from all of them right when the match starts right?) Miramar. Just Miramar. The map itself is one big flaw. It's too huge and is extremely difficult to solo on so if you have no friends watch out for this map (regarding the fact that theres only two maps just watch out for the darned game itself)overall yeah dont spend $30 on this game go buy something else unless you have like a lot of friends who play it then yeah do it because if you squad up you might actually have a good timebut if youre an absolute loner no dont im warning you you WILL regret spending money on this game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Thats what really makes it pop out from other games because out of all the games that i play its the only one that can really make me be scared and nervous and its just so awesome to feel this while playing. Im afraid tho that the game is still in beta (you can buy it but its not 100% finished yet) and because of that the ammount of bugs is pretty big. But the main problem about it is the fact that the optimization is horrible. Even people with modern rigs cant seem to run this game like they should be able to. I personally get less fps drops in GTA 5 than in PUBG. It isnt really fair to compare them since one of them has been out for quite a few years now and PUBG isnt even realeased yet but its just for you to have an idea.Basically if you dont have a good pc and dont want to have to go thru bugs and stuff i would recommend for you to buy the game once its realeased. I really think the game has a lot of potential to be one of the greatest games out there but it still has alot to go thorugh.8/10 (Just because its in beta and there optimization is pretty bad),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

With the addition of new maps Mirmar and Sanhok the game has propeled to new heights. I have sunk hundreds of hours into this game and feel hands down this is the best battle royale out for my style and taste. I say this because of the battle royale genre this is the most realistic version of a combat shooter out. Fortnite and others that are in this arena aren't the same. I'm not going to get into the whole PUBG? Fortnite? and who's best? Plain and simple a battle royale is a battle royale. Last man standing wins. So can't base it as whos the best BRG? Instead you can only say which game style do you prefer? Do you like real camouflage style stealth with weapons and ammo that come close to real world physics and effects then you should get this game.

I love the concept and when it plays right it is one of the most thrilling and tense games I have ever played. But the key word there is ""when it plays right."" This game is terribly optimized I don't have the newest fanciest card or a six core processor but with what I do have I should be able to run the game above the lowest settings. Whenever I do the game slows to a grinding halt and turns into a slideshow. Even at very low settings the game struggles to load textures upon dropping in.The loot spawning doesn't feel too bad to me though when I drop into a military base and don't find so much as a handgun when everyone else has assault rifles and shotguns I can't tell if I should be mad at the game or at RN Jesus. I'm not asking for a fully loaded SCAR every game but high value loot areas should be just that. All in all that's really not too big of an issue for me.Another issue with the game is hacking. A lot of people say ""Well I haven't seen one so there can't be that many!"" Well I didn't run into any until recently. It seems a lot of the time people confuse skill for hacking but it's becoming more an more rampent and it does kill the fun of the game when you and a buddy are in the top 15 only to have a Chinese hacker come through the wall and blow you both up. I want this to be the game we all want it to be. I'm (foolishly) hoping that the devs don't the bed with this. I don't want to see another DayZ. I don't want to see another ARK. I don't want to see another great game lost in Early Access Hell.But whatever despite all that it's E Sports ready amirite?",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,250,False,Recommended,"This game is highly addictive and also highly based on RNG. You drop from a plane and parachute to a location of your chosing across the map and even if you pick the same place 20 times in a row you're guarenteed to get different levels of loot each time. Sometimes you'll be stuck with a sickle other times you'll be fully kitted out with an Mini14 and all it's attatchments and personally I like it.As someone who loves just running around and looting stuff in games PUBG is great because 90% of the gameplay is a running/looting simulator until you make it to say the last 20 players of a game which is when the action starts to happen. As far as Battle Royale games go this game is pretty well balanced in terms of loot the zones in which it spawns and the dispersal of air drops the combat itself could use a little work as there are occasional buggy hitboxes and hackers which can't be avoided but all in all its incredibly fun.As someone with a terrible aim I much prefer playing with friends and I like the fact that this game offers not only Solo and Duo gamemodes but also a squad gamemode for up to 4 people. ON TOP OF THAT there's also First Person gamemodes for those who hate their lives and enjoy having limited vision in games.As a game that's still in ""early access"" lol? It's great. It's being updated constantly and the developers seem to be listening to what their customers want. Also the graphics are pretty which helps.I'd recommend this.

You'll end up gathering supplies for many minutes at a time only to pick off a few guys (or even none) and have your progress lossed. Yes I know that it's part of what this game is all about but I can't help but feel like I'm wasting my time on nothing. After a long day I'ld rather hop into a Battlefield server where I can chill and relax and rack up a 10+ killstreak and not have to worry about enemies lurking in the brushes.

2018-09-12,0,0,374,False,Not Recommended,I played this game from the beta and over the last year. I loved it and I love the concept really and writing this reallly hurts me. It has grown into a asian cheater game and Bluehole do not want to make actions that fix this for real. The system that sorts people that get thrown into a game by latency is gravely flawed because asians overflow european servers via VPN and that causes technical issues and the ball is rolling with all kinds of issues with latency and lag. The cheating has grown and do grow every day since now the player with the most skills is not being honored but the pllayer with the most divine cheat.. I am not talking about good skilled streamers and such. Look at leaderboards there are known cheaters leading them and Bluehole does nothing about it. They claim to adress these issues with updates but in reality this is not a optimization issue it is a player issue they need to make a system to perform a totalitary region block eveen if it comes to the cost of us not being able to pay with friends in other regions. The game is atm rotten and falling apart and money is controlling what Bluehole is willing to do about the problems. They are an asian company so I doubt they are willing to lock asians away from the european and american servers. Reason is that everyone cheats in asian servers that gives them competition even as a cheater. So being a sucsessfull cheater means getting in to servers where less of the people is cheating. And if they cant get into our servers and get results here they simply abandon the game. That is not what Bluehole wants so they just slip them thru and tells us they try their best to implement systems to adress issues but in reality they just try to optomize the code to run smoother and better with the cheaters still connecting. Well that is of no help I rather play a less optimized game with less cheaters and more people I can actually comunicate with in english at least in a squad. Singeplayer is not even an option anymore. If you want to achieve something at alll you get better results in squad because then 2 3 of the asian cheaters are actually teamed up with you.. So until this game is fixed or dead its not worth anything.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Granted my machine is running a bit old but this is a complaint I've seen mentioned by people running all manner of rigs from low high end.That said overall optimization was greatly improved at launch which has been great.I've seen many complaints about chinese hackers however I very rarely encounter this phenomenon I play on Japan/Korea and Oceanic servers so unless all these Triads are braving ping to troll american and EU servers exclusively then I'd suggest many of the reports are simply the result of salty players and a missunderstanding of how broken the Death cam is.I'm giving this a Thumbs Up regardless of some ongoing optimization problems and the rare cheater I always find myself jumping into lobby after lobby no matter how frustrating the previous matches may have been the core gamplay is exciting with good shooting mechanics and highly addictive replay value.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-11,0,0,1152,True,Not Recommended,Giving this a negative review because of the decision to ban 'stream snipers'. While I agree that it is 'bad sportsmanship' to stream snipe I think the blame falls on the player willingly broadcasting their every move to the world. Streamers have the tools to delay their stream and if they choose not to they know as with every game they play that people can use this to their advantage. Not to mention how hard it would be to prove somebody is stream sniping. Also after anouncing no paid for content before release and breaking that promise. I wonder how much development time is going into that rather than completing the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-07,1,1,63,True,Not Recommended,Game is practically unplayable and im not the only one expeiencing this issue skydiving down to have none of the textures loaded for the buildings (just 10pixel jagged mishapen walls and structures) making the game unplayable for the first 1 2 min unless you hit tab as you open your parachute to freeze the game and load the building textures which takes 30s 1m. Now if you do this you CANNOT aim where you land and the freezing is still unacceptable even on lower settings it occurs and the game crashes are soon to folow with the game freezig and killing my pc (GTX 970 8gb RAM I5 4960K). THis is unaccptable with the network lag they NEED to fix this for people with worse internet like me.Not to mention the devs going back on their promises like the kykes they are after receiving $100 Million already im very upset with the direction they are taking the game and it all started with the August update I didn't have nearly as many problems before this update. Also why does take so long to add vaulting it should be a base feature.EDIT I tried it on the lowest quality grapghics and i loaded in this time but i landed in the prison and same polygon issue I could walk through walls and the game was unplayable after 2 MINUTES!! it loaded the graphics and crashed the game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-26,0,0,40,True,Not Recommended,I cannot recommend this game at its current state. Its extremely laggy buggy and glitchy. Controls feel extremely strange and the maps so large that your hand starts hurting for how long you're holding shift to run. Unless you find a vehicle which are rare and far between. Then to make matters even worse the camera angles make it extremely difficuly to actually land shots or even see someone. And it only gets worse. While people shoot including you the game decides that your smooth 80fps needs to now be 3fps and you die because you can't move. Also there's literally no motive to play the game. Its just go and collect currency from winning (rarely happens) or losing and that currency does absolutely nothing for you. When and if you ever see anyone you will either have an advantage over them or they will have an advantage over you. There's no in between. Most of the time you'll either die trying to find loot from someone who magically found a shotgun in the building you ran into first or you'll get severely gunned down by a random guy with a rifle while all you have is a pistol. Don't buy this game. Wait about a year then buy it. Maybe it'll actually be well built by then. At its current state its about as glitchy and buggy as Ghost Recon Wildlands was during its first closed beta. Shooting moving and aiming just seems awkward and wrong.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-10,0,0,537,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a tactical online battle royale game in which up to 100 players get flown across the map and may parachute to any location they wish to in order to loot and to kill the other players in the game with them. As well as fighting other players you must watch out for the circle/barrier keep an eye on the bottom right of the screen (above the minimap). The timer shows the amount of time you have to move inside the white circle before the blue circle comes (the blue circle damages your health) and the exclamation mark indicates that the blue circle has started moving towards you.You can play the game in a duo (two players) or a squad (four players) there are also custom games which filter out certain aspects of the game (e.g. items variety circle time) in order to make the game more fun however you do not get rewards for playing custom games and only PUBG partners can host them.You can purchase crates with the in game currency (BP). The price of these crates double every time you buy one but after every week the price resets back to 700 BP. From these crates you can earn Wanderer or Survivor crates which contain different items of different values some of which can be sold for a lot of money on the Steam Store.PROS Variety You never know what is going to happen every game is different. Fun The extreme rush the game gives you once you get into the top ten is enough to make you replay the game over and over until you get a winner winner chicken dinner. Constant development Cheaters will be terminated very quickly. Worldwide community/servers.CONS The system requirements are very pricey and the recommended system requirements for Medium/High at 60FPS is most likely an i5 7600K/Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a GTX 1060 or RX 480 and over 8GB RAM.

I quickly get into games with less than a minute queue time. I have not experienced any crashes or serious bugs. Game runs smoothly. Graphics look good. I'm not really a big fan of Battle Royale MP. I just don't get it. It's slow and plodding for the most part. You can wait several minutes before running into another person. Your best strategy is to turtle. Find an abandoned house or building with good vantage points and hopefully good loot inside and stay there for as long as possible. I usually get sniped whenever I leave my trusty confines.I just don't find it that fun. Last Man Standing on Counter Strike Global Offensive is more fun than this type of game. Who cares about a circle that keeps getting smaller. Honestly it's not more fun than TDM. At least in my opinion.

2017-08-20,0,0,1046,True,Recommended,Pros All around fun first person or third person shooter. 100 Players sky dive to a destination of their choosing on a set of two islands. But it isn't as simple as it seems you must master jump times and the way you fly to be the fastest to reach your destination. Chances are at least one person will land near you and the battle is on. I have been beaten down by the troll that follows your every move only to jump and head shot punch you to death. A trait that he had obviously spent time mastering. I myself within the first few days of playing had a game of cat and mouse against a guy with an assault rifle only to prevail with a frying pan. I ran and watched his position and ran back towards him when he wasnt looking I took position around the corner and swung at the air hoping to draw him in. As he reached the corner he saw me and a spray of bullets penetrate my chest and my hp bar hits one tenth as the frying pan pangs across his face. I proceeded to say who's your daddy. In good spirits he just laughs and says I applaud you enjoy the loot. This game has a definite skill gap and even my 9 kill game I fell short with 5th and another game learning you can cook grenades in the worst kind of way expliding my self with a 6 kill third. I am still to win a game but even when I lose I don't seem quite as angry as I do with other games. Which to me says that my thirst for a good game is quenched in other ways. The player base has quickly grown and the game will only get better. The game needs to get better and with that I will give my list of cons.Cons The number one priority at this point is to optimize the game. Even the best systems for gaming can only muster 90 FPS and that hurts for people who spent the extra $$ for the 144hz. The game looks a little ugly if you want to get the best fps possible but with a reshader app which is deemed legal by the company it can bring it to life with more color. Still the need for optimization is high and I wonder if they want to have a finished base product before they go back and alter code if that is how it works. I am not a programmer. The movement system seems almost bad when you first start playing I had trouble clearing small walls using windows for escape or sneak attack. The way to move into a gunfight or move and maintain any semblence of accuracy and even the aiming feels funny at times. This is where I should say this is not really a con does the new vaulting system they plan to implement look awesome. Hell yeah! It is part of the skill gap I mentioned earlier and I have come to get much better and doing all of the movements I could not. I get some FPS drops when the RNG bomb zones happen. Not sure it is anything on my end because I believe I have my graphics and realtek sound drivers up to date. The game is very laggy when you first land and sometimes it can really ruin your game.The grenades in this game a) for the molotovs and the smokes cause small FPS drops and b) the grenades have small area of effect and are often times useless. They are definitely part of the skill gap and part of it I still haven't mastered or even figured out. All around this is a very fun game and a refreshing change of pace from most other shooters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I haved owned PUBG for just over a month and just hit 200 hours. Never thought a game with more loses than wins could ever be so much fun. Finally a game that isn't like any other. The ""Battle Royal"" genre is a game for me that requires attention skill and good timing. All the other gun slinging games get too repetitive and not any real teamwork. PUBG introduces urban strategies that allows you to fight with what you got. Some situtations are good bad and just pure luck. But for the most part you are in control to make the best of it as much as you can.No game is perfect but no game is fun if you can't get off. Hats off to PUBG and wishing for the final product soon.

This really affects the gameplay since it will make you lose games because of the most stupid reasons there are. Although it's ""fun"" because everybody plays it or because you can just join games to mess around with your friends but this title is extremely overrated by far and some of you will not be able to even play this ironically because it's insanely broken (way more than what you see on videos/streams trust me)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I NEVER PLAY Asian Servers why the would I want it to be default on ASIAN SERVERS? not to mention I DONT PLAY THIRD PERSON... why would it automatically adjust for this? is it that hard to make the game REMEMBER YOUR PERFERRED SERVER AND PREFERRED GAME MODE? or hell just KEEP IT ON THE LAST SERVER LAST GAME MODE YOU PLAYED? REFRESH BUTTON really?! you literally add a refresh button because you realize how glitchy the menu screen can be and you do nothing to fix it... what a joke. the friends list doesn't work when you mouse over it half the time you have to go up to your REFRESH button to fix it so you can invite your friends or see any of your friends... YOUR FRIENDS liST has a REFRESH BUTTON because it cant handle AUTOREFRESHING your list to SEE WHEN YOUR FRIENDS COME ONLINE?! what a ing joke...

With all this taken into account this game has risen in popularity and with all that comes more players and more clients on their servers meaning that sometimes (not always) the game won't run properly. Other than that the game is quite fun the gunplay is satisfying ""but some guns need buffs and nerfs such as the crossbow and shotgun"". The movement is stiff rigid and takes getting used to but with a few matches in the bag you'll pick up on how to do it.

That being said I do realize that the optimization issues are a problem for most people and that you need a pretty good machine to run it. Otherwise I believe that this game has very intense moments crazy things that can happen. In the overall aspect I do recommend this game because of its intense action fun to play with friends and an experience that is different every time. This game contains Pros Hilarious moments with friends that you can play with and enjoy screwing around Winning after engaging in heavy firefights and scrounging around for loot makes you feel accomplished when you finally win Landing far off shots and leading your targets effectively makes you feel like a real marksman Different plane paths and drop locations so you can have a different experience every time plus randomized zones so you can fight from the hills of Po i to the wheat fields of Yasnaya to the urban combat of Sosnovka Military BaseCons Poor optimization need a decent machine to run it.

Only downside is that about 90% of my region's server (NA) is Chinese players!

Only downside is the fact that the devs are focusing too much on adding new outfits crates and emotes instead of adding more gameplay features or modes. The 4x4km map (Sanhok) is nice and allows for faster gameplay but PUBG still hasn't evolved beyond simple battle royale drop in with 99 other players collect loot die or win.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-27,1,1,491,False,Not Recommended,Ah PUBG...A game that came out of nowhere taking the dying Battle Royale genre by storm and becoming #1 on Steam.It had it's flaws and bugs when it came out (mainly optimization lag cheaters) sure. But all of that was attributed to it still being in early access and whatnot players had hope of devs eventually polishing the game with bug fixes optimization character models that don't look like NPCs from Oblivion (Great game btw you should play it if you haven't). Back then the game had a charm an aura a SOUL.Now more than a year later we have 3 Maps (1 of them being unplayable garbage with a large map with random clusters of Unreal Engine assets being passed off as buildings terrain and cover and the other 2 being somewhat decent with Erangel remaining a clear favorite among most players) some quality of life improvements have been made but some steps backwards were taken aswell (ie. paid Season Pass with half of the skins not being a permanent item in your inventory).By the time good updates started coming around it was too little and too late most players lost interest and started playing Fortnite.TL DR Dead Game lol,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-12,0,0,416,False,Recommended,Pubg is my favourite battle royale game on the market. First I should mention that my forst experience with battle royale was around 4 years ago with Playeruknowns battle royale mod for Arma 3. PUBG is a great game alone or with friends. Yes it can be buggy at times and infuriating but it tactile and realistic feel is what makes me enjoy the game rather than its competitor fortnite. With the Fix Pubg campaign that Pubg Corp are running I am hopeful this game can regain its playerbase and be a competitively viable game. Its recent release of Sanhok has demonstrated that the devs know what the players like about the game and the faster paced gameplay makes it hard to go back to the older maps. Overall I would rate the game a 8/10 and will stick with the game throughout its development. Rip,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also stop spying on your users.ingame menu http //front.battlegroundsgame.com/index.html6. Hit reg that is client side CLIENT SIDE? WTF?So you shoot someone and your client says you hit him. It sends that data to the server and the server compares where the player was on your client to where the server had that player located. If this doesn't match up because you have poor ping that hit doesn't actually go through to the server and the hit won't really count. PUBG has no secondary check on the server side for hit detection. If you hit him on your client and get your packets to the server it just checks off on that and allows it. A big issue here is how there are no trades in the game. If you and an enemy both shoot each other and should kill each other whichever one of you gets your information to the server first wins. After you're downed your bullets no longer do any damage so even if your client also sees that you killed your enemy the server just ignores that information as on the server you're already dead since the enemy got their packets there first. You'd think this means having low latency would just 100% be better but it's not always that simple. If your enemy is lagging their bullets might not even show up on your game before you're shooting at them on your game but by the time their bullets reach the server so that it can relay it to you they've already shot 20 times and you're dead on the server despite never having a chance to see all the bullets they missed before hitting you. Someone could have a high upload speed and get their packets to the server very quickly when shooting you but a very slow download speed and thus they don't see you moving but instead see you standing still despite you actually moving. The hitreg is actually calculated client side in this game.What ever you do stay away from this game right now",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Im an average gamer but the hacker community in PUBG has gotten out of control and I fear it always will be. Just sucks the fun out of the game... /,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-27,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Devs suck too much streamer optimization isn't really optimal and it's more of an empty husk than a game in it's own right. The world is huge and honestly if you can handle having the graphics turned up the scenery is nice but there isn't anything to fill it up. And odds are if you land in an empty area not near anyone you'll die without even encountering another player.Edit Also I 100% bandwagonned with this negative review since the Devs are mad at Bluehole for a super dumb reason,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If I really hate this game and am tired of bad devs why do I even bother crying? And you whiny entitled cucks should stop complaining about the game not being perfect... Look at what ur getting from a team of ppl that went all in to bring you the game you loved but didn t really think through that UE4 was never built to have 100 ppl running across a different maps filled with weapons and everything just for your gaming pleasure the game will never run like cs go or league so you cucks who think complaining about fps will solve something think again if ur game doesn t run well it s your problem and not theirs... They ll optimize the game but it ll never be running like butter unless they change engines. Bluehole is doing as much as they can even though you guys fail to realize building and working on pieces of codes that make a game played by millions of players a day is definitely not an easy task and you whining will not help.

Potato servers paid DLC WITH removal of the free crates (why even bother with having in game currency then) coming soon even though the promise was made to not have it implemented until after the game is released horrendous vehicle physics and it's running on a year old engine (which in modern computer days is pre historic) that was never meant to handle 100 players on a single map in a massive multiplayer environment. Oh and the devs think CS GO's skin model is a great example of how to do skins. The only thing CS GO's skin model is being good at is showing how to not do it.It's currently going down the DayZ/H1Z1 road which is a bad sign and until then avoid it and until these decisions are reversed this will stay as a negative review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My major critisisms are that the game lacks variety there isn't enough of it but i can forgive this seeing as the game is early access and they're bound to add in at least something to change it up but the biggest problem with PUBG is that while fun it's also infuriating when you start out in the lobby and there's playing darude sandstorm on full volume into their mics you look foward to putting the s in their place with a well placed bullet but then you actually get into a game and the mow you down it's disheartening to know that everyone seems to do a better job at murder than me but i still managed to get into PUBG despite this so i guess in short PUBG is worth the money i paid but that doesn't mean you're allowed to put the price up PLAYERUNKOWN.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After this I yet again met some more people to play with and got a great 3 4 man squad running. We explored most of the whole map and found underground bunkers military installations it really made me realise what a great game battlegrounds is and what it can become. And it's alpha?

Shame it seemed like a really good game.Update Just tried out the latest update. Oh Jesus... After clicking the reconnect button between 12 14 times I got in ( Servers are too busy... Try again later ). And I couldn't believe how much worse it got. The framerate was so horrible that my character was literally skipping. I was playing frame to frame... I mean christ..

2017-03-23,0,0,19,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I've been playing Battle Royal since the Arma 2 mod. PLAYERUNKNOWN has been working at his craft for years and ultimately created this amazing game. From movement to gunplay to overall enjoyment he's certainly out done himself. The game plays wonderfully even in Early Access. I've been involved since pre alpha and testing during this process. The game only continues to improve. During the closed beta each week fresh patches released updating the game and fixing bugs. This game is well worth the price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-30,3,11,383,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. (Game was gifted to me by a friend I would probably be more annoyed if I had bought it myself however because the price is pretty high)PUBG has the potential of being a really great game (providing the devs don't run like every other early access game) the game has great gun play gun sounds and solo is the best BR experience I've had. The downside is duos and groups the whole game is brought down by the revive system which is one of the worst implementations of revive in any game I've ever played. My main hope is that it is outright removed because I dislike it that much but if it isn't I have some complaints that should be fixed for me to enjoy duos or groups.1) Headshots don't kill in one hit it's knocks the player out. This can be fixed by simply allowing some guns to kill one hit snipers in general are useless. Let's say there is a team in a house and there is a balcony you see one guy they haven't seen you so they're wide open for a shot you shoot and get a headshot but you down him. What is my plan as the sniper? I can't go into the house I know people are in there and the knocked out player will be getting revived. This system only benefits the team that shouldn't be allowed to have these kinds of mistakes. It allows bad players to cheese death.2) Knocked out players take too many shots to finally kill. It must take at least 5 shots to kill a knocked out player. I fail to understand why a headshot doesn't kill a knocked out player in 1 hit but that's another issue.3) Knocking out players gives me information that I really shouldn't know. If I shoot someone and they die I know they're alone but if they're knocked out they aren't alone.There are other problems with the game that most likely will be fixed this however is a core mechanic so I have fears that this won't be removed and that is a shame because as I said this could be a really great game. For this reason I can't recommend this game unless you only want to play solo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You take a lot of total damage from flipping over tiny pebbles when you're in a car and you get stuck in little divots and take damage from that.(Also while driving a car) If you shoot from the seat behind the driver in a car it's possible to kill your teammate. I've had so many glitches since the new update that I'm evaluating uninstalling. Pls fix. Just a tip make it playable before you add new things.When it actually is playable the game feels kind of slow but kind of fun in squads at least. But since the update I've had problems in every match.P.S.

It's just sad to see such a fun game that started dying a few months back (not really surpising as probably most people are just done with dealing with the issues the game has just like me) Hope they fix it in the future and it won't be too late for the game.

Easily one of the worst battle royale games which is saying a lot because the battle royale genre is already just a terrible lackluster genre that should have been a side mode to a base game. this ""game"" somehow lacks more content than a military shooter set in ww1/ww2 the variety is restricted to 3 maps of course for balancing reasons the only unlockables are cosmetics and ranks the actual incentive to play the game is mostly carved out and resold through a season pass you have to pay for every few weeks when plenty of other free to play games give you daily/weekly challenges completely free on top of that some of the unlocks through that pass are temporary let me make that clear TEMPORARY. so not only are you paying for your own psychological manipulation to make the grind more interesting you don't even get to keep some of the things you earn. oh and this on top of the Valve style loot crates where you have to buy both the crate and the key making things needlessly more complex and confusing for an already scummy system.the game is a buggy unpolished mess that runs very poorly especially when compared to other games that look about the same and run fine and what do the devs do about any of this to try and fix the issues and make the game the best it can be? absolutely nothing actually wait they are doing something they are trying to sue multiple people to sustain a monopoly on the genre so that you only have the one choice if you go to the battle royale genre for your daily dose of waiting in the loading screens and prematching all day long.i can go on for longer but i don't want to waste time just stay as far away from this game and the Battle Royale genre as a whole. i've played many battle royale games to try and understand the appeal and for the most part this genre for me will stay as a thing i only turn on because my so called ""friends"" couldn't buy anything decent. I absolutely cant wait for the day that this dies off the fact that this is popular is like watching people beg for less content in video games.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-28,0,0,862,True,Recommended,I bought this game at launch back in march. I thought the mechanics and the game's approach to a battle royale was much better than H1Z1. I decided to refund it though because of the game's bad optimization(could not even run it with a decent 30 fps on a gtx 1070). But late August I decided to buy the game again and I can truly say that it has evolved into a much more playable and enjoyable experience. It still demands a beasty pc to run properly but once it does.....You just need one more!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-10,1,1,447,False,Not Recommended,"Game with great potential but Devs have issues with being fair to players who arent popular streamers. Letting them get away with glitches that would get others banned. Also the paid crate system before the game is fully finished shows where their priority lies. There is no reason for them to go about this route. Always breaking the game with recent patches and then never compensating the players because Early Access is an excuse to up a game. Push a game breaking update from PTS to Stable when they knew in PTS it was busted but that Crate system needed to get in.Update to review Game has alot of hackers it seems like lately. I feel like their number of cheaters reported are inflated. Also the servers are very inconsistent and the game itself it largely unpolished. Update 2 since 1.0 game is in a worse state than ever. Hackers are rampant because ""Cheating is more accepted in China"" and the main focus is really on paid crates and limiting how much people make money on their crate system. Ballistics are crap and anti cheat is the most laughable thing ive seen on a game since WarZ. I am having more fun playing on laggy escape from tarkov and Fortnite than this.Yet there are more people who wanna deny the hacking than people who deny auchwitz. I just dont get where the priorities are for this company. It is about releases on different platforms crates and everything. Where they can make the next dollar. This game shouldn't have come out of early access if they can't handle cheaters. There needs to be a region lock for certain playerbases if they cant be responsible enough to stop the hacking. But then again they don't care. When Uplay is more adept at taking care of hackers you know you are just flat out bad. I notice a common theme when I die and that is it is always a chinese name. Almost never skill (except a couple times where i screwed up) its either laggy players or hackers. Either way they need to go. Other than that the game itself is just horribly optimized and tweaks need to be made to cameras of the players. The newer ballistics system is more random than anything else and has made the game way harder than it should be . This is just making H1Z1 look more and more appealing than anything. Least they know how to handle ping abusers and cheaters. Fortnite a free to play game deals with these issues and has better optimization than PUBG and definately has less money in their budget for the game. It just shows more and more that the main issue with the game is the lack of care the devs have for the community and their game. Steam should see how bad games get sometimes and offer refunds to players who deal with this. Update 3 so still in this state they have improved upon it however the new hacking epidemic is the macro users. The devs upgraded the servers so they run smoothly with less disconnecting but it still seems like hit reg is a nightmare. The way throwables are for frags makes no sense as you still take a lot of damage when you should be out of range. The car physics are still abysmal. Weapon balancing did nothing except make smgs the new mid range weapons and all 5.56 weapons trash. The mini is just awful im better off with a pistol and the circle is stupidly aggressive. It just feels like everything is just something they think of last minute. The game itself is fun because of the setting it has but im just waiting for something of the same setting to come around so i can jump ship from this abortion. Whether it be Rings of Elysium which i recommend more than this because even though the servers are in Thailand they run better than PUBG's servers and all their features make for a smoother enjoyable experience.Update 4 Game still continues to be buggy and just an overall mess with this pass just to make more money on an otherwise pretty inconsistent game. Shots don't land where they should and still just overall becomes a fest. Least they seem to have fixed the blantant hacker issue but the no recoil macro people are just all over the place. Just a sloppy mess with the same issues as ROE for less decent features.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's not paid to win at the moment I hope it will stay the same crates are openable with in game earned money there is so much more weapons and different type of vehicles which makes it more interesting also the weapon customization is superb for a Battle Royale game.

Of course there are negatives in the game too like poor loot on some maps or chunky ui or the silly skins to pay and some random little bugs but these are so minor that I personally don't care much cause every game has these too.

2017-09-02,1,3,157,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Why this game was released with the optimization it has is beyond me.

This is terribly game breaking and needs to be fixed ASAP! Performance aside...it is a very fun game. Its a great game held back by lazy optimization.

2018-05-21,0,0,546,False,Not Recommended,Okay so I have been playing this game for quite some time now im a rather patient person and I have been having some serious high hopes that this games developers would actually do something about the hackers they claim to ban people all the time (big whoop buy a new account and continue hacking) 80% of the games I play I get killed by someone through a wall or through trees from a far distance where the shooter never even saw me in the game Ive grown so tired of this problem that I officially regret having ever purchased this game it is finally uninstalled I do NOT advise this game to anyone that hates hackers.Then let me start on the optimization of this game I have upgraded my pc to run this game at 100+ FPS since then they have some minor optimizing but what they constantly ignore is all the bugs ingame like getting stuck on a wall while trying to land after parachuting or the insane amount of times I was riding a bike launch over a wall then randomly explode while not having taking any vehicle damage or let me not get started on the amount of times that I have gotten stuck in walls or fences you end up floating inside a wall or a fence just because you jumped up against it then you naturally need your mates to come knock you down in hopes that you will fall out of the wall (sometimes this works sometimes...) and then ofcourse the latest changes to the weapons which has completely ruined the balance of the game UMP's and Vectors are now the strongest weapons in the game purely because they have next to NO recoil what so ever so forget using your assault rifles pick up those tiny little SMG's and go wreck anyone that has not managed to adjust from the assault rifles.Long story short I dont advise this game to anyone that expects good development or even if you are expecting some sort of realism to the game there is absolutely nothing realistic about this game I cannot count the amount of times that I have heard jokes about this terrible optimization and the so called physics of the game.my verdict started off promosing ending up a terribly crap game thats filled with hackers on all servers absolute waste of time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

While they just added 2 new sets of cosmetics for free.About the actual game It's fun and at first really hard. This is my first battle royale style game and it took me almost 80 hours before i got my first win. But once you get good man every game is fun. Sure every once in a while you'll land somewhere with someone else get unlucky with loot and die. But then you start up again and maybe the next game you get 10 kills or a win or headshot someone 500 meters away or all three.

2017-12-21,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,So after playing this game during its Early Access stage I had a few problems with PUBG Horrible optimization.On low to medium settings I was still getting FPS dips well below 40 on I5 6600k 4.2GHz + GTX1070. And I play at 1080p no AA. My machine can handle ARK on high settings and yet it was suffering every time it had to render a few houses in a field.High lag.The latency (ping) is difficult to fix but that is not my issue. Even with 40ms ping I'm still getting rubber banded every game even when there are only 40 players. Doors don't always react to your input and you're never sure if you picked up that weapon.Low responsiveness.This could be subjective but I need some form of indication that my input does something the moment I press a button. I don't want to wait 6 8 frames for character to start moving. When I shoot and hit a target I want to know I hit that target. More importantly if I missed tell me how I missed I had a few close quarter encounters where I was definetely shooting at someone's face for the game to not register the hit.While the optimization got a lot better (I can run it on Ultra witout AA and get stable 70+ fps) the other problems didn't. I can't say if it's the best Battle Royale out there but I definetely have a different favorite from PUBG which I still find unpleasant to play moment to moment.If you like your game to run smooth as the new DOOM and actually respond to your input instantly I'm afraid PUBG 1.0 still is not that.Oh and there are microtransactions.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,1,2,822,False,Recommended,recently there has been quite a bit of negative reviews some reasons I can relate with and others i cannot one thing that has bugged me with this game is the fact that when I buy crates with battlepoints I usuallly get a crate that i have to pay for to unlock this really bugs me however i've been playing this game since about march april of 2017 and I can say the devs have really been trying hard at this game features such as valuting healing animations optimazations wayyyyy less cheaters constant updates map selection etc. and with this in mind I will really reccomend this game to just about anybody yes it can make you mad yes there are still problems BUT THE DEVS ARE FIXING IT and even in the new update that adds the 6 times and 3 times scopes and loads of new grips sure i may not be a fan of it but it shows that the devs really care about the game overall and i can see much potential with this game as a whole11/10 love you bluehole,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-09,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. To begin with I'm not really a fan of the battle royal genre I find the games mundane. However this game takes the medal for being the most uninteresting and mundane of the masses.It controls like I'm playing Eurotruck Simulator but I have a human character model. There is never a stable connection even on the best of networks it jitters around and can't seem to figure out where to place my character which is just the tip of the problem while I'm looking in my rear view mirror backing my character up and trying to make a right turn around a bend.I'll try to wrap this rant up though the maps are bland open wastelands that just seem to stretch on forever and require a vehicle to pass through them faster because otherwise you are tasked with running around for 15 minutes in a dead and useless landscape just to reach another beige ish shack with 2 stairs up to the top for some sort of items to collect.The character creation although customizable just feels like I'm dressing a manikin not to mention the difficulty in changin the character once it's locked in.I'm not even going to touch on the stupid mistakes the company is making right now either with poorly designed event passes that are shorter and less rewarding than the competition.This is just generally a pathetic bland and uninspired game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Great concept but dont like the first circle the map is to big and way too little vehicle's. The game is very cluncky delayed inputs favors the campers. and more and more cheaters as in every shooting game sadly. Overall good game but with many frustrating elements sadly. Maybe worth it if they fix the lag/networking coding soon.Hope a big company or a company who invests alot in this genre soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I know it's early access but I'm really really sick of the lag and the RNG that goes into this game. Literal weeks of terrible loot and bad luck whenever I land in a town. Not to mention the gunplay can be really really terrible sometimes. Full shotgun blasts to someone right next to you can either completely miss or do t damage. The WORST part is the lag though. The network connections to this game are really ing terrible. I'm tired of seeing someone going back into cover and still dying. Up to half a second after I hid.Game development is actually getting worse. Instead of focusing on frustrating aspects (lack of torque in vehicles which basically makes you a sitting duck if you stop on a hill ing autoplacement into terrible region servers everytime you start the game etc) they're placing useless garbage into the game like weather effects and more guns. SERIOUSLY frustrating.It has been MONTHS and we STILL cannot actually cancel an attempted join to a match.

2017-12-22,1,1,174,False,Not Recommended,After many mixed feelings throughout playing this game and much deliberation in the hopes that this game gets better I can't put this off any longer. It wasn't the lack of fixing for the plethora of issues nor was it the fact that the devs never listen to the community. Now you don't even get points for winning. This game is always has been and always will be filled with bugs because fixing issues is not the concern of the devs. Despite all the issues the most inexcusable bug comes from the one reason most play the game. Winning. I played 3 games of the 1.0 update and in the first realized not a single issue of importance had been fixed. On my third game I won and screencapped as I always do for proof. I won 995 points killing the final player as I rejoice to myself. As I load back to the main screen...I am hit with a horrowing realization that this game has managed to get even worse. I only have 860bp which is what I had last. Not a single point from my win transfered over making that entire trial that grind worth nothing.Chances are I'm not the only one this has happened to and I doubt I'll be the last. Considering that Bp in this game actually is worth money since you can buy crates I wasted time and money because the developers care so little about their players. Having to spam F or drag items into your inventory for a solid minute while everyone else gets guns to kill you as you struggle to perform a basic function is one thing just like how sometimes you actually just die because the door closes on you. Those glitches happen and we're used to them.Getting completely and utterly slapped in the face by a company that cares none for its players by making the one accomplishment achievable worthless even if only on a small percentage chance is far from acceptable. This was just one of many flaws in this game but it was the final straw that made me leave a negative review. The current standing for reviews on this game rests at mixed and I truly hope it hits negative for a wakeup call. I'll go over some of the more base issues that rest in this game. Horrible item spawn patterns (You often find 3 4x scopes in the same room and none anywhere else) Horrible shooting mechanics (Even with a stable connection you can shoot a non moving target at point blank and the bullet will miss) Horrible starting lag (The most crucial part for most matches is the start in which you will spend a full minute trying to pick up one gun and a single box of ammo) Horrible driving mechanics (Do you like flipping 3 times when you hit a rock? This game is for you.) Horrible BP distribution (Pretty sure they lowered the rate it's giving for 1.0 ) Horrible reward for winning considering you might get nothing at all for it There are other things here and there you could gripe about but these are the biggest and most relevant. I truly wish I could refund this game because of this update it has become even more broken than it once was. I have a lot of hours in this game and I don't want them back but considering the game has become unplayable now I would like my money back. I enjoyed the game despite how bad it is at its core but now I can't even enjoy it to the slightest since my one incentive is gone. Fix the game (Which they won't) or hopefully get the Negative review standpoint on steam that you deserve.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The server lag is also unbearable sometimes probably just due to an awful netcode.The game just screams early access which it is and that's okay but what's not okay is trying to sell loot boxes and keys in an unfinished early access game. I have played the game for as long as I could bear these things including in solos duos and groups and honestly it's mostly just a waste of time and a great way to lose up to hundreds of hours with nothing to show for it except for a couple screen shots.If you want a battle royale game just go play fortnite it runs great looks great plays better and it's free.

2017-03-31,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,This game needs to be seriously optimized. I love everything about the game and wish to play it but I have a lower end PC and have to usually have most things like Anti Aliasing off completely. This game has most things like that but there is no off for it only very low. Even on a lower resolution this game runs poorly. I got a max of 13 fps while in game. I feel like the audience for this game would be greatly increased if the devs focused on optimization and then focused on new things.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-28,0,0,756,True,Recommended,This is the first review I've ever written and after 60 plus hours of play time I guess it's time that I give my opinion. This is one of the first video game for any type console that I have actually played or purchased over the past 15 years and it was a great choice in my opinion. At times I have had issues with the game locking up or freezing but these issues have gotten much better during the past few weeks. You definitely need to invest in some quality head phones to play this game and hopefully they will be able to get the audio/sound issues corrected very soon. At times I've had to stop playing due to getting headaches from all the loud effects and gun shots you hear during game play and the audio/sound issues would have to be my biggest complaint with the game. You definitely have to listen out for your opponents in this game or your game will end very soon. I have made numerous attempts to adjust the game audio and sound on my computer but I can t seem to get it right. I've read and heard several other players complaining about this same issue and we are all hoping this fix is on the agenda and soon!! The only other issue or complaint I have with this game is the lack of a training area where new players could learn the basic game functions and allow the player to get familiar with the weapons. I know that continued game play will help in achieving this but it can suck having to restart over time and time again and in many cases you still didn t get the opportunity to obtain any experience before your killed again. LOL. I actually have a few friends who have stopped playing the game because of this very issue but I refuse to give up and plan on conquering PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds one day. If you have not played this game yet you are definitely missing out!! I definitely recommend in adding this game to your collection!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-03,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,I played this game on my phone after being hardcore fortnite for a few months. It really was a better experience at first so I bought the PC edition but there are definitely more cons than pros. For instance the game simply does NOT run smooth. Even with an 850m GEFORCE GTX graphics card I can only play this game on VERY LOW graphics and still only maintain 30 40 fps. On top of the constant crashes and loading screens you get stuck at. Another thing this game costs $30 off steam correct? You earn currensy in the game by playing rounds earning more currensy the better you do. The only thing you can spend this currensy on (other than changing your character appearance for a ridiculous amount) is to buy loot crates that contain clothing items. Fun right? Wrong! These crates then require you to BUY A KEY WITH REAL MONEY. EACH KEY COSTS $2.50. SO YOU PLAY THE GAME TO EARN CREDITS TO GET CRATES TO SPEND MORE REAL MONEY JUST TOP OPEN THE CRATES YOU BOUGHT WITH YOUR IN GAME CURRENSY. So I spent $30 on a game that is at BEST mediocre compared to other battle royales and the only way to open my 10 crates is to spend $25 real life dollars. Absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. After a few chicken dinners and countless game crashes/ruined games because of peoples play styles (camping in the corners of three story houses not making a single footstep while peaking at the staircase in third person) my friends and I have made the switch to Ring of Elysium. Ring of Elysium is currently only available in Thailand but you can find videos on how to download it in the States (Where I am). Pubg is a disgrace and it on its own customer base. This game has so many issues I guarentee it's not worth buying. Get Ring of Elysium or fortnite for free even if the graphics are not as great the games simply run SO much smoother and do not try to rob your wallet even after making 10 times their projected sales.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-02,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,Before I get roasted hardcore from all the haters and PubG fanboys/fangirls/fangenders... I want to say that the devs were on the right track. If done right in the future this game can reach a status so legendary that it can possibly top all the MMO's currently out such as World of Warcraft GTA V Rainbow 6 Siege and more!You can disagree all you want but this is true if done correctly. Now to why I downvote this game.In its' current state there are numerous issues that make this game difficult stressful and nearly impossible to play. I will be putting them in list format and explain a few. Hackers/Exploiters/Glitchers Asian/Europeans filling NA servers (possibly vice versa. Haven't tested nor confirmed.) General Loot Spawn Movement/Controls Weapon statistics (Damage range abilities fire rate recoil etc.) Hit Registration/High Pingers High Ping Servers/Matches Vehicle Stability/Vehicles in General Useful Player Options (Map Selection matches based on rank/skill)So the ones I want to cover are these Hackers/Exploiters/Glitchers. Asian/Europeans filling NA Servers. Hit Registration/Unstable Servers &amp Matches. Player Movement.1.) Hackers are a major issue. Within a time span of 4 hours my crew and I managed to run into 3 confirmed hackers and possibly another 15 more unconfirmed but were suspicious. Thing is there's nothing we can do about it! All we get is a death cam and a report button for a dude locking onto heads without the need to ADS with a P19C and over 200 rounds. Rainbow 6 Siege has a lovely Ban feed which allows players to know that their software actually works but PubG offers no confirmation on any bans made to hackers/possible hackers. (Let's say general cheaters.) which honestly sucks! I'll never know if ButtLicker69xXFazeXx got banned or not. This needs to be fixed ASAP!!!2.) Aahh.. Asians on US Servers. Not a very rare sight to see as it happens to all games! World of Warcraft Rainbow 6 Siege DayZ World of Tanks etc. But in this case it is consistent well known and what's worse is that nothing is being done about it. For the 30+ hours I have played I can say with as much disgust possible that I have never been in a stable PubG match (solo or otherwise perspective as well) with no Asians or Europeans. Never. Meaning you have players with 500+ ping bolting around you like Dash from the Incredibles and you're just sitting there trying to hit something that already lit you up 20 times over. Terrible I say!3.) This coincides with #2. Going straight to the point you can lock onto someone's head (legitimately no hacks) with a Kar98k. Sitting on a radio tower with an 8x scope cheek pad and compensator and fire away! Oh what's that? You are clearly shooting at a stationary target's head and chest but bullets seem to go through them? OH WAIT! You shot someone in the head point black with the new Sawed Off but he can still stand and unload an M249 into you and heal as if nothing happened? Hit Registration is absolutely garbage and sparratic random. Along with the unstable high ping servers bonded with the already 500+ ping Asians on US servers and you have yourself an impossible target. 4.) Movement is extremely janky. First Person is all I play and when I turn it feel as if I am attempting to turn a Semi Truck with no power steering (Yes I have driven large automobiles such as Semi Trucks with no power steering. Not fun.) Movement is awkward which included proning crouching and recovering from them. Jumping swiming driving parachuting the new vaulting... It's extremely bad.I am not going to offer solutions as I am in no position to do so due to many reasons including little to no knowledge in game developement. But what I do know is that games can come a long way and as players WE made your game know. WE play your game. WE bought your game. You owe us an enjoyable experience and as players WE depend on YOU Game Devs to give us that experience we were promised.Also game uninstalled from my library due to a possible art copyrights?! So I have to sit through a long install once more because someone forgot to credit someone??? Absolutely disgusting... For those that want to buy this game buy it at your own risk and willingly. It's broken it's unenjoyable but if you wanna give this game a chance then more power to ya!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-04,0,0,519,False,Recommended,Notice how most of the negative reviewers have 100 1000 hours played. The game is fun and well worth playing. Cheating is not as rampant as the negative reviews might make you think. Particularly since the addition of the death cam it's now easier than ever to find and report cheaters.I can mention only few games that can provide as much value as PUBG. It's 30 and I've clocked over 400 hours and I'm not done yet. The game is being updated continuously and each update is typically an improvement. I doubt I can find any game wherein the haters have clocked as many hours as PUBG. But I get how it can be frustrating to lose a round because of a glitch or a bug or cheater (which is a rare occurrence) but those are present in all competitive games. So if you're on the fence about getting PUBG don't be. It's without a doubt the best battle royale game on the market today.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,614,True,Not Recommended,Oh PUBG how do I explain what makes this game both great and yet at the same time a total ing dumpster fire? TLDR 10/10 would play Potato Simulator again. If the game gets optimized and they fix the server issues / hacking then I would definitely recommend it. While yes I do greatly enjoy the game there are times its made me want to (literally not metophorically) punt a small child into a volcano. Just a few examples for all of you who are wondering about getting it.Pros There are some awesome moments out there that make you want to come back for more. Nothing is more satisfying then cooking yourself up a DELICIOUS chicken dinner. This is especially true because unless by some stroke of luck you get one early on (or you are just really good) you could concievably not see a dinner until you are 50 hours in. Now as many people have stated this game is exponentially better with friends. I've come to notice getting Solo wins is much much harder. Both because its you vs 99 other people with no help from anyone and because chances are you will get mulched or turned into pudding without knowing what happened. Duo and Squad offer great communication enjoyable gun fights (more on this later) and some absolutely hilarious moments. I told a guy who's team I just killed he could join us only until we stopped and he was left to rot in the middle of the desert. In game chat can be a gold mine at times and a total nuclear wasteland at others.Cons Prepare you because its about to get ruined. The one take away from all these reviews is this game runs like steaming garbage... It's basically like someone with two broken legs trying to crawl to the hospital. While yes some mechanics are cool they are horribly unoptamized and some are flat out broken. You could hit one of the VW busses with a bike and send your target into the next dimension. Thats just one example of the thousands of game breaking bugs that occur almost every game. Hackers hackers hackers. Player Unknown's Battlegrounds huh I could have swarn I bought Hacking Simulator 2017. At one point it wasn't that bad maybe 1 in 10 matches. Then for some entirely unjustified reason Bluehole / PUBG Corp decided to let in the Chinese. (It wasn't the letting China in that was a problem. IT was the way it was done and how it worked out) Now about every other game you have a pretty high probability of running into a hacker. Hope you like getting aimbotted bud.Gun play basically is a shot in the dark. Its both satisfying but underneath you realize it can be totally ed. Zeroing is absolutely insane and good luck adjusting perfectly to hit someone 400 plus meters out. If they aren't standing still you might as well be out the car window into your own face. Bullet damage is broken shotguns are still disgusting. Basically unless you really follow up on your shots and dump a decent amount of ammo into someone chances are you will underestimate how many bullets you need to down someone. Even then the bullet damage can just not register and you're still screwed.Finally the damn loot boxes in EA. First off don't sell loot boxes that contain items that in reality DO HELP YOU HIDE. Also for some reason streamers have items we can't have? Thats not even that bad but to claim that the trench coats don't help hide you is ludacris. BUT FINE we accept it. Then you go and lie and say there wont be payed loot boxes in EA. outta here. Take Away I would love to recommend this game. I really would I just cant. Unless you have a pretty decent rig a literal ing endless amount of patience. You will get angry and it'll be often. OR you are a masachist. Ultimately this game has tons of potential but is severly handicapped by the devs and frankly their absolute lack of common sense. Chances are PUBG will go the way of the dinosaurs if they don't get it together.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Learn the maps learn your pros and cons learn every weapon and be aggressive and most importantly have fun. I definately recommend this game to the players who are into FPS games for a while. A record breaking game with a mind blowing Graphics and players.

2017-08-27,0,0,514,False,Not Recommended,Best asset flip of 2017.PUBG has a neat concept. It's not an original concept as they'd like to claim since they stole the idea from H1Z1 but the high stakes matches are fun. The problem is that in the end it alwyas comes down to who has the better sniper rifle.Net code and hit detection is terrible as servers run at an inconsistently low update rate (about half that of Fortnite's which itself is a very casual game). Melee weapons simply don't work. Parachuting frequently bugs out and throws you off buildings.Visually the game belongs in 2011. Crysis had better graphics than this and ran better and that was 11 years ago. It doesn't help that the art style is inconsistent and bland with no real identity not helped by their overuse of store assets (almost all the default weapons are from asset packs)I recently got caught in the 16th June ban wave which was 'hastily' reversed. And by hastily I mean it took them 15 hours. No real apology or explanation was forthcoming and I only got a stock response from their support team written in broken English.Bluehole are a terrible development company and no one should be supporting them by buying this game it's loot boxes or cosmetics.

Bullets and hit box consistency issues and bugs. Also kind of a deal where its the best camper wins. The mechanics they built in to stop camping and move people together just favor those sitting in the right spot. You can get in to the top 10 every time if you just grab an 'ok' gun then drive to the center and hide in a bush shooting people running back 'in bounds'. No skill required. The last 10 is all luck depending on how they shrink the zone and where you happen to be sitting. The guns handle like poop. The random spawns are cool and all and I guess equal opertninty but there is nothing like landing checking 3 houses and having no guns only to have someone find you who has 3 guns and shoots you down. Not much fun there. Most matches are insanely slow and boring and end with someone hitting you one or two times before you can pick them out if you are moving. Or they are long and slow while you camp waiting for someone to walk by.. Boring.. . Basically its a game of who sees who first. Do NOT spend money on this trash.

I would say 1 out of every 5 matches will have a chinese hacker in it and you will die from a head shot from almost a kilometer away. Also desync is bad and performance although improved is still The game is allot of fun but i will not recomend until there is a better anti cheat system. i recorded several vids of getting wrecked by hackers at end game (sometimes whole squads of hackers) and it takes months for the admins to do anything about it but will eventually get done still doesnt change that there are thousands of hackers. another point is they should offer a region locked servers that also auto kick high pings,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The gameplay is adrenaline pumping every decision feels like it counts and the punishment for dying actually matters unlik most modern shooters.3. Advice Turn off voice chat completely all people do is abuse the game's unbalanced audio mixing and scream like in the pre game lobby and inside the plane. Play with friends the fun is damn near endless with friends while playing alone i can usually only handle about 2 4 matches depending on how well i'm performing.4.

Aimbot from across the map ESP locating items anywhere on the map not to mention you can disable grass rocks even trees from appearing simply by editing your ini files. Sloppy shameful coding. Wait until Blueballs gets their ing act together.No I can't recommend it while they push features over optimizations. The fog patch pushed it over the edge for me because it forced post processing on lowering framerates across the board from low end potatoes to supercomputers by about 20FPS.
