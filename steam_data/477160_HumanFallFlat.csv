The controls in this game are painful, and not in the mental sense. After a few minutes you can already start to feel your hands totally shutting down. I have tried for hours and hours to have the fun that I 100% expected to find in this game. I went in to this game with a very open mind, the possibility of this game being awful hadn't even crossed my mind when booting it up.

84,75981428,english,"An idiotic puzzle game that will make you laugh and hurt your cheeks. Jam solo or with up to 8 friends and have an unforgettable time. This unity made game is a masterpiece of its kind. Being a puzzle game it accomplishes a good balance between easy and hard mode spectrum. Any age group can enjoy this short game, even on an outdated rig. The game provides 14 unique maps with different puzzles and art style.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The gameplay is all clumsy, the controls don't seem as though they would work, but weirdly enough for this game they do. Your wobbly character is on a floating level and tries to pass the hurdles without failing. Some of the time, the game wants you to think out of the box, but sometimes there are direct solutions. The game mechanics work in the co-ordination of camera and hands. You raise your hands to grab, pick, or climb over an object. The up or down camera movement determines whether you want to pick an object or climb up your lower body. Spam jumping is quite fun and looks hilarious. As the levels have checkpoints, you can pretty much recover from any mistake. If you are playing with a friend, only one player needs to reach the checkpoint to make everyone spawn from the same spot.

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
The graphics are not realistic nor too janky. They have a unique clay-ish art style, also known as a solid mesh which is perfectly molded by the designer. You won’t find any incomplete areas on the map. Unity equals all the elements in your design, making sure every element feels like they belong in your design. Initial maps can look somewhat basic, but as the game progresses, the quality increases. The lighting is done cleverly; even if you are passing through a tunnel, your vision will be clear.

[h1]Main Pros and Cons:[/h1]

[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Low system requirements
    [*]Lobby up to 8 players
    [*]Light hearted fun
    [*]Playable by all ages
    [*]Wide variety of character skins in steam workshop
    [*]Music/Sound fits the game
    [*]If you get skilled enough you can learn new shortcuts 
    
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Short in walkthrough length 
    [*]Can feel stressful to certain group
    [*]Feels repetitive as the game progresses
[/list]

 [h1] Miscellaneous Information:[/h1]

[b]How you start-[/b]
Your character Bob falls from the sky onto a dreamscape. His appearance is all-white with a baseball cap. You can either paint him manually, select pre-made demo characters, or add from the workshop. Then the game proceeds to teach about controls using narration and video tutorials.

[b]Levels-[/b]
The game offers 12 main and 2 newly added maps, also termed as “dreams”. Along with them, there are 2 gorgeous lobby maps to roam around till your friend is connected or is AFK. Every dream/level has a certain theme like water, factory, ice which contains puzzles accordingly. The average time needed to complete a map can be around 30-40mins, but it can increase with each level increment.

[b]Steam workshop-[/b]
Surprisingly, the steam workshop is immensely filled with character models counting the numbers up to 240,000. You can choose any character from anime to Hollywood movie to dinosaurs to occupation to animals. There are a lot of level designs submitted too, and those numbers are increasing fast due to the popularity of the level editor.

 [b]Level editing competitions-[/b]
As the game is encouraging people to create some maps for the game through their level builder tutorials, there have been competitions hosted with a prize pool of $10,000. This interaction with the community is highly appreciated, and the winning maps are later on added to “extra dreams”. The factory map was a result of these competitions and is highly liked by the players.

[h1]Honest Rating:[/h1]
After completing the game multiple times, we can conclude that the game has potential, and a lot of things can be enhanced by time. But according to the price and unique concept, this game is worth a try. The game provides laughter, which is all we need these days.

The gameplay consists of looking around to see what sort of environment you're in, and investigating things you can move, then scratching your head for a bit to work out how to solve the immediate problem.  Usually, the problems are fairly straightforward in understanding what to do, but actually doing it is somewhat more challenging!

this game is very VERY silly in a million ways. the character you play as flops around levels and has incredibly sticky hands. while it does get tedious sometimes, its still very charming. all the levels have multiple casual puzzles to solve while you look at the preeeetty sweet scenery (mostly in later levels). the amount of easter eggs and achievements are both fun and rewarding.

[b][h3]cons[/h3][/b]
as you march into the later levels, you will notice that they become increasingly longer and more tedious. it can be incredibly frustrating to have a crucial item to drop down into the void, or fall all the way down after climbing for ages. also this game can make you WANT TO THROW YOUR MONITOR OUT OF A WINDOW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

[b][h3]bottom line[/h3][/b]
human fall flat is a very fun game that i kind of left sitting in my library, but im glad i picked it up again. the game is very charming and simple. the longer levels and frustration can be remedied if you're interested in taking shortcuts and thinking like a speedrunner because wooooosh gotta go fast sonic hahahahhahahaa

Human Fall Flat is one of the games that must need rewarded for their originality. You have to solve puzzle maps according to the realistic game physics. First times it can be complicated to complete levels, especially without help. Although, this game is supposed to challenge and puzzle your brain, so you must be sure before you buy it.
There's a discreet number of levels and optimal (almost infinite) personalizations of your character right away.
You will laugh a lot, if you play Human Fall Flat with your friends: I suggest you to try this mode, it's the best!
What about the other two game modalities? 
▪the Single-player mode is set in standard maps, personally I wouldn't play this mode in the long term 'cause the game becomes repetitive and boring alone;
▪then you can join other unknown players, but (personal experience) often some errors or crash occur, other participants 
sometimes expel you or you just lag for the whole match.
Here is why playing with friends is the best way to face this game, in my opinion.
I'd like to see in this game a public session with more than 8 players, where you have different challenges, like a battle royale game. But lots of troubles might occur, first of all the lag. 
To sum up, I certainly recognise this game is unique and funny, but not long lasting.",1596973819,1596973819,True,8,0,0.641693830490112305,0,True,False,False,76561198430294002,15,6,540,0,540,1594503269

If you're planning to get this game as a solo experience than remember to bring a sleeping bag of some sort because this game gets unbelievably boring. It starts pretty solid but once you're a few levels in you're just running around clueless on what to do or desperately trying to pass an obstacle that relies on the game's physics. The music can keep you distracted until it ends and you're just left with dead silence until you eventually progress. Also Multiplayer mode is pretty garbage too. I've read somewhere that if the host has a poor connection or you do then it will be a little rough which is to be expected. What I didn't expect was an entire second of input delay and that's being generous because when you press the jump button it'll either take an entire second until the game responds or it doesn't respond at all. So in Multiplayer you're just being dragged along by the host. Just look around for another ragdoll game",1594154277,1594414322,True,0,0,0.481605350971221924,0,True,False,False,76561198372173212,62,32,1173,0,272,1595454352

98,72130303,english,"the only defect is a camera move.

this game's camera is snapped to the character's head which swinging all the time u play, as some game play videos show in Youtube. (Caution: the official sample video's camera is fixed for shooting these trailers by the developer, so there is no such a mode to fix the camera in the game itself.)

so u will get motion sickness after 10min or so, that's why i don't recommend this game.

if the developer gave us the way to fix the camera (= to turn off the camera shaking), ill change this review to thumbsup. i cannot believe they left it even today.

カメラ最悪：
複数の欠陥がある。ひとつはカメラ。頭部に固定されてしまっているため、ただでさえグネグネうごく人形に合わせて視界も常時揺れる。これを固定するオプションはない。よってすぐ３Ｄ酔いする。

操作性の悪さ：
そしてもうひとつは操作性。常にワンテンポ遅れる。ＵＮＩＴＹゲーム特有のモッサリ感。このせいでジャンプ後につかまる作業がおよそ成功しない。また変な慣性もついており、狭い足場にとどまることも困難。というか移動キーから手を離しているのに、カメラで見回しただけでヨタヨタと数歩移動してしまうおかしな仕様。おそらく簡単にクリアさせないための作者独自の改悪と思われ。そのせいでアスレチックアクションなのにまともにアスレチックできない。これを上記のカメラで行わねばならないのだから、なおさら３Ｄ酔いが多発。

ストレージ大食い：
マルチプレイの鯖リストで他人が初期以外のＤＬＣを使ってると、鯖へ実際にインしなくてもSTEAM Workshopのデータが勝手に \SteamApps\workshop\content\477160 に溜まっていく仕組み。だから定期的に掃除しないとストレージがパンパンになる。ゲーム自体は500MBらしいが、遊んでもいないワークショップのＤＬＣがダラダラ落ちてくるため数ＧＢ以上へ膨れ上がる。

結論：
ってことで、おすすめできない。カメラと操作性を直せば良ゲーになりうるが、発売から日にちが経ってなお放置してるところを見ると、変なこだわりを捨てずにあえて放置している、客のほうを向いてないデベロッパのように思われる。彼らにも読めるよう英語でレビューを書き、フォーラムでの通報もしておいたが、まあ期待はできないだろう。直したらサムズアップするつもり。",1593997426,1594278933,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197988258743,180,29,926,15,30,1601640423

Skins - because uploading even the slightest changes and recolors is easy without any sort of quality advisory, categorization (painted, recolor or image based) or tutorialization on how to make good skins, in-game, the workshop ends up being flooded with tens of thousands of low quality uploads.

Levels - while there are some good ones here and there, they're few and completely buried under the sheer flood of chinese made low quality content, which feature unknown writings, dubious thumbnails, dubious scripts (these are unity levels that can be freely scripted to do anything - malicious scripts are a possibility and may damage your computer) and strange cultural fluff that has nothing to do with the game but act more as an advert or postcard.

- Very entertaining to play with friends, you literally cry out of laughter when playing this.
- Supports Steam Workshop - countless blob skins can be downloaded and you can create one yourself!
- Puzzles are challenging - solving some puzzles took hours (unless you have 5head friends, I got Pepega ones).
- There are alternative ways to complete each puzzle.
- 14 different levels - initially the game had only one level, but gradually they added 13 more for free which is great.

10/10 would recommend buying the game to defy the rules of physics to grab the butt of my friend.

My pals and I just recently finished all available levels and have never felt so fulfilled since we started gaming together. It's very simple in concept, but so very fun in execution. The thought that gets put into every puzzle, every secret, every finish has thought and importance. Sound and music isn't common in the game, but the subtle sound effects are funny (such as bumping your head on a plank) and the music that does play is always great. My favorite is ""Sail Away"" from the Water level. We're going to be diving into custom levels shortly and plan to replay all the main levels with a few more friends in the near future to discover all the stuff we missed. I would definitely recommend playing this with friends over playing solo, it enhances the experience to work as a team in this game. I've heard joining random servers doesn't make for the best experience, although I can't speak for that as we've only played in ours (which does get guests time-to-time who we will play with unless they're asshats who sabotage). 100% recommended experience.

The way the characters move and do things is so wobbly and clumsy and hilarious.

Even performing simple tasks like opening a door or picking up a box feel silly and awkward but aren’t frustrating. All the puzzles can be completed solo, but it is more fun to play with other people, even if you spend more time agitating each other than finishing the puzzle.

The physics are well programmed and i've never had any glitches. Once you get familiar with the controls it becomes a blast to play just for the sake of speed running each level and doing all the achievements. As of rn I have 100% beaten the game and got all the achievements, the first game I have ever done that on. If you love physics games than I highly recommend this and to challenge yourself to see how fast you can beat the game(Record is under 7 minutes). If you want a game to laugh at with your friends? Then I also highly recommend this game. If you don't like puzzles, have no friends, and take life too seriously then this game is probably not for you.

Also the developers released a free new level as part of the game, not a paid DLC and that's nice to see

[b] Is this game worth my money? [/b]
Yes, although I would recommend getting it on sale. 

[b] Is this game good gameplaywise? [/b]
Yes, especially with the continued community support.

[b] Is this game fun? [/b]
Undoubtedly, but you and at least one other friend needs to have it for it to be fun.

[b] 8/10 [/b]


[h1] Full [/h1]

For my ranking of games, I use 3 distinct criteria:

     [b] 1.	Pricing [/b]

At the time of this review I have 18 hours on Human: Fall Flat and I paid about $11 AUD (about $7.50 USD) for the game. This equates to:
     18:11 = ~1:0.61
This means that for every hour of Human: Fall Flat I played at the time of this review I paid 0.61 cents in Australian Dollars (or about 0.42 USD). This is really good money-wise, although it must be said that I got this game on sale. I would definitely recommend doing the same.

8/10 for this section.


     [b] 2.	Gameplay [/b]

Truth be told, the gameplay isn’t very interesting in Human: Fall Flat, but that’s because it doesn’t need to be. It’s the most basic thing one could think of: if your hand touches something, it sticks. That’s it. But what Human’s levels do with this mechanic is nothing short of genius. The levels take this mechanic and push it to its absolute limit. You’re frequently being flung across the levels or grabbing on to your friend’s back for dear life. While the levels do get old fairly quickly, continuous support for the Steam Workshop by the developers really help this game stay fresh. Most notably, the recent Workshop competitions bring out the best creativity in people.

7/10 for this section.


     [b] 3.	Personal enjoyability [/b]

Oh my god this game is fun. Honestly this game is almost perfect when it comes to how much I enjoy it (may I mention the aforementioned flinging across the map?). There is one major detriment to Human’s enjoyability, and that is its total reliance on you making your own fun with friends. It’s a sandbox with wacky physics, but it’s not at all fun by yourself. If multiplayer wasn’t an option this game wouldn’t nearly be as popular or good as it is. Don’t get this game if you don’t have a friend who’s also willing to get it and play it with you.

9/10 for this section.

Anyways the concept of the game is simple but allows for a lot of possibilities, and performing simple acts such as lifting a lever or navigating terrain can be entertaining, though I can imagine some would find it a little frustrating. My favorite part is the music. I'm about to go on a tangent, but I was expecting the music to be wacky and silly, because that's what the game is. But instead it alludes to the more poetic nature of the game about struggle, adversity, and triumph. It makes me want to engage in a new level with my head held high and see what happens. My only criticisms are the laggy online multiplayer and it looking like a very quick port from the Xbox version, but those didn't take away from my experience of the game, save for the multiplayer, but I think that may be more of a fault on my old computer than the game.",1591488435,1591488435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198101626716,32,1,1423,53,1320,1600970398

Old review:
[strike]
[h1] WTF was this game!!! [/h1] (The worst game experience I ever have!)

#1
[b] The control was absolutely fucked up! [/b]
How can the little guy grabs the ground instead of other items all the time!!!
Using the visual to adjust this guy's hands? It's so weird that you can only see one small part of the scene all the time. e.g. When you move stuff, you can only look up!
The little guy cannot even stand still on a small slope when I was trying to finger out what to do next! 

#2
[b] The auto checkpoint is seriously unreasonable! [/b]
Reviving on a different map? It happened dozen of times! 
You cannot save the game progress! If you messed up, you can only go to last checkpoint (without change anything but your location) or restart level!

#3
[b] You cannot run! [/b]
If you always messing up (because of its suck control), it will waste a bunch of your time on repeating and repeating ...
In some situation, the distance between the items are longer than regular, you can only make that jump in a very precisely calculation (you will try many many and many times).

#4
[b] I don't know what will happen next! [/b]
It is good for players to find their own way. But when I stuck on a simple puzzle for half an hour, there wasn't a simple hint! 

#5
[b] One positive: the idea of the game is unique and great! [/b]


I only finished the game about 70% right now, and I messed up. I need to restart the level and I gave up. My finger is pain and I'm totally in an angered mood. I have no idea what will happen next, but fortunately, I‘m done it today![strike][/spoiler]",1482926763,1590969024,True,0,1,0.38990098237991333,1,True,False,False,76561198256400571,292,54,329,0,,1514986423

30,67798251,english,"Human: Fall Flat is a hilarious, entertaining, and straight up wacky game. And it's great... for the first 3 hours. We'll get to that later. For now, let's talk about the pros.

            The physics in this game are hilarious. You can grab your friend and throw them off the map. Only for them to grab the ledge and now you're both hanging off the map!(I really recommend playing this game with a friend). 
             The movement itself is something to behold. You’re constantly wobbling and flopping around everywhere. When your character moves a switch, they’re moving their entire body and it’s hilarious. The goofy physics are so well done that it is able to differentiate itself from other puzzle platformers.

	    So how do the puzzles mesh up with physics? Well really well for the first ⅔ of the game. The puzzles aren’t too long. They feel the perfect length, and they all introduce a new type of puzzle. 	
The pacing feels perfect for these first ⅔. It always feels like there’s something happening, and that combined with the constant goofiness of playing with a friend makes the game a joy to play. But it’s time to talk about the big things holding this game back.

	There are a lot of things this game tries to do that just doesn’t work. This game has sections of precise platforming. And it just doesn't work in the 3D environment combined with the ragdoll physics. And it can be pretty frustrating. 
         Also, while the first ⅔ of the game have nice pacing and short and sweet levels, I can’t say the same for the later levels. They are too long and very tedious with pretty boring mechanics. For example, in one of the levels you are tasked with putting coal on a conveyor to go into a truck. You then drive the truck on a pretty long road. Then light the coal burners, and put the coal in it. Tell me that’s fun. It’s not. I just can’t see how this made it into the game. It’s boring, tedious, and just not fun.

         In Conclusion, I think this game has a great ⅔ and very lackluster last 3rd. With some very bad puzzle design in my opinion. So much so that I didn’t even finish the game because there was no point in wasting my time in something that wasn’t fun. (Also my game crashed at the very, very end of the level, after spending 30 minutes on that level. lol). I still recommend this game for the exceptional first ⅔. Maybe wait for a sale. But hey, you might disagree with me. Thanks for reading my review.

EDIT: I went back and finished the game and while I do stand by my opinion I do think so of the later levels are better.",1587534873,1590612380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198983148817,43,14,4076,0,462,1596222160

The workshop is what mainly keeps the game alive and some of the levels are just really creative. Even in the base game I was able to sink 20 hours into it just because of how much fun it was. (On Console) The ragdoll physics and the overall aesthetic of this game is yes. Again, get the steam version if you really want to have the full experience and not have to pay $20-$60 a year to play online.

Here's a list of things the steam version introduces:

I've spend lots of time just throwing my friends of the map for fun or just screwing around the map completely skipping puzzles.

The controls are easy to learn, but will always be shit. Don't see it as a bad thing: it leads to fun and hilarious moments for you and your friends. 

The puzzles are relatively straight forward, but the challenge is controlling your little guy anyway. Every map has some things to explore, so they are somewhat replayable.

It looks absolutely adorable and cartoonish, which fits the goofy nature of the game.

Above all else: the OST is beautiful. It's honestly one of the best soundtracks I've heard in videogames.

62,68589891,english,"I did not enjoy this game and eventually gave up at the halfway point. Not because it is an inherently BAD game, it's a good game, but there are some aspects of it that make it, in my opinion, more frustrating than it's worth. 

PROS: Huge variety of achievements for a game of its size, which will have you coming back to play it multiple times
Environments are very clean-looking and fun to explore 
Music is good when it's present (see below) 
Customizing your character is really fun 
Every level is themed differently 

CONS 
You have to control each arm individually, and click to grab things. However, there is no priority given to objects that are important to grab (a lever, a door handle, a box) versus the floor or a wall. For some people this is part of the fun, but after the tenth time I tried to pull a lever and couldn't because my hand had suctioned to the wall instead, I was fed up. 
You control your arms by moving the camera around. This is fine at first, until you get to the parkour-like sections of something like level six. You have to raise both arms over your head (thus moving the camera into a position where it's looking up at your head from the ground), run, jump, and grab something else. This is extremely difficult when you're forced into a camera angle where you can barely see your feet.
There is good music, but it's only around for a short while in each level and then disappears. It also doesn't match the tone. I expected the game to start giving me meaningful messages about life, because it sounded like something out of a thoughtful documentary.
By far the most frustrating part is that, when you respawn by falling back into the world, you can't get up right away. I feel like a game like this should have you up immediately because it's just so frustrating, but you have to watch your little guy lay there a bit. 

Honestly, I'll probably keep playing because I want those achievements and I want to finish it (since I paid money for it, lol). But it's out of determination, not a sense of fun. I did not have fun while I was playing this game. That may be okay for some people, but it was not for me.",1588648147,1588648147,False,0,0,0.456810623407363892,0,True,False,False,76561198007775522,131,8,242,0,197,1590202202

36,68379266,english,"Human: Fall Flat is a Playable character in a world of NPCs. When you've been playing games your entire life it becomes difficult to find the excitement you had gaming in your youth. Why? Games become stale when you've played hundreds of them. You've seen it all and realize most games are just carbon copies of ideas made by developers long ago or they're just a re-skinned triple A cardboard cut out that repeats annually. The first time I saw Human: Fall Flat was on a twitch stream of two Korean friends hysterically laughing as they fumbled around trying to complete a level. While watching I had the thought ""the physics of this game would probably allow you to climb anything.""  I bought HFF and sure enough you could climb everything. A fact many didn't realize as I had the 2nd video uploaded to youtube ever showing this. https://youtu.be/XNx-NvgyuNc I wasn't the only one as a youtuber named Igor had uploaded a video of climbing just two days prior to my own. https://youtu.be/KO6bNAjwPzc Two different and separate people came to the same realization about a maybe unintended mechanic of a massively popular game. That's the unique beauty of Human: Fall Flat, even before you play it, it sparks your imagination and makes you wonder what is possible. There's no game like HFF other than cheap knock offs that tried and failed to copy it. If you're still on the fence let me provide the side cutter. Human: Fall Flat is one of the best games I've ever played, you can easily spend 100 hours playing it and after that you can learn how to climb and forget what day it is trying to climb to the top of one of those trees on the christmas map.

Human: Fall Flat or HFF for short is a very unique game. You should give this game try.
The puzzles are not that hard to understand but the absurd controls of the game makes it a little bit more harder to do.
all puzzles have multiple solutions or even shortcuts that help you a lot when you understand the controls its not that hard.
Also you should check the community made maps for this game with your friends. Its just so dumb and funny
Also also try to complete achievements they show you a lot of secret places and they are very fun to do.

The controls are a bit frustrated at first. but no overly so, get a bit time to get use to it you are all good. We have many hours of fun. My little girl enjoys dressing up her character, custom paint it and make our characters look like twins. She even gives me advise on how to play. When I was out grocery shopping she can play with her brother and won't be missing me.
Custom map from the workshop has so many added value to the game too!
The music is a masterpiece. First i saw the bundle to buy both game and OST i thought ""why people would buy soundtrack of a silly game?"" I was so surprise when I play the first time and instantly regret i didn't buy the bundle.

The story levels/dream levels are extremely fun to play and I absolutely love how some of the achievements for the game are out of the way and some may be time-consuming. In addition to the dream levels, there are hundreds of workshop maps that will cater to your liking; parkour maps, puzzle maps (i.e. mazes, riddles, sudoku, puzzles, etc.), hide and seek maps, battle arenas (i.e. sword or lightsaber fighting), bunnyhopping maps, etc. Although, I do have to say that finding a really good map after playing all the most popular ones of all time is a bit like finding a needle in a haystack, but it's worth it. 

The levels are meant for you to get from spawn to the exit and there are a couple of tutorial tools IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME to help you (dream level called ""Mansion"" and ""Mountain""), so all those reviews about not knowing what to do in game, did not pay attention to the voice overs or the helpful hints. 

If you play a lot of the workshop maps and can handle the language barrier, I do recommend downloading the Google Translate app on your phone to translate the foreign maps (mainly Chinese). 

Cons:
1. There is camera bobbing, which can get pretty annoying, and the initial few hours of playing this game will give you a headache/motion sickness, so beware of that (my friends and I got used to it eventually).
2. At certain times of the day, if you're playing on a public lobby, either hosting or joining a random lobby, there will be a lot of people, especially children under the age of 15, who will troll you, so also be cautious of that.
3. Sometimes when you're hosting a lobby, some of the interactive parts of the workshop maps will show as moving for you, but not for the other people in your lobby. This is more of a Unity thing from the map's creator part; they may have forgotten to code some of the nodes or whatever for multiplayer version.
4. If you are hosting or joining an online multiplayer lobby, get used to the lag that follows whenever a new person joins the lobby or just the lag between you and the host. Lag happens, get used to it.

Lastly, I concocted a list of great maps to start off with a friend(s) on Reddit. Enjoy! https://www.reddit.com/r/humanfallflat/comments/d6ooko/list_of_great_workshop_levels_to_play/

P.S. Feel free to add me on steam if you want to play with someone. I'll be glad to show you the ropes. If you actually want to find someone to play with at any given time or have questions regarding Unity, workshop building, or some technical stuff, join the official Human: Fall Flat Discord server for a quicker response.",1584943328,1587515774,True,57,8,0.840361893177032471,8,True,False,False,76561198235332708,92,2,50642,1040,33102,1601821253

  The first time I took control of Bob, I staggered carelessly, like a drunk. His hands were both sticky, his walking steps sound was lovely, and he jumped like an inflatable balloon swaying in the wind.
  Bob walks out of his dream by constantly solving mysterious.
  With background music and background vioces,you could play the game slowly and enjoy the different ways out of each fantastic dream. There is no perfect answer to each dream. There may have some shortcuts in many places, which makes the game much more interesting.
  Many of the items in the achievement system are difficult to achieve and many are hard to find. For example, it's easy to get lost when collecting gems in the 'mountains' level. And if you want to stand on the snowman hat at the 'Christmas' level, you need to have a strong climbing ability. From my perspective, the most difficult achievement is time-limited achievement. It takes a race against time to connect the cable in 35 seconds. This really takes patience to try again and again.
  The creative workshop is really worth seeing and fansinating. Many players have created beautiful and fun maps for everyone to subscribe to, and Bob's clothes can be various. Because it's a dream, it's up to you. To create infinite possibilities.
[code] It seems that falling will never end, but the dreams will finally have a time to wake up. The end of 'Human:Fall Flat', also the time you should wake up.

Your arms -- both of them at the same time -- point where you look, and your triggers stick and unstick your hands.  Oh, and you have a jump button. But that's pretty much it. The controls are, naturally, kind of terrible, and that's the point. Everything else emerges from that in a way that is eerily effective.  It starts out being really difficult to mantle over obstacles, and the game is oddly sparse with obvious help. But, in the first level, you're actually being taken along a training run that is a study in how subtle a tutorial can be.  Between that tutorial, a physics engine with a ton of slop, and some level design that is really forgiving of, shall we say 'creative solutions', you'll soon be completely unaware of the game.  You'll enter a zombie zen sort of space where you're just waddling across yet another chubby fantasy world and enjoying the hell out of it.

Two of us have put in more than eight hours over less than two days in split-screen, and we still can't seem to find the end of this game! I call it 'cooperative', but the game might actually be possible to play single-player.  It wouldn't be nearly as fun, of course. I'd love to try it with the 8-character online play!

The game is not without its drawbacks, of course. The game's antagonist is, as is typical in physics games, the controls and the camera. The controls are, again, terrible. I came away from hours of gaming with controller-claw. The camera thinks it knows where you want to be looking, and is often *quite* wrong.  Since your camera is unavoidably connected to control of your arms, bad camera translates into bad control of your flappy little appendages.

Still, and again, *that's kinda the point*.

I strongly recommend this game if you've got two controllers and love couch-coop games.",1586831719,1586831719,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197983043667,418,128,1178,0,511,1590982144

You can get creative and find original ways to get around an obstacle, when you fail to see the obvious solution that is right in front of your nose.

Playing with a friend in local co-op with split screen (or with others online) is of course great fun, and the cooperation to solve puzzles makes up for the shortcuts you can find when playing with someone else: instead of finding a way to put an object on a pressure plate, one of the players can just stand on it, and while the other player has passed the obstacle, the first one can jump off a cliff to respawn at the next checkpoint. Because of the multiple possibilities and solutions, the game definitely has some replay value, and it would make sense to play the game solo after completing in co-op, to figure out how to do it without someone else helping out.

The game's release date appears as July 22, 2016.

96,66644557,english,"Slightly flawed but tremendously creative game. If you enjoy puzzles (not exceedingly difficult), are relatively adept with controller (KB&M is easier in my opinion), and have a buddy with this game (or couch co-op!), I'd highly recommend this game.

+ Great physics. The best part about this game is how the objects react to you. Blocks have a good heft, levers work in an expected way, and even your plushy bounces with a cute squish. You can end up spending hours in this game just trying things out and seeing how the physics engine reacts. Seeing unexpected interactions or funny physics based goofs is when this game is at its best. Explore the levels, and learn how to move laterally across walls with just your hands, you can get into cool locations and skip parts of different puzzles.

- Frustrating controls. The main gripe I have with this game is that the controls are wonky. I'm not sure if there would have been a better way for them to design the controls, but I know that the way it exists in this game currently can be quite frustrating. Your character will wave their arms uselessly while trying to reach for ledges or other objects. If you need to grab an object and orient it in a specific way, get ready for an annoying couple minutes while you desperately try to position your hands on the object in such a way that you get the right leverage.

+ Plushy. Your character is so cute! The controls are frustrating, but that's somewhat offset by the fact that your plushy walks so cute and looks so stupid with it's hands sticking out. Your plushy will often get its hands stuck behind its own head, and you'll struggle to get it free (look down!), and while that's frustrating, you can't help but laugh because of how it looks like a dumb puppy chasing its own tail.

- Mediocre puzzles. I feel like they had to dumb down the puzzles a bit because as a player you'll spend most of your time just trying to maneuver yourself into the right position or move objects around. Many times I'll come into a room and figure out quickly how to solve it, but the rest of the time is spent trying to move the pieces into the right position. I'll admit that a couple times it threw me for a loop, as I assumed the solution, but then I realized the physics wouldn't work. I think if the controls were a bit less clunky (again, I don't know if this is even possible), they could have put in some more difficult puzzles.

+ Atmospheric music. The musical chirps in this game fit the theme perfectly, and when you enter a new section of the map, it will play a little tune, which changes throughout the game. I found myself really enjoying the music, and I actually wish there was more of it, as it's often quiet in a level while you're stumbling through a section.

+ Level design. Not the puzzles specifically, but the levels themselves have a lot of charm. There are two starkly different approaches to level design in this game, the first couple levels are in a sand box style level, and the last couple are set in interesting real-type environments. I wish there were more  of these ""real"" environments, but the sandbox styles maps aren't bad, they feel a lot like Portal",1586061157,1586061157,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056716321,142,7,919,0,919,1586059532

First i was trying to figure it out the controls, it was weird but i got used to it, i found a way to climb by swing around and grab
music is great but it feels empty after the music ends and just birds sounds.

The puzzles are creative and you that love being Lazy you can just jump around and ignore everything
my favorite levels were the Castle, Mansion and Snow, everything was fun, jump around, try to destroy everything and etc.

The ONLY complain is the Objects Glitch too much when doing Puzzles, they can hit with another object and EVERYTHING Fly around or Under the map.

The Final Result: YES YES AND YES, Fans of Ragdoll Games, this is a Fantastic game to play and screw with your friends.

I tried several different type controllers including the Steam Controller with no favorable outcome. The bug also happens when not using Link. It appears there are others with this issue and have been uable to solve it either. I don't know what the refund policy is so fear I just paid $15 for a game I'll never be able to play.

[b]Final score: friends/5[/b] 

Human: Fall Flat is a game about solving little physics-based puzzles to progress to the next area. It’s about completely ignoring the puzzles and just jumping over half the level. It’s about grieving other people and throwing them off the floating white island, that you are stranded on. But most importantly it’s about having fun with your friends. 

For this reason I declare myself to not be in the fortunate position to review this game accurately in its fun factor or replayability. I can only tell you about things like purposefully frustrating mechanics that give your character the cute, clumsy movement that you’ve seen in YouTube videos where people are having fun… with their friends. If you would like to know more about the fun you can have with your friends in this game, don’t read my review. Because I don’t have any friends to play this with. 

People might say that, it’s my fault for playing a game that is mostly only fun if you play it with friends, or that I am at fault for not having friends in the first place, and they would be absolutely correct. However, did this game make me forget the fact that I have no one to play it with? No, it did not. Maybe for one or two moments in which I was strategically trying to find a way to skip half the level that one time, but most of my playthrough was a constant reminder that I am alone and may very well be for the rest of my life. 

If anything this game made me understand the importance of social skills and desirability of an interesting personality, that I don’t possess. It confronted me with the minuteness of my own existence and brought me closer spiritually to the great empty and cold nothingness that is the universe – devoid of anything resembling human compassion and is deafeningly full of the harsh reality that we will never amount to anything meaningful in the lifespan of our species, as the meaninglessness of reality cannot be rivalled. 

All in all, this is a good game and I would recommend it to people with friends.

1 In the early period of game, lack of climbing training leads to hands hold hands corporation, weird gestures are Extremely laughing maker when play with friends and family
2 Details are nice.

Cons:

1 Double players mode with  controller + keyboard are fairly hard to make it work, it takes me about an hour make it work, it is pretty kind of most usual hardware question of this game, if nothing works, try Steam - Settings - Controller - General Controller Setting - unCheck 2 3 4 and Check 5(Generic...), then restart game.

2 Controller holding button(LT+RT) is kind of not working most of the time, on the other side, keyboard + mouse is totally easy, result is climbing is much more harder with a controller, but 99% success with keyboard + mouse

3 User guide is not enough for toon tuning, please find out in game settings, totally two toon, 1P and 2P, default white, customize is also fun.

Pros:

- Really fun game, especially if you play online
- Long enough for the price (but should be 10€ instead I think)
- Ragdoll Physics
- Character customization

Cons:

- No way to see players' ping to know which random you should join online
- Can be a little hard at times (on the first run)

Your goal as bob is to complete puzzles and/or break the rules any way you want to finish level after level. There are 8 levels in Human: Fall Flat. I can assure you, no matter how many times you complete them and play them over again, it will NEVER get old!! Dont get me wrong though, Human: Fall Flat has its issues. Most of them lie within the mulitplayer of this game. Usually, if you join a server in Human: Fall Flat that you are not hosting, you will experience SERIOUS latnecy issues. Im talkin like 30 seconds to 1 minute of a delay. This can not only be annoying to deal with, but it basically makes the game unplayble. Manily because timing is everything in this game, weather your solving the puzzles or not, it sitll makes the game unplayble. Anyway, despite its issues, if you host the server and your friend is close to you (like maybe the closest 3 states) you should be fine. And let me tell ya, this game is even better with friends to play with!! In the end Human: Fall Flat is a must have in any pc gamers libary due to its unique puzzle solving, and gameplay over all.

The greatest influencer of this want was the Game Grumps with their, ""Human Fall Flat - Steam Train"" Series.
I still rewatch those episodes once in a while. 
I wish they would go back and play the game some more. 
They didn't finish the game or come close during their let's play series.
And since the game has added a lot more since then, it's a shame they don't go back and try it again. 
I'd pay to see Arin, Ross, and Chris yell at each other on how to complete each puzzle.

But in terms of the game, It's solo enertaining. 
I'm quite surprised on how low the achievement percentages are. 
The game isn't that hard. 
It might be 'challenging' but once you get a hang of it, it's just a matter of controlling your character to do the thing you want. Or if you don't like puzzles, you can always swing your way up walls. 
That m1 - m2 swinging climb is actually broken. It might take longer than actually doing the puzzle, but it's a whole heck of a lot easier to manage.
I had a lot of fun playing this game by myself. Whenever I tried to play online I'd get kicked from the server. 
Going back and achievement hunting also adds a whole new level of puzzling, especially that, ""stack all 4 boxes"" one.

If you do, it can be fun to mess around for a couple hours, but that has more to do with chasing and grabbing each other as floppy people than the actual puzzles and levels themselves, which feel kinda empty and vapid.
Gameplay and level design are where this game... falls flat for me. You might know the solution to a puzzle immediately, but the floppy, imprecise controls can make something simple - moving a box, for example - take longer than it feels like it should. The movement seems to be meant more as a joke than an actual mechanic. Solutions tend to be pretty one-dimensional, because that solution is all the controls will allow you to achieve.

Very unique puzzle game with charming characters and maps. Great to play with friends, a lot of good community maps, which extend the mediocre amount of dev maps. 

Pros:
- A lot of fun when you play it with friends
- Interesting puzzles
- Powerful character editor
- Sometimes there are multible ways to get to your goal
- Especially the newer dev maps (everything after the nuclear plant) are quite good
- Download community maps, a lot of them really good, extending your playtime (Little Big Planet Vibes)

Cons:
- Some maps, especially the early ones feel a bit empty. 
- Either you like the controls or you hate them
- Some puzzles feel like you are using glitches to get by, instead of properly solving them
- Some minor glitches and bugs, but not really a con, imho
- Music is horrible! I can't even recall if there is more than one song, because 90% of the time, there is no music at all! So make sure, you have a good playlist running in the backround, when you play this game. 
- You can't turn down music when you play a community map, which sometimes is really really annoying (I'm looking at you leap of faith part 1! Still a good map, though.)",1578530077,1578530077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197968717521,38,9,1664,0,1392,1591813064

Great game, especially with friends!
Like Gang Beasts with puzzle elements.

One of those games you really need in your library. 
Supports remote play and workshop. And on top of that it still gets updates, entire levels to be clear.

4,61024512,english,"“Human: Fall Flat” is a platform-puzzle game where you play as “Bob”, a clumsy little figure that can run, jump and use his hands to interact with the environment, move objects or pull himself up ledges and obstacles. There isn’t much of a story to it, you go through various themed levels trying to reach the exit by solving puzzles in a variety of ways. This is where the game shines because it doesn’t hold your hand, but rather leaves you to figure things out for yourself. Depending on how patient and composed you are, this can either be a relaxing or infuriating experience. In any case, just looking at the simple, minimalist visuals after successfully making that hard jump feels rewarding.

Highly recommended for anyone that loves physics and platforming puzzle games and doesn’t get mad after his hundred and first attempt. Also worth noting is that the developers have kept adding new levels to the game to the point where there are twice as many as when I purchased the game, and the best part is that they are all free. It is well worth buying it, even at full price.

They added workshop not so long ago, hell yeah!!

I absolutely love this game, the mechanics and the physics are just amazing and I am waiting for new maps and scenarios, you will get the most fun out of playing with friends or randoms with the new online mode. In each of the maps there are different ways of accomplishing the goals and going through the map, EVERYTHING is possible specially with a lot of people. I found my self in some cool situations using the levels assets, if you get creative you'll be surprised. 

The only complaint me and many other people have is how short this game is, you could say it is, but considering that the developers are planning to add new levels and probably modes in the future, well just be patient and stay frosty because its gonna be worth it. One of the things I love about this game is the customization of your character, you have two slots to create with and you can save your presets so you never loose them, there is a lot of variety when it comes to outfits, combinations and colors.
Only one thing for the developers, add WORKSHOP and a neat lever creator, and BOOM best game ever.

The camera is probably the only real slightly upsetting aspect of it considering the direction your arms reach are directly related to where your camera is pointing... but the lack of control is what makes the game somewhat difficult and without it I honestly don't know if the game would be fun or challenging without it.  

The level design is also rather impressive, they don't bother too much with restricting you as there are more than one way to get to the next level... and even some ways I'm sure no one intended for you to discover at all.  Open-ended levels somewhat make me nervous because I get the feeling I'm going the wrong way or I'm not doing what I should be to accomplish the task at hand.  Even still, playing solo each level has taken me roughly 30 min to over an hour depending on how much I struggle to put a box on a button. lol

All things considered... then reconsidered... if you can laugh at yourself or your friends without shame and you're also a fan of any physics-based gameplay I don't know why you're reading this... you should be playing.  Even still they just released a X-Mas based level this year so content is still being added.  Stop reading... buy this and play with me because I have no friends.

Several achievements are either borderline impossible or require the will of the heavens to complete, because Sakalaus decided to be [b]VERY[/b] strict about the conditions. 

Also, if you have experience with the 3D platformers of old, welcome back your good friend, terrible camera [spoiler](one of the reasons why so many achievements are nothing short of lottery)[/spoiler]. Seriously, just go look at A Hat In Time's camera development footage, Sakalaus. If your game was any more serious, a lot more people would be complaining about the lackluster camera. The goofy physics are no excuse.

And thus, I give the game a 6/10. Good fun, especially thanks to the workshop, but the many flaws are inconvenient at best and debilitating at worst. Also pull Rollin' out of hell and actully make it feasible.

Theres just something so releaxing about seeing a computer program come up with how a thing should fall down, or how a cape or robe flows in the wind.

There is however an abundance of falling involved. and what els should you expect from a game with a title as this?

Human Fall Flat is a physics based puzzle game. However with the addition of workshop support there's also an abundance of great parkour maps you can jump, swing and slide your way through.

Not only that, but the game aslo includes a neat character customization mode, where you can dress and paint you human into whatever you'd like.

On top of that the whole game can be player online with up to 8 players.

53,55757742,english,"Before tearing into this game for its various problems Ill start with the good.

Warning - Swearing ahead | This game seems to have a semi young fanbase so if you live in a good christian household I would advise skipping to the TL:DR at the bottom.

Human Fall Flat is a truly great game overall and Ive had plenty of laughs and enjoyment in this game. Its physics based movement is great and is a great change from the traditional movement of other games, the way you're able to interact with the world was jaw dropping for me the first time I played, the puzzles are great and levels are even better for visuals and design you can tell the Developers truly put their hearts into the levels and thats very lacking in the modern gaming scene. workshop support ontop of this allows of nearly limitless maps to play on.

Now for the bad which is mainly one huge problem, that being lag


Oh good lord the experience this game provides can be almost entirely ruined by lag and delay in your movements introduced when playing non-lan games. as some if not all of this games puzzles require some form of precise movement/timing having nearly a half fucking second of delay from when you press your button to when your character preforms the action is unbearable and has caused me to quit many online games. if you play online you'll find yourself missing jumps, diving off ledges when you pressed space and even walking in a straight fucking line can be a challenge as you will overcorrect because it takes so damn long for your character to do what your keyboard is telling them to do.

Im not even sure why the lag is so bad, maybe the physic based movement really doesnt mix well with online servers as I assume it almost all has to be done server side and nothing can be Client side and then updated for other players like how most games deal with movement and actions online. It really doesnt help theres not a single way to actually view what ping you have or what ping servers will have if you join them, so just blindly seeing if a server is somewhat playable is exhausting and tedious. 

Other smaller problems which I wont elaborate too much include

Allowing people to grab other players with no way to get them off without kicking them can be extremely annoying and easy to abuse and piss people off

Developers have been known to patch out certain techniques that abuse the games engine allowing people to skip parts of levels or puzzles which for a non competitive couch coop type game is extremely counter intuitive and plain fucking stupid in my eyes, but as a casual player I dont care too much, but I can see the issue.

Certain levels puzzles have literally no guidance as to what to do especially on some of the later levels which is an extreme whiplash coming from the earlier levels which have a great flow to the puzzles. It seems they sometimes try too hard to make open ended puzzles to the point of being so god damn blank with instructions skipping them is preferrable to grinding your brain cells away actually figuring out how to do them, which for a game based around puzzles is really fucking dumb.

Im sure I missed some smaller points but thats my basic view and opinion on Human: Fall Flat.

TL:DR

Absolutely amazing game with a unique and interesting movement and interaction system great replay value, and very fun with friends, lag is a big draw back so beware before putting your money down, dont come looking for a great online playable experience because it isnt here at all. If you have a group of friends who dont care about lag or all live close enough to set up lan 100% go for it, but if you dont put your money somewhere else or wait for a sale.

I would love to give this game a recommend but simply cant, 15 bucks for game only enjoyable on your own and in Lan multiplayer isnt worth it in my eyes and until the lag problem online is fixed Its going to stay that way.",1571984776,1571985727,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198135258354,150,36,1590,0,955,1590274687

THE BAD: Nothing. I don't know of any ""flaws"" per-se that were not already intended. The goofy physics will always make you chuckle, and the crazy camera helps with the immersion. That is all I can say negatively about this game, honestly.

THE GOOD: This is the funniest game I have ever played. The rag dolls after being flung 500 mph are fantastic, and the fact that you can grab your friends and throw them around is too funny to be real. The levels, while not mentally challenging (for the most part) are fun to figure out, and make you feel successful for being able to fly onto a rock, and pull yourself up.

Notes:
The game is a puzzle solving game, with rag-doll like movement. WASD to move and right and left click to grab. Have you ever played ""Getting Over It""? It can get that frustrating at times, especially if you play for a while or after a difficult day. The one complaint I have is how frustrating the mechanics are, and its not even a complaint. I just get really frustrated when it doesn't act the way I want it to. The level design is either intended for speed-running, or idiotic. There are entire sections of levels that can be skipped by giving it some thought, and I like that, but there are some places that seem like they didn't try to prevent skips. 
I have never encountered a bug in my 20+ hours on this game, which is awesome. Plus, they release a new level every once in a while. I got 20 something hours from doing a couple of plays and all of the achievements, and you could get even more from downloading levels from the workshop. All in all, I think that if this game is on sale, you should probably grab it!

[i]2019[/i] [h1]Review[/h1][u]I still love the game[/u] but you could complete this game in less than an hour.. and there's only so many times you can replay the levels until you know them from the inside-out.

1. [b]Levels[/b] 
We should be getting more levels from devs. I know there's a ""public workshop."" However, they really should be pushing out more than ONE NEW LEVEL PER YEAR. Especially if they're going to be charging $15 for it. Of course you can replay levels again and maybe even with different friends but at some point (probably in the near future) you'll get bored of it. [b]But[/b] there are levels made by the community. I personally haven't been able to get one working but perhaps other people do and I'm just missing something. 

2. [b]Price[/b]
I bought the game very early on for around $5 to $10 and that is exactly what it's worth. If I knew what I know now about the game and how neglected it is, I would NOT pay $15 for this game. If you're made of money though, then by all means, go ahead and buy it. It is a very fun game. Unfortunately it's just short-lived.

3. [b]Wait for it to go on sale[/b] 
The short amount of time it'll take for you to complete all the levels is not worth $15. Especially if the devs intend to ride on the back of the community to make levels for them. Maybe these levels are hard to make but if the community can manage to make ""300 community maps!"" as they claimed, then why are we only getting one per year?

In multiplayer the game is brilliant, but the sad part is it is over so very quickly. The included levels will last you maybe 4 hours if you're good. Maybe even less. The workshop levels are a mixed bag of too hard, too easy, and impossible due to bugs. Workshop levels are just buggy in general, but the worst thing is I experienced crashes on over 50% of the the levels. Some crashes were so bad I had to pull the plug on my PC. The main game crashed on me once. Also it's a complete pain in the ass to get the workshop up and running. You need to download Unity. There is little info about this on the forums, but a google search on the subject will likely bring up the old method of inputting a code, causing a great deal of confusion and time wasting. After downloading unity one must spend a bit of time loading all the info from the game into Unity before one can begin downloading player made levels.

Overall I was disappointed, the game is unique and absolutely genius, but given the time spent creating the game, I can't imagine it would take THAT much time making some official levels, the engine is in place and the levels can be constructed fairly easily. I would say the content should be double what it currently is. I'd take that over 400 crappy player made levels that need to be sifted through for hours of trial and error crashes. Sadly my time is too important to me and the whole experience has been soured. 

By all means get the game, unless you're piss poor, and if you are poor, get it on sale. Because the game is one of the best coop experiences I've ever had.

34,33955167,english,"Human: Fall Flat is a freeform, physics-based puzzle/platforming game. The player controls a semi-ragdoll character and attempts to guide him through 9 levels.

Each level is a presented as a semi-open dreamscape, where the player has to do such things as scale heights, cross chasms and operate machinery in order to reach a set exit point. The game's worlds scale quite well and ramp up in difficulty enough to each provide a first-time player new, challenging experiences. The opening level is meant as a tutorial and is incredibly simple and linear. By the end of the game, the areas are massive with a multitude of both necessary and optional puzzles and variable routes to reach the goal.

The aesthetics of the game are pleasing. The worlds are presented as colorful and cartoonish generally, but the game is also pretty and quite easy on the eye. The music is also astoundingly good - as a person who mutes in-game music far more often than leaves it on, this soundtrack was striking in that it never even tempted me to turn it off. The tracks are good, and rather than simply providing a backdrop they often stop for a while and then start playing at appropriate points. An example: the player is traversing up a cliffside and the music has stopped, but he gets to the top and faces a daunting jump to the next area. Cue an intense, epic overture to accompany the feat that's about to be attempted. It really works well and I am impressed by it.

The gameplay is simple but satisfying - the character can walk, jump, lift things, and climb. Interacting with objects, operating machinery/vehicles, and even mundane things such as pushing carts and opening doors are presented as challenges. As I mentioned earlier, the character is semi-ragdoll so the motion at times can be sluggish and occasionally unpredictable. This can (and will) lead to unnecessary falls while platforming as well as awkward moments where his body has contorted so strangely it is difficult to correctly proceed. That said, this is not QWOP: it is occasionally difficult but not unfair or impossible. The player learns to control the character and his motions well enough to eventually be capable of quite precise movement and actions. This learning curve makes solving puzzles and completing climbs very fulfilling, and even completing small tasks generally comes with a sense of accomplishment.

Outside of the main goal of completion exploration is also fun and rewarding: very few areas in the game are pointless or redundant. Have you ever tried hard in a game to get to a difficult-to-access area, then been disappointed on getting there to find out it was completely empty and useless? That is not a problem in this game. High climbs, cliffs, alternate routes are all present and become interesting to reach and try out as the player improves and replays levels. This gives what would otherwise be a ""beat-it-and-done"" sort of game a decent amount of replayability, as exploring for fun and for achievements is very interesting. The main levels take several hours to complete (I'd guess 3-6 is average, but considerably more or less are both possible) and several more if one wants 100 percent completion. For reference, it took me 10.5 hours to finish the game and get all the achievements.

I bought Human: Fall Flat at full price ($15) and I can say with certainty that it is worth it, but were this game to go on sale I'd call it a must-have. I don't generally review games - in fact, this is the first I've written for a game on Steam. But this game was so engaging and so much fun, I felt I needed to recommend it. If you enjoy physics games or ragdoll, buy it. If you enjoy puzzle games, buy it. If you enjoy platforming, buy it. If you enjoy freeform exploration games that give you plenty of fun things to mess around with, buy it!",1501613402,1565651996,True,5,0,0.60280376672744751,0,True,False,False,76561198332056170,235,7,1445,0,661,1590095194

If you try to load a checkpoint, it drops you back in the correct location, but it resets your progress for the entire level, oftentimes trapping you in a place you can't get out of. So, then the only you can do is restart the level. Buuuut restarting the level seems to break it even further. Like the one with all the doors and cables, the lift starts to drive itself into walls or in circles without the player even touching it, and the switches don't work, soooo you can't move the generator to where it needs to go, which means the level is not completable. I tried just climbing over walls to get around these issues, but the character's climbing abilities are pretty lackluster, and eventually I got tired of falling over and over.

2. Train: It's ok, it's basically a continuation of the first level.
3. Carry: It's probably my favorite level of all the levels.
4. Mountain: Just as good as carry, but a little harder.
5. Demolition: Meh, it's ok.
6. Castle: Everything exept the ending to it is fine. The ending is really annoying, it's a big spike in difficulty.
7. Water: The WORST level. It SUCKS. All you do is ride from boat to boat. THEN you have to do a part that makes you line up 4 hooks over a giant crate with 4 holes in it  with levers. Then you have to get the crate in the PERFECT spot. THEN you have to do stuff with rafts and MORE boats. It's absolutly HORRIBLE level design.
8. Power Plant: Meh, it's fun if you have friends. Otherwise it's just boring.
9.  Aztec: A difficult last level with intresting new mechanics.
10. Dark: I haven't beaten it yet, but it seems fine to me.

Now just a few months on, there's plenty of great community content in the shape of levels and custom characters. I can honestly say that it's made a world of difference to the longevity of the title.  I return to it several times a week when I'm in the need of a break from more serious titles, or just to have a chilled out laugh with friends. 

Would I recommend this game? Heck yes but only if you have friends to play it with. Playing solo is quite frankly a little dull.

[h1] Gameplay Mechanics [/h1]
The mechanics are [i] HILARIOUS! [/i] I love this aspect of the game. It's fun to grab other people and throw 'em off edges. Take their objects and mess around, and even experiment with the ragdoll functionality.

[h1] Core Gameplay [/h1]
The CORE gameplay is really fun, I absolutely fanboy over how fun it is. However, [b] let's focus on the overall gameplay. [/b]
The overall gameplay is pretty monotonous. There's about 8 levels you can complete; Each getting progressively harder. However, when you're limited to these levels in multiplayer, and only being able to have a 2 player split-screen, the game gets  boring after a while.

[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]
The game is pretty good, however it's word of the day is [b] monotonous. [/b] If they'd [u]allow more split screen options[/u] or [u]allow users to create their own levels[/u] to mess around in, I'd have not returned it. The game itself is decent, but it needs expanding.

[i] Note: [/i] For the game's price ($15) you could almost get [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/] Dead by Daylight [/url] or get [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/] CS:GO's Prime Status upgrade [/url] (Since the game is free now....)

[i] Also sorry for the short review. This game doesn't really have anything to go in-depth about. [/i]

One of my friends was not convinced from the look of the game, I gifted it to him and he also made the remark that it had been forever since he had so much good, simple fun and laughed so hard in a game. 

It reminds me about Gang Beasts - but so much more fun and puzzle oriented. So many ways to solve the puzzles and soooo many ways that things will turn into something non intentional and hysterical funny! 

If you have a few friends to play with using discord or teamspeak or whatever, this game is a must. It's entertaining in it's own glorious way. I rarely write a review, and even more rare after only 8 hours of playtime, but I simply have to recommend this.

38,52587418,english,"At its most primitive state: the bones of a puzzle are to get from Point A to Point B, to put everything in place to complete the task at hand.  The glory of the puzzle relies solely on the maker at hand: putting obstacles and rules in place to make the puzzle more challenging and engaging to the participant.  In 2016, a small studio released their unique decision on their obstacles and rules: wonky physics, intuitive obstacles, and 8-player madness.

[b]Human: Fall Flat[/b] follows Bob, a particularly wobbly fellow who finds himself within his dreams, dreams that require him to use ingenuity and a keen eye to make it past obstacles that block his path find the exit of his dreams.  Your Bob is fully customizable, with preset options and colors to choose from.  If you're feeling creative, you can draw a specific face for your character, or use a webcam and add yourself onto your Bob.  Bob will have to navigate through 10 levels that will take you from catapulting and scaling castles to navigating and surviving rapid waters.  Enjoy every level with up to 8 friends online, and enjoy the infinite levels beyond with the newly added Steam Workshop!

[b]Fall Flat[/b]'s most interesting quality is the quirkiness and movement of the characters.  Almost every task is done with the floppy arms of your Bob: pressing buttons, winding back catapults, even driving a stick shift tractor trailer.  The left and right arm have individual buttons, when an arm is selected, it reaches out and Bob's hands become like glue, sticking to whatever surface or object comes in contact.  Bob will be able to climb up ledges and maneuver around each level...maybe not with the greatest of ease.  Part of what makes [b]Human: Fall Flat[/b] difficult is the general oddity of navigating around each level with Bob.  It's almost intentionally frustrating, and it will take some getting used to, but the handicaps of not having full movement make the puzzles that much more satisfying when they're completed.

The real bread and butter revolves around the multiplayer of [b]Human: Fall Flat[/b].  Having 8 Bobs all vying towards a single goal will almost always end in some kind of hilarious travesty.  I can't recall a single session where I haven't been laughing and yelling at my friends for hours on end.  The combination of that many minds trying to complete a task with the stunted movements and floaty physics is a match made in heaven, even if you start to realize who you would and wouldn't trust as the leader.  The newly added Steam Workshop content will be the saving grace for the longevity of this title: you'll always have your mixed bag of how good a level actually runs, but we've found some really creative levels that really push the physics and creativity to a whole new level, and has had us loading up the game more and more.

The off-center style of movement and puzzle solving may turn some away at first, but [b]Human: Fall Flat[/b] is absolutely worth the time.  I love the simplistic art style and the way [b]No Brakes Games[/b] took a kooky idea, that can be frustrating to control, and transformed it into a hilariously good time: just make sure you bring your friends for the ride.

72,52130041,english,"Human: Fall Flat is a game in the genre of ""Wacky Physics Controls"" a la Surgeon Simulator, Goat Simulator, or Octodad: Dadliest Catch.

Where the physics in these other games often leads to frustration more than enjoyment, Human: Fall Flat treads the line much more carefully. Although it still takes a bit of getting used to, when the controls click, they feel intuitive and natural. Simply grabbing a ledge and watching your human clamber up a ledge is a joy. Similarly, the puzzles in Human: Fall Flat rely more on intuitive solutions than fighting the difficult controls. Grabbing a hook to slide down a wire, using a windmill to launch yourself, or a glass window with a fire extinguisher provides a cinematic moment made all the more satisfying because the controls are grounded and almost tactile.

Extended multiplayer and workshop features are an excellent addition. If solving puzzles by yourself is fun, then doing in while one or more friends struggle for control of a boat or fight to throw one another off ledges is double so. Workshop levels, while not as extensive as the likes of Garry's Mod, bring an extra couple hours of enjoyment and the promise of creating your own puzzles - though I personally have not used the Unity integration to develop any myself.

As with these other physics games, even though Human: Fall Flat is an outlier, there are moments of jank where you can't just get your little arm to grab that ledge, or the water wheel that normally lifts you to the exit is weighed down by your extra companions. Likewise, there are cheap solutions such as swinging just right along a wall to slowly climb upwards; though some of these are still satisfying.

Ultimately, all I can say is while I loved the game, I wish there were more official levels. Human: Fall Flat brings a bouncy and jiggly world to life, and I wish I could spend more time there.

You can play with random strangers too, but we all know how playing with random strangers on the internet usually works out, right? It might work for you, of course, but I recommend some actual friends + your favorite voice chat software.

You can also try to play it alone, but I doubt it's even remotely as much fun as it is with other players.
Also, playing alone makes this game a lot harder as many of the tasks found in this game are built for multiple people.

When I recommend this to my friends we played it which was awesome. But for some reason I turned on my troll mode and decided to troll my friends. How did i troll them?

[h1]Exposition, Concurrence and Summation[/h1]

[b]Human: Fall Flat[/b] is a physics puzzler. The puzzles are not however the express obstacle to overcome. Much like Grow Home when you press LMB/RMB or the trigger of your gamepad the corresponding hand is outstretched directly away from the camera and from there you can direct it as you wish. It acts more like a sticky pad then a hand. 

You'll be doing things such as climbing, arguably the main mechanic and other more intricate things later on. For example, rowing a boat, operating a forklift, connecting wires to batteries and generators and loading catapults. 

A lot of these physics games humor is derived from the very odd things that happen organically just from playing and watching the physics play out. But early on this game has some tutorial videos that lend it a bit more character. It feels a little Portal-y up front. It also has some slightly epic if not ironic music throughout. 

I say Portal because of the corporate detachment vibe the videos give off. As well as for the reasons in the early stages that it is very closed in and controlled. The stages then evolve into a much more open space that doesn't necessarily encourage exploration; No traditional collectibles are to be found. However, there are some achievements from doing things that aren't really required that can be fun to accidentally run into, often found from going off the beaten path. 

There is also some very odd 3D MS Paint/Blender-esk thing to paint your character. It has webcam support as well. If you desired to bring the real world into the digital. 

[b]THE GIST 
It's an enjoyable fun, relatively short game that at times can be a bit frustrating. Either from knowing what you need to do and not being able to execute or just not really being sure where to go. But those times are outweighed the good.[/b]

18,51076432,english,"Alright, let me get this out of the way. I would recommend the game. It's a good game, it really is. It's fun with friends and gives my right hand a great, sweaty workout. BUT, I'd like to point out some annoyance and irritating stuff of the game.

1) I don't know how the game's servers are like but often when playing online with people, the connection becomes laggy and personally, I find it aggravating. Have you ever tried to hop rapidly or run, jump, and let go to fly at the same time while all of your inputs are like .3 second delayed? When this happened (can happen to others as well), I honestly thought there was something wrong with my keyboard. ""What's wrong with my spacebar? Do I need to clean it?"" Turns out, it's just input lag! Maybe others would catch onto it sooner than I did, but I just find it overall frustrating.

2&3) Online lobbies and the community. This may be a personal thing but I like to join random people's lobbies and play with them because I got no friends, and I wanna make friends. Simple enough. However, majority of the time when I do join, these f*ckers keep kicking me out, perhaps simply because they don't want a stranger to join. How about making the fucking lobby private! That's an option you dinguses! Or player cap it! 2/2, 4/4, 8/8! Or even better, ban me so I don't have to see your damn lobby in the list! It just frustrates me to play with these bozos! It's not like the devs can do anything about this! You can't change people, so why the hell am I ranting?!

Edit: The game has gotta fix it's server disconnect causes. For example. If you received ""Server disconnected"" while playing or when you first joined, most likely (other than the host actually stop hosting) they just kick you and it gives you the wrong cause! How do I know? Well I come back and and same again, disconnected, BUT this time it showed the real reason: You've been kicked. After this has happened to me, (which has happened multiple times) it's just something I expect now and accepted that people didn't want me.

Overall, I just find the online community toxic. I'd suggest play with your friends. Invite them. Make sure no one else can join. The game is much more fun if you can talk to them via mic for better communication. Have I mentioned that the game will make your hand sweat like it's going through a workout? Maybe it's just me. 7.9/10",1559814030,1559814465,False,11,4,0.53745567798614502,0,True,False,False,76561198054903191,163,7,2266,0,1988,1575658687

Why at first it may seemed like the levels have absolutely no use to the story, it turns out all together in the grand picture it all tells one larger story. While trying to progress through the game we come to the realization that this man is broken from the tragicality of his Waifu death. How do we know that? like I said previously in the Third instalment which shows it, But while at first I shrugged it off as his favorite Anime Character it slowly starting to come together in the upcoming ones such as the difficulty spike that proceeded afterwards. Later on In the Three IX, we get introduced to something more sinister in the game. Such as spooky creatures roaming around, with Easter eggs scattered around all the maps. While looking into it as we slowly progress the nightmares from the levels we slowly see a closed off entrance which is blocked off. As I sat down thinking on how to get out I Interpreted it as a blockade making him not being able to fully escape from the prison the Creator has trapped himself in.  As than in the last level before the Acceptance, we bypass the monsters, which then leads us up to end of a cave which is finally open. Then in the Last installment of Three we came to the conclusion he has finally moved on, and he has accepted his Waifu is now gone and would not come back. With this knowledge he will now go on into this world without feeling the emotional weight from his tragic lost.

I would have to say this game is really fun and think it would have been cool in a story mode playing and build and fight and all the things you do in a game with these controls it would be fun and also very funny to play.  I wish they would make a campaign mode for this game.

I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE SOME ADD ON MAP MODES IN STEAM FOR THIS GAME IT IS A LITTLE SHORT IN GAME PLAY, THOUGH THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ALL THOSE WHO PAYED 2O DOLLARS FOR THIS GAME. 

Unlike the game called game beasts this game works very well, i have posted reviews but most have not even seen my reviews, unsure why when i give positive reviews but game beast never fixed there game it is unplayable on the pc...

THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE SO CALLED MODS MOST DON'T EVEN BUILD MAPS THAT WORK VERY WELL and some have such good looking maps but the doors don't open with lots of cool building and other object used for nothing and level that don't work all for show,  what a waist of good map editing and time!

On Linux (Steam Play) the mouse bugs out on the second game, so if you leave a game you have to quit out entirely and go back in just to avoid that particular issue. I haven't played on Windows so I cannot confirm if that bug exists there too. I realise that any Steam Play compatibility issues may not be their fault, but the game used to support Linux natively (and badly) and I'm mentioning this in case people want to play on Linux.

IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ON LINUX:
* Make sure you enable Steam Play otherwise it will download an older version of the game (also very buggy!)
* Set the PROTON_NO_D3D=1 option in the launch command setting.
* Beware that your mouse will probably glitch out on the second game you join, so if you exit a game, exit right out (Alt+F4) and then launch it again.
* Good luck - check protondb for more tips.

Overall we had a lot of fun with it but the continual stream of bugs encountered did detract from the experience a bit.  One of the main reasons it is so satisfying to finish a level is because the risk of a bug making that impossible is ever present. You get very good at scaling walls.

This game is very aight imo. The most challenging part was trying to drive the big yellow scary trucks. The most fun part was skipping 80% of the level just by climbing one wall lmao. Dont let my whopping six hours of gameplay deceive you, I am a true gamer at heart and this game gave me a heart attack (if you know what i mean) yuh. Game was beyond all else, on a physical and mental level (maybe even possibly a spiritual level too). A young birdie once told me that there is great replay value, even though there is ten-ish WHOLE levels to play. If you are an achievement hunter, buckle up, get yo dog, play yo kazoo, and good luck soldier. My favorite moment in the game was when my doiks would try and climb a wall, and I'd grab them and violently hold my other free hand to the ground. They proceeded to unfriend me and sent a hitman on me after the sesh.

I can't play the game.

Ever since this latest update, The game crashes on startup. And yes, my pc CAN run it. I uninstalled. I deleted and uninstalled. I went to the C drive, deleted, and uninstalled. Nothing worked. I went to the steam support forums. Nobody responded other than one random dude saying to give my pc information. I gave it, and I haven't gotten a response in several days. I emailed the official support team for this game with the email they provided. It has been nearly a week and I still haven't gotten a response. The only real response from support was on the HFF discord, and the people that tried to help me weren't even from the actual company, they were just people who decided to be nice. I spent several hours doing things such as reinstalling dx11 among other things. Sadly, this didn't work out, and my game still crashes on startup. I just want to play the game. I payed my 15 dollars. I payed nearly 60 so multiple friends of mine could play. 75 dollars for a game I can't even play. What a scam.

63,36148760,english,"NOW WITH PROPER WORKSHOP SUPPORT!

This shows the devs dedication. When HFF's popularity exploded, few could argue a proper workshop back then could have launched HFF into legendary status, with a potentially massive player base. 

Alas, adding in proper workshop support was a real hassle, not so easy. Knowing it would take considerable time and effort, the decision was made to go forward with it. I believe even based off a community challenge, having players collect presents in the old christmas lobby. A goal was set that was easily surpassed with a vague hint somewhere along the lines of ""the most requested feature will be implemented if we reach ##### presents."" Now years later we finally get what was promised. I'll be honest, I've had my doubts and been impatient from time to time, finding it had to believe there was still no proper workshop implemented... But all that is now in the past.

Is it too late for HFF to reach this legendary game status? Probably. But there will still be tens of thousands, if not millions of people who will be able to enjoy this work. HFF is already Legendary in my eyes.


Old Review:
Funniest couch co-op game I've ever played. Now with online multiplayer! 

Block your friends, or random strangers.
Showoff to your friends, or random strangers.
Torment your friends, or random strangers.
And perhaps, every now and then, accidentally help your friends, or random strangers.

After playing this I spend quite some time searching for anything similar, and it doesn't exist. At most there's some physics based ragdoll versus stuff, but nothing co-op.

Played this a lot on console with friends, it's a simple but well polished game and I can highly recommend it.",1509391898,1555498474,True,0,0,0.488034605979919434,0,True,False,False,76561198000624335,115,52,1478,0,811,1581462788

Even if it's not on sale I suggest you buy it, and make your friends get it, you will have a great time playing trough all the custom levels with your friends!

RECOMMENDED!


OLD:

This is another sad story of a game being deserted by the devs, we waited for a new map and been begging for workshop map support since early 2018 (That is when I bought it)
Since then we got ONE new map on halloween / new year 2018, not sure when exactly it came out kinda missed it.

Long story short, they been adding skins, and other useless things to make the game look alive, and keep the game selling.

So far it does not seem that they are planning to make any large changes for this game, i believe they are working on part 2 which might have workshop map support and more maps.

28,49943094,english,"Very frustrating game, and especially frustrating if you're going for 100% achievements. But if you're up to the task and challenge, it is an absolute blast!

Similar to Octodad and QWOP, Human Fall Flat uses a unique set of controls and mechanics to tackle odd and interesting challenges. There is always something new to be accomplished, and the achievements range from trivial and story-bound to mind-bogglingly difficult and terribly frustrating. The game always has me coming back to try and reach the next achievement or tackle a puzzle in a different way, thanks to unique layouts and physics.

Personally haven't tried any multiplayer beyond joining a couple random servers, so I can't speak much about it. The little I have played has shown tons of potential. Hope with the new Steam Workshop support that people can use this to make Portal 2 Co-op style maps/puzzles to further strengthen the multiplayer experience.

My one gripe is Controller support for the Mac is shoddy at best. However, this was easily remedied by making a custom profile that fit the developer's recommended configuration and using my controller as though I were using a keyboard/mouse.

8 PLAYER MULTIPLAYER HAS BEEN ADDED WITH WORKSHOP SUPPORT ON THE WAY, THIS IS NOW A GUARANTEED BUY ASAP.

it plays like gang beasts but more focused and linear yet your ability in the game dictates the path you take, 

E.G

bob and dave cant climb very well but together they can pull each other up making a human ladder/tower and it works meanwhile jimmy is climbing the walls like the no lifer he is.

Fuck you jimmy you knocked me off the wall you ass

10/10 buy it

Edit: It has been 2 years and we still have no public workshop with multiplayer compatibility,
Until they add these much needed features fully i cannot recommend this for longtime replayability or in general as its rather niche without it.

Mac and Linux versions are available and are first-class citizens![/quote]
(At the time of writing this review, the [url=http://www.nobrakesgames.com/company/]company page[/url] even wrongly states that there still is Linux support.)

So how do us Linux gamers have to find out? Get a cryptic ""incompatible versions"" error when trying to play with friends, and having to go to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/477160/discussions/0/1735468693704602016/]the game's Steam forum[/url] to find a half-hearted response from the developer. I mean... what is ""we appreciate the frustration"" even supposed to mean?

Why this is a big issue? Because some of us want to support developers that put in the effort to make and update games that run natively on Linux. Heck, I bought the game for multiple people! To deceive Linux gamers by claiming they're ""first-class citizens"" and then go back on that very clear promise, in favor of other things such as console support (yuck) is a pretty big punch to the face. I've tried contacting both the publisher and developer, outlining this issue and asking for a refund, but I haven't even received a response in a month.",1551315990,1551316003,False,3,0,0.476297050714492798,0,True,False,False,76561198012461215,141,2,279,0,266,1551318384
13,49270459,english,"I'm in the difficult position right now of having to be very blunt about a game that, to tell the truth, I still enjoy playing.  But here goes.

I purchased the game early on, without knowing much about what it was, to support linux gaming!  I have friends who game exclusively on linux, and I look forward to being able to do the same myself some day (though currently I maintain a windows gaming rig).  Not only did they support linux, but they advertised the mac and linux versions as ""first-class citizens""!

Several months ago they dropped linux support, though.  They have some excuses about being a small dev team and it being too much trouble...  and it's sad to see such lazy priorities from an indie developer I had respected, but they could have made things right by proactively offering refunds to people who had purchased the game for the linux support.  I would not have gotten the refund myself, but I have friends who need it.  As it stands though, my friends have been denied any attempt to get refunds, and ignored when they contacted the developer.  They have been, for all intents and purposes, defrauded.

I have seen excuses floating around like, linux users can still play, just not the latest version... however this is a game that shines as a co-op game.  People who purchased the game specifically to play with friends, now cannot, and obviously convincing the 90% on still-supported platforms to downgrade their game version is a non-starter.  I don't know if the developer has endorsed this as an excuse or explained why linux users should not deserve refunds...  based on the way they are ignoring my friends, it seems that their attitude is simply that they already have the money and it's not their problem.

I will be honest: the game is fun.  But given the situation, it does not deserve me going into detail about that.  It really only shines in multiplayer, and the developer cannot be trusted to concern themselves with whether you can actually play with your friends.  If you only use windows and don't care about friends on other platforms, this might not affect you.  If you play on mac, you should operate on the assumption that you might be next.  Either way, they have shown that they are willing to leave paying customers behind, and they will not do anything to offer refunds or make things right.  If the game hadn't originally supported linux, it never would have made it onto my radar...  but I could still forgive the change in supported platforms if they extended affected customers a chance at refunds.  They did not.  I'd be lying if I said this isn't a fun game to play with your friends, but you are entirely at the developer's mercy when it comes to still being able to play with your friends next month, and you can expect no compensation if things change again.",1551313584,1551313594,False,5,0,0.503928184509277344,0,True,False,False,76561197994459543,310,18,557,0,557,1551318310

I put a red thumb here not to ""bash"" the game (who have a lot of good reviews) but to make a warning visible for players that might be a little like me.

I've beat the game once (plus the nice free DLC that as a better ""ending feel"" IMO compared to the last level) and I enjoyed it for the most part ... but I might not replay it for success or whatever.

I mean, this game is really fun to be played with friends ... yes ... [b]WITH FRIENDS ![/b]

The goofiness of the character is real fun when you're messing with you're friends and trying to put them of map ...

... but this is also a puzzle game and it can be a real pain when you're alone and making like 40 attempt to put a damn log under a damn rock !

To say it in another way, it can be really frustrating IMO when you need 30 seconds to understand what to do but need 30 minutes to manage to do it !

I know it come a lot from myself. I'm more confortable with understanding puzzles that doing agility tricks (it always bugged me) !
But I really wanna warn you about this ... in case you got the same kind of ""skills"" as I do (or more like an absence of skills I might say >.<).

While that might come handy in a speed run I would suggest that you try at least one ""full"" run of each level to get the full experience.

Sonic 3D Blast, also known as Sonic 3D Flickies' Island in Europe, is isometric take on a mix of Sonic platforming, serving as a spinoff to the franchise, and Flicky collecting'n'leading hot action. It was developed by Travellers Tales and Sonic Team, former doing main programmer job while latter came with game design ideas and some more. Well, they did want Sonic 3 to be isometric to begin with. Also riding on whole pre-rendered trend that went hip with Donkey Kong Country. Published by Sega in 1996 in the West only. 32 Megabit ROM, the biggest that Sega Genesis can see at a single time.
There also were Saturn and PC versions, made near the end of development of this supposed “Genesis swan song”, replacing the cancelled Sonic X-Treme. Saturn had improved graphics, redbook soundtrack, different actual 3D special stages, analog input. It's technically the best version. PC version was similar but lacked few graphics and had 2D parody of special stages, yet had autosave feature.
Sonic Blast on Game Gear is a different game despite fitting in marketing-wise.

The game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.

I don't usually talk about mods, but Director's Cut exists and it was made by game's main programmer so it's sorta semi-official. None the less, back to what Sega gives us there.


Now, technical part about Sega's emulation here:
The Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for ""Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics"" game that should appear in your library.
It has Bedroom HUB which is the one with many features yet lags for many and Simply Launcher which lacks Workshop and Online but at least it works just fine for everybody.
However, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time!
Emulation itself, mostly sound, isn't that good but it does it's job. Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.
As alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in ""uncompressed ROMs"" folder that program itself doesn't use, just change file extension to "".bin"" or so. The file for this one being ""SONIC3D_UE.68K"".
I also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. You can find it here on store page or go to ""manuals"" folder of game root and open ""S3DB_MG_EFIGS_US.pdf"".


Robotnik has discovered that Flickies on Flickies's Island can actually travel between dimensions by using huge rings. So he trapped them all in Badnik robots to search for Chaos Emeralds. These robots aren't any different, no dimension travel there. Sonic is back here and ready to save em all while his two gang members chill around.

The core gameplay keeps the Sonic formula going. You can run around and you can jump. Seeing how it's isometric it has a separate button that you can roll with. Or spindash if standing still. You still defeating enemies by either jumping or rolling. Albeit using slopes by rolling doesn't play a big role here at all, these are weak slopes. The controls have some inertia to it, pleasently. Too bad Sonic can't immediately turn 180 degrees around, he does a small circle. Still uses rings health system where as long as you have any rings you will survive a hit but then you have to recover all the scattered rings.
It's a rather forgiving pleasant take on isometric style. You can run in all 8 directions. It hides nothing important behind walls. There are shadows for everything. The floor always has checkered tiles so you can measure, borders are clearly defined. While Sonic is a bit too fast, the game doesn't require much precision platforming. Well, there are few but you can cheese most of them by using nearby spring pad or so. The levels are varied as well, some having sorta puzzle elements. Spinning pads are great on the second zone.
Protip: You can break ice spikes in Diamond Dust by rolling into them.

Powerups are back through breakable monitors. Invincibility, extra life, speed up, so on. By the way, Sonic icons that aren't in monitors aren't extra lives by medals. Collect 10 of them and you will get a continue. There are shields, each giving you extra hit against normal stuff. Blue one is immune electricity, red shields protects from fire, golden one gives you active ability where you do 
Protip: Get a red shield in a Volcano Valley or die.
Each zone has two acts, along with a boss one. The first two acts are divided into two-three stages. And in each stage you have to save five flickies. That means there are only five badniks in a stage and most of them are static non-threats. Not too exciting. At least game somewhat makes up with stage hazards. But the game is still too easy. Then you break those robots and have to grab birds. This is where Flicky inspiration comes in. The birds will follow you in a line and they can be broken off with projectiles after which they scatter around. It worked in Flicky which was a tight 2D game where you constantly get chased by cats, you would die if they touch you and simply scatted lines of flickies if they touch those. With risk-reward applied as you got score by bringing in bigger lines and that would lead to getting extra lives in a tough game. Here? Not a tight design, it's just there. Projectiles may throw birds off but that just happens, not something you pay attention to. Collecting birds over lava is pain. There is too much space, nothing chasing you. Yea. It's just there, just making you spend a bit more time in levels and thus isn't exciting.
There is usual optional quest for 7 Chaos Emeralds. Actually, they look like Halls candies, which would explain why Sonic can't turn into Super Sonic. Super makes games too easy anyway. You do get an extra final boss and good ending however, that's good. To get an emerald you must find Tails or Knuckles first, just chilling. Both of them appear in each act, hiding or appearing somewhere in previous stage once you progress, feel free to backtrack. Last appearing in Volcano Valley. It does mean you can get two emeralds per act, one from each. You get extra life on repeat. Just give these fams 50 rings. Though they will take and store any amount so don't bump into them.
After that you get into a special stage. You run over bridge, collect rings and avoid bombs. It looks incredibly smooth, the best on Mega Drive. Albeit gameplay is a bit plain and is too easy. Still fun.

There are usual bosses. Robotnik every time. Most often you just wait for him to get down and hit him, then avoid his stuff, repeat. Varied health. Not bad but not too cool.
Protip: For Volcano Valley boss instead of trying to get into pipes first, you should curve your jump off side floor to hit Robotnik then you will be bounced backward onto pipes.

Not much options. Just sound test and controls. Bare minimum!
As for graphics. Well. They tried to do DKC thing with prerendered sprites because it was still cool, albeit 1996 was somewhat late. Which isn't the smartest thing to do on Genesis, as compared to SNES it has low amount of colors. Still, devs deserve some love for managing to create smooth vibrant world. And fitting intro FMV into Genesis cartridge is just awesome. Too bad that ending is just a bunch of images with text.
Music is great too. Chiptune goodness, the best from few composers on the project.

Overall, eh. Mixing Flicky and Sonic is a nice idea, as evidenced by game like Wiz'n'Liz, albeit that one was only somewhat Flicky. But this isometric execution of it is weak. I still wouldn't call it a bad game.

Having played over 2 hours, I have enjoyed every level and challenge presented to me. I haven't found any puzzles too difficult, and the progression of difficulty is dare-I-say perfect. 
My favorite aspect of this game is the openness of the levels. In the construction level, I spent half an hour climbing various pipes and exploring the destroyed concrete structure. By going out of my way, I got to look at some of the puzzles and get new perspective on them (When you get to the castle, try to find a way to ring the bell!). The levels have tons of areas to explore and even has achievements for going off the beaten path!

Now for some scores
Gameplay: 9/10 Super simple, super fun! 
Level Design: 10/10 Each level has hidden areas to explore and flows with their theme well.
Story: NA Not all games need a story. This one is fantastic without it. 
Difficulty: Moderate, This is a game that will stretch casual players without breaking them and satisfy hardcore gamers without boring them. 
Worth Full Price?: Yes, this game is worth full price.

As a note, I am only a few hours into the game. I have been enjoying it so much, that I had to write a review and give this team the praise they deserve. My opinion may still be incomplete, but based on what I have seen so far, I recommend this game for anyone looking for a good time.",1547756228,1547756228,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198277810008,60,2,2053,0,346,1580949303

77,48195882,english,"This is one of the funniest game I’ve ever played. I usually hate games were the controls are clunky – but in this game the difficulty in controlling the wobbly character is more than half the fun! Dying a couple of times because you mistimed a jump is also not that frustrating as you respawn quickly and save locations are quite generous. The slightly crude polygon world works really well with this type of game, and gives it a cartoonish atmosphere and makes the character that much more loveable. The sound track is beautiful too.
The game reminds me of Grow Home and Grow Up (which in my book is a good thing).

Some criticism:
You need a pretty decent frame rate and a strong stomach if you want to avoid motion sickness. Or perhaps just take a big dose of Dramamine…
Perhaps it is just me being stupid, but I found the game very difficult to play using an XBOX controller – using the keyboard + mouse is much much better.
The biggest drawback of this game is the rather small number of levels available. I had played the original game over a year ago, but after learning about the new Dark level I installed it again. The new level was just as fun to play as the other levels.
It appears that virtually all recent negative reviews are from users disappointed because suddenly and silently linux support was dropped. I originally bought this game when I was still exclusively on linux, but I now have access to a Windoze box too, otherwise I could not have played the new Dark level.
In my opinion the devs should remove the ability to scale vertical walls by swinging back and forth– that just feels like cheating and all puzzles can actually be completed without climbing.",1546985583,1546985583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198408768447,320,153,2808,0,2703,1575642059

18,48109769,english,"==INTRO==
Human: Fall flat is a strange puzzle game with an even stranger name. It's main appeal are it's intentionally wonky controls, which allow for some interesting physics-based puzzles.
==GAMEPLAY==
Pretty straightforward. There's a bunch of levels with different themes, that are filled to the brim with various physics-based puzzles that require the utilization of the intentionally wobbly and weird control scheme to complete.
==MULTIPLAYER==
Multiplayer is literally just the base game + second player. It does break some puzzles.
==LENGTH==
Short. Around 7-15 hours, greatly shorter when in multiplayer due to the ability to break certain puzzles by standing on pressure plates, etc.
==DLC==
Not really a DLC, one free map added for halloween.
==MODS==
None that I know of.
==PROS AND CONS==

Pros: Silly and fun, very unique compared to other puzzle games.

Cons: Graphics are pretty much default unity stuff. very low poly and solid color. To me that's not a turn off, but to others it is. Biggest concern is the length of the game, it's rather short for its price, although it goes on sale often.

==RECOMMENDATIONS==

Who I would recommend this game to: Puzzle game fans, those who enjoy wonky physics games like Octodad, and the controls of Gang Beasts.

Who I wouldn't recommend this game to: Really just anyone who doesn't like the genre but that goes without saying.

==FINAL SCORE==

There is modification support (I don't know to what extent; as well, AOW), but, just let me know if you want to know how to set things up, at least when it comes to playing with others user created content (levels, character models)..

41,47769712,english,"This is what you get when you combine deliberately frustrating ragdoll QWOP controls with a physics puzzle, and it's the worst of both worlds.

Walking around like you're drunk as hell is amusing at first, but when you combine it with a physics puzzle, it quickly stops being fun. 

I [i]almost[/i] liked this game, but the trains level was so abysmally horrible that it singlehandedly ruined the whole game for me. First off, you start off with a door to a maze that's blocked by some debris. Moving even [i]one piece[/i] of debris is a chore and takes way more effort to pull off than it ought to. You think one piece is bad? [b]There's a whole fucking pile of it blocking the door[/b]. Do you see my playtime? 25 minutes? 10 of them were spent moving debris from that fucking pile. And even after spending all that time moving it, I still couldn't get the door open all the way, because there was just too much debris. That was one of the most obnoxious gameplay moments I've ever experienced. After that, I had to get a light to light my way in the maze, and in the maze, I found a crate, which I had to drag out from the depths of the maze with the lantern in the other hand, in a maze with narrow hallways. This is supposed to be fun? I sure as hell didn't have fun tripping over that box while trying to escape from the maze. 

Afterwards, I somehow managed to get up the wall using the crate and struggled my way to the end. At this point, I was quite nearly fed up with the game. And after that, on level 3, with the elevator and the crate, after I fell off the high platform with the crate the second time, because the crate is too heavy and it just drags you down with it, I immediately quit, because that was the point where I knew I was fighting with both the QWOP controls and the physics engine.

Never make the player fight with the physics engine, that's bad game design. And I don't understand why physics puzzles are popular, because that's all you do in those games: fight with the physics engine. The whole [b]point[/b] of a puzzle is in figuring out the solution. Execution is secondary and should always be straightforward and not gut wrenchingly tedious. It's a terrible gameplay experience, and it hurts my fingers. If the player has to physically struggle to do something that should be easy, they are not having fun. If the player tries the same solution multiple times and gets different results because the slightest difference in any variable results in wildly different output, then they will begin to resent the physics engine. You can have awkward controls and wonky physics, and you can have tricky puzzles, but please, [b]don't combine them.[/b]",1545632733,1545634120,False,1,0,0.419631034135818481,2,True,False,False,76561198261957551,910,191,25,0,25,1545632302

Portal felt nice in solo and coop due to its complex nature, but this feels a lot more like a coop game. They made every level soloable, but I think it would be far more fun to play with friends. 

My first playthrough took about 2 hours. I think a 10 euro price tag is a bit much for that, and even the 5 euros I paid are a bit too much for something I feel like I'd play 1-2 times. 

It does however just work and is a great experience. From visuals to music to difficulty, this game is fun and a joy to play. 


I wish they'd improve the game by adding more levels and a custom level builder. If this gets a custom level builder, it will be worth 10 euros 100% of the time.

This game was one of my favourites, but then the developer decided to drop support for Linux. (I assume it was the developer's decision, since a lot of games from the publisher are still supporting Linux).

I honestly can't believe that they did this, since I have paid for this game, and should get the same content as those with Mac and Windows. Just because I can still play the game doesn't make it okay. We (Linux users) won't be able to get updates, and won't get online multiplayer even though we have paid the same amount as those with Windows and Mac who will get these features. We are paid customers. We should get the content that was promised to paid customers. 

The developer answered a post about the support for Linux being dropped ( https://steamcommunity.com/app/477160/discussions/0/1735468693704602016/?insideModal=1&ctp=5#c1735469327933155260 ). It is clear from the comments that many people are as unhappy as I am. 

In the post by the developer it says that Linux was dropped so that Windows and Mac versions could continue updating. This is ridiculous. Linux users have paid the same amount as Mac and Windows users, but are now being refused the same content. The Linux community that has payed for this game did not pay only to have support be discontinued, and new updates and multiplayer become unavailable to us. When we paid for this game, we expected that we would get all future updates and continue being able to enjoy the game the same as everyone else. This was assumed with good reason, since no-one buys a game thinking that in the future they will suddenly be refused content that will be given to others. Dropping support for Linux is extremely unfair towards Linux users, and makes the purchase we made a scam, since we have given money and not received what was promised to us.  

I realise that this change won't make too big a difference to the developer. After all, the Linux community is quite small compared to the amount Windows and Mac users. It saddens me that the developer still deems it okay to do this to us, even if we are not the majority.",1545230549,1545230834,False,5,0,0.546390354633331299,0,True,False,False,76561198411298729,14,1,1171,0,1110,1554118656

91,47605615,english,"First of all, you may be wondering: ""How has he played 51 hours of this game...?"". The answer to that is to be given within this review.
Pros:
- Multiplayer is awesome.
- The physics add to more fun.
- There are many achievements to fill up all of your time.
- There are many ways of completing levels. For example, after I learnt how to climb things whenever I wanted, I climbed around the whole of Construction and finished the level that way.
- The developer is quite active for a one-man team. It is not easy to create a game as good as this all on your own (excluding the publisher).
Cons:
- Not too many levels but not too little -- takes 5 hours to complete roughly, depending on how you complete it: alone or with friends etc.
- Workshop has still not been added but as stated, this is not easy to implement as a one-man team.
- Quite boring if you are alone.

There is my answer to the question.

I have had this game before it was on Steam, there were only a few levels but still insanely fun!

If you are into games like Gang Beasts or Amazing Frog? then you may feel some nostalgia as this game has the same wacky physics but it is a lot more polished and always fun to speedrun.

EDIT:
The new level is really awesome and I had tons of fun with it, LOVING IT EVEN MORE!!

The completely dumb ideas we tried to traverse the maps and the hilarious ragdolling responses the character models did gave us so many hours of knee-slapping laughs.

We had played other games with a similar style to this such as Gang Beasts, and while I loved that game as well I just wanted larger maps and more platforming. Well Fall Flat definitely had that covered.

If you are looking to just mess around with friends and grief each other while trying to solve platformign puzzles then this is the game for you.

Pros:
1. Funny

4. Online Multiplayer support
5. Concept isn't that repetitive
6. The narrator has a nice voice.
7. Chat feature (some multiplayer games do not include chat)
8. Local Multiplayer support.
9. If you get bored of original maps, there are workshop maps   

Cons: 
1. Is usually only funny with friends
2. Workshop is complicated to get to
3. Lag (mostly online)
4. Friends can be annoying at times

Even with all the cons I've listed, I still give this game a fair 9/10.

- Controller support
- Extremely fun with friends
- Good for all ages
- A nice amount of humor, if you try
- Well done physics
- Fun vehicle play

Cons:
- Not many levels
- There's a bridge on the construstion level that you can get irreversibly stuck under. This is only a problem if you're as monumentally stupid as I was.

I really have no specific problems with this game other than it having (currently) only 11 levels. All the levels have many different ways to complete them though, so the playtime can be stretched.

The game provides simple but satisfying levels to manipulate your way through, and there are always a plethera of ways to complete these (which takes, give or take, 5 hours).

However...

Human: Fall Flat is not meant to be played by the rules, no...
All you need is to get some friends together and you get quite the diamond in the rough; betrayal, murder, mystery, hate, love, I won't let go Jack moments, anything your heart desires...
It may start with just one friend, but in my experience a chain reaction is triggered where you end up with a full lobby to kill, rape and pillage with.

 The Levels

[*] A fun level design in my opinion, can be very fun but also frusturating at times.
[*] Not many levels though. it will take around 16 hours to beat the game and get all achievments.

 Operating Sound track

[*] The sound track is super nice to listin too.
[*] sometimes can be dramatic/loud 

 Multiplayer

[*] Currently the multiplayer servers can be laggy with 5+ people on, and also a huge lag spike when someone joins.
[*] i have'nt had many server problems yet. if i cant join my friend usually just restarting your multi-player game will fix it.

 Bugs

[*] i havent seen many bugs but one ive seen was game breaking, me and my friend were achievment hunting and all the sudden we could fly. (i do have a screen-shot of it on my profile).
[*] Another i've seen was on the map castle which you couldnt break a lock inside a building. Luckily that isnt important at all and its only optional.

 mods
[*] Mods are a small pain to get, and you cant play them multi-player. (Hopefully workshop support soon)
[*] With mods you can download charecters (They work in multi-player) And you can also get Maps/Levels

overall this game can be amazingly funny, a great OST, and only a few bugs (i've encountered) i highly recommend if you

Human: Fall Flat is more like an arcade game. You just Keep Trying Things Over And Over to try and figure out what the developer wants you to do. And then, if that wasn't bad enough, you have to jump and grab and let go, etc. etc. at the exact moment so that you can accomplish what the developer had in mind. Games like these were designed as arcade games that made you pump more and more quarters into the machines to try and get to the end of the developers hoops and hurdles.
>Like Pac-man, Mario Brothers, etc.<
True puzzles are more like the ones at miller world inc or The Talos Principle where you are presented with a puzzle to solve, and you just solve it. You don't have to Jump at the exact place OR Grab at the exact height, OR Swing with the exact momentum, etc. etc.
However, If you like this type of arcade game then you should really like Human: Fall Flat.
There are SO MANY VARIABLES that you will be doing things Over and Over until you get it Just Right.
Of course you will constantly die and have to start over again and again and again.
Another thing that I hated and you may like is that the character that you control (that has to perform the hoops and hurdles) responds like a drunken sailor. He is a wobbly mess.
Another thing that I found strange was that I read Many of the reviews before I purchased and they were saying things like: ""It is hilarious""; ""We just kept laughing""; It is insanely funny; etc.  I never so much as experienced a hint of humor.
It wasn't funny. It wasn't fun. I was more like a miserable chore that you just Had To Finish so that you could put it behind you and forget it as fast as possible.
Oh, and least I forget, extremely boring.
But like I said, if you like this type of arcade game then you may be in for a treat. The software ran without so much as a hiccup. The graphics and sound were clean and I didn't experience any location that 'trapped' you.

The main reason is that I do not enjoy a game in which the main (or actually, only) diffifulty comes from the difficulty of controlling your character's body. I mean, I do enjoy challenging levels, challenging puzzles and everything, but to struggle with a bad body to finish some tasks which would be otherwise trivial if you have a normal body, is another matter. The person you control in this game seems to have no bones and drunk as well. It walks as if dragging its body, and the arms would even get stuck with its own head. Most of the tasks are obvious enough, and would be quite simple with a normal body.

42,45108019,english,"(Long-Winded Explanation of Game Mechanics) [Skip]
Human Fall Flat, a ragdoll physics game with velcro hands, entertained me for a while. Control scheme is a typical WASD for locomotion while Left and Right Mouse button stretches out the hands for grabbing things. One more thing: you can jump! Press the Space bar to jump. Gain some momentum by spamming the heck out this and holding both Left and Right Mouse buttons in order to jump huge gaps. Shamble around like a zombie while desperately leaping over gaps. Rotate the camera by moving the mouse which also moves the direction of the outstretched hands.

(I Hate Hook Puzzles)
I spent hours trying to explore nooks and crannies while avoiding conventional solutions to the game's many puzzles. I particularly dislike using hooks to swing across anything in the game and would rather cling onto a wall like an insect to reach my destination.

(Performance Related Game Lag)
You too can experience the game like I did, but better! My computer is crap when it comes to framerate for this game in later stages. The game performed alright considering my laptop come from the year 2013. I assume just about anyone else out there owns a computer that performs better than mine. If your computer can play Saints Row the Third without lagging, congratulations! Your computer is better than mine.

(Multiplayer Experiences-Lag-Trolls-Aloof Players)
The time needed to join a game took about 3 minutes. The few times I managed to play a multiplayer game, I experienced lag with more than 2 people. In the chaotic mess of a multiplayer game, I came across silent gamers that took it upon themselves to cling onto me, carry me off, and throw me from a cliff. Down I tumbled into another experience where players remained clueless and careless on how to solve a puzzle. Their aloof nature infuriated me as my attempt to solve it on my own were ruined by their interloping. I almost gave up until a few of the 7 other players actually solved it by chance.

(Conclusion)
This game is best enjoyed on a single player playthrough. Plug in a USB controller for someone else to play from the same computer (good old fashion CO-OP 2 player that seldom shows up in modern games). Nobody says another actual person needs to be around for 2nd player. Use that other player as a useless ragdoll or stool whenever it's convenient. Go out there and enjoy this game on your own time, then maybe try dipping your toes in the deep end of multiplayer. Best of luck to anyone that plays this.

53,45021479,english,"Human: Fall Flat is definitely fun with friends but I'm not sure if it's worth full price, if you're interested I suggest you read the short lists below and check it out when it's on sale.

COOL: 
+ Easy to start, understand and play co-up experience. You can play solo, but is simply quite boring.
+ Surprisingly funny and engaging for such simple mechanics. At least with friends.
+ Stylized graphics and design are a'ight. Nothing amazing but works for what it's trying to do.
+ Achievements and other minor challenges are introduced to add some spice to the game, but still has limited replay value.
+ Music is rather surprising. Sometimes doesn't fit the mood, but it might be the most professional-seeming part of this indie game.
+ There are apparently ideas to have a Workshop where people could share levels and avatars they made themselves, this could greatly increase the game's lifespan.

NOT-SO-COOL:
- Without any friends to play with it's simply a rather slow-paced walking simulator with some puzzles and parkour mixed in.
- Everythnig is physics based with no real challenges. Just small chores that are hard to do due to the nature of the controls. This was funny in ""Octodad"" for example, but not so much here since there is no narrative to make it funny, only your friends.
- It's also really easy to go out-of-bounds or sequence break. Half the times the intended path is less obvious then the alternate ones, meaning level design is a bit rubbish.
- A far better experience with a controller then keyboard and mouse but inputs seems to lag quite easily when you're playing with a lot of people.
- For a game that is so easy to break and get stuck in, there isn't an /unstuck command or anything like that. You can only ""reset to checkpoint"" the ENTIRE server when one person is stuck. 


So all in all, it seems this game has a solid idea but fails a bit at the excecution. Maybe a bit more time in development could've given it a bit more character to work with. I think 15 bucks for less then 10 hours of rather limited fun might be a bit much for some people so I recommend to grab it on sale as long as you've got some friends to fool around with.

there's only 6-7 levels included, and no straightforward workshop support. and this game isn't something like half life 2 episode 1 where even at 20$ it'd be a game that's well worth the money, HFF isn't. it really isn't, and the lack of regular updates puts this game with litterly 95% of early accses games. unfinished, a good idea with a lackluster game attched to it. 

is there workshop support. yes, but it's so stupid to accses, there's no real mod tools that are easily avalible. and for a game like this. it needs easy to get into, easy to make addons to be more alive than a few month old coma paitent.

The biggest workaround is to disable key repeat after starting the game.

1) start the game.
2) in the terminal type without quotes ""xset r off""
3) Profit

The game will crash a couple times but this resolves most crashing issues.

40,44856440,english,"An interesting concept that ""falls"" short.

The game although amusing to watch via Twitch or YouTube is more frustrating than it is fun when actually played. I experienced the game for the first time co-op and both my friend and I found the puzzles to be underwhelming. The physics for movement is more annoying than it is fun, but considering how the game is built I can't think of a way it could be improved while maintaining its design style in terms of perspective and mechanics.

Both my friend and I tried the game using an Xbox One controller and frankly it was a struggle as the movements for the puzzles became more complex. Not a struggle as in ""Man this puzzle is hard because it requires knowledge A or B with skill A or B."" no more like ""These physics and controls make this object move at an almost unpredictable path."" We honestly felt like moving objects around left us at the mercy of ""RNG"". But that's just our opinion.

Overall, the game is interesting. Many people seem to enjoy Human Fall Flat as it holds a Very Positive on Steam at the time of my review.

However, it's not a game for me and personally I can't see myself ever playing it again, even with a friend.

I bought the game on discount and I couldn't recommend it at that price point.

This is the first game on Steam I've ever refunded in the seven years I've used this platform.

Either way, this is just my opinion. Hopefully it might help with your decision to buy.

You can skip 90% of all the levels, and you will randomly be able to fly.

I 100% reccomend this game its so fun to play with mates.
(nothing is better than dressing up like an astronaut and smashing windows with sofa cushions)

The physics baste puzzles are really clever and there is more than one way to solve it, this really involves your imagination.
Speaking of physics, the charactor physics are helarious.
(Smash windows, climb walls, crash cars; do it all anything is possible in this game)

For keyboards the controls are SUPER easy.
i haven't tryed controlers yet so im not sure how difficult they are but im guessing there easy.

So heres my conclusion: GET... THIS.. GAME! SRSLY :D

27,42816924,english,I simply love it. Playing this game with friends is so much fun and it never gets old. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!,1529347864,1529347864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198156501463,156,8,375,0,338,1537353434
28,42806484,english,"Human: Fall Flat is just a really strange game. I first came across it while checking out what games are out there and instantly thought 'this game isn't for me' and clicked on not interested but after a long while, my friends were looking for a fun puzzle game to play together. We had recently just played 'we were here' and 'we were here 2' which we also enjoyed. Regardless, I was asked to purchase this game, now for the price tag of 15 bucks and the looks, it seems a bit hefty and all in all, it kind of is a bit much for this game but when push comes to shove, its fun. You may not get thousands of hours in and for the relatively short game, its a bit on the pricey side but with friends, it really is just a heap of fun. 

I would like to point out a few things about the game though. Single player without friends, is like yanking out your own teeth, its boring, this game is all about the group dynamic with friends. VOIP, random acts of harasment to your team mates, its all fun and games till somebody gets picked up and thrown off a cliff.

As for the graphics, well, there are a few issues but it looks like it plays, like walking around with a puff pastry. Your balance is a bit wonky, when you look at places, you move around which considering the sizes of some ledges means that you look towards the next ledge and you go falling back down, its pretty hard sometimes. Most of the puzzles are pretty easy to solve but require you to think for a moment and in that moment, you should have that one friend that tries something to prove Darwin correct.

Now for the sad part, the game doesn't have much replayability. Face it, once you know how to do the puzzle, its just done. The fact you move around in a kind of wonky way makes that the hardest part about the puzzle and you will start to hate the game pretty fast when you are trying to do something you already know how to do but can't really make it. However that isn't the biggest down side of the game, the biggest downside is the fact that there are bugs. The biggest 2 seem to be a locked door that can't be opened while it should be to allow for movement between two areas which makes achievement hunting a real pain and then there is the big one. Sometimes it will bug out and you can just jump over and over to fly. As you can understand, when you can just hold down spacebar and avoid 100% of the puzzles and just go from start to finish in a few seconds, its pretty dull. 

However, I would recommend this game, its fun, its a bit expencive all considering. If you are looking for a good game to play with friends, I would put this one on hold and buy it on a sale.  If you are playing with a full group, you can probably finish the game in 1-3 hours. If you are looking to do all the achievements, 5-10 hours. If you are looking to just goof off and have fun, 10-15 hours before you hit the workshop really. I haven't tried the workshop myself but the game seems to be pretty fun all round. I would have wanted a game of this size and quality however to be sold at a price 33%-50% of its current price, so between 5-10 and not 15. However, get it on a sale and you got value but you should really only get this game with friends.",1529311359,1529311359,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197978246593,503,44,1338,118,836,1600988293
29,42802689,english,"Human: Fall Flat is a 3D physics-based puzzle game that really shines when played cooperatively with friends. You play a drunkenly wobbling character (which you can paint and customize) that can walk, jump, and grab/carry items (as well as each other, which can make for some fun rescue attempts of doomed friends). The only play skill really is perhaps the ledge jump, which requires your arms up during a leap that hopefully gets you high enough on the ledge so that you can pull yourself up. Other than that, the playability is pretty straightforward. I played with mouse and keyboard and didn't have any problems with the controls. There were some moments when I was carrying and aiming large poles where the camera ended up in a poor position and I could not see. Having a friend to be a spotter definitely helps for those moments. Oh, and figuring out how to row a boat, that's a tough one. 

I'd say that most of the puzzles are not too difficult and become apparent rather quickly. However, while you can see what NEEDS to be done, it isn't always obvious HOW it is to be done. There was probably 1 puzzle per map that really took a long time to solve. A few took almost an hour to solve. This is when your personal creativity really comes into play. I think there is the primary, graceful way to solve each puzzle most efficiently, but aside from that you can always drag random items with you to a new area and end up creating your own solution. Some of the puzzles seem to have extra items laying around for exactly that purpose. Also, this means that if you trip an event and 'lose' your item, there is always a backup plan laying around for you if you can find it. There were a few times we lost our item, our boat, or whatever, and the developers never left us stranded. We always had a way forward and never had to quit and restart. I really like this aspect of the game. A lot of puzzle games can focus on the ""one solution"" and box you into that expectation of how it should be solved. This game sets you free. If you can get your character to the end... however you do that.. you solved it! The puzzles themselves are quite creative, and while there are some simple ""get the box to this weight-switch"" puzzles, there are so many others. Probably the most common question you ask will be ""how do I get up / over there?"" and the puzzle is more about traveling to a location rather than solving some kind of number or pattern riddle. 

I did not play single-player, but on cooperative mode there were times when it was the sort of situation where only 1 person can reach the end, so that was bittersweet. Although, the puzzles themselves generously allowed 2nd player to proceed after the 1st player trips an event. For example, the 1st player may be swinging and land on a stone which topples over underneath them. That stone falls but lands in a way that allows the 2nd player to drop down onto it and take a secondary path to catch up to 1st player. It's fun to be in the lead and trip the events, and if you are 2nd in line then it could be a drag if you only get to follow someone else's path of destruction. Don't fear! Many of the alternate paths have their own events and encounters, so you still get that experience of being first. Because of this aspect of the gameplay, I feel that the experiences of who goes first and who goes second is quite balanced. It may be a little different with more than 2 people though. 

The maps and level design were fun and maintained a lot of interest due to number of places to explore. Some of the maps are quite large, and there will be many puzzle sections within the map. It does save gradually as you work through the map. The design itself was quite varied with each map being its own very different world. I never got bored of the maps. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with this game. It was a lot of fun, it got me thinking, and the characters are quirky enough that you can't control things smoothly yet somehow it seems more amusing than frustrating. If a sequel comes out or if there is a DLC / workshop for more maps I will definitely return to this game.",1529292281,1529292718,True,7,2,0.557603657245635986,0,True,False,False,76561198077164486,90,9,1094,0,505,1595138443

57,42536417,english,"At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. 
“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. 
...
After playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. 
 
[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. 
[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. 
[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.
[/list]

[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. 
[/list]

[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.
[/list]
 
[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]
[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]
I was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. 
Human Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours.

Oyunun grafikleri çok tatlış. Küçük penguenlerinizi (benim deyimimle) istediğiniz gibi giydirip paytak paytak oradan oraya atlayabilirsiniz. Oyunun arka fonunda çalan saçma müziği hiç beğenmedim. Onun yerine arkada fonda 2pac veya eminem dinlemek daha zevkli açıkçası.

Oynanış açıkçası çok basit diyebilirim. Sol click ile sol kol, sağ click ile sağ kolu haraket ettirebilirsiniz. Zaten bunu oyunun en başında size çok rahat bir şekilde öğreniyorsunuz. Dinamiklerden bahsedecek olursak bu konuda biraz kanser diyebilirim çünkü karakterinizi istediğiniz kadar ileri veya geri götüremiyorsunuz. Ayaklarınız normal bir şekilde haraket ederken belinizin üst kısımları sıvı kadar akışkan bir şekilde haraket ediyor. Ancak bu kanser haraketler sizi güldürebilecek potansiyele sahip. 2-3 arkadaşınız varsa (mümkünse aklı olsun 70iq altında olursa olmaz) bölümleri çok rahat bir şekilde geçebilirsiniz. (Buraya kadar okudun beğenirsin umarım ;*)

İndirmdeyken alınabilecek, arkadaşlarınız 3iq değilse güzel vakit geçirebileceğiniz tatlış bir oyun.

22,41487146,english,"The game has a very simple concept. Get from A to B, solving puzzles and working together along the way. The simplicity in itself is something I appreciate, there's no hidden trophies, severe punishment for failure or any micro-transactions.
The physics are simple, as are graphics, as there isn't really any need for them to be anything other than that. It's a functional, self-explanatory environment.
There is a rather cute 'character creator' allowing you to paint regions or free-draw on the character's model.

Some puzzles aren't always obvious at first glance and there are multiple ways of solving it, the one that succeeds depends on how patient and tenacious you are.
The controls are simple and easy to get the grips of, excuse the pun.

Perhaps the downside of the game, at least as far as I can see, is the lack of 'levels' overall.
Quickly completing the levels there was little left to do other than drag along a friend. Once their run was over, drag in another... it all got rather boring and even a little frustrating when those friends couldn't see the solution to the puzzle, which was all the more obvious to me having completed the same thing multiple times already.

Something I've seen suggested many times, and now agree with, is some form of level creator incorporated in the existing game (or as a different application). This allowing users to create new levels for their friends or others around the world into a workshop where they can easily download the map and have more adventures. Not only would it bring back a lot of existing players but new ones too perhaps.

Understandably there will likely be a level of 'trolling' with this however, maps with rude words and creations or ones that simply cannot be solved.

Up to 8 player coop so very nice touches. Make sure you have a oxygen tank near you I ran out of breath laughing.

Note for you developers,
                  Developers really nice job with the game love your work so far if you can please add some additional levels in the near future adds a nice touch to the short but fun series of levels. Maybe a steam workshop, guarentee that the whole community will make some fun levels for the rest to try out. Keep it going.

69,39498075,english,"First off, let me say that I did previously review this game, and I don't think I did it enough justice.

Human: Fall Flat is a game about Bob, an average human trying to overcome his dreams. Or, as far as I am aware that is the story.
H:FF isn't a story based game, no, it is a 3D puzzle platformer.

Pros:

*Multiplayer is AMAZING, dare I say, it is the BEST part of the entire experience
*Levels are imaginative, but not to the point where you feel overwhelmed
*The game doesn't care how you solve puzzles, leading to nearly endless possibilities
*The physics in this game are really one of the highlights, as they can create some truly beautiful moments
*Speedrunning this game just feels awesome since using certain tricks, you can go super fast and blaze through stages
*Attempting to get all of the achievements can add some great fun to be had after beating the game, heck, I even consider this the postgame!

Cons:

*Only nine levels!? I wouldn't mind if all of the levels were the same length as the castle level, but come on! There are only 5 substantially lengthy stages out of the 9 already in the game!

*In my opinion, the first three levels are a waste of space. To better them, they could have been packed into one tutorial level as to not waste any more time on the tutorials.

*The lack of an easy to use level editor. Now before anyone comes running at me with pitchforks, let me explain myself: The level editor we currently have is not an ideal solution to level making, as you not only need Unity, No, you need an OLDER VERSION of Unity, AND even after you have made your level, you likely won't even be able to export the files!

*Single-player can be VERY boring. I'm being serious about this, if you want to get the most bang for your buck, you really do need at least one other person playing it with you to make it a ton of fun.

*The controls may feel weird at first, but later you get used to them.

VERDICT:

Now, I know that the cons I listed were pretty lengthy, but those were just some things that only MILDLY bothered me, since either way this game is still a ton of fun.
After putting 70+ hours into this game, I think I can safely say that this game is worth the price, but only if you have at least one buddy to play this game with or it won't be as fun as it could be.

I give Human: Fall Flat a 10 out of 10.

Lots of people may disagree with me, but this game is seriously my favorite game on Steam and of all time.",1516497446,1522448348,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,76561198337390005,60,7,6251,14,4484,1601252262

There aren’t much currently in this game. A few levels to go through and solve. If you play solo, everything is a challenge. With friends, your life is 20x easier.

First off, as it stands, the game is short. Real short. A few levels of puzzles and you're pretty much done. No story or anything. Just a goofy ragdoll making his way downtown. If you're looking for a long invovlved game then at this point I would recommend moving on. 

With that said, me and my friend had a blast with this game. It's a sandbox puzzler and as the levels advance so do your available options in solutions. There's always an ""answer"" for the level, but it was usually more fun trying to do the level in any way other than the correct path. Working as a team was fun, throwing your teammate over the edge was funny, and it never really became frustrating like a lot of co-op puzzle games can be. 

We beat this a few months ago, but we both check back regularly to see if there's any new levels or an online version of the workshop just because we had such a good time with this game. 

To wrap it up, in it's current form I give the game a solid ""C"". We had a blast, the game itself is fun and runs well(I don't remember anything too game breaking at the moment). If they ever get the workshop with custom maps available to playing with friends then I can imagine a lot more hours put into this one and would definitely bump the rating up.

I love that there are lots of exploits and crazy bugs. This is a wonky physics game afterall.

Once online multiplayer was introduced, you're able to meet lots of interesting people from all over the world and start your journey all over again.

Gameplay is amazing. There are numerous ways to finish any given level, as well as secrets in each. Playing solo has its challenges and so does playing with friends. Some obstacles are easier to pass with one person than 2+.

[*] Animation glitches that can screw up climbing/swing/etc
[*] There is a multiplayer level with no objective, a snowball gun, and is fun to waste time with friends.

The controls are simple and the game works well with controller (i have an xinput pad and can't speak to other controllers) or mouse and keyboard which i prefered, you can rebind keys.
I finished the game in 3 and a half hours but i was fairly quick, most people are taking just over 4 hours. Some of the 'zones' have multiple side areas to explore which are challenging little tests for fans of the climbing mechanics, i definitely missed a few things in my playthrough so there's still stuff to see if i were to go back, there is a stage select for quick revisits.

I love messing with physics in games so this is totally my kind of thing, there's plenty to do here for a fun afternoon of bouncing around, i recommend watching some gameplay to see if it's for you, the length is just right for a short and fun physics playground and manages to keep showing you cool and interesting things throughout.",1469315014,1520381929,True,9,1,0.527035236358642578,0,True,False,False,76561197964850713,1050,11,215,0,213,1544044088

Yes tooling around with friends is fun, but no game modes? pvp? weapon modes even? races? obstacle courses? map builder? workshop maps? The fact that there are no consequences to any actions just makes it way too tame to me. Fall off the edge? No worries. pick up exactly where you left off. Too easy.

The maps are built pretty well and you do have to think through the puzzles (and i'll admit i laughed most of the time with my friend), but to me it's just too bland to be called fun. By the end of each level theres no real sense of accomplishment, just relief that you're done the level and hopefully something more fun will be next. The controls are frustratingly not controllable which is a definite no go in a game so specific to carrying, running, and climbing things. Gang beasts is the pvp equivalent, and having both ideas collide would make a far superior game (for gang beasts too).

43,40492631,english,"Human: Fall Flat is an excellent little physics based puzzle game with a wonky yet fun and rather deep control scheme similar to QWOP or Octodad.

This game brings back memories of playing through the puzzle sections of Half-Life 2 for the first time and being amazed at the possibilities and unique ways to solve many of the challenges. Almost always there are at least two obvious solutions to each puzzle, and several far more obscure and interesting ones. The games first few levels are very short, and serve as a tutorial of sorts, but once you got the hang of jumping, climbing, carrying and falling the game opens up with some rather huge worlds filled with things locales to explore, vehicles to experiment with and challenges to overcome.

The visual style is very simplistic and somewhat cute and dorky with the marshmellow-like characters, whom you can also customize quite heavily with different outfits, colours and even your own face through the use of a webcam. Music isn't anything too special, although some tracks did give off a very majestic and powerful feeling (something that very much clashes with the gameplay and at times made it even funnier.)

There is no story to speak of, unless you consider the narrator who makes sarcastic and funny remarks during the first few tutorial levels as story. I don't think this is a problem in any way though, the game feels more like a sandbox for you to play around with and each level simply consists of getting from point A to point B and then making a 'leap of fail'. Tacking on some sort of plot could instead have taken away from the focus of the game, which to me was solving the levels in fun ways while accidentally (or purposefully) screwing over any potential Co-Op partners.

Speaking of Co-Op the game can be made far more entertaining if you have a friend or two to play with. The puzzles are sometimes made extremely easy with multiple players, and some can even be skipped entirely like retrieving boxes for the buttons (you can instead simply have one person stand on the button as only one player needs to clear the level for everyone to pass.) However this is nicely balanced out by the fact that far more options open up when you are several players, you can climb on each other and pull each other up from heights or swing each other around etc. The vehicles are also even more infuriating (and fun) to manuver with several people trying to communicate and steer things the right way, often ending in the party falling off a cliff yelling at each other like friends do.

Human: Fall Flat was a very enjoyable experience to me, and the only issues I really had with it was a few bugs, most minor but one or two gamebreaking ones that I hope the devs will be able to fix soon. The biggest glitch I came across, and I believe it is a glitch although it might be some sort of dev-tool that the dev team forgot to remove when publishing the game, is that contrary to the narrator's beliefs you can in fact fly in this game. I will not write how to fly here, because it allows you to bypass all the levels in mere minutes, missing out on the whole game and I know some people may be prone to using it if they find out how to much to their own dismay.

The game also comes with achievements, tasking you with really exploring the levels thoroughly and solving some optional puzzles. They were a welcome addition and extended my own playtime by quite a bit as I enjoyed most of the extra challenges. Playtime can range anywhere between 3 to 10 hours I'd wager, depending on how quickly you are able to clear the puzzles, and if you rush through the game or decide to explore it fully like I did. There are only 9 levels, but the last 5 levels can easily take several hours to beat. Workshop would fit this game perfectly and if they add workshop support for player-made levels that would make my recommendation even warmer.

A very fun game to play with friends! Buy it at full price, or during a sale if you're not sure about the purchase.",1519927095,1519927095,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006879453,1177,67,950,0,587.0,1590107306

You probably wont want to buy this game when you see it. At most you might just be on the ropes about the idea. To be honest it's not a very long or clever game. It's broken in a lot of places and where it isnt broken you can always find a way to break it.
But here is why I don't regret putting this game in my steam library and why you should have it there yourself.
In this game you will use your friends heads to climb to safety from a lake of lava.
You will launch yourself out of a catapult to break the walls of a keep.
You will lock your friends in a small house.
You will attempt to jam lengthy blocks where they definitely wont fit.
You will try to climb a wall with your face and ultra sticky hands.
You will build things that were a waste of time and wrestle your friends because they knocked it down. You will sail a boat and operate machinery and do gymnastics.
You will wander around like a handicapable toddler and push your friends off cliffs ""just 'cuz"".
You will have alot of fun if you waste your time and money on this game. You should buy it and a copy for your friends and have a great night doing silly stuff because it will be great fun.

-----------------

Pros:
Very fun.
Very good physics.
Great multiplayer.
Online splitscreen, that's freaking awesome.
A lot of different ways to complete levels.

Cons:
Not a bunch of maps, they really should add a level creator. then this game would be perfect.
No workshop. (yet)
Possibly just me but sometimes servers make my game delayed.


Overall:
I highly recommend this game, it's very fun to do with friends/family or with strangers. I've had many laughs and great times. Even though there are not many maps there is SO much to do. So many different things and hidden secrets. I personally like breaking the game :). So yeah, if your looking for a fun multiplayer game i highly recommend.

As you blunder around the world with your ragdoll companion, exploring the environment and trying to solve puzzles to get to the end of your journey and onto the next level. It's simplistic, intriguing and enigmatic.

We found we were scratching our heads trying to work out how to solve a puzzle or get through a particular path only to accidentally blunder upon the answer in the most enjoyable way. There are multiple ways to get somewhere and when you're playing together it only takes one person to find the answer or you can do it together or help one person move onto the next part to then get both of you ahead. 

You can play on your own, but it's so much more enjoyable with a companion.

I loved the way this one felt to play, it gives you a happy feeling, even when you're failing, falling and failing again. If you want to play something different. Something that makes you think, but also relaxes and frustrates you in equal measure, then this is it.

89,40362038,english,"Cons:
i like looking where my character is going so i angle the mouse to be able to view my surroundings. unfortunately in this game this means that my character is hunched over all the time like he ""can't even"". 

you can spiderman grip the walls but for some reason you can't climb them like spiderman. i've tried several times to climb walls, vines, a train. each time the hands grip but no upward momentum is gained or not enough momentum. i release the button for one hand to reach up to grab the next bunch of wall only to find that the now free hand has no intention of grabbing any more wall and just dangles there.
There are times when i'm running around trying to grab things and when i let them go my character's arm swings uncomfortably around the back of his head. So the ragdoll physics needs work to have less jello like humans, and humans that are a bit more stiff and seemingly have actual bones instead of spaghetti noodles.

Pros:
That being said it's still a physics puzzler and those are fun, at least until they are frusterating and no longer stay fun

What really enhanced my experience though was the fun Multiplayer aspect of the game. Through hosting a game a lobby I was able to find awesome players to go through the levels and on one play session we all role played as daring adventurers going on awesome adventures like becoming pirates and and knights in an old medieval castle. If you wish to host a lobby though I suggest a maximum of 4 or 5 players any more than that I promise you it will become crazy and hectic! 

Now as much as I love this game I do have some complaints though such as , though there is a banning system it can get a bit tricky to track which players are the trolls and which ones aren't. I suggest adding player usernames above our bobs or at least maybe at the top-right or top-left corner of the screen there's a list of players on the server with their names and an image of their character. That way it would be a lot easier to see whose who.

Finally and I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, I would suggest to somehow implement a voice chat into the game. God knows how many times I got into situations where a player can help pull me up but I can't type in chat because I'll fall to my doom. If the developers could somehow make this an option in the game that would be an awesome edition :D

50,40244455,english,"I am speechless with this game. This is a fairly new game, and it is incredible. There are only like 10 levels, each one taking longer and longer to complete. It is insanely fun. I bought it on a sale, but I say it's worth full price. Even though there is only 10 levels, there is so much content. You can play with friends, local or online. One of the major reasons I love this game so much because of how interactive it is. Basically you can mess with any objects you find. Sometimes there are just random objects lying around, like at the end of a level was in a house once. My friends and I barricaded the doors, and sorta just messed around with the furniture. We broke glass with our fists, picked eachother up and threw eachother off of the balcony. If I had to rate this game, I give it a 10/10. I highly recommend this game to people. If you don't really have many friends to play this game with, then you can play online with people for 1-8 players. All levels are the same singleplayer or multiplayer, but it makes it more fun multiplayer in my opinion. You can mess around with more stuff. You can jump off a cliff, grab a ledge, and your friend can jump off the edge and grab your leg screaming ""YOU'RE COMING WITH ME, PUNK!"" This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. Being a fairly new game, they should release loads of more content should I cannot wait for. It has very few bugs for how new it is. Not that it would have many bugs either way, as it is fully released. If you feel like murdering your friends by throwing them off of cliffs, (which you then instantly respawn at your last checkpoint), breaking glass, playing maps all based around destroying stuff, going through tough and puzzling challenge, (or skipping them by taking shortcuts or just climbing around the wall that seperates the two rooms), feel accomplished after taking 5 hours on the last level only to find out there were easier ways to do it, climb trains and ride boulders as they tumble down mountains, then this is the game for you! (Don't tell me this was a run-on sentence.)

So how does this game score in my opinion?
Rating: 10/10
Originality: 10/10
Fun: 10/10
Creativity: 10/10
Bugs: 9.5/10 (That's good, not saying that it scores well on how many bugs it has.)
Killing your friends: 10/10
Content: 8/10
Available content in the future: 9/10

So I scored in 8 categories, if you add up all the numbers, in my opinion, it scored a 76.5/80.
I'd say it's worth $14.99 not buying it on a sale, (unless you wait for a sale), for hours of fun and playing with all of your friends for hours of enjoyment and killing.

So in conclusion, this game is 100% worth it and if you are considering it, GET OUT OF YOUR STUPID HEAD AND CLICK THE FREAKING 'Add to Cart' BUTTON!

[*]The third Onlinegame will stick with me to death.

Luckely i landed right next to him the next second. 
I keept running away from him tryed to explore the map, as a dog landed next to me. Or more like a man in a dog Costume. I won't assume gender here, but after he defended me from this village people nightmare,

Spoiler:  The water map was infuriating!!!  at one point you need to tether 2 boats together to get a box on a button.  This took me close to 9 tries, because the boats had a mind of their own and kept on running down the river.  

My only gripe with the game would be that, I would have liked a quick save option.  The autosave save at weird locations, meaning that if you miss time that one jump or grap, it is back to the last checkpoint, usually one that had you raging to get past it.

34,40167578,english,"I picked up this game after seeing it featured on Go 8 Bit. It looked like fun, but I couldn't have imagined just how much! 

Usually I don't like co-op games - I'm a gamer and I like games because, generally speaking, I prefer to do fun stuff without it being interfered with by other people. Co-op's become such a huge componant of games of late and (often) at the expense of the fun. There are a few exceptions: Borderlands, Little Big Planet, Rock Band, Dead Island to name a few. And right at the top of the list is Human Fall Flat. 

This game is a test of friendship and the quickest way to get divorced if you're playing with a spouse. It's also made me laugh more than any other game I've played in a very long time! It's hilarious. Yelling to your friend 'my arm's stuck behind my head, I can't!' or 'dammnit, I'm gripping the floor too... which hand do I let go... ahhh, wrong one!' never gets old. 

Not only is it fun it is beautifully designed. The physics are so impressive and exploring the various levels is both satisfying and challenging. It's also very difficult to do right, which adds to the pleasure of finding those exits. 

If you like puzzles this is perfect. I suspect there as many ways of solving the levels as people out there. Brute force seems to work well and who doesn't love swinging a rock around till you break a window? Also, catapults! Who wouldn't want to get shot over a wall by a seige weapon?

The enjoyment we received for the next few days as we attempted to make our way through the levels was worth it.  Some of the levels can be maddening, like attempting to drive the truck and tower jumping (falling) in the power plant level.  Others flowed real well.  Some were confusing as we weren’t quite sure which way to go.

There doesn’t seem to be a lot of replay value.  There can be weird physics glitches.  A whole level’s worth of progress can be destroyed if a random player joins your session and doesn’t want to cooperate, but we laughed through it all.  I wouldn’t say the game is worth it at full price, but I’ve spent $7.50 on worse.

'They' are wrong. Bob clearly has superpowers.

But it's not Bob's apparent superpowers that make the game fun. What makes the game fun is the fact that you are given literally nothing but your own two hands and the aforementioned 'tools', and you have to use them to solve the puzzles you are put before. For every puzzle, there are multiple ways to go about solving it, and trying them all lasts for a long time.

Or you could just climb across the bottom of the map (This is actually possible)

Difficult to a certain degree.

There is alot of times I don't get my grips even after I see my arm extend, and this has happend more and more lately.

Human: Fall Flat is a great plataformer where you control a blob person, who is customisable, to waddle around and lift objects or themself to reach higher ground to solve the puzzles within the many levels of the game. The arm mechanics of grabbing where you look as well as physically using your mouth to indicate where to move your arms really puts yourself in your characters shoes. With it's blob-like but cartoony graphics it's a fun puzzle game which is great with friends.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Fun gameplay
- Fun physics
- Entertaining ragdoll physics
- Good graphics
- Lots of levels and puzzles
- Good soundtrack
- Customisable character
- Great Multiplayer

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Being your character is wobbly it can be hard to control on narrow walks to lifting yourself onto a small plataform. Although the wobbling isn't Grow Home/Grow Up levels of wobbling.
- It's a personal pet peeve of mine where Indie games ""honour"" popular youtubers who did a couple videos on their game and have special recognition being added into the game or future titles. And in this game theres tailor-made outfits and custom heads for specific youtubers such as Draegast, JackSepticEye, MattShea, etc. The reason i don't like it is because it gives a special prize to the popular people rather than just having something everyone can use, albeit you can also wear the outfits made for the youtubers, it just feels like they're given special badge just for doing a few videos on the game.

32,39468373,english,"TL:DR version - I only played single player. No mutiplayer of any kind. Not at all recommended.

So many positive reviews I was willing to give it a shot. I was expecting a goofy game where you would be using wonky physics to solve puzzles. I was partly correct in that expectation but unfortunately the physics aren't fun to mess with and the controls are tedious. All of the ""puzzles"" have no more than 2 ways to solve and usually only 1 is do-able. The fun/challenge of a puzzle is figuring out how to solve it, not the exuction of putting the pieces together. Every puzzle/obstacle was easy to figure out and incredibly hard to execute due to the controls and physics. I was hoping to be building catapults and make-shift towers but instead I'm trying to plug cables into batteries while my character is instead grabbing the floor and some random rock that is nearby. It was more fun to figure out ways AROUND the puzzles, which sort of says a lot about the level design in this game. I'd rather bypass the sections than play those sections.

Because there is a lot of climbing in the game (especially when circumventing areas) you are constanty swinging the camera, because where you look is where you (sometimes) grab (if the game cooperates). This actually gave me a little motion sickness and as a result I could only play for an hour or sometimes two, in one sitting. Also, not a good time.

If there was a run button or better climbing mechanics than I would really enjoy this game. The characters move like toddlers to put it simply. It looks funny to watch but it's a headache to play. Unfortuantely, the whole game kind of feels like an alpha-build that made it out into the world as a full game.

EDIT: I also forgot to mention that the game has some console commands... but you can only use them after you've finished the levels and they turn off achievements (even things like free-cam, apparently). It would have been nice to be able to jump to a checkpoint instead of replaying entire levels for some of the achievements. I don't want to replay entire levels for one section at the end.

1. Complete puzzles
2. Explore
3. Finish the game with flying colours

What me and friends do:

1. Hold hands
2. Throw ourselves off the edge of the map
3. Throw your friends off the edge of the map
4. Draw funny faces on our avatars
5. Grabbing ledges but you grab your friends ankles
6. Watch TV but we throw the TV off the map
7. Asking for help to get pulled up but we grab their face anyway
8. Falling from the sky to restart what you were doing but you fall on top of a tree and hold on so your friends can laugh at you.

So all in all it's more fun playing with your friends than playing singleplayer!

Cons: 

Eventually lag will sneak up and freeze the game.

16,39327522,english,"One of the most fun physics games I've ever played, and they update the game with new content as well! This game can be fun by yourself to see how you can screw things up, but the true potential of the game is unlocked when you play with friends or play in a LAN party.

Fun Features / What they did right:
- Maps are not railroads. Sections can be skipped, easter eggs exist in high places and hidden places. You can railroad the puzzle if you want but there's other ways to do it.
- Physics responds very well. I wouldn't say ""realistically"" but definitely well beyond acceptable.
- Multiple activities; Row a boat, drive a boat, go white water rafting, ziplining, and throwing your friends off a cliff in a dumpster!

Suggestions / What could be better:
- Checkpoints... You can only get a checkpoint moving forward and can't go back to different sections. When you skip a whole map (Aztec) and get the checkpoint, you and your friends are pretty much forced to go forward and can't reload an earlier checkpoint to go back once you realized you skipped it.
- Better LAN support. Playing P2P (Friends) or Online doesn't give an option to play on LAN. Supposedly, the game detects you're all on a LAN and runs a LAN game but this doesn't work.

32,39145165,english,"I have played other games that use sloppy controls as a main gameplay point, and some of them I have enjoyed for the most part, such as Octodad or Goat Simulator. When it comes to Human: Fall Flat, I found the usage to become more annoying than fun, and the longer I played the game, the more I wished that I was reaching an end point.

I am actually going to start out with some details for why I liked the above games. Octodad has a great personality to it, with the general plot and interactions just being so funny and also cute with the family dynamic. A lot of the actions you do, along with the art style and character interactions, make it feel like you are watching some silly hit-yourself-in-the-head cartoon characters. In terms of gameplay, I do not think that I found much of Octodad to be difficult, as the majority of the work is usually done in mini-game formats. Because of the storyline and having actual level progression and funny characters, Octodad has an odd sense of life to it.

Then Goat Simulator is definitely more difficult than Octodad, but is also not quite the same thing. Goat Simulator is nothing but bizarre events to the power of infinity, and you can move with normal walking and do things like walljumping. Further, you unlock abilities that make navigation easier like flying around a map to continue the stupid things you are doing, which means that Goat Simulator focuses more on its weirdness and less on the actual difficulty of the controls. There are still some places in that game, including one of the DLC's, that bring in focus on the bad controls and can get annoying. But for the most part, I was able to accomplish a lot of things in Goat Simulator and had fun with the crazy things you do.

Now, we get to Human: Fall Flat. This game started off by showing a tongue-in-cheek narrator and letting you know that you could walk somewhat normally, but also had to stick to objects with your Play-Doh-like character. As it turns out, the narrator disappears pretty quickly, and you remain in a lifeless set of levels where you mainly do platforming/parkour that is extremely hindered by the intended sloppy control system.

Right away, Human: Fall Flat is different from the other examples I mentioned, because it does not have anything other than the gameplay. Octodad has a story, nice level set-ups, lots of great humor, and so on. Goat Simulator has out-of-this-world environments, hilarious events to encounter, numerous add-ons for the goat's crazy powers, and so on. But then Human: Fall Flat has a handful of somewhat generic locations and its gameplay, without anything else. Some level examples are a castle, miniature factory, and a power plant, but there are no other characters or any more narrator dialogue. The levels remain lifeless. Basic. Empty. Bland.

I imagine that life can only be added to the game by playing with other people. But even then, after seeing how the game works, I have no desire to play it again. The actual usage of the control system is worse than in the previously-mentioned examples.

In this game, the first 3 levels are really short and show some simplicity for getting used to movement, pressing buttons, and moving objects. The 4th level is a bit longer but still mainly contains things like pushing objects, though it adds in the capability to swing on a rope. But then in the 5th level, Demolition, the game suddenly shifts. The levels grow largely in scope and take longer than the previous ones, but they are also [i]a lot more annoying[/i].

The game starts adding in a lot of parkour-like features, and you start to focus more on platforming and failures with anything that involves jumping or fast motions. The game also starts to add a lot more obstacles like miniature ""puzzles"" in your way.

But the fact of the matter is that almost none of the ""puzzles"" are really puzzles. The majority of them are pretty obvious to figure out and only take so long because you will likely respawn a few times while jumping somewhere, or you keep dropping objects and have to go back to get them. In the Power Plant towards the end of the game, it was taking me several minutes just to move batteries around and connect wires because the batteries would keep clipping the ground, or my character would stop moving and I would have to repeatedly change the position of the character's hands. By this point in the game, I had already been extremely frustrated by similar things in earlier levels, so I was really hating things here.

That is also not to mention that later levels add in vehicles which waste so much time, as you cannot use multiple hands at the same time properly. Your character will incorrectly move multiple wheels or levers if you are trying to do so. Thus, you often have to raise acceleration, then turn, then lower acceleration or reverse, then turn, and so on. It gets so annoying that vehicles probably should not have even been here. I mentioned earlier that Goat Simulator has some bad places and vehicle usage is one of them. One of the DLC's for Goat Simulator has a spaceship section and it is loathed by almost everyone who plays it, as it is considered to have one of the most idiotic controls ever, to a point where it has no fun value. This is how I felt about the vehicles in Human: Fall Flat, as well.

A lot of the bad controls and issues like the above also come from the fact that raising or lowering your character's hands [i]will also raise or lower the camera[/i]. Who thought this was a good idea, by any means?

Human: Fall Flat just does not have much personality to itself, and harps on platforming and the intended control system way more than other similar games that I have played, making the experience more frustrating than funny.",1515315089,1515829158,False,2,1,0.447118848562240601,0,True,False,False,76561198104392527,578,261,546,0,546,1515314873

This game is pretty darn entertaining, the controls and avatar movement are extremely satisfying and hilarious, this along with the great design of each level and the various puzzles make for an extremely fun and enjoyable experience. 
I personally played the game along with one other friend, and I would say that the puzzles were perfect for 2 people. I can see enjoying the game with up to 4 players, but it may start to get a bit crazy. 

Graphics/performance 
The game isn’t very graphically intensive, and that’s part of the charm, this game should run will on most systems. 

Value
The regular price of £12 may now seem a bit steep, however when purchased on the typical £5 on a sale it’s definitely worth a purchase. I completed the game in just over 5 hours, all in all a very satisfying puzzle game with a very fun aesthetic.

Pros:

- Multiplayer, because most games are better with multiplayer.
- Detailed maps all filled with unique puzzles.
- Hours and hours of things to do. More things to do with friends.
- Achivements are challenging, try some if you are bored.
- Character Cuztomization, many different skins to choose from, and you can create your own!

Cons:

- Only 9 Levels, at this time of the review (The first 3 don't last that long too). 
- Most puzzles are easy, besides some of Aztec's levels, they were hard.

You know what I'd like? and maybe a few other people would like? A city map. Maybe not to do puzzles on, but to explore, and possibly Roleplay, but i'm not a fan of that. You may also say this review was biased, which I can also agree with, sorry.

I'd recommend playing this with friends more than by yourself, as having someone else in the game with you, brings the style of game to another level!  The animations have a whimsical element to them that I feel really only stands-out when you’re in the game seeing other players move around and when you are wrestling each other off the cliff!

We didn't find the puzzles particularly difficult to solve and sometimes entire puzzles could be circumvented (if you just want to beat the game or are trying to do speed runs.) 

What made the puzzles time consuming was mostly running around for the mechanics (because everything is giant) and working with some quirky stuff[spoiler], like the gear shifter and steering wheel in the truck, as an example[/spoiler]. There were some unrefined physics moments as well, but nothing that broke the game entirely. 

For me, it wasn't about the puzzles needing to be difficult or the game needing to be 100% polished; it was about spending time with my friend in a multiplayer game that didn't get the adrenaline pumping and nerves rattled. It was chill, funny, and allowed us to work together to complete a common goal without trolls ruining the experience and becoming high-strung. 

I recommend purchasing it when it's on sale, as I feel the price is a little high if you intend on only playing the multiplayer (which is in Alpha.) I had bought it during the holiday event and felt the $8CAD to be a decent price point for the entertainment that was had.

[i]However[/i], once an official workshop has been released, there is bound to be hundreds of hours of gameplay from player-made content.

Human fall Flat does have Split Screen which works and looks and realy good. The only problem with this game is the terrible connectivity issues while trying to play online with friends. My friends and I got this game over Winter break and we had so much fun playing it. Then when we got past the medeival level the game went fucking insane. We couldn't connect to each others lobbies or even load into levels. So we stopped playing the game for the time being hoping it will get better.

13,39069901,english,"I can definately recommend this game to anyone who wants a bit of fun. Whether it is a nice but short puzzle game  all by yourself and your loneliness, or a a funky and extremely fun game with a friend or two, or maybe even 5. The amount of people you play this game with really does not matter.

I payed 7,5€ for this game during the Steam Winter Sale and that is a fair price for the game. Considering the amount of time and fun I had while playing this alone and with friends(hoping for a lot more hours when the workshop comes, if it comes).

There is one HUGE thing I have to mention though: Even though that the developers said that they did create all maps that are currently playable by hand(and they are very well made, no doubt at all), my friends and I, and the rest of the 1000+ reviews have a very good point->
Namely, that this game would benefit INCREDIBLY much from a steam workshop, where people could create custom levels for everybody to play.

I for myself have done some mapping far back when I played Counter Strike: Source and I had a blast playing them with my friends and trying new things out. A game with these clunky, yet fun movements and a co-op mode is so much fun and it would be so much more with a workshop to work with, even with a few bricks, items or small third party tools.

A steam workshop with maps, outfits etc. would increase this games popularity by a HUGE margin.

EDIT:
I just read that the developer is looking into creating a new workshop for the game after the holiday break which has ended now, so we'll hopefully get our desired workshop with a possibility to create custom maps in the near future. Thank you for hearing us out!

Thank you for reading.

In which you can host a free server easily up to eight people and have so much fun and blast of laughter at times. This puzzle game has almost no negatives but I does have one and that is not having a ton of maps but hopefully the creator will live to his promises and start the workshop for the game.

Gets boring kinda quick. I may try some more levels. We'll see what happens. Controls are unique, so it's refreshing in that way. Worth about $5 Imo.

The level design is fun, not so much challenging but me and my friends found ourselves on the same bit for hours just messing around; that's one the good things about this game - the replay ability. I've played the same level three times but still found myself in new perdicaments each time. But, keep in mind, i'm talking about the multiplayer here, not the singleplayer. You would get a fraction of the enjoyment and playtime as you would with multiplayer, playing the game singleplayer. Messing around with friends is what truley makes this game fun, probably the main reason everyone plays it. 

I got the game for half price(£6), which is one of the best £6 i've spent and I can say that price is very generous, but I'm not sure this game is worth £12. Fair enough it the game has a lot of replayabilty, I have 8.4 hours and I'm still not done, but the core game(i'f you just play it normally) is very short. A lot of people have mentioned it their reviews, the core game maybe has like 2 hours of gameplay. If you were to get this game, I would make sure to get it while it's on sale. 

The customisation is decent, not a lot of variation but the workshop opens up the door for that. There is a wide variety of skins of there and the fact you can import pictures leads up to some funny moments.

Played it singleplayer and had so much fun.
Would be easier to play multiplayer as having more hands makes fewer work, especially when it comes to using vehicles and such.

Also figured out how to scale a wall by grabbing with one hand and swinging Bob so that he can grab higher with his other hand in the last map. It takes a while, but it is useful.

Achievement hunting means more replay ability as you have to do things differently.

+Very  polished and easy to play. The graphics are becoming more and more charming for me.
+It holds your hand until you get your bearings. They make the learning curve easy.
+The levels are interesting little stand-alone sandboxes that even have little secrets in store to reward those that want to stray from the main path.
+It's quite addicting because the puzzles are just challenging enough. No rage yet from me.
+There is a lot of content already, but more stuff is being added. Workshop support is being added, as well as all kinds of new skins.

No, I won't be refunding this game. Never in my life.
It is way too fun for that. The graphics are awesome, and so is optimization.
It has some humour in it, very unique characteristics, and lots of details in each level / map, that were still made while the developer probably knew only a few people would see.
Each level is challenging, but not too much, and very fun.
The first levels are simply perfect, the introduction to the mechanics are on point.

There is also the free (yes, no lootboxes or paid skins!) character customization, and each character can be shared on the Workshop.

81,38853712,english,"If you enjoy games with goofy controls and the slapstick comedy of physics based ragdoll people trying to solve puzzles then you'll love Human Fall Flat. 
  
On the surface it looks like a pretty stupid game. You're messing around with your friends, throwing each other off of cliffs, sometimes solving a puzzle. What isn't immediately obvious is how much there is to explore and do in each of the levels (ending with Aztec as of Dec. 30 2017). There were so many moments playing this game where I yelled ""THAT ACTUALLY WORKED???""  Some of the puzzle solutions make perfect sense but aren't possible without some kind of scripting in a more normally controlled game. I'm going to avoid spoiling them, but if you're a creative thinker you'll have a great time trying to break puzzles and explore placed you're not supposed to go (except you'll almost always find that you were, indeed, expected to make it there). It's a game that's packed full of secret little tasks that give you acheivements. 
  
The multiplayer as it currently stands is pretty good. People that I hosted said they experienced pretty bad latency when they tried to jump, but otherwise things seemed to work flawlessly. Even when our characters were hopelessly entangled we were able to both see ourselves hanging onto the correct body parts. On top of working surprisingly well it's just hilariously fun. 
  
If you're only interested in the single player I think you'll still find satisfaction in the game. The puzzles are all possible alone and interesting enough that you don't need other people goofing around to make them interesting. The game also has a fairly easy and fun speedrun if you're into that.",1514628298,1514628298,True,1,0,0.528795838356018066,0,True,False,False,76561198035343692,671,48,4745,0,1154,1525203667

    [*]Fun to play ALONE & WITH OTHERS

This game is truly something special. The climbing physics and mechanics keep you hooked playing alone, and promote exploration and ways for the player to figure out how to complete a puzzle faster. Playing online or with friends allows you to explore the puzzles in new and unique ways.


    [*]Both control schemes (KB+M & Controller) work well

Both control schemes make you FEEL like you're putting work into lifting/climbing stuff. It's an abstract kind of feel, but once you get used to it, it feels VERY rewarding.


    [*]Works on a wide variety of hardware and OSes

Compatible with Linux (SteamOS), Windows, and Mac. Rock solid 60FPS on both my gaming-oriented desktop, and my half-baked potato laptop. Runs at 144FPS solid at 1920x1080 settings maxed out on the desktop (i5-6600k + R9 290), Runs at 60FPS solid at 800x600 settings minimized  on the laptop (i5-2550m + Intel HD 3000). The fact that I'm able to get 60FPS on a laptop without any dedicated graphics whatsoever is a true testament to how well optimized this game is for the lower end PC's too.

I have seen so many good ideas fall into limbo because the developers either bit off more than they could chew, made enough money and just gave up on the game, or are incompetent. I can say with confidence that these developers are not like that. With the constant updates since release, I'm sure this game will stay good. 

On to the game. It was a hard idea to work with, because it would have to nail the line between too easy and over frustratingly hard. I think it did it better than any other game of this type. I have put in quite a few hours in this game, and replayed the story with different people, and I can say that it is still yet to be boring. The possibilities are endless, and you can mess around for hours without completing any part of the puzzle and still have fun. Since there is no story and it is sorta open world, you can get your own experience out of it depending on what you put in. Sure, you could break the game and skip the puzzles, but you don't get any fun out of it. That is why this game is a masterpiece.

The physics are very fun to play around with, even more so with friends. I only have a few complaints, the first of which being the levels. The graphics for everything is very simple style, very aethetically pleasing and easy for you computer to run, but the layout is mildly questionable at times. Occasionally, it is unclear as to where you are supposed to be headed, but I believe that is all part of the fun. My other complaint is that the levels are designed with the intention of it being solved with only one player, so when another is added, some of the puzzles can be cheated and altogether skipped with a bit of team work, but again, all in good fun.

1. Too much wobble. While it can make for some hillarious moments, and adds a bit of challenge, the excessive wobbling can be frustrating for some of the puzzles and the resulting camera shifting around makes me nauseous. I have chronic headaches which sometimes have visual triggers and things like the excessive wobbling can make them worse.

2. Sometimes in co-op people will grab onto you and throw you off stuff or prevent you from moving, this can sometimes be pretty funny, though occasionally some players abuse this feature and harrass others.

Suggestions:
1. Please give us a way to select the degree of wobble to our liking. 
2. An option to make it so bob cannot be grabbed by other players. I suggest this just be an ability and not a toggle because more commonly other players will be helpful and assist you up ledges or prevent you from falling off something. So, just some sort of ""let go"" type of button for those times when other players are not being helpful.
3. Run or sprint, because fun.
4. Better free climbing options. I really like open exploration of the maps in addition to the puzzle solving. Right now there is a sort of swing side to side option to slowly scale vertical surfaces which seems to limit how much higher you can reach up each time. I'd like to see that limit removed or some other option put into place.
5. Improved item handling. See player wobble.  
6. Day and night cycles.
7. More maps and more complex puzzles.

The game controls very well and no bugs were present thankfully. Designing your character is a lot of fun and with the new 8 player multiplayer, things should be really picking up!

So Sunday afternoon at around 3:15pm my Brother messages me saying ""Look at a game called Human: Fall Flat""
Reading the random title I decided to check it out as sometimes he does find good games.
As soon as I saw the tag ""Physics Based"" I was sold (If ya'll know any other good co-op physics based games let me know in the comments) because I knew that they usually result in endless lols and good times had by all.

So I think f*ck it and buy the game for £12 and load up the gameplay trailer. Within I'd say 5 seconds of watching I had started laughing and I mean proper belly laughing. Eager to play I installed the game and we made a lobby. After 20 minutes of headbutting a train my brother finally joined me and we set out on the journey with high hopes.

8 hours, 2 headaches caused by laughing, 2 500mg of paracetamol and 7 spliffs later we both logged off with new found hope for the gaming industry and various short term ailments caused by extreme laughing and snorting (with me actually shedding a tear later on in the game)

There are different levels (not a lot, but plenty to keep you busy, for now) with varying levels of difficulty and it seems there is often more than one way to solve the puzzles, you'll find some things easy and other things a good challenge.

Does have a few glitches with skin editing... And occasional FPS spike (which I assume eventually will get some optimization)... And dodgy multiplayer if your too far away from the host, but overall it runs well, haven't actually experienced a crash of any form yet.
Biggest complaint, even though some of the levels are huge, there's not a lot of levels to select from. Fingers crossed for workshop level's later on. :3

I ended up doing a full 100% completionist run, enjoying it every step of the way.

Much of the entertainment and satisfaction comes from the learning curve. When we started we were only able to walk around and jump. By the time we were done we were able to scale vertical walls, cheese every level and earn every achievement.

The soundtrack is excellent too. Sometimes absent, sometimes atmospheric and sometimes swelling in relation to what’s happening in game. Epic.

64,37994342,english,"Once you get the hang of ""Human: Fall Flat"" it's Ok.  That said, there were quite a few things that completely infuriated me about this game and I would be highly neglectful if I didn’t include them in this review.

First is the control, or rather oddity that is considered control.  Your character is basically a complete rag doll that’s somewhat controlled from the mid-section.  That meaning, it seemed as if the legs were there just to flop around, without actually holding you up.  This would become somewhat frustrating in areas where you really needed to know where your footing was.  With your legs flailing around during every jump it was sometimes extremely difficult to make a precision maneuver, and in a game where precision is sometimes the only way to move on, it can become quite rage-inducing.

Secondly, it seemed like many maps allowed you to very easily skip the majority of the map to move onto the next area.  As the game progressed it seemed like the linear design of the maps failed heavily.  An example, when I reached the “boat” level I pretty much didn’t have to do anything.  I made my way over to the dry river, walked up to the dam at the top, “bounced” across the rail that leads to the top of the waterwheel, and opened the exit door.  From there I just had to jump off the diving board and I was done that level.  I knew I missed a LOT of content there, but unlike a good linear puzzle there was really nothing forcing me to solve the tests that were laid out in front of me.  This continued, to some extent, in the battery area.  When you were supposed to seek a way to get the battery down from the statue, I just ran back through the shortcut to the start and grabbed the very first battery.  I skipped a whole section of puzzles and went straight to the boilers.  The very last map was even worse.  After wedging open the door I figured out I could “jam” the elevator using the sticks I was given at the start and then simply use the cube to climb up to the top of the elevator area.  From there I went right to the temple and jumped in.  I must have skipped 80-90% of that final level... Even though there was a lot of imagination used, this is a sign of poor map design.  A player shouldn’t be able to skip over entire sections of a level using the tools you’ve given them.

My final gripe, which will sound funny considering my last paragraph, is the lack of content in this game.  Each map seemed to introduce new things however that specific map was the only place those new things were used.  For example, the forklift.  You basically used it for a whole 30 seconds and that’s the last time it’s used.  The haul truck, you do one load of coal and that’s it.  Likewise for the boats, you use them for one quick thing and you never see them again.  It almost seems like a waste of perfectly good coding.  Why not add more levels with those same objects, although have the player use them in a different way?  Like maybe having to use the boat to transport something.  Or have the player use the forklift to position a pallet to climb to something?  I mean, there are many ways you could use these vehicles to solve different puzzles.  It was really sad to see such limited use of them.  The wiring and batteries was yet another missed opportunity.  Why not make an actual wiring puzzle?  Like, instead of just hooking 2 wires up between a battery/generator you have the player have to actually use multiple wires to build a circuit.  Hook up actuators to levers and a power source, etc.  There are so many simple circuit diagrams online it would be really easy to incorporate one into your game as a puzzle.  According to Steam I completed this game in under 4 hours, and that was without doing anything I would classify as cheating.  To me, that seems overpriced.

Some people might argue with me on this next topic, that being replayability.  While I can see that some people might find a lot of replay value in this game, for me personally it’s not there.  I really have no desire to go back and see what content I might have missed, or how I could have completed puzzles differently.  After the first couple of maps the novelty of the game wore off for me and it became a push to reach the end.  I didn’t really find that “spark” that would draw me back to playing through the game again.  Yes, there were some interesting aspects to the game, but nothing I’d want to relive.  The only real replay value in this game would be for those who are looking to join the speed running competition.  Personally, I couldn’t be bothered with that nonsense considering the only talent involved in speed-running is how quickly you can use exploits and glitches.  That's not skill.  It's akin to using a performance enhancing drug during the olympics.

At any rate, I don’t think I can recommend this game.  As a puzzle game, which is what this seems to be trying to be, I really didn’t find it that difficult.  The puzzles were extremely easy to solve, with the only frustration being when you couldn’t get your avatar to do what you were trying to get it to do.  That would fall more into the category of “fighting with bad controls” than it would be puzzle solving.  The game is interesting, no doubt about that, but it’s not something I’d discuss with friends around the water cooler.  Thus I can’t recommend it to you either.

One thing to note, I haven’t tried their alpha version of multiplayer.  This might be where this game shines.  The frustration at trying to control your avatar could very easily turn to all kinds of humor when playing and joking around with friends.  My review is solely based on the single-player experience.",1512193202,1512324164,False,18,2,0.390592008829116821,0,True,False,False,76561198078187111,464,101,275,0,275,1512190534

There are so many things that make this game a masterpiece, but so I don't spend the next 10 years gushing over this jewel I'll focus on the most important and incredible portion of the game: 

The Story.

I can't remember the last time a story in a videogame has moved me like Human: Fall Flat. 
I was unsure when I first dove in, but even by the end of the first act I was more than hooked.
By the end of the game, I was in tears. 
I don't want to spoil any important details, but trust me when I say that the characters and world of HFF will immerse you totally. The character's interactions with eachother are second to none, it's like they took a recording of people from real-life and used it. Mad props to the voice actors, their obvious dedication to this game shines in the dialogue.
If you take anything from this review, let it be that the story of this gem will move like never before.

The only thing I could possibly say is a bit off about this game is the gameplay. 
It's clear that they focused more on the art and storyrather than the engine, which is perfectly fine. However, playing with the physics in the world was just boring. It feels like the whole ""physics puzzle"" gimmick was thrown in more as a last-minute addition rather than a core component. 

TL;DR
Fantastic story, incredible voice acting and characters, boring gameplay. A must-buy for lovers of in-depth story.

For me this causes near-instant motion sickness and I had to return the game as it is unplayable for me without a steady camera.

Devs if you read this, if you make it so you can disable the camera bob I will repurchase the game at a later date. 

edit: update 12/1/17 the last patch added a camera smoothness slider in the options, however this does not disable camera bobbing so they might as well have not wasted their time with the change.

22,37982933,english,"A fantastic,fun,silly physics based puzzle game with online and couch co-op built in.

I was honestly expecting the controls to be not all great, usually in games that use an actual physics engine for moving characters and not animations tends to not have the best controls however in Human Fall Flat they feel great, they walk a fine line of being responsive enough and kinda fiddly for comedic effect without ever frustraiting you or making it feel like its the game fault if you fail. The few levels it offers will take about 4 to 6h to complete, depending on how much exploration you do.
What i love most about it is the fact that every puzzle has multiple solutions, a fair amount of which  i don't think even the devs noticed and it's all thanks to the great,fun physics engine it has. Levels also offer a lot of exploration, tons of secrets and easter eggs can be found which adds a good replay reason to try and find all the hiden things in a level. Achievements are also well done, trying to do some of em' was really fun with a partner, such as trying to perfectly stack 4 boxes or trying to balance ourselves on a moving giant bolder as its roling down.

Only con of the game is well its lenght, in about 4 to 6h you'll be done as it doesn't have  too many levels , still it's not expensive and the few hours of content are very good quality. I hope the devs add steam workshop support one day with a level edditor, that would extend the game's life by ten fold.

The game play is extremely difficult at times and the physics of the game can make some of the puzzles difficult, but any potential frustration usually dissolves into gut busting laughter, and the game offers multiple ways a task may be accomplished. My only complaint about the game is that there isn't more of it as between you and a couple friends the game can be completed within a couple hours. However, the replayability of the game has great potential and how much fun it is to play with friends makes replaying the game a pleasure. My only wish? More content in future DLC's.

As you learn more, you discover new ways to cause mischief. With a group of friends doing just the same, well, things get out of control.

For example; we had a vehicle, and one of us got the engine started, but fell off right after. So in an attempt to stop it, one of us stood in front of it only to have the vehicle pass right over without a hitch. Another ran after it and attempted to grab it and caught the tire, only to be spun uncontrollably as we watched both our friend and the vehicle tumble off the ledge.

- Controlling your character feels amazing, it's simple, but works so well.
- There is a decent character editor.
- The multiplayer experience is fantastic; just hop into a game and help solve puzzles with others.
- The game is filled with amazing set pieces; you can pretty much drive or tamper with whatever machine you see (my favorite being the cargo ship on the water level :D).
- There is more than one way to solve each puzzle, making for a really satisfying experience when you solve something your own way.

This game exceeds all expectations except the level count there being about 8 or so. Other than this and the oppotunity for more actions, mechanics or some excellent VR gameplay, Human:  Fall Flat is perhaps in the 1 percent of indie games that are more than a tech demo! Moreso the game is built on simple gameplay with thousands of possabilities. The replayability is also there... Illd love to try new things with different people.

Do you enjoy laughing?
Do you enjoy trolling your friends?
Do you like to have fun?

LOOK NO FURTHER!

Human: Fall Flat is brilliatn! 

Does it have it's flaws? Absolutely! However, they are so minor that  the fun you will be having just from playing this will be so worth it. 

There are only 2 things that I would say are wrong with it.

1! Very short game.  One friend and I can complete the whole game in 10 minutes. (Speed runs!) 
    -Side Note: If this is intended? AWeSOME! If not? I think we broke your game.

2. NO LEVEL CREATOR! Hell! I think this game would shine SO HARD! If there was a steam workshop where people could create levels and you could check out other peoples hard work. 

Now for a list of THE GREATEST THINGS EVER!

1. Physics Based Puzzles
2. You can pick your friends up and throw them off the puzzles
3. Creative puzzles 
4. Beautiful art style 
5. You can pick friends up and troll them
6. Co-op puzzles
7. Troll your friends
8. Laugh like crazy because even though you are being a douche, it's funny! IT'S FUN! 
9. Lasting memories of good times in a great game. Well worth the CAD $8.49.

Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ingredients
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
3/4 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon fine salt

Directions
1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)

2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.

3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.

4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.

5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.

For a Rocky Road Bar:
1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.",1511463365,1511463365,True,0,0,0.407673835754394531,0,True,False,False,76561198296119050,25,16,973,0,323,1575154492

82,36866144,english,"Human: Fall Flat invents an entirely new mechanic for interacting with a virtual world - all through attaching the left hand to your left mouse button, and the right hand to the right button. This simple interaction is thoroughly enjoyable to learn, while being suprisingly difficult it's still satisfying. The name of the game here is interaction and HFF does it incredibly well. Throw this in with the functional physics system and suddenly picking up a brick and throwing it over your character's shoulder becomes an immensely entertaining activity, for something so simple. 

The polygon art style suits the game well, and probably helps to keep it running so smoothly. The environments presented in the game are where the aesthetics really come into their own. The huge castle/fortress or aztec jungle etc, look great with the game's lighting, colours and shading. 

You have to play this game with friends. That's where it really shines. Hauling each other around, watching each other fuck up and fall off a cliff - hell, even watching them just try to plug a wire into a connector is so entertaining. 

The puzzles the game presents are super fun to work out. I'm usually the type who would rather google the solution than work it out for myself - but in HFF I wanted the satisfaction of figuring it out. It was just that fun. There's a somewhat steep learning curve in the mechanics, but nothing you can't eventually figure out - we even brute-forced our way through a few puzzles/doors without realising. 

Replayability: The second or third time round a few of the maps was still enjoyable. Again, mainly due to watching friends try to work out puzzles while I already knew how to do them. Still fun. The game also rewards you for treading off the main path. So the second time around, you look at every little nook and crany in the environment and start to think: ""I wonder what's in/up/down there"". And when you do get there - there's actually some content waiting for you. 

Negatives: the game ends. There's only so many maps, and so many times you can play the same puzzles. There's no real arcade mode to speak of, or any challenges aside from the steam achievements included. I would have a lot more hours on this game if there was just more levels or maps or game modes. 

Overall: The best physics game I've ever played - and one of the best party games I've ever played.",1511395676,1511395676,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197997137332,106,2,1307,189,877,1601519144

2,36290232,english,"Human: Fall Flat is a silly physics-based game where you have to complete numerous puzzles in order to move on throughout the levels. There are multiple different kinds of puzzles which keeps your brain ticking constantly. It supplies a singleplayer and multiplayer mode. You can either have a friends-only multiplayer match, multiplayer match with strangers or Split Screen with a friend (or as I like to call it, couch mode).

The graphics are pretty and they are all isometric which makes me love this game. Any game that includes isometric shapes in the graphic files will make me love the design. The best thing is that it is all simply designed and not too much effort, unlike most games, are put into the graphics. This is reasonable because the game is supposed to be funny and silly and having complex graphics will take that away. The animations and transitions are really well made. If you die (i.e Fall in lava or into the void) it simply changes to make it seem like you're falling from the sky and you land on the ground. The animations for the character is hysterical because if something hits you on the head, the top part of your character swings back but you can still carry on walking.

The multiplayer is a good idea indeed but unfortunately, you're going to run into these trolls who like to ruin your day. They grab hold of you and stop you from doing stuff by killing you. It can be very annoying when they only focus on one person. 

Overall, Human Fall Flat is worth every penny or cent or whatever for the singleplayer but for the multiplayer, I would recommend another game similiar called Gang Beasts. Thank you for reading.

28,36237220,english,"This game is really fun, it made me laugh, and really made me interested to find interesting ways to get around the 9 levels currently in the game. You can tell that they really care about making interesting levels, as they all have various achievements and unique themes, like a factory/construction site, a power plant, and Aztec ruins. They are all really nice to look at, the Aztec level in particular having some really attractive architecture. Each level feels different, and the controls are very basic, but offer a lot of variation and strategies you can do. This game is even better with a mate, and you can also dress up the character to wear hazmat suits, police uniforms, Skiing gear.

There is one major problem with this game though: It can be extremely frustrating.

The controls, whilst offering a lot of the humour and value in the gameplay, also add in a lot of irritating quirks and confusing moments. For example, sometimes I will try to jump off of a ledge to grab another, but instead, the model just flops off the edge, and it seems to be because it can be quite difficult to judge when his feet are on the tip of the edge, but for the most part it won't stop you progressing. Another is with some levels, like Water, really showing how rowing a boat wasn't really a good use of the controls. I eventually got into some sort of system with rowing, but I never managed to get a grasp of the raft controls, as it seemed to just keep slapping into the beach or just not moving at all.

Levels are also very large, which on one hand is very enjoyable because you can't breeze through this game in 10 minutes unless you're very good at the puzzling and platforming, are sometimes unclear in their direction, and what feels like the right way to go, is in fact a huge skip past most of the level's content, so when you reach the end of the level, you may feel confused as to what the other things in the level are for. Aztec had this problem, where one box puzzle can skip almost 90% of the level's content. 

Overall, this game gets a solid 8/10, I had a lot of fun with it, and I can't remember if it has workshop support or not, but if it doesn't, it would hugely benefit from it.",1509700665,1509700665,True,0,0,0.492738574743270874,0,True,False,False,76561198126231761,279,102,484,0,381.0,1575249846

Customization, the game has plenty of ways to customize your character. 

Great physics, ya' can bend shit with a pipe and fling yourself at a wall and mildly damage it. 

Mutiple ways to solve puzzles and beat levels, I like games that don't say ""u can do dis & do it 1 way only"".

Great level design, creative and fun.

Challenging levels, who dosen't like a good challenge? Weak people, that's who.

71,35026943,english,"Would you like to roam through varied floating landscapes solving physics puzzles as a pudgy man with the body consistency of a gummy-bear? How about with a friend? If you answered ""YES"" then Human Fall Flat may be a game for you!

This game manages to be both fun and frustrating as you attempt to control your floppy man through a good number of themed levels (castle, construction yard, docks, ancient temple, etc). To progress through these locations you need to solve a lot of physics puzzles. Some are easy, some look easy but aren't. Some look hard. Some are just nonsense. But the game is oddly forgiving in some ways, especially when playing co-op, and while there may be a ""correct"" solution to most of the puzzles it won't stop you from getting up to serious high jinx  and abusing the physics system to ""solve"" them in a more...lets say ""creative"" way.

You primarily control you little man (who can be completely color customized and outfitted with funny clothes) by moving around and grabbing things with each left and right trigger being the grip of your left and right hand, respectively. Raising your arms up and down allow you to lift and pull yourself, your partner and other objects. Results vary from getting the object to exactly where you want to completely borking it all up in the most hilarious way. Add more complex interactions like trying to sync the oars on a rowboat or anything involving a combination of jumping and grabbing allows for a good challenge. The controls and frame-rate are smooth but sometime the camera is a little funky as it tries to deal with intervening objects as you flail your little man around. 

I won't go further into the types of things you can do in Human Fall Flat as a lot of the fun is finding those interactions for yourself. Safe to say that there are a LOT of different ways of interacting with the world and objects that can be used. Or misused. Or be broken. (Also water can sometimes be a real pain in the butt - grrrr). Regardless even the screenshots I used here (from the developers website) almost show to much.

There is a checkpoint system where if you fall off the world it resets you to the start of the puzzle that works most of the time, it can be a little frustrating in the longer stretches when you take a tumble near the end. In co-op it is a little more forgiving as long as one person reaches the checkpoint the other can use it as well. The method of reaching the check point as you fall is clever too as you just keep falling back to the start from where you fell off without interruption as if the world is one big wrap around.

I really like minimalist art style of the both the world design and the color pallet used. It is clear and easy to read as well as nice looking. The design of the world is both strange and humorous with a number of little gag bits added for fun. 

I really enjoyed my time with Human Fall Flat and the designers (No Breaks Games) have already released additional content since the game came out and hopefully will release more puzzle locations and features (as of this writing online co-op is coming soon) in the future. For $15 (or less, it goes on sale quite often) you get a good chunk of really fun puzzle solving game play.

Note : I only played Human Fall Flat in split-screen co-op mode so I don't know how any of it works as a single player experience, some of the puzzles we barely solved with the two of us, I have no idea how they would be solved solo.

84,31890138,english,"I recently just got this game to play with my 5 year old son for his birthday. We love split screen and local coop games so I wanted to leave a review here for anybody who was on the fence about this game!  We finally beat the game recently together! 


Gameplay: 9
- From the start it was extremely easy to drop in 2 players for some local coop. This game is filled with various physics based puzzles where you are required to interact with the environment in logical ways to find a way to the end. There seems to be multiple ways to complete the levels which leads me to believe ther are tons of secrets to find! We also LOVED the customizable characters which were not in the game from the start so I hear. The game is great for local coop because when you get too far ahead it will teleport the other player to your location which was super helpful for progressing through the game with a toddler.

Controls: 10
- Charlie is only 5 so he is not completely capable of handling a mouse and keyboard setup yet but is vey skilled with an Xbox One controller. This game was perfectly suited for the controller and has very intuitive controls. Charlie had it figured it without the first couple of minutes and the game did a great job of introducing the more complicated mechanics slowly as you progressed.

Story: 9
- The narrator is great in the training videos; I love sarcastic tutorial videos and narrators. It allows for some fun dialogue moments where the narrator has awareness that the game is being played by somebody through the monitor. It gives off a vibe similar to Portal and The Stanley Parable so far! The world is full of mystery and not much was explained at the start which adds to our curiosity of everything around us.

Graphics: 9
- Low polygon artwork is a particular favorite of our family! I feel like this game in any other art style would not be the same and would take away from the world. Low polygon artwork pairs well with the developer's world and gameplay mechanics based around physics.

Overall: 9
- HIGHLY RECCOMEND for anybody looking for a splitscreen experience.  There are very few that are fun and work well lately and this is one that does everything right!

13,33638661,english,"I am on the fence on this one but I have to lean more towards not recommending. 

On one hand it has a simplistic charm and quirkyness that makes you want to see what's around the corner but on the other hand there are a mountain of issues plaguing the game.

The camera alone is enough to make you turn the game off and walk away immediately. Want to climb a ledge? The camera zooms into a face-first POV that then confuses your next set of actions resulting in the cause of many, many deaths. I used a controller for this game and the thumbsticks somehow control the camera and the humans arms at the same time and it is downright rage-inducing.

The controls leave something to be desired as well. The human acts as if he has had one too many beers and stumbles around and doesn't exactly do what you are telling him to do but does that action very closely which leaves room for many errors. This become an uphill battle when you are required to make simple ""platform-esque"" jumps and the human makes a half-hearted attempt and thus puts you back at the beginning of the puzzle. I shouldn't have to redo a portion of the game because the built-in controls are not doing what I want them to do.

I *HIGHLY* do not recommend playing this (if you decide to) in single player and go for local co-op as the tasks get exponentially easier with a second pair of awkward hands.

TL;DR
In the end, this games falls into the developers unique genre of ""funky controls makes for hilarious gameplay!"" but because of those controls & camera alone, it delivers something very far from ""fun"".",1500413322,1500413322,False,4,1,0.551062345504760742,1,True,False,False,76561198067079464,1258,16,308,0,308,1500163903

The game's controls are far enough in the frustration side that for single player would lead to controller throwing would make for good laughs with a partner. While the game can be readily compared to Octodad in terms of concept, the game does have a number of puzzles that require preciseness and timing that Octodad did not require. Add that the camera is an essential part of the controls, and it can make for frustration.

Given all that, the game does a great job of presenting physics-based puzzles with a lot of good visual hints to guide you to the solution. There are not too many repeated puzzle elements, though when there is repetition, it is part of a learning scaffold to help you on the complex puzzles.  Not all the puzzles are straight forward, and some require experimentation -- and that's where the control frustration can set in - but most puzzles are reasonably self-contained in their own areas, so you can quickly come to the right solution. Checkpoints are frequent enough to not be a game-stopper.

35,33240391,english,"TL;DR Great puzzle game, Tomb Raider 1-like controls, very satisfying puzzle-solving, 50/50 level designs, a bit short in terms of length and levels available. Buy it when it goes on sale, though its SRP isn't half-bad if you're planning on playing it with a friend.

=============================

Finished it in ~6 hours on my own (without exploiting the wall-climbing mechanic), not because it's easy, but because I tend to just focus on a game when I have free time.



Human: Fall Flat is what you'd get if you mashed Gang Beasts's mushy character model (and some of its control mechanics) and Tomb Raider 1's controls scheme, assuming you were born around the time it first came out. It's mostly a puzzle game, but the challenge isn't just in solving the puzzles; it's pulling it off.

One of the main challenges (or draws, if you're not into this kinda thing) of the game is the control mechanics. You grab things with your left and right hands using the LMB/RMB respectively. Add to that the fact that you need to actually ""look"" in the direction you want your hands to lunge towards to and you'll either get annoyed the first few attempts of learning how to work it. While the camera *does* zoom in on your player character when you hold any of the mouse buttons, it doesn't lower your character's opacity, so it's a bit of trying to flail around your flappy ragdoll arms as well (and sometimes they can get stuck on your own body too.)

It gets more interesting when some of the puzzles require you to think beyond the usual ""grab this and drop it here"", since some of them actually have you operating vehicles (which are surprisingly fun to operate even on your lonesome) and catapults (which you actually wind down and trigger manually), as well as breaking walls or windows with objects lying around.

There is no ""one"" way of solving a puzzle or finishing this game. I believe I skipped out on some of the puzzles, not because I used the parkour exploit (yes, you can climb walls if you take the time to learn the mechanics enough), but because some of the puzzles i solved ended up with an object that helped me climb over a wall without having to ""cheat"" the climb. It's great, though some end-level bits were clearly designed to force you to go through certain doors (especially the first few levels).

The main ""fun"" aspect of the game is in solving the puzzles, as well as actually succeeding in pulling off whatever it is you need to do. Nine times out of ten, you're wrestling with the camera and your floppy ragdoll body, and depending on your temperament and willingness to succeed, this may or may not be obnoxious and detrimental to succeeding. Actually being able to grab onto that ledge while jumping off a falling pillar and expecting yourself to fail is immensely satisfying, as the ""physics"" puzzles tend to increase in terms of variety as the levels progress. Again, you can skip some of them, but where's the fun in that?

In its current state, it's hard to recommend it at its standard price point. Unless you're planning on playing with a friend locally (no online as of writing), it might be advisable to get it during a sale (which I did haha). It's technically a ""finished"" game, but it somehow felt a bit lacking. Not sure how to put it, but I feel like it's the lack of levels that's holding this game back, as the controls and feature list is already quite sound. 

It would be great to see more games like this where the player is given freedom of movement to this degree, without making it too easy for them to navigate the whole map. It was a refreshing experience, though I might just be a masochist for games that sacrifice standardized mechanics for new ideas.

Human: Fall Flat is a game developed by No Brakes Games and pbulished by Curve Digital

The game takes physics puzzles to a new place and it is incredibly fun and enjoyable to play but the hardest part of this game is the controls, they are kinda finicky and awkward to play yet not completely annoying such as in Surgeon Simulator

Human: Fall Flat is a fun game to play by yourself or with friends in local multiplayer. Some things could be fixed in later patches and updates but overall it is a fun game to play in short bursts or with friends!

That's not to say that the controls are frustratingly hard or impossible to use in a semi functional way (like Surgeon Simulator), and it doesn't mean that how well you can ""act normal"" using the controls is an important part of the game (like in Octo-dad). Instead it's a fairly easy and entertaining puzzle game that is made a little more challenging because all of your character's limbs fell asleep one day and just never woke up.

1,32179196,english,"Candid Camera. Beadle's About. Trigger Happy TV. What do all of these things have in common? Enterainment based upon someone else's misfortune or their reaction to an annoying situation. You then also have shows like Takeshi's Castle  which are entertaining because of peoples epic fails at doing the most simple of tasks. And just like those shows, HFF is only entertaining when played with someone else. Let me explain.

In itself, the game is more about wrestling with the controls than puzzle solving. That may seem odd but this is really the fact. The puzzles are not hard. They aren't going to test your creative logic or have you pondering for hours with the answers staring you in the face with a cheeky grin. It's about managing to achieve a very simple task with completely inadaquet controls. HFF isn't even the first to do this since the days of Grow Home and Grow Up we've had procedureal animations kicking around and frankly HFF's controls are less tight by comparison and that works against it when it attempts to ask you to do something simple like jumping a gap or walking along a narrow edge. The only thing it does well it grasping and lifting objects. As a result, playing the game by yourself is extremely tedious. But when working with someone else it is extremely funny to see how your buddy is completely failing to perform even the simpliest of tasks. I guess the lesson here is that it is only entertaining when it isn't happening to you.

Given that there are many other games out there with amusing cooperative play it would be only fair to say that HFF is not something I can recommend because unless you have someone else with you the game just isn't entertaining. Furthermore it is very, very short and has absolutely zero replay value. If you want a game like this for solo go play Grow Up or Grow Home. If you want a good party game then try Gangbeasts or A Gummy's Life.",1496591332,1496591435,False,110,8,0.635160148143768311,9,True,False,False,76561197971316390,223,95,1348,0,553,1555614491
2,29595935,english,"I came back to rewrite this review because it turns out this game has great replayability potential. 

Basically, in this game you run around, and you can reach out and grab stuff with both arms. There's some objects you need to pick up and use as levers and such, and there's some machines and platforming and opening doors and such. 

It doesn't sound exciting. But you know when you're drunk, and you can barely walk, and every simple task feels like a challenge? It's kind of like that. 

Not only that, but once you start to get the hang of what this game is, you can start breaking the rules. You can go off the beaten path, use items from the previous puzzles in new and exciting ways in the next one, you can climb to the top of all the things you thought were just there for decoration. 

And the sooner the better. Replaying the game, there's so much I realize I missed the first time through, because I was so busy finding shortcuts. Not only that, but sometimes I just didn't know what I was supposed to do, so I think I must've gone the wrong way. For instance, once I drove a boat into a wall so I could jump over it, I'm just now discovering where I was actually supposed to drive that boat.

The idea of the game is great: drop you in (literally) by yourself into a funky world, and you have to figure out what to do. The problem is actually doing it. Your character has a wobbly, eratic, uncordinated nature - meaning that even once you figure out what to do, actually making your character do it is just as hard (or harder). For instance: grab a cane, hook it onto a peg, and swing on it. Sounds simple. But getting your character to pick it up, swing it, hook it, and then move - MUCH harder. Early in the game, it's not a huge problem, but as the game goes on, it can severely ruin the experience. It's not a challenge about doing something precisely - it's a challenge about getting your character to do basic functions (which just isn't fun). 

If they made the character easier to control, this would be great - or at least easier give you more precise movement as the game progresses - the game would be amazing.

This wouldn't be such a terrible shortcoming if the game didn't require you to use fine motor skills to accomplish tasks at every turn. Feeding a wire into a hole.

29,31751905,english,"Very creative and intuitive controls. You're an average person with no special skills; you can run, jump, grab, push, pull and that's about it but that's what makes the game so creative. Every single action is manual, which means you shouldnt expect Assassins' Creed style climbing (hold this button and push analog stick that way). Your right trigger and analog stick controls your right hand, and your left trigger and analog stick controls your left hand, and you have to really think about every single button you're pressing and the exact timing to perfect climbing up the simplest of things. It's easy to understand but diffiult to master. Whenever you ""fall flat"" (and it will be often), you'll be frustrated, but at yourself and not at the game, as the controls are quick and responsive so you've got noone to blame but yourself. If you've played ""Gang Beasts"", it's basically that but better, with more things to do, and a ""story-mode"". 

Open ended level design means there is not one way to approach a situation, and leaves much to the imagination. You can pull levers, push buttons, drive vehicles, scale walls, leap gaps, row boats, pole vault rivers... the list goes on and on. If you can imagine it, then you can do it, it's all up to you as a player to pull it off with the controls that you are given. There are no ""missions""; you're thrown into a world, and you just explore but you know which general direction you should be moving towards. The way the levels are designed is methodic and step-by-step without holding your hand too tightly. 

The possibilities are even greater in co-op, as you can interact with each other in ways that many games have explored but not perfected. You can climb, push, pull, throw, ride, tackle, save, and kill other players and it's mad fun. Something as simple as rowing a boat can be so exciting, chaotic and hilarious. 

I bought this game (and completed it) when it was still in Early Access. I played through the whole story with my girlfriend so I definitely recommend you play with another person too as that's where it really shines. We absolutely loved the game and she was surprised to hear that, at that point, the developers had not yet finished the game. I haven't played since, and I'm sure it could only have gotten better, and that is a large, large statement, as this game was already very, very good. Will come back when the free update is released, and if something compels me to change my opinion then I will be back to edit my review, but for now, I'm quite set on my decision.

38,31693013,english,"A great physics puzzle game. I definetely reccomend it, but here's a list of Pros and Cons for those of you who are interested.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

- Very well designed levels, it is clear that a lot of effort was put into making sure each one has multiple solutions, and all of them look beautiful.

- Fun, floppy character can be painted and customized, but still has a lot of personality as a blank slate.

- Very replayable, due to the ammount of freedom.

- Beautiful sound track. Even if you don't get this game, I'd suggest you buy it if you have money to spare.

- Very few physics glitches.

- fun even without multiplayer.

[h1] Cons: [/h1]

- After the first few levels, a more ""suggested"" path becomes clear, and sometimes the levels feel more like trying to put things together with your floppy arms than a puzzle, for an answer is immediately clear.

- Vehicles are more frustrating than fun.

- It seems like less effort was put into the last level, the ends of lava rivers can be clearly seen if you fall off the map, and falling into lava doesn't make you instantly respawn, you just fall through it. No real affect on gameplay though.

- The soundtrack doesn't seem to loop, once it's done, it stays done for a while or until you get to the next level.

All in all, a great game with only a few issues.

The first one was that it was too short. Though the levels were long, there were only eight of them, which I were able to finish in just ten hours. Not worth $15.
The second problem I had was that most of the puzzles weren't all that puzzling. Of course you had to think, but the game was mostly just tedious back-and-forth work in which you had to find of transport items in the game. Not worth $15.

+ the puzzles are amazing and have more than one solution
+ you can custom paint your character
+ everything works with physics, pulling levers, swinging on ropes, breaking objects
+ driveable vehicles
+ a lot of new elements are introduced throughout the whole game, so levels never get old
+ music is great
+ even though the physics are whacky, you still have a lot of control over your character
+ level transitions are very creative
+ have fun and go numb, with the ragdoll button :)
+ controller support
+ I encountered no bug whatsoever
+ local multiplayer coop!

Playing with a gamepad: 6/10

Playing with mouse & keyboard: 9/10

I don't know why the developer even offers gamepad controls.  

Grapping with either hand is a digital action yet it's mapped to analog triggers on gamepad.  

Aiming with your hands requires a great amount of fidelity and sensitivity, so trying to do this on an analog stick, instead of a mouse, is simply worse.  

I know people bitch if you don't offer gamepad controls, but I'd put a big disclaimer: MOUSE AND KEYBOARD RECOMMENDED.

At times I thought this is what tomb raider would be if Lara packed on the pounds. Timing jumps perfectly, swinging like tarzan, hurling yourself through the air like a damp washcloth waiting for an impact to stick to any available surface, operating vehicles and machines with the dexterity of a moose. Well maybe not the latter two but at times this game is unforgiving. Spent 5 minutes scaling a vertical wall, let go with the wrong hand, start again. Spent ages rowing a boat (painful until you get the motion right) but slipped overboard, start again.

My only problems are the length of the game (depending on play style and how quickly you get the controls), it lasts maybe 5-6 hours max (my play time is 2 run throughs and some split screen). Additionally, the last level feels a little unfinished, repetitive power based puzzles, when in previous levels you were solving varied challenges (physical skill, logic, creative thinking).

A fun customise feature lets you put your face on your character via webcam but you can also paint them to look however you like.

Human strikes a great balance between giving you reasonable control of your motions without forcing you to micromanage them. Most of the time Human does what you expect, and the times it doesn't have more to do with learning what works (e.g. how to weild poles).

The level design harkens back to a time when games were far more varied. Yes the way you interact with each level is mostly the same, but very few set pieces are reused between levels keeping what would otherwise be a very tedious game more or less consistently interesting.

The achievements in the game also do wonders for the engagement with the game. Some are super easy, some are very vague, but they keep the game from becoming a simple ""flop across the map"" experience.

In human fall flat, you navigate environments with the goal of getting to the end. The catch? Your avatar is controlled by you. And not well (but in a fun charming way).  Each stick controls a hand. Triggers control the grips. Clumsily pick up items you need, manipulate objects, climb up walls, use controls, and more using your ""drunken baby"" avatar.  It sounds like an awful experience, but in reality it is fun and charming. It plays very similar (as I can tell) to gang beats.  It isn't surgeon simulator level of ridiculous.

You can either do the standard puzzle, or try to break the game and go around the puzzle or solve the puzzle in a strange way that probably wasn't (or maybe it was) intended.

It's also a great game to play in coop multiplayer, especially if you still haven't gone through it in single player so you both have to figure out what's going on and how to progress. You might also find, like I did, that some of the puzzles seem impossible to solve in single player, so it give you a reason to go back to it in single player after you finish it in coop.

You use the trigger buttons to control your dude's arms and grab things. You'll have to work around the levels to complete some puzzles to get to the exit. 

The fun part is there's not a RIGHT way to complete a puzzle or get through the level. You can do whatever the game allows you to do within it's physics. Not that it's physics are something gold, it's pretty faulty but the goal of this game is to be funny, I guess. The only problem I've encountered is that you control your arms up and down at the same time you control the camera Y axis, so placing stuff around can be troublesome sometimes. 

The level design is noteworthy, there's a lot of places to explore, paths to find, even tools and vehicles to commandeer. The graphics are simple, you can paint your dude as you wish but the music didn't appeal to me... it's kinda sad, and doesn't quite fit in the game.

There are not many levels though each is greater in size and complexity than the last. Most of the puzzles aren't exactly hard and some of the last few aren't so much as challenging as they are kind of tedious if your IQ is even just a smidge above average or you at least look around long enough to see what needs to go where.

For 12 dollars it may seem steep but trust me, its worth it

I'll do my best listing my experience and the pros and cons of this game

Lets get some cons out of the way first

First The Game is Kind of Short, Lasting About 10 levels (I think) it does end kind of quick but after level 3 the levels do start to take a while, about 1 hour if it takes a while. But 2 things, while the levels may seem too long at 1 hour, I honestly feel they dont overstay their welcome. Each Level will have you do many, MANY, things and theyre all fun and unrepetative, so it doesnt feel tedious completing a level in terms of how long the level is. But that still caps at around 12 hours to finish the game I would say, which you could complete in a day if you wanted. But the catch it there is workshop support on the way so there will soon be an endless supply of levels, but for now, even at 10 levels, the game is still worth getting now.

Each Level Is Built Amazingly Well And Are A Blast to play. Each Level will have you face many challanges to solve the problem thats thrown at you and you use physics to solve them and its fun. Its so fun solving these and with them feel refreshing you should never feel the levels are tedious. Also Each Level Has Little Secrets you can find and do and some fun extra paths to go which may be more difficult but are awesome and feel fun. Hell, you can even skip sections of levels if you find the right place, and I dunno if they were intentional or not, but it makes you feel quite badass when you find them.

The Game Also Has Local Multiplayer, and I will be honest with you, If you wanna have the absoulte best time with this game, Play it with a friend on the first playthrough. The Game Is still fun by yourself, but with a friend, it becomes one of the best multiplayer experiences i've ever had with my friend. While if you guys love being douchebags to each other you can do that, You can work together and do many crazy things and its so much fun. [/spoiler This is a spoiler for the last level, but on the last level you are able to drive a car to get some coal, and me and my friend fought over driving the car for about an hour, and it was so much fucking fun, we kept pulling eachother off and trying to take over the car, it fell off the edge a couple times, we both tried to use the steering wheel and the acceleation, I dunno why it was so much fun, but damn that was a good time. Also I found this torch and I suggested maybe it lights up the coal burners so I did that, and it worked, and we laughed so hard about that.]


And Thats My Experience Of Human: Fall Flat

While The Game May Not Be Perfect with it feeling just a bit short, I could never say i dont like this game, This Game was a Great time, and its even a better time with friends, So if you have a friend to come to your house and need somthing to play, Get Human: Fall Flat, and trust me you will not regret it.

Well-designed puzzles with interactive and destructible environments and a healthy dose of the prerequisite humor needed to lampshade the shambling activities of the doughy protagonist. The visuals are very pleasing to the eyes.

The local co-op works very well and the game is really a lot of fun and laughs with a friend. Some option to individually customize player controls and appearance would be useful, but it sounds like the devs are planning to address this soon so it should be a non-issue then.

Figuring out puzzle solutions is generally uncomplicated with a simple observation of what's available around you – the challenge resides in the finesse of your execution. Wonky physics can sometimes make it difficult to perform simple tasks, especially in the ""Water"" level where you'll respawn more than anywhere else with the need to redo small sections.

Elsewhere, respawning when you fall down is usually trivial since it sends you right back where you left off, everything else untouched.

I bought the game after I got a 16 dollar refund from a purchase, because I saw Matt Peddlesden play it once, and thought it looked funny.  Bought the game not expecting much, and what I got was:

A ragdoll-ish physics-based puzzle game, full of wacky puzzles to solve.  Solve the puzzles in whatever way you think: your way just might work!  I loved going through and throwing things around....the physics engine has been done well, and actually seems quite more realistic than a normal puzzle game!  The art style is very simplistic, yet stunningly beautiful.  Shaders add a very nice feel to the game, and overall it runs quite well!  (Constant 60 FPS for me, including Twitch streaming)!

The only downside to the game is the length; as of now, only 8 ""dreamscapes"" to conquer.  But, these ""dreamscapes"" have multiple sections so you WILL be busy for a while!!!

All-in-all, I'm very VERY happy I decided to get this game, and it was worth every penny of the $14.99!  I'm proud to have supported the dev's of this AWESOME game!

Pros:
This game is absolutely phenomenal! It's a hilarious physics-based puzzle/obstacle_course game. During each level there are multiple paths you can take and multiple ways you can overcome the ensuing obstacles; so it's not entirely linear. There are also some pretty fun spots hidden off the beaten path. It also has a nice soundtrack which comes in at very oppurtune times, adding to the game's hilarity. I don't know what else to say...it was AMAZING!!! It kept me entertained for hours. Oh and I played this with my brother; I'm sure it's still a lot of fun by yourself, but I find it to be a blast with another person because it feels like it magnifies the games hilariousness.

Cons:
Sometimes the levels can bit a bit confusing on what you are supposed to do. I don't think I was supposed to climb vertical walls by swinging like I did lol.

Yes the game is good, neat mechanic for the main controls. The puzzles are really difficult to solve, however they are certainly frustrating. The checkpoints are well placed, still I wish I could just fly back to where I was, or set my own checkpoints. 
There does seem to be a lot of jumping puzzles. Which is ok sometimes, but almost everyone does seem a bit repetative. It appears the the developers did put quite some effort into pulling the player up onto the ledge, but if you forget to let go of the right hand, or slightly over shoot your target, restart!

Human: Fall Flat does keep me coming back, mainly because I get frustrated (from falling) and quit then think I can solve that.

Until I started reading the reviews.

This is a great puzzle game with marvelously consistent physics compared to alot of modern titles, and every level is a great little sandbox that lets you solve it your own way.
I thought each puzzle was pretty easy, although apparently that's not the case for everyone. Although for a number of the puzzles I saw the way they wanted me to do it, but then I solved it a much easier way with previously given parts. (on the energy level, just take the batteries with you everywhere)

Or if you want to spoil all the fun, you can just swing-climb up every wall in your way and beeline to the exit of each level.
So yes, with a great sandbox, you can't force the player to solve every puzzle.

I just want to say that there is an unbelievable amount of polish, attention to detail, and cool additional features that they didn't need to do, but that I appreciate.
Implementing dynamic shadows for light sources of different colors, which is only used in optional level sections. Carefully making every edge and hitbox work seemlessly on all surfaces.
Not to mention the level design that just encourages you to fool around; I spent 20 mins using the catapult to knock over all the stonehenge structures.


Overall I really enjoyed the experience, and I would recommend this game to anyone with a bit of time to kill and just wants something relaxing and fun.

52,24904104,english,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS REVIEW OF THE GAME FROM THE POINT OF VIEW WHO HAS ONLY DINSISHED THE GAME IN SINGLE PLAYER.

Human Fall Fat is a 3d physics based puzzel platformer (of sorts). Your goal is to solve all the puzzels in whatever way you can, and make your way to to end of the level. I say ""Whatever way you can"" because they're are mor often enough a couple ways to progress through puzels, some of which are intended, some of which probably aren't. The description of the game was not lying when it said that the game was opeInstead of doing a puzzle the obvious way, and that's were a lot of the fun comes from. There are at times mulitple intended ways to get past a challenge, and some ways to simply cheese it at times. I found myself on multiple occasions climbing and jumping my way accross many puzzels, ignoring the many contraptions that would normally be used in solving it, which in my opinion is much more satisfying at times. The game as a whole is quite the adenture, even though their all some VERY stupid puzzels. Puzzels which annoying because of the physics engine. If you have ever seen gangbeasts, the character you controll is one of the ragdolly characters you play as in that game. The way you pick up objects and climb is the same. This can be fun at times, but it can also be incredibly anoying, especially when you have to carry and/or orientate objects ina specific fasion. Throughout my playthrough of the game, mostly ion the last two levels, I found myself on the brink of ragequitting due too the difficulty of having to lug around and attach certain objects to one another, and operate the occasional veichles that show up (The boats were especially fustrating and controlled extremely awfuly, expect for the giant steam boat which controlled ok). The driving segemnts were unfortuanately never that fun because of it. This can at times elongate the amount of times you spend playing through game. some of this frustration though mayn have also come from the fact that I was playing through this alone. judging from what I've seen in some coop playtrhoughs on youtube, having a partner makes the puzzels a lot easier, and most likely a lot less frustrating. So I would recomend playing this with a freind, although playing it by yourself is still fun, just beware of the later levels.

54,24762589,english,"First of all I enjoyed this game, I really do, and I'm going to start with why I enjoy it, because I do think this game is great.

I love the graphical style, the control layout and how simple the controls are when using a gamepad, I also love the customization feature and the levels up until the water level are simple yet enjoyable, water and the following level were the two longest and hardest levels me and my nephew had to face and we enjoyed it despite arguing a lot. I thoroughly recommend playing this game with friends, but responsible friends, not childish punks like my nephew, but I digress.

I loved this game, right up until I finished it an hour or so ago.

Now, why I don't recommend this game.

8 hours, 4 of which were spent on the water and the following level trying to cope with the absolute bullshit layout.
The earlier levels are so small and despite being fun, the game itself is remarkably short, with the last two levels I mentioned being the longest and there are many unfair things in the game, such as on The Water level, there are a selection of boats, which I found infuriatingly difficult (with a gamepad!).
The checkpoints can drive you to insanity, but among this I found comfort when me and my nephew were drawn to teamwork (even though you can solo this game).

When we finally finished the final level we were stoked and felt accomplished, until we hit the credit screen, where I felt cheated, it felt too small and I realized we'd spent the last 8 hours arguing, complimenting one another's performance, arguing again, scratching our heads, clawing out our eyes and then rejoicing once we finally beat the dreaded water level, which in my opinion is very hard to begin with, and needed more checkpoints, it's also ball crushingly long.

After you finish the game, to my knowledge there is no reward but the experience of having finished it, I don't usually finish games, but I had no idea I was about to finish it.

Performance wise though it was great, only experienced minor lag.

I hope they add more levels or do a longer sequel, and for the love of the almighty I hope they let you customize player two and let you change your outfit without having to paint one on, maybe add some form of combat, though I feel that's more for Gang Beasts.

All in all if you want this game, my best advice is to buy it during a sale, unless you're happy to part with £11 at my time of writing.

My original review (posted below) criticized Human: Fall Flat for not being fun after a couple hours thanks to, what is in my opinion, a poor water/boat level with frusturating mechanics and checkpoints. I stated that I did not recommend the game at full price because of this severe downturn.

However, I am now altering my review to a recommendation for one main reason. In a world of angry indie developers that are quick to dismiss and silence criticism, No Brakes Games responded to my review directly, thanking me for my feedback and promising tweaks. After reading their response, I loaded up the game to find that the speedboat repsawn had been altered so it would no longer default to it's original beached postion regardless of where it last was on player death, which helped curve my frusturation with the section a bit.

While my thoughts on the water/boat level haven't drastically changed, as I still find it annoying and even frusturating in many ways, the simple fact that the developer listens to customer opinion and treats it with respect is admirable and deserves praise.

Thank you No Brakes Games.

 ___________________**ORIGINAL POST** ___________________

I was having fun with the light hearted relatively simple physics puzzles the game presented all the way through the castle level (so about two hours in). I rarely got stuck, objects behaved as they should and if I did something dumb and fell off the map, the checkpointing was totally fair.

However, all that changed when I got to the water/boat level. Rowing the first boat was simply frusturating, but it didn't last too long so it wasn't that big of a deal. Then I got to the sailboat, which was just slow and dull, grinding the pacing to a halt. Then I got to the beached speedboat and everything fell apart from me.

First off, getting the speedboat into the water was infurating. No matter where I placed the rollers or where I pulled/pushed, the boat moved tiny fragments at a time seemingly at random or not at all. After a good 10-15 minutes of pulling every which way, I finally managed to get the boat to the edge of the water. However, on the very last pull I would need to get the boat into the water and start progressing again, the physics completely freaked out causing the boat to go flying into the air and my character to be flung into the middle of the water killing him and forcing a checkpoint reload.

The resulting unfair death forced me to use the slow, boring sailboat again and respawned the speedboat to it's starting position, forcing me to pull it all the way back to the water all over again. After another 10 minutes of frusturing pulling and pushing, I finally got the damn speedboat into the water and was able to move forward. However, because the speedboat is difficult to control and the game doesn't make it clear where you're supposed to go, I ended up driving off the map and falling...back to the damn sailboat and with the speedboat once again spawned to it starting beached loation.

At this point, I quit the game and have no interest to ever load it up and finish it. I WAS enjoying myself up until this frusturating , tedious and poorly checkpointed section. I'd recommend this game when it's on sale for some kind of discount since you'll only get around two hours of fun out of it before it falls apart.",1470377111,1470581274,True,2,0,0.526041626930236816,3,True,False,False,76561198001721686,752,22,178,0,177,1517380173

Fun, good puzzle with many many ways to solve. Quite relaxing at time & at others you will be really in the zone.  
  
This game is great, simple as. Simple concept with a huge array of things to do, from firing yourself with a catapult to riding dumpsters.  
  
Want to solve the puzzles? Want to screw around and try doing the level your way? Well your in luck, this is the game for you.  

Good price for the game play and the re playability is good.

I do feel however, that the game could use and audio track.  I mean there is ine, but it really only plays for a couple of minutes when you enter the level, and then a few more times throughout.  But there are long periods of silence, which I found kind of un-nerving lol.

The game is mostly fun, and I got some real moments out of enjoyment out of some of the puzzles and especially out of the character. 

The feel is a little like Octodad meets Portal, but without the soul of either, and that's part of the issue. You get a snarky narrator for all of, like, thirty seconds, and then the game is mostly played in silence. The music is nice...when it's there. The whole thing feels a little empty. The world looks like it has interesting stories to tell, but you'll never know, because there's no substance beneath the puzzles.

By the end of the four hour play time, some of the puzzles start to wear thin. Especially because the second-to-last level is frustrating, what with all the water around that makes even the smallest screw up into a drowning offense. Be prepared to respawn and restart puzzles there a lot...which is not fun. Also, the final level feels pretty repetitive over most of its length, which isn't great. 

Where Portal and Octodad left me wanting more, I was perfectly happy to be done with this game in the end. I didn't really want to spend any more time working through the world. 

I hope there's more support, maybe some new levels provided that provide more diversity. But one of the core problems, the ultimate hollowness of the game, isn't going to be fixed by patches. The narrator at the beginning makes it feel like the devs wanted to make this a more fleshed out experience, and just ran out of time or money.

20,24564362,english,"Human:Fall Flat, where to start... this was a breath of fresh air for me since I often play games full of constant fast paced destruction.This is a game where your goal is not very clear, what you have to do is interact with the environment in order to proceed further into the level. all ""levels"" are just different places to explore, and there are 8 of them no less.

the keyboard controls and the controller layout are equal, the keyboard is just a bit more precise, and that of a controller is a bit more immersive. so you don't have to worry about it if you don't own a controller. there isn't a superior control scheme.

if you are used to ordinary progress/straightforwardness then this isn't the game for you, this requires you to think outside, or in this case, inside the box. anything you can imagine is logical, you can probebly do. 
ex: some people try to push a speedboat into the water and complain because it takes like 15 minutes, but in reality there is a metal bar next to it you can use as a wheel to roll it in just in 15 seconds. it's that simple.

the bottom line is that this game is not just solving puzzles, it's just using your mind to proceed, there are many ways to solve said puzzles. or even avoid them entirely by using a clever route, there are also some parkour elements, as silly as this game is.. the parkour is actualy fluid and easy to master.

this is definately worth a buy, the achievements are also worth getting (maybe not Let it rain and adventurer because that took a lot of time to get due to how grindy they are). most of the achievements simply require you to think a bit outside the box and sometimes even visit interesting places in the map you normally wouldn't

However, after the castle, the game puts you on a straight path, which only gives you one other way to go (and that is when you're halfway through the level already). The boats of the water level were absolute crap to use, I ended up using about 15 minuttes to get a god damn boat INTO THE OCEAN... and then they expect you to ditch it, for another. 

The factory is a single path, allowing no fun, nor creativity. The first half is ""PUT WIRES INTO SPECIFIC SOCKETS"", but after that part was over, that was it, no more wires. Instead you get driving with horrible controls... ""Psh how bad can it be?"" you might ask. Well imagine playing surgeon simulator... with a car... with the possibility of faling out of the world and having to start over.

Overall the part of the game that was in the beta was great, but the full game COULD have been a masterpiece if the last two levels were not so boring, and rage iducing.

EDIT: I had another go at the game. I got the boat in easily this time. there could have been a clue there though. Like an abandoned, broken ship which has the log infront of it.

On the Power level, I managed to climb out of the first room, then grab onto a wire (which was stupid and I loved it!) and I simply took the statue's box. This made the level fun for me. still dont like the driving though.

Overall it's a decent game. The puzzles are fairly intuitive but the art style and physics make for a fun engine. There's some object penetration bugs but it's kinda to be expected from a game like this. Initially I critiqued that there really isn't more than one way to get through the game and this was wrong. To clarify: There's only one real solution and method to the individual puzzles. The fact that it's also a platformer, however, changes what you can do in the entire level. I went into it with a Talos Principal mindset and that was wrong of me.

The engine has awesome mechanics in it. Electricity, vehicles, tides, boats, a freaking awesome shipping container crane... But all these features appear only once in the short game. I see no reason why there isn't a level editor and workshop support. It's just a waste. There's so much potential in what's here but so little in the execution.

But the split screen experience was 10 out of 10. 

So many times one of us was about to fall down an edge and the other came for help, dragging eachother back up. There was plenty of times we cooperated. 
Another time I was driving a huge crane trying to lift containers from a boat, while my friend stood on the boat grabbing the chains from the lift and putting them in place in the container. It was highly enjoyable. 
Another time he was steering a cargo truck while I used the speed lever. We also had a classic fail with the truck were the tyres didn't touch the ground and it stopped moving, whereas I put a rock under the wheel while my friend pushed forward. There's alot of solutions for imaginative people in this game and many different paths to take.

Which somewhat did happen when a voice spoke sayying ""It was dark... I couldn't see anything."" Whatever the case may be, I shrugged the eerieness and moved on. But it felt pretty boring after that. The puzzles are far too simple and comparing this with games like Portal 2, where I sometimes just searched for th correct solution, wasn't something I could experience here....

Of course, this isn't portal. But I'm taking the puzzle logic here. This doesn't feel like a puzzle game, but rather a humoristic physics and.... I got nothing else...I may replay this game if it adds Steam Workshop support along with a well-provided Map Editor. or.. More levels... More options, more everything!

I do not say this game is a waste of money. Because I do support the developers for being able to at least finish this game. (Somewhat). But if this is all they will provide...

The cool features they didn't show in the trailers or pictures, was that you can color your own character even use a webcam. That's a fun and stupid gimmick in most games.",1469240922,1469240922,False,45,3,0.579169571399688721,0,True,False,False,76561197964471157,701,92,270,0,270,1469240139
8,24467521,english,"Human: Fall Flat is one of those little gems that will no doubt get skipped over because of its simplistic graphics style. Yet what you will find with this game is an involved puzzle game that isn't afraid to try something different. There's no story to the game, you are literally dropped into the game and then you go off and start solving puzzles using your left and right arms.

Initially the controls took a bit of getting used to as the right analoge sticks control both the camera and the height that your avatar will reach. But after a little while you will get used to this and it becomes second nature to you. As for the puzzles themselves, they can be tricky, but in a good way. As you enter the level you will find stuff that you can interact with and move around and you wonder what you can do with them to get to the next level. You will jump, climb, move things, control things and more as you attempt to solve the puzzles. Then when you start to feel like you are getting somewhere, you come across a joke from the developers that is both hilarious and cruel!  

Overall, I find that I'm enjoying this game and it serves as a nice distraction and is both challenging and rewarding as you overcome the environment.
