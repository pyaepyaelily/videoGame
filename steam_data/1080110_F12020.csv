The handling this year is better (easier). I'm making corners I always used to struggle with. Traction this year is more difficult than previous years though.

Speech recognition is less bugged this year. (It actually works straight of the bat)

The graphics have improved since last year.

The addition of ""MyTeam"" is excellent and I really enjoy all the additional elements instead of just racing. I really hope they expand on this in the next version. 

The car models are as always on point.

What I don't like are the micro-transactions. This has caused a lot of cosmetics to now be hidden behind a pay wall. At least give us a more basic choice if you are going to have pay-cosmetics.

Yet another yearly F1 title by Codemasters. As the game is now on a 40% sale, I feel inclined to finally voice my opinion on the game and if you should buy the game or not during the sale.

F1 2019 was largely an improvement over F1 2018, featuring a substantial graphical upgrade, codemasters proudly showing off the night race at Bahrain in the first promo videos. Furthermore, the biggest addition in F1 2019 was the implementation of the Formula 2 feeder series into the game. F1 2019 also added driver transfers into the carrer mode keeping while keeping the R&D from F1 2018 (more on this later). 

So, what does F1 2020 offer new and returning players? Micro-transactions, in-game items previously accessible from the get-go, now locked behind a limited 60day event, where you are required to fulfill certain challenges (or spend real money) to obtain the items. However, many more items are added to the game (though you have to buy them indirectly with real money or complete certain challanges) 

But, f1 2020's primary addition to the series is a brand new career mode where you create your own team called ""MyTeam"". However the system is extremely limited in terms of what you are allowed to do in game. Tried to name your racing team you play in SINGLE PLAYER after an historical team or manufacturer and found out you couldn't do it? Tried to do work arounds using numbers instead of letters etc? Your account just got BANNED, sorry. God forbid having your player name be of ""Historical Significance"" DIE RACIST. Coming back to talk about actual game-play, the mode is extremely easy, months after release. Playing after 2 seasons for any decent player is pointless as your team easily snowballs into an unstoppable force leaving many players to call the mode an ""Mercedes Simulator"". 

Another point is the supposed ""Performance Patch"" we are still waiting on everyone thought we were going to have months/weeks ago. Due to Ferrari's massive drop in performance from 2019 to 2020 nobody could have expected, (unless you actually listened to what Ferrari said during pre-season testing including Fia's tec directive, adding 1+1 was too hard for most of us) The game ends up being a horrible representation of real F1, while Vettel and Ferrari are struggling like never before irl, they are winning race after race in the video game. 

In Conclusion the game is arguable the best game codemasters have ever developed with more features than ever before. And while I do recommend you buy the game on a discount, the game ends up getting a ""Not Recommended"" due to the massive video-game SIN of adding micro-transaction to a already 40$+ racing game. Not aligning itself up to real F1 in any shape or form. And lastly, Ignoring it's communities feedback regarding the R&D speed that has been an issue since 2017.",1601672112,1601672112,False,7,2,0.605444669723510742,0,True,False,False,76561198193867528,55,11,2591,687,2487,1601739874

-all integrations of the teams versions of the #WeRaceAsOne liveries were implemented
-F2 2019 (the only complaint that I have with this, is that we can hire Antoine Hubert for our My Team career modes, even though he died at Spa (RIP Hubert) and I do understand his conclusion in the F2 part, but why are you able to hire him in the 2020 F1 season?)
-Cars feel waay faster
-The possibility of saving race highlights (it was in 2019 as well, but it's good to see it do its thing here)
-Making the game more Casual-friendly by changing some settings within the game (allowing people who aren't good at the game jump in, regardless of their skills)
-Increased realism on the physics

CONS
-Podium pass (just why?)
-Microtransactions (was this deleoped by EA or something?)
-Zandvoort feels like it's from 1970 instead of what it should've been in 2020
-Zandvoort marshalling sectors feel waaay off, as I once had a yellow in the final corner, which also resulted in a yellow on the pit-straight
-The lack of Steam Remote-Play support
-The inability to hire Nico Hulkenberg as a teammate in My Team (I can't be the only one who wants to give him another shot)
-The lack of a 'alternate layout' to Zandvoort, as I feel you can make a shorter variant of Zandvoort using the diffrent layouts
-The AI starts feel waaaay too sluggish on a pad/wheel. on keyboard, they are just fine but that is because you need TCS on full when playing on a keyboard. when on medium or none, the ai get some good reactions, but then it feels like they bog down. I actually made up 8 position at monza going into T1 with a wheel, and I started P20.

Overall, it's a great game. If I could request one thing to codemasters directly, it's to add the Steam Remote-Play support so I can play with my friends who don't own a gaming PC and/or the game itself. the game is really Casual friendly, and is easy to jump into wether you are a pro or just starting out. definetely CodeMaster's best game to date. If I had to rate the game a a number/10, it would get a solid 8.4/10

""You've played 11 more hours of this game, would you like to revise your review?""

OK. I am fucking sick of getting 3 second penalties for running wide and losing time. Unfuckingbelievable.

Further: Now regularly getting errors trying to join MP lobbies. Cars crashing in a race left a phantom wheel in the middle of the track but no safety car. Safety car bug still exists, glitching it or cars on track when they pit. Crash to desktop loading setups in MP lobbies on more than one occasion, fortunately in practice sessions. Daniel Ricciardo suddenly went out in a Merc in one MP session with no AI...

Patch 1.09 - Fixes none of the issues we've been having in a league. Start lights go out early for the host and spectators, random disconnects and races getting stuck on the start lights. Penalties are still more often applied to the person rear-ended than the offender. 
Also, most time trial times have been randomly replaced with ones of a different time, and claims to be using setups when not and vice versa. Total farce. Codemasters got real lucky real racing is happening and people aren't seeing real F1 drivers face these issues week in week out.

I see issues around online racing on the subject of latency and how the game/server handles it as well as random CTD's during Career/Team Mode races with the full AI coverage with a crash handler uploading crashes to let Codemasters know something's fishy and when it happens in the end of a full race you need some fresh air

The paywall behind the VIP Podium Pass to unlock more challenges and goals is kind of utterly crap. By the time you get the idea of it you most likely already spend enough free Pitcoin on bs items till you realize you should have spend 9000 Pitcoin on a VIP Podium Pass and sort of feel forced to buy Pitcoin to have enough when you reach level 13 and get 2500 free Pitcoin while this feels as content that should already be ingame by buying the full game

It's not like they really need to make money by other means, because this game doesn't sell well at all. I think they go as hot cakes and Codemasters should open VIP Podium Pass content up to everybody to enjoy to be honest. It could even be made available by reaching LVL 30 on the Standard Podium Pass

The rest of the game is awesome and Codemasters still seems to be working on updates to improve things

First time playing an F1 Game, but I've seen review comparisons and yes this game is a great way to play alone with its My Team Career mode for a casual like me.

If you're not a car guy like me, it's better to start with the Driver Career to get accustomed to the ways of F1 before moving on with the My Team Career.

Also what's great is you can adjust the difficulty quite well that suits your enjoyment. Let's be honest, most of us just want to enjoy and win, so it's not bad swinging that difficulty down, no shame in that.

For its price it's well worth it the $25 I paid for.

The sound of the car and other track effects (crashes, wall contact, sound echos went passing close to walls) were improved a lot. it feels more envolving.

The new ERS deployment its a fetarure that I enjoy a lot, and its more close to the real thing. no more having to cahnge deployment type before and after every turn, now you just have an ""overtake button"" that you can use to spend at will you stored energy.

43,76321814,english,"TL;DR: Good upgrades on paper vs previous edition but bad execution for the most part.

For context, this is my second F1 game after 2019. I play singleplayer as well as take part in an amateur community league. I use an Xbox controller.

I really liked the addition of My Team mode in this year's version. It is a fun concept, but I have two major complaints so far:
1. The secondary driver you start with is often not a good match for you. Even with difficulty where my lap times are only a few tenths from the rest of the field, my secondary driver (Lord Mahaveer) is in the back of the field while I get pole.
2. The car upgrades concept was complex enough for me in 2019, with the additions of further upgrades, I am totally lost!

As far as main gameplay goes, it feels like car setups play too important a role for making the car go around a track well. The default setups have a lot of understeer issues, such as in the turn past the back DRS straight in Spain or a couple turns before the back DRS straight in Monaco. This can very well frustrate a new player using balanced setup. I haven't used the singleplayer assists yet but on paper they sound nice. Having a simplified ERS and DRS (including the assists) is a good touch IMO.

I was excited about the F1 league mode, but the bugs are filled with it and makes it a bad choice for adoption. Even many multiplayer issues have spilled over from previous game and many more have come. This has negatively impacted online play for many. It is still F1 and if you don't sweat, you can still enjoy the racing.

In the end, if you like F1 and want to enjoy racing, go ahead but don't take this game seriously. Also, the DLC is whack IMO as the vehicle models look awful in custom settings without a dedicated option.",1600680213,1600680213,True,3,0,0.535497486591339111,0,True,False,False,76561198224783556,181,14,4042,603,3348,1601825216

Avoid PVP unless you are setting up your own lobbies with friends...  Turn 1 is a cluster between people that don't care and, horrible connections forcing you off track.  Good luck finding a ranked lobby other than the 5 lap option.

What I like:
-MyTeam is a wish come true. I had been longing for long for a F1 game where we can develop our own team. The complexity, the headache and the planning is amazing.

What I don't like:
-The game did crashes a few times. Each time it happen is under very different situation. It happen three time as of this review and it doesn't cause much trouble but still frustrated. This kind of event never happened when I played other games either on Steam or on other platform.
-The DLC which we need to pay for extra liveries and so on. This game is basically a giant and expensive DLC already. With gameplay, engine and physics of the game has little changes. The only changes are the team, liveries and calendar. So why not just included everything as we will still be buying this game every year.

What I like to see in the future:
-We can carry the liveries for the next and coming F1 game.
-Included all the circuit that ever hosted the F1 Grand Prix like Sepang.
-Customization of race calendar so we can put as many race as we want and able to add circuit which are not in the current calendar.
-Pits Team department in MyTeam so we can improve and upgrade. Pit stop is a huge part in the race.
-Maybe include the other racing class, F2 and F3 like the motoGP game.",1600620361,1600620361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198169763697,17,1,2239,67,2133,1601808622

I guess theres a risk is could have made the Career mode a bit redundant but I think that this section still has its merits. Codemasters unlike EA sports with Madden NFL and Sports Interactive with FM series really make the effort to listen to people within F1, the players of the game and the fans to push this series year on year to get better and better rather than just treading water. Also, absolute touch of genius to include Rags in the F2 drivers you can sign. Real comedy value. Handling is great and the game has a sliding scale from easy pedal to the metal style drivers with all assists on to a more immersive experience with all assists off, which when you eventually get it right rewards the hours of practice and patience. One of the best sports sims on the market and can only see it getting even better in the future. Codemasters also good with their patches so game kept up to date.

However, I do think they could have made it a TAD MORE customisable than it is, but still, it's a good starting point. Several issues from previous versions have been fixed, such as blue flagged cars moving out of the way, in 2019 it was terrible, but this has since been improved, however the AI still seems to struggle with the idea of racing etiquette such as on several occasions they will just swerve across the track into the side of you for no reason, they don't leave you enough room through corners when approaching from behind and have less than half a car alongside you etc... but these are just small things. The biggest issue with it currently though is the overall performance of the teams, such as Ferrari are still performing as a top 3 team, when in reality they are struggling down the mid-field or worse. It's a good game, looks great, plays nice, but there are still a few factors that I think could be improved, but again, these, mostly, don't affect actual game-play and are just more personal preferences like being able to customize the car livery in the style of Forza Motorsport, changing the appearance of car parts, such as the nose, wings, sidepods etc... these are just things I'D like to see in the game, but then, this is their first foray into the custom team thing, so these things may come in later games.",1600476011,1600476011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198033262811,101,2,790,97,423,1600981349

I always complimented Codemasters for not letting F1 games go in the direction of another annual sports games but with this Podium Pass and new ""currency"" inside the game I can't give a positive review...The game it's fine (I don't play multiplayer so I'm saying this about the singleplayer modes), if you played F1 2019 it's just a natural evolution and managing a team it's nice and rewarding... but the Podium Pass looks like the start of a greedy era, just other games where you have to buy sh*t after you already paid for the game...",1600284589,1600284589,False,2,0,0.460360080003738403,0,True,False,False,76561198319555420,292,21,7239,646,6267,1601933195

I have two issues now that begs belief. One was my podium pass that working, it's this game version of a battle pass, it would simply not work and crash the game whenever i tried looking it in game. Managed to fix that reinstalling the game.The second issue it's the game now flat out refuses to join multiplayer races. Everything else works just fine, but when i try to join any multiplayer session, the game and steam itself freezes and stop responding, having to be killed in the task manager.This game is a dumpster fire.EDIT: so, after the most recent update of this game, codemasters manage to break it even further.

72,73541769,english,"[h1] F1 2020 [/h1] is without a doubt, the most polished and well made in the series. That being said, it has a collection of minor flaws that keep the game from reaching true perfection. Some of these flaws are carried over from previous titles, and some are new problems that were created in the process of adding new features.

I will first begin with what is amazing about F1 2020. The most refined feature of this game is not often discussed by many reviewers, and that is the controls. I personally played this game on an Xbox One gamepad with no assists, I had zero problems and the game handles like a dream. While most true sim racing games seemingly require a wheel to play to their full enjoyment, playing F1 2020 on a gamepad has no drawbacks once you get used to it. The key element that makes gamepad controls so smooth is separating force feedback (FF) into different sections based on the source of vibration. While many sim racers (raceroom being a good example) simply make all FF come from the center of the gamepad, F1 2020 assigns brake based FF to the left trigger (using the default controls) and acceleration based FF to the right trigger. This may seem like a simple solution, it smooths the process of playing with no assists considerably, as the player can now feel where the level of grip is more effectively. This also applies to wheel traction as well, so when one of your tires loses traction, you know which one it is based on FF location. This, in combination with many other refinements in gamepad controls, make the non-wheel driving experience easy to understand and improve with. The reason this is not often talked about, is because codemaster's refined control scheme has now become standard in their titles, however I believe it is important for the casual and inexperienced player to know that the barrier to entry is significantly lower because of these features.

While the core gameplay itself is amazing, what about everything surrounding it? Well, to put it simply, if you have played F1 2019, you have already played around 80% of the game before. I say this in the sense that F1 2020 recycles most of the content from the previous year's game. Driver career, championship modes, classic F1 cars and invitational events all make a return. The one big addition to this game is the ""my team"" mode that puts the player in the position of a team owner, manager, and lead driver. Playing as a modern Jack Brabham is a somewhat refreshing take on the modern sim racer. This feature brings a lot to the table as it gives a racing game something to do other then just racing. It is important to note however, that a large portion of the content in my team is based around the foundation of R&D development from previous games, as the main choices you have to make are around which R&D department to commit to or develop.

One of the more intriguing new features is the addition of driver ratings. In previous F1 games all an AI driver's speed was based on was their car and difficulty setting. With these new driver ratings, each AI driver has their own racing personality of sorts. Because of this, certain drivers might perform better in qualifying then in the race, or be more prone to ballsy overtakes then other drivers. This is especially visible in the ""my team"" and ""driver career"" modes, as with driver transfers, certain drivers might out perform their car, an example from my save being how Daniel Ricciardo consistently qualifies higher in a Mclaren than Alex Albon in a Red Bull, even though Daniel has a clearly inferior car. This small addition to the game makes quite a difference overall in the feeling of realism, as each driver feels like their own entity and no longer just an embodiment of their constructor. This also blends well with the my team mode, as it now creates a meta-game out of the driver market, as you can choose which driver to approach based on the stats your team needs.

Most of F1 2020 is pure gold, however there are small pebbles and stones that keep this gem from truly shining. The biggest problem stems from the new addition of the podium pass. The podium pass is just what it sounds like, a battle pass...for F1. If you do not care about cosmetics then you can skip this section because the PP (yes I am abbreviating it like that) only unlocks visual cosmetics for the player. The PP comes with the additional features of challenges and a daily items shop, clearly emulating the microtransactions of games like Fortnite. If you are willing to pay the 10ish dollars to unlock the premium PP, it gives the game a sense of progression aside from the career modes, but if you do not, there are some small consequences. The most obvious consequence is the lack of basic cosmetics, while F1 2019 gave the player more than a dozen options for helmet designs from the beginning, F1 2020 gives only [i] five [/i] (not counting DLC). Car liveries are in a similar position as only four are unlocked from the beginning, with a couple others being unlockable via grinding. Codemaster's rational for this is quite obvious, as they likely plan on re-releasing the designs from F1 2019 in the items shop throughout the year. Sidenote: Codemasters has also not yet added a way to record color coordinates for the combinations to achieve certain colors, so the process of copying a color off of a different design involves eyeballing what the color looks like.With all that being said, the customization in this game is fantastic. because of their new podium pass system, codemasters is now free to branch out more with their designs, allowing more original cosmetics like the ""star and stripes"" series, that have more unique design ideas. 

A common criticism from previous games is that each game has been using the same set of basic character animations since F1 2016. Sadly, this is still true, while I was hopeful that the addition of custom podium celebrations might signal CM attempting to create new animations, they remain the same, as do some of the pit lane graphics and computer screens. Sidenote: if you look closely at the pit lane engineer's computer screens, they all have a map of Monaco on them no matter which track you are on.

This is a truly fun game to play, with fantastic core gameplay, and a host of new additions that freshen up the ""formula"" of this franchise (yeah I want to punch myself in the face after that pun too). Overall, F1 2020 is an amazing game, and if you are willing to either shell out an extra $10 or simply put up with a lack of cosmetic options, any seasoned sim racer or casual driver can enjoy themselves playing this game.

5,75867968,english,"First thing first, I want to specify from the beginning that I have played every single F1 game that Codemasters has made.

Now...in the last couple of days I really wanted to play F1 2020 online, but is simply UNPLAYABLE!!!

It is simply ridiculous how every single time something has to go wrong in a way or in another.

Sometimes there is someone in the lobby who wants to kill you, or you have to wait a lot for everybody to connect properly while you are watching the endless loading screen, or the ghost system simply doesn't work and you can't know when you can go through a car and when you will hit someone who was a ghost but became a proper car, or you can't overtake because the other players have lag and you can't know where they are going and you end up hitting them, or you remain stuck in the pits for 10 or 20 seconds because why not....

The damage model is too fake.A lot of times you hit something with the front-left of the car and something from the other side of the car detaches. I heard about the licensing problems. But they can't be the reason for the unbreakable rear wing, floor, barge-boards and so on. It would be nice to see that your suspension is a bit damaged after you touched a wall in Monaco.  

Not to mention the safety car and the way it gets deployed. It is inconsistently and that is when it finally gets deployed, because most of the times there is a yellow flag for anything and then, suddenly, the SC is deployed for a car that stopped on the track.

I mean, I can understand that nothing is perfect. I do love the game, the graphics are outstanding and the sounds are really good. But, at the end of the day, it is simply unacceptable to buy a game that has so many problems. And what is truly sad is the fact that these issues have been in the game since the move to the Next Gen Consoles, back in 2015. When you really think a bit, it is outrageous to pay 50-60 euros every year for something that barely improves. The price isn't too big, the game is the real problem.

From my point of view a lot of things that are in the game are awesome but they are not fully implemented or they are not used at the maximum potential. For example, the My Team Carrier Mode is done just to be done. It is really nice to be able to make your own team, and choose your favourite colors. But you can't really choose your livery or the colors. You need to fall in love with one of the liveries that are in the game, and you will not be able to modify the color of the number, which is black on the most of the cars and doesn't fit at all with the rest of the car. You can't really go into administration as your balance will never drop below 0. In the normal Carrier Mode, you can lose your drive if you under-perform, which is great, but it is in fact a loop, as you will always receive new offers from other teams. The historic cars are nice, but they are useless. They are in the game just to be there. You can have a couple of events during your carrier, but it is unrealistic to have a little race in Suzuka, when you are a Renault Team driver and you just finished the race in Monaco, with the next round being in Baku. Also the V8s are super slow on a straight line, they were slower back then, but not that slow. You can't go over 300 km/h at Spa. I would also like to have a full season of cars, even pay extra for them, and play something like a Carrier Mode from 1999, for example.

And I am not writing this just to write it. I know that it might even end up unread or a small amount of people will see it. But, What I want to say is that I will stop buying F1 games until these issues get fixed and also the racing and driving aspects of the game become more realistic. I want to be able to put the car on the grid by myself after the formation lap, I want to actually drive through the pit lane, I want to see realistic damage, red flags, more tracks.

The game is great, but when I play it I have a feeling that it is such an old game. And that's because it is so repetitive, and sometimes annoying and unrealistic.",1599939572,1599939665,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198096472942,10,1,2883,24,2757,1601573086

List of game-breaking games:
- AI keeps driving into from the back of your car until you spin off the track. As soon as they make contact, they just keep pushing.
- If you drive next to an AI, they ram into you if that is their 'optimal' race line
- Game disqualifies you randomly for not using 2 tyre compounds, even though you pitted for different tyres
- VSC and safety car are a buggy mess: safety car delta is unreliable, leading to drive through penalties even though you're standing still on track, pit lane + safety car leads to punishments
- Sound breaks volume of many other applications (like teamspeak/discord) until your alt+f4 out of f1 2020
- Game randomly loses controller and when you plug it in again it doesn't  recognize your controller config
- If you need to fulfill a drive-through penalty, the game pits you instead of drive-through, making it impossible to do the drive-through, which leads to disqualification.

50,75729251,english,"F1 2020 is quite possibly the most in-depth and accessible Codemasters F1 game so far. Codies has managed to deliver a game that appeals to casual race fans and dedicated F1 fans as well. First things first, though, this game is NOT a simulator.

 If you go into this game expecting a realistic representation of how an F1 (and F2 car) drives then you will be disappointed. This game can be classified as a simcade (an already loose definition in the first place) at best. However, this does not mean the game isn't fun. Driving in this game is intensely fun, especially with assists turned off, you can still really 'fight' the car for control. Using a wheel is probably the best way to enjoy this game, although controller users can still have a lot of fun as well especially with the new 'casual' mode offered by the game. 

Now that i've touched on how the game delivers the feel of driving an F1 car, this game definitely succeeds in making you FEEL like an F1 driver. With the game's attention to detail for every team (cars, team kits, and garages) from the F2 feeder series, media interviews, car R&D, and driver transfers, the game tries it's best to give players the feeling that they are a fully-fledged member in the F1 paddock. The one thing that i wish was more in-depth is the MyTeam mode. It's fun for around 3 seasons, but after the 4th season onwards, everything gets a bit stale even with the dynamic driver transfers. The lack of proper customization for your cars and driver gear is also disappointing. Although i can understand why, this is the first time Codies tried pulling off something like this with a license as big as Formula One.

On the technical side of things, however, the game does suffer a bit from a few annoying physics-related, graphical bugs and 1 game-breaking save glitch (which i think is sorted by the time of writing this review). Despite the heavily improved AI from previous games, you can still experience weird inconsistencies from the AI performance in qualifying sessions, and an occasional lack of a challenge from the AI in the higher difficulty settings (AI level Expert/90+).

All in all, this game provides a fresh new challenge for both new and returning players in the MyTeam mode and has more accessibility for casual players by providing more assists and help options to ease players in the world of F1. Besides that, the existing regular career mode is refined and better than ever with the addition of a full F2 season. Minor bugs and inconsistencies aside, F1 2020 is a game that both F1 fans and casual players alike can enjoy. 81/100.",1599708987,1599709374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198147857764,22,10,4575,618,3422,1601652415

As pistas são todas originariamente previstas no calendário no início do ano. Por isso, infelizmente as mudanças que a F1 sofreu devido ao COVID19 não foram aplicadas. Desta forma, pistas como Hockenhein, Mungello, Imola e Algarve não estão e [b]não estarão[/b] no jogo. Por outro lado, as pistas originariamente previstas e que devido ao COVID19 saíram do calendário, estão no jogo.

Em termos de jogabilidade no volante, não percebi grandes mudanças. O carro continua perigoso nas escorregadas de traseira. Mas isso, é claro, se você forçar um setup com menos aderência na traseira, o que particularmente eu gosto de fazer e normalmente não acaba bem. rs

Comparado ao F1 2019, o jogo é melhor? Na minha opinião, é sim. Mas por pouco. Por isso, o jogo pode não valer a pena para aqueles que não são tão ligados à F1 e estão pensando num jogo só para sentir o gostinho de pilotar um carro de F1. Mas se o jogador quer pilotar o melhor jogo/simulador da temporada 2020 da F1, na minha opinião, este jogo é a melhor opção do mercado atualmente. Por isso, na minha opinião o jogo vale cada centavo e é 100% recomendado.",1599575181,1599575181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197996646295,158,46,726,0,606,1599599332

One race they will be 2-3 seconds slower than you and next race they will be 2-3 seconds faster, which either require player to constantly tweak difficulty settings before each race (essentially running a mock session outside of career mode) or forfeit any hopes for a challenging race.

It's a real shame because game packs a lot of content, which is ultimately rendered not interesting due to difficulty issues.

Adding to the insult is the fact that once you're in qualifying you can't change the difficulty settings, therefore if you notice it being wrong there you have nothing left to do except to forfeit the race.",1599505088,1599518648,False,4,0,0.529411792755126953,0,True,False,False,76561198035949911,300,10,661,0,661,1599504880

Also weekly even sometimes gives an error code when matchmaking starts, resulting in have to wait another hour to retry (most of the time it works just fine a second time).

2. 2020 season update: bring out a DLC containing the tracks that are introduced last minute this season.

3. VR implementation... , but I'll settle if this will not happen untill F1 2021. Better get really good implementation of VR instead of unsteady/low quality.

Having only played about 2hrs total, I can't say too much about content and gameplay, however, I've seen that [b]F1 2020[/b] has great gameplay.

[u]Customization[/u]
Being able to customize your vehicle is a nice thing to make the game more personal - and you can do quite a bit.
You are also able to create your own character from developer-made presets [i]face, hair, hat, etc.[/i]

[u]Other things[/u]

Which is great for the people that love to drive on different tracks, or for those that would love to drive on one the tracks in real life; but can't.
The career more is also great.

It stagnates and that is making it difficult to recommend. Codemasters is trying to buff the content, but not fix the gameplay. The AI is still bad and is inbalanced. They just have more top speed if you increase the difficulty. So it varies too much. 
Online is still a mess and is impossible to play. But the biggest flaw is Myteam. It shows the community, that there is a new mode, but really, it is not much more than the normal career. There is no depth to the decisions. 
What I want is more realistic gameplay. 
Basically a better collision model (Tires still or rear not affected by contact), weather/track conditions (10 rounds on a track that stops being wet, but the dry tires are still slow, because the computer suggested HEAVY WET?!), a complete warm up lap with parking the car and also driving into parc fermé after the race etc. I could go on for hours. 
So stuff, that is more important than more content, because that content is easily made, but gameplay changes, physics adjustments are way harder and are costing more money.

- Race weekend events where you can race others on the track where the real F1 event is being held
- Realistic audio quality (the sound of the engines is amazing)
- Customisation options (Your multiplayer car, character, team etc.)

Cons
- Literally no point in playing F2 (Don't assume that by completing F2 you'll be put into F1 teams accordingly)
- F2 practice session is redundant (I think its geared towards people who have little to no experience in open-wheeled motorsport racing). There is no incentive to complete the practice sessions.
 - Not sure if it was only me that experienced it, but the Oceania server was quite laggy and limited so most of the time I was racing on Asia/America servers with moderately high ping.

As you can see most of my complaints are related to my F2 career. This is because i fell into the trap thinking that doing well in F2 would put me in a good team in F1. Boy was I disappointed when I completed my F2 career... You could total your car and score 0 points in your whole F2 career and still have the option to join Mercedes, Redbull etc. At the end of your F2 career, you are simply given a list of teams to join rather than being placed in a team based on your skills and effort. So ultimately, there is no point completing the F2 career.
All in all, the game is great and still sorta worth the $84.95 but I wouldn’t bother with the F2 career. Just skip it and get to the good stuff straight out of the box.

The fundamental downside about this game is that the servers are always buggy, it seems like Codemasters do not care about maintaining their servers as I along with many of the guys I do league races with find ourselves losing connection or getting kicked from races, which is incredibly frustrating when you want to do well. Another huge issue is the incident/crash detection system. The game is not smart enough to pickup who caused accidents and incidents. If following a safety car and you are hit from behind the game gives the victim a five second penalty or drive through penalty. When racing and you are crashed into or crash into an impossible to avoid collision ahead, the game will penalize you. In almost all situations where you are a victim, the game will penalize you anyway.

38,75256572,english,"[h1] F1 2020 is a MAJOR improvement over its predecessor F1 2019. [/h1]

[b] Here's why; [/b]

[list]
[*] MyTeam mode allowing you to create your own F1 team, becoming the 11th team on the grid. Throughout your MyTeam, you develop your car from being near the last car on the grind to a championship contender. This is a great step forward compared to the model of F1 2019, where you simply join an F1 team and drive for a preexisting team.

[*] The lobby select menu of Online play had a major improvement, in F1 2019 would have problems with incorrectly showing the status of the lobby. Or if you did join a lobby, many times in F1 2019 a connection error would occur and you'd be kicked back to the lobby. The online in F1 2019 felt very unstable, whereas Codemasters has clearly put time into improving the online play for F1 2020. Now online feels very stable with few issues here and there. (Ex: A guy in the lobby is the last one loading for an excessive amount of time, holding up the lobby until either he quits or everyone else quits.

[*] The new ERS system implemented is a gamechanger for the flow of the game. F1 2019 had 5 ERS options, which became tedious in managing throughout the race, having to constantly cycle and manage your ERS on top of your fuel. This was incredibly tedious as if you played on automatic ERS you had a huge pace disadvantage. The overhaul of the ERS system in F1 2020 completely fixes this issue. Now there is two ERS options during the race, overtake, and medium. The player uses overtake when wanting to increase power and attempt to gain time or make an attempt at an overtake. This simplified system improves the flow of the race greatly.
[/list]

[u] Now To Focus On F1 2020: [/u]

[list]
[*] Similar to last year, the feedback on the gamepad is amazing, it gives you so much information on the status of the car. You can feel when you're losing grip, you get feedback on if you are about to lock up the tires, and much more. Codemasters never disappoints when it comes to feedback on the gamepad and I can assume it is the same with Force Feedback on the wheel. 

[*] The graphics of this game are stunning, similar to last year the game is very visually pleasing with great optimization. Allowing for smooth gameplay with great scenery.
[*] Codemasters added a podium pass this year, which is the same as the battlepass models of other genres. This is a great system for players to earn cosmetics as they continue to play the game. No advantages or disadvantages are earned through the podium pass or any DLCs you can buy. 

[*] The AI for this game continues to be the best AI of any racing game to date. There is still some flaws. An example would be the AI struggling to have wheel to wheel battles with the players. Overlooking the small flaws of the F1 2020 AI, the AI itself is top of its class and gives a very immersive feeling while racing in MyTeam. 
[*] CodeMasters included the original career mode mentioned before for the players that enjoy the more traditional career mode in F1 games. This allows for the player to choose between playing MyTeam or just doing the career they know and love, or both. 
[/list]

42,74047285,english,"Just a little reference before we get into the review : this is officially my first racing game with a wheel. I started watching Drive to Survive on Netflix and before you know it, F1 was in my library and a steering wheel was in my house. Lot of questions were asked, specifically around why is there a wheel in the living room and what was the cost. That doesn't matter; what does matter is that F1 2020 has come a long way since I first played the series in 2015. Rock solid racing game, a lot funner with friends, and highly recommended with a wheel. Although the game is quite positive, there are still a few things to consider depending on your level of competitiveness. 

F1's [b]gameplay[/b] is quite rock solid. The amount of assists available to help new players makes the game accessible and allows n00bs to experience success to continue playing. If there is a need for a more real, racing simulation type action, turn off all those assists and start wondering why the car continues to spin out (maybe don't floor it at first eh)? That was the first major difference I noted. Actual F1 fanatics will notice systems like DRS and ERS are avaialble, and pit/boxing the car can all be made manual as well. I got a few speeding penalties in the pits for that. The single player mode features two main paths : Career and My Team. 

Career is what you'd expect, start from F2 and work your way to F1. Become a better driver, make more money, earn more sponsors, and race for the dream team you've always wanted. My Team takes a more manager/owner approach where you manage more than you drive. Time trials is also available - times are recorded and compared to worldwide players so there is always motivation to try harder. Multiplayer features split screen (nice touch really), unranked and ranked lobbies. Ranked generally has players that are more ""race smart"" and are wary of colliding with others. Sometimes in unranked you'll find lobbies like this, but sometimes you will lose your marbles as some players do not grasp the concept of a proper F1 race. Dive-bombing (going at a fast speed into a turn and hitting another car) can be a real issue and really piss off serious drivers. Some players have an issue discerning between Need for Speed collisions and F1 collisions. 

The [b]graphics and visuals[/b] are pretty good. Animations seems smooth and accurate, graphics take note of tires skidding onto the track, and the dynamic weather system is a pretty cool feature. There will be races where you'll start in rain, but maybe finish racing in the sun. Really changes the strategy and forces the player to apply their common sense in a racing situation. I understand that F1 keeps safety paramount, but knowing that F1 2020 is a game, I think this realm needs a little work. If a car travelling at 300km/h hits another car or a wall, there should be some damage and potentially some flips going on. I think this is the weakest point of the game at the moment. The [b]sounds and music[/b] are bland. Some of the engine sounds are definitely distinct, while others may seem like a modified vacuum. The interviews after races are a little annoying after a while; interviewers will ask more or less the same questions which affect the player's acclaim. 

Overall, F1 2020 is a solid kick to the new decade. I highly recommend the game if you follow F1, if you're an avid and competitive racing fan, or own a steering wheel and pedals. I think the price of the game is a little high and should be towards the $30-$40 range. I disagree with releasing games year after year with no significant improvement (*cough cough* I'm looking at you FIFA). If you do decide to purchase this, 

I would recommend getting a few friends on board and creating or joining a league. Small details like the crowd suddenly cutting out, or the absence of punctured tires may bug you for the price of $60+. Reviewing replays is also another terrible feature that needs significant improvement. I think for $60+, the replay system should be at least decent. Additionally, the ranking system doesn't make much sense. My ranking and license both go down and up randomly at times. It would be nice to know what I'm doing right in the game and what I'm doing wrong. F1 2020 is a decent game, but is a long way away from being superior to iRacing.

44,72536399,english,"2020 and still no VR support despite the community begging for it for years! No actual triple screen support either. Multiplayer still sucks. No mouse support. Physics and force feedback were improved a bit this year but still feel like trash compared to real racing sims like iRacing or ACC.  There is a reason the real F1 drivers think the game is a joke and refuse to play it. They all play mostly  iRacing or Rfactor instead. I really wanted to love this game but with the lack of VR and poor physics other sims just do everything better than F1 2020 can (other than F1 licensing obviously).

If you're the type that plays the game casually on a controller for a couple weeks and don't mind re-buying essentially the same game each year (think madden) because you love F1 so much than you'll probably be ok with the game. But if you use a wheel and are the type that wants to play a racing game for months on end. This isn't that game for you. You'll get bored very fast.  There is pretty much no depth to the F1 driving model. For a lot of replayability you'll need actual racing sims that have more complex physics.

After hearing they made FFB more realistic this year I was excited to try and really wanted to love this game as I'm a huge F1 fan but after playing for a couple hours I wasn't that impressed. I hopped back over to iRacing and drove an F3 car. It took me about two turns to realize there is absolutely no reason for me to ever play F1 2020. With other games, I'm able to be fully immersed in VR while driving a bigger variety of cars that all handle much better.

62,75218427,english,"If you're just looking for some happy go lucky gamepad/controller driving... oooo look mum I beat Lewis Hamilton oooo look we've been to that track! Then sure, it's a fun time decent looking game to feel like you're involved with Formula 1.  Fill your boots you'll very likely enjoy it.

I'm a casual sim driver.  By that I mean I own a direct drive wheel, a cockpit, pedals and have a decent rig, but I don't compete in anything, I'm a very good sim driver, I can jump into a good sim and match the real pole times of the real drivers and that's what I enjoy doing, but I don't take it seriously at a competition level.  What I enjoy is the feeling of the cars and knowing that you're close to the real thing.

Obviously in todays world, your opinion doesn't mean anything unless you're popular so don't take my word for it... take George Russells, lead driver for the Williams F1 team who described F12020 as a ""step in the right direction"".  This summed it up perfectly for me.  Codemasters have been working on this franchise for 12 years and they're still unable to get it right.  And that step in the right direction? They need thousands more steps before they're at the right place.

The Formula 1 2020 game... you don't have to have driven a Formula 1 car to know that these cars are absolutely nothing remotely like the real thing, they don't drive or behave anything like a Formula 1 car to levels where it's just not fun at all.  I respect the guys who top the leaderboards in the game and are able to get these cars around the tracks faster than everyone else, but they're not driving a F1 car, they're delicately choreographing.  The real 2020 Formula 1 cars are designed to be the grippiest vehicles ever made, you just need to look at one real race to see the insanity in how nimble they are, precise, they throw them into corners and the outrageous levels of downforce plant the cars into the road like there's a planet resting on them... 
This game though? The cars feel like you're pushing a hovercraft around an ice lake.  They're cumbersome, slippery even with maximum downforce settings, they understeer off the road at will, break traction far too easily, you think you're the problem until you look at how these cars behave in real life and in other games/sims and you realise no, they're just that bad here. 

Part of the problem is the woefully inadequate force feedback that the game provides, it has gotten better over the years, but it's missing key feedback to let you know what's going on with the car.  For example, you can hit 215mph on the Monza pit straight, turn your wheel to full lock to which the car then begins to understeer in an almost perfect straight line... this wouldn't happen but that's not the point, but whilst the car has completely lost all grip with the road and is essentially free sliding in a straight line there is absolutely zero feedback being sent to your wheel to let you know that the car has lost traction.  There's a very minor amount of loss in tension as part of the understeer effect, but blink and you'll miss it, and that's it.  You can be free sliding with zero traction at 200mph and the game sends no feedback through to your wheel, making knowing whats going on almost impossible.  Other titles do a great job with this by juddering the wheel during loss of grip, it's unrealistic but so is sitting still whilst travelling at 200mph, you need false feedback to simulate car physics.  This is just one of many examples where you're left feeling like you're fighting a losing battle if you want to drive the car to the best of your ability, without all that you're just driving it like you're trying to master a game mechanic.  Now you can play around with damper settings and all the rest of it as much as you want, the feedback is decent in most areas in terms of bumps in the road and rumble strips but when you need to know that you've broke traction going through maggots & beckets... there's nothing.

Then there's other things like track limits which ruin the experience for those of us who enjoy shooting for leaderboard times.  The FIA have pretty clear guidelines on where track limits are per track, but Codemasters have completely ignored those and it's almost like they've asked an intern to red-line the boundary of the tarmac as track limits at times... areas where you absolutely have to take the car as part of the corner are deemed a disqualification when in real life it's totally acceptable to be there.  I appreciate these limits are the same for all users, but that's not the point I'm making, the point is this makes the driving experience as an individual far less enjoyable.  Speaking of leaderboards though, the game has a chronic problem with hackers cheating their times to the top of the boards.  I've witnessed the guy at no.1 on a leaderboard, watched his ghost, his car floated backwards around the track upside down and finished the lap 20 seconds quicker than everyone else... and his time stayed there for months.  Codemasters just don't give a toot.  

Look, the counter argument you always hear when people complain about F1 games is that ""they're not a sim"" and ""stop being an elitist"" or words to that effect.  But I totally disagree.  Codemasters do want this to be a sim, there are numerous elements to this game such as telemetry outputting and compatibility profiles with high end simulator gear which suggests they do want this to be considered a simulator.  But the fact that they also try and cater for a console audience on gamepad/controller makes this a mushy confused mess of a game which just doesn't work for those of us who just want a reasonably realistic driving experience, it's not enjoyable to drive and in my opinion they should allow something as prestigious as the Formula 1 license to be given to a dedicated simulation studio in addition to catering for the masses.  It really is saying something when you can download a $3 mod for something like Assetto Corsa, the RSS Hybrid car, and have a far more accurate feeling Formula 1 driving experience than the actual franchised game.

Let's not forget, Codemasters can't even be bothered to enable mouse support in the PC version of the game, when you're at that level you do have to cast doubt on why other things are so questionable in the game.

And finally, VR support.  I'm personally tired of hearing the excuse that it isn't worth putting in because so few people have a VR headset.  No.  So few people have a VR headset because so few mainstream developers are able/capable or willing to make their title compatible with VR.  It's the other way around.  It's a futile argument, but mark my words, at some point the person who decides on who gets the F1 game license will eventually be enlightened into the world of VR, and they'll come down on Codemasters like a ton of s**t over why it hasn't been part of their game for all this time.

So sure, there are parts of the game which are good and detailed, as a casual gamers you'll probably love it, but for anyone who wants to feel like you're actually driving something close to a F1 car with a wheel and pedal set, it's a far cry from that.  And as a Formula 1 fan it's very disappointing to not have that connectivity with the sport.

There is little to NO continuity between AI difficulty on every track. Some tracks, the AI are painfully slow, and on others, are brutally OP. 

The Qualifying Practice Programme gives you a target time that accounts for your engine mode being in MAX, despite FORCING you to drive in RICH engine mode at best. Essentially, if your Qualifying Practice Programme states your qualifying time was good enough for 15th, in the real race, that pace is usually AT LEAST 5 positions better. In short, the Qualifying Practice Programme is way more difficult than it should be.

Multiplayer is as toxic as ever and completing a race is near impossible at times. The penalty system is ridiculous.

Multiplayer is an absolute joke.

Then there's the cheating in the weekly events. I want to know how its possible to get a time of 1 min 30 at Belgium and 1 min 18 at Silverstone, among other ridiculous lap times you see set.

Trying to take respite from multiplayer in career mode has its own flaws. Right now, the quali sims are way off. They know about it, and have shown no acknowledgement or that it will be fixed. I picked Williams for career and topping a practice session to achieve your quali sim of 19th is just stupid. I've also had a bug where even on mix 2, your fuel funnels away like you have a leak.

Now the my team, am glad to see how fun and addictive it is. Unfortunately the r&d point and money is too easy to get, wish there was a difficulty slider on how much you get as already third season in and already winning the championship, it may be good for casual players but me being a formula addict I wanted the grind to last upto season 6-10 and not 1-3

Only downside is that each race weekend takes a while unless you just skip straight to the race which is minimum 5 laps long, however doing this means you lose out on precious R&D points, doing this manually normally means you will get the full amount but by simulating you run the risk of getting substantially less. Multiplayer works fine, I've only done ranked races and can always find a lobby. The one downside to doing ranked is the 'strict' corner cutting that is employed and at times is laughable as you only have to touch the white line and you're warned, likewise if someone crashes into you you will always get a warning for a collision which is very harsh.

[quote][h1]F1 game for the masses[/h1]
[b]DLC’s[/b] let’s just get that out of the way, just don’t bother getting any of them, you not missing anything nor does if effect your gameplay. Just leave it…

[b]Difficulty,[/b] well it’s a game for the masses, you can make it really hard or you can make it really easy and arcade like. Does not feel like it compromises in whatever you prefer. If you like to game on a controller or steering wheel, both work perfectly fine and can be adjusted to your gameplay style.

[b]Graphics,[/b] I’m running everything on ultra but never had an “oh wow” moment. Have some other Codemasters games also from 2019 where I actually had those moments.

[b]Gameplay,[/b] rock solid! You do need to think about your components in your car, as in you don’t want to wear them to fast or they do break and you will get a DNF. Planning ahead does feel rewarding, to upgrading to driving more carefully to saving fuel or spare the few tires you got, or just simple heat management. It’s all there with develop new parts to installing them or just speeding up your pit times. That said I never felt overwhelmed by it, all been easy to understand also there are ton of tutorials in the game with solid voice overs and text.

[b]Previous F1 games,[/b] well I have not played one for more than a decade sooo… That said I’ve played tons racing games since Stunts that you played on DOS back in the early 90’s, just not the F1 series.

21,74793164,english,"F1 Series by Codemasters is nothing short of amazing. Either for virtual racing enthusiasts and newcomers to racing in general.

The game has features to enhance newcomers experiences with high levels of driving assists. The great part about this is being welcome to a greater portion of potential consumers outside the racing niche.

The game also has zero assists options for veterans. The player can remove assists such as traction control and ABS for a more genuine F1 and F2 experience.

This time, F1 2020 has vastly improved the formula of CM F1 titles, with features additions and graphics enhancements also for handling. F1 2020 has a much better tire model than the previous F1 2019 had. We now have the awesome My Team mode, where you create the 11th team on the grid, race and grind for car improvements during a dynamic career mode we already had previously.

Circuits selection is based on the first 2020 official calendar, so you can count on two brand new and laser scanned tracks as Zandvoort and Hanoi GP. 

Suzuka has taken some love from the devs and now counts with a smoother asphalt after the last chicane that previously had an infamous bump.

Cons lies on older circuits that were made years ago and saddly doesn't stand the test of time, specially with now laser scanned circuits. These circuits are in the form of SPA, Hungaroring and Monaco. I believe they are the only ones left for a major revamp as they feature not realistic cambering, hard tarmac elevation changes that are not there in real life and wonky curbs.

SPA GP circuit is in dire need of a total revamp and possibly from a proper laser scan, as the original we have wasn't made with such technology. Curbs are in totally wrong shape, making it sometimes dangerously high for the car as in the amazing turn 12. Saddly, we have to wait to see a proper Spa-Francorchamps circuit.

The game physics is not on the level of iRacing, Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2 and other sims, but surely does the complete experience of a Formula 1 weekend with full rules and dynamic weather. Graphics are sensational and optimization is high end.

As an old Grand Prix 3 fan...This is the best Formula 1 game made to date. Codemasters still improves on every single title since F1 2016, sometimes strongly, sometimes not that much.

Highly recommend. Infinite amount of entertainment.",1598203638,1598203783,True,53,1,0.814335227012634277,0,True,False,False,76561197976826826,419,97,4741,102,4529,1600974376

Online -

Not much changes in terms of development and additions, except for a few new liveries for the custom car. But also the addition of lapped cars being ghosted, which is great, especially in ranked when people get salty and try to take out the leader. Good stuff on that. Other than that nothing much has changed. Not sure what else they can change but Online is pretty good for right now. Setups are also massively important this year more than any other, and this will be very evident in online, you'll find yourself possibly over a second off, if your using a balanced setup. It's really recommended that you either download or create your custom setup, or else you might find yourself at the back and in danger of being taken out at turn 1.

Single Player - 

My Team, my goodness me. I don't believe anyone ever expected this, but it's incredible, create your own team, appoint your own teamate from F2 Drivers to current F1 Drivers, multiple departments where you can decrease or increase morale. There are plenty of sponsors that are your main source of income, they are also placed onto your car, race suit and helmet. A bit more of customization is a good sight in this game. F1 drivers can now retire as well. The only negative from this game is the slight decrease of AI Aggressiveness, there is no denying there speed, but there wheel to wheel racing has gone down a bit, sometimes they completely turn into you, or just brake and completely back out of a fight, which is pretty inconsistent. The second bad thing are the starts, probably the worst it's been since 2015 in terms of starts, it's nearly impossible to get a good start every time against the AI. It's possible, but unlikely.

63,74376701,english,"[h1] More of the same, Deluxe edition lacking [/h1]
I've marked this as Not Recommended but to be honest it's a very slim margin and if there was a middle of the road 5/10 option, this would be it.

TLDR version: If you liked 2019 you'll like this as it's more of the same, but to it's detriment. Too much recycled content, My Team frustrations with liveries/colours. Second driver growth is painfully slow. Schumacher Edition isn't worth it. 2019 had Senna-Prost content with race events based around points in their career. in 2020 the Schumi edition is just a bunch of cosmetics.

Full Review:
From 2019, the addition of My Team is nice, it's where most of my hours have been put in. Also the handling feels different in a good way.
Sadly though that's all I can kinda highlight as new or different in this over the 2019 version.

As is kinda (sadly) expected from annual titles, there is a lot.. a LOT.. of recycled content from last year or two of F1 games.
-Practice tasks are exactly the same (Track acclim, tyre management, race strat etc.) Which can all be completed in less than one practice session, with no real incentive to do Practice 2 & 3 as once they're done, they're done.
-Paddock interview questions and answers are completely identical to last year, not having any new questions at all, or changing the format feels really lazy.
-Classic content is EXACTLY the same as last year, the same classic championship winning cars like Alonso's Renault, the Brawn GP car etc that were in F1 2019.
-The ERS management on the HUD is the same even though the use of it has been changed, so you have a mostly pointless HUD option to change ers mode but only between Medium/Overtake/None when you already have a toggle button.

There are also a few quality of life things that I feel were missed opportunities and frustrating when playing the game.
-My Team mode resource point generation feels really slow the further along the R&D tree you go.
-Acclaim point growth hits a wall and really starts to become a slow grind.
-In My Team, if you want to try and pick a second driver from the lower ranks  and stick with them, rather than changing drivers with higher skill and contracts, their growth is almost painfully slow, with facility boosts only having a limited effect and activities only giving +2 to a single stat, it really frustrating.
-The custom liveries are such a missed opportunity, only giving you the option to recolour a few templates rather than a full fledged editor like in the Forza or NFS series. Also the colour picker is frustrating as you can't save previously used colours.
-Overtake being an on/off button press rather than a press and hold like in the current F1 cars.

Schumacher Edition
It's really not worth it.
While 2019's Senna/Prost edition gave us a few races and track events based around points in their career at least, this year the Schumacher Edition is just a bunch of cosmetics and nothing else.

Overall
Have I and will I continue to sink hours into this game? Yes
Because if you enjoyed 2019, you'll enjoy 2020, because it's more of the same.
But a bit TOO MUCH of the same.
They could've really gone with something fresher for a new decade of f1 games but there's so much copy-paste from 2019s game it's a real let down.",1597539040,1597539040,False,28,2,0.590928375720977783,0,True,False,False,76561198004191445,543,1,5105,0,3795,1599954593

Cons:
- There still are bugs despite Codemasters using a very old engine. In one case, the game crashed at the final lap of a 50% race.

Multiplayer hasn't changed since the last game and if anything it got worse. The day Codesmasters actually makes a good F1 game is when Multiplayer is actually enjoyable and not filled with brain dead, lead-footed, low IQ drivers. The game needs a reporting system and on top of that have a system in place like Overwatch in CSGO where multiple experienced players review a set of incidents in a race and all vote on whether a ban should be given to said player.

I've heard My Team is good. I don't really have any plans on playing it. I haven't touched Career mode and I'm sure that hasn't changed as well.

Verdict: Don't buy the game strictly for the multiplayer. If you want to get it just for My Team/Career mode go for it but It will probably get old after a while.",1597177475,1597177544,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198129514495,70,14,718,0,718,1596829488

43,73133793,english,"The question most people have when a new game in a yearly series releases is, Is this worth it for the £45/£50 price point... In this case, I believe it is. Fair enough, i missed out on F1 2019 because I didn't see it adding a lot to the previous iteration of the franchise. This game however does a lot to add to a formula (no pun intended) that was getting stale.

But why...
- My Team, the new addition to the game, adds a new layer of gameplay that truly makes you care about your team and its success. After starting out with the mode and having a bit of fun, bringing the lord and saviour Raghunathan in as a 2nd driver and witnessing him come dead last every race whilst I was slowly getting closer to the points as the season progressed... I got more irritated as the season progressed and changed him out. The personalisation is nice and keeps you caring about every action. However, this isn't without complaint because all that has really been added is a bit of behind the scenes management and being able to drive your own personalised car... races are the same, as are interviews post-race.

A few graphics have been added for pit stops which is a nice touch, but nothing major for the races and career modes. AI have been updated though and do make more punchy moves which throw you off your usual lines to defend against them. Some tracks, like the new Zandvoort Circuit, still have easy ways to keep the AI behind most of the time unless you have horrific driving ability or tyre wear and therefore you can get points with the rest of the field in a processional line behind you. For the most part though, it's a nice new challenge and the AI are more unpredictable in their moves.

Online is as it always has been... mainly chaos with a few decent races in there. I've ended up getting bronze tier ranking from placements simply because of first corner punts from behind and the side ruining a whole race as people forget the brake pedal exists. Fair enough, I'm not the greatest of drivers but try to keep out of conflict as much as possible. Some races have been quite pleasant, first lap wing changes creating some good battles with other drivers who found themselves in a similar situation. It just needs a function like Forza where it can predict collisions from high speeds card launching into slow corners for the experience to be tolerable.

Wheel support is, as usual, very good... Force Feedback is nice in telling you about understeer and oversteer, allowing you to react in time along with the pitch perfect engine noises to give you similar indications. The mobile phone ring of the Ferrari engine downshifts is a personal favourite to hear as I pass them, or they pass me.

There are still some updates needed though... liveries still haven't been updated to the #WeRaceAsOne versions and Ferrari still have the most powerful engine and their performance hasn't been decreased as it should have been after the first performance patch. 

All we need is a realistic setting where Mercedes winning qualifying by a second causes the commentators jto say ""Why did they win today?"" ""Because they're Mercedes... They're just miles better."" (and I say that from a McLaren fans perspective). 

So overall... is it good. Yes, this franchise has been on the up since 2016/ 2017... This is yet another improvement but if you're hesitant... just get it on sale, it's inevitable it will be half price within 6 months.",1595456856,1597176103,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198234571772,109,13,5781,614,2034,1601892624

53,74137247,english,"A great F1 game. Some welcome improvements to car handling and ERS management over last year's game, following input from real F1 drivers who raced in the Formula 1 virtual championship during plague lockdown. Minor improvements to graphics, which in 2019 was already a massive step up. My Team career is a great new addition, and I'm really enjoying playing as the owner, manager, and star driver of the 11th team on the grid.

If you're a hardcore sim racer, you might dismiss this game as not being ""realistic"" (translation: difficult) enough. But for me, it's about as much of a simulation as I need it to be. For inexperienced players, there are plenty of driver aids to help ease the learning curve. There's also a new casual mode, which can help even complete newcomers enjoy the satisfaction of winning races.

In terms of content, the full original 22-race 2020 F1 calendar is represented. Sadly, none of the replacement tracks for this year's actual season will make it to the game, but let's hold thumbs for a Covid Edition DLC in 2021. There are also classic cars, including Michael Schumacher's title-winning cars in the Schumacher Edition DLC. In addition, there's a full 2019 F2 season (with 2020 tracks), with the 2020 season to be added at some point.

A more divisive new addition is a ""battle pass"" season type of system, where you gain XP that unlocks cosmetic items and Pitcoins. You can either purchase Pitcoins for real money. More interesting, though, are the daily, weekly, and premium challenges, which also nets more XP.

I would definitely recommend this game for F1 fans, and anyone curious about driving the world's fastest race cars virtually. If you don't care about having the most current drivers and tracks, you can probably save a few bucks and buy F1 2019 on sale instead. But depending on the price in your region, the improvements and new additions in F1 2020 are well worth the money at full price, provided you buy it shortly after release, and play it until F1 2021 is released.

56,74134692,english,"Through no real fault of Codemasters' own, the authenticity that's been a hallmark of its F1 series isn't quite there this year. How could it be when the season it's replicating remains a moving target? Having started some four months later than planned, we're still not entirely sure what the rest of the F1 2020 calendar is going to bring, with visits to circuits like Portimao, Imola and Mugello on the cards - none of which will make it into this year's game, while Zandvoort and Hanoi, two new races we'll never get to see this year, find a place in the game's circuit roster. Even the liveries have changed fast in the build-up to yesterday's season opener - the now Rokit-less Williams is part of a day one patch, and you'll likely have to wait a little while after launch until you're able to race Mercedes' freshly black and jaw-droppingly beautiful new look.
Well, that was my own tale, and F1 2020 provided me with the systems to be able to play it out. You pick out your team colours and livery in an editor that, for all its limitations, provides some fairly convincing results. You select sponsors - they're made-up brands and companies, which actually seems fairly authentic to the F1 underworld of financiers and mythical energy drink slurping enigmas - and manage contracts and facilities alongside the R&D upgrade tree, juggling resources amongst the lot. I'm a big fan of how 10-race seasons are now an option, making that progress all the more instant and just as gratifying - because when it comes together, and you're working alongside the F2 hotshot you hired to make a crash and grab on the last few points-paying positions, F1 2020's new team management mode feels legit.

It's helped along by handling that keeps making forward strides. There's a new, more accessible pad setting, complemented elsewhere by tweaked wheel settings that keep you that little bit busier when hustling around a track. Most importantly, whichever way you're playing, everything feels whippet quick and responsive. It's all a bit overstated, as is the AI, which is equal parts courteous and aggressive with not much subtlety in between, but that's just fine. This isn't iRacing or rFactor 2, yet in its own way F1 2020 is faithful to the real thing.

71,72559347,english,"As mentioned before, I have to change my review.

Many of the most frustrating Bugs are fixed.
It is still not what I would consider a good Game, due to the MTX involved but at least you can actual have fun with it.

The driving physics are better then in the previous installments. The car has actual weight that you feel through the corners. Acceleration and deceleration destabilize your car as it should.

Unfortunately that is the only improvement you can point your finger at in comparison to F1 2019

The KI feels still stupid. Getting themselves in positions where they will never get an advantage besides getting in your way. Qualifying times seem to be dependent on your first run.

Another thing which is very irritating is that you can deactivate Auto Save, but then you don't have any means to save.
There is only a ""mid race save"" feature but that's the only one in the entire game. If you want to save between P1 and P2 you are out of luck.

In regards to dealing with Codemaster themselves, just don't.
You still need to fill out a form just to tell them about bugs. To get heard you have to do Q&A for them in the first place. Best case is you decompile the game, fix the bugs yourself and only then tell them about it.

This game is still not worth the money they want, but at least its worth being called a game. Wait for a 50% deal and play the shit out of F1 2019. You are not missing out.

-there are some translation issues (in polish)
-the AI sometimes fails to notice you being on the inside and just turns into you
-the microtransaction system is something that doesn't really fit the game
-the goddamn Podium Pass, which would be fine if it was for free, sadly it isn't

-updated physics
-My Team mode

- Mirror (Now you can check if Kvyat is behind or not :D)
- One click button to overtake (Simplified ERS), i like that a lot
- Harder AI (Usually I play with 105 AI before and now 95 is very hard)
- New track and some track got update (Like Spain sector 3)

Cons :
- No new track from a new 2020 calender
- Less classic car

I love carrer mode in F1, Fifa series, that was my favourite mode so far, but I need to be honest, this game is not something special, compared to even F1 2018.",1596998694,1596998694,False,1,0,0.456483125686645508,0,True,False,False,76561198109572438,70,23,366,0,366,1596185183

24,74038955,english,"So I bought this game on impulse after wanting to play a more realistic racing game.  I usually play arcade racers, and after a dozen hours playing, here's my review:

The game has a lot of depth and accessibility options, allowing you to tune the game to your liking. Not all of it is straightforward though, and some options are pretty hidden, so I suggest you take your time browsing through all the menus because the game's tutorial will not hold your hand.
If you ever played Dirt 4, F1 2020 has the same My Team mode as that game, and it adds a lot of replayability and much needed variety to a F1 game. The flashback function so present in every Codemasters racer is also in this game, but this time without any downsides to its use, so it's entirely up to you to limit yourself or abuse the flashbacks as much as you want.

The biggest problem I've found with the game so far, is actually on the gameplay side of things. The game sits on the fence between simulation and fun, which is not a bad thing, but that means it also lacks some things you'd expect from this type of game.
There's no random engine failures for the player. The AI's cars might randomly fail through the race, but yours won't, ever. The damage model on this game is bordering on nonexistent, which I assume is because the sponsoring brands don't want their precious stickers being damaged by modern mesh deformation technology, so while the cars in real life are fragile and soft, the cars in this game are coated in trademarkium and are by all means, unbreakable.
The AI also seems to have a larger range of turning than the player does, which means they'll often take corners at much higher speeds than you will, which I assume is to compensate for their constant premature braking before curves. Seriously, over half of your overtakes will be because the AI decided to brake much earlier on simpler curves, meanwhile tracks like Monaco, they will fly through curves at double your speed.

Races can be huge too, and some races even on 50% lenght, can have as much as 35 laps. You can pick between having 5 laps/25%/50%/100% races lenght, but honestly going above 25% is something you should avoid unless you're doing one off races. The game for whatever stupid reason will sometimes randomly black screen after a race, and if that happens, the entire race progress has been lost. 
That means if you just spent the last 60/90m doing a 50%/100% race on carreer mode and the game suddenly decides to black screen, not only your entire progress is lost which means you gotta redo the entire race, but the game DOES NOT ALLOW YOU to change race lenght on race day, which means you gotta either retire from the race or do the entire thing again and hope this time the game goes through.
Overtaking backmarkers is also as frustrating as it is in real life, which makes you wonder why the hell FiA still allows B-Teams to compete in the same race as A-Teams, specially when teams like Alfa Romeo are just Ferrari's spare parts.

There is also a huge discrepancy between race difficulty and practice difficulty. Even on the lowest possible difficulty settings, practice mode will still often have simply unreachable goals. And failing practice goals means you get less points to upgrade your car with. Thankfully the game allows you to simulate practice mode so you can skip it entirely and get points out of it. The game also lets you simulate races if you ever wanna skip a track you dislike or a rainy track.

Rain in this game might aswell be hot butter, it makes your car lose all grip and just slide along every single curve. I did two rainy races so far, and on both times half the AI cars crashed out of the race on the first 30s.

Finally, the game also has some battle pass crap and a cash shop, which lets you buy random gloves, outfits, car decals, helmets and podium poses to customize your character and team with. Character customization is the bare minimum, as you just get to pick between one of many male presets and a few reptilian ""females"". 
You can customize your character any time you want, including changing his/xir presets and name, but any change in clothing aside from helmet will not be reflected on the carreer mode, so you're basically spending money on content you can only use on half of the game.

In the end, I really enjoy this game for what it is, but it's clear it could be so much more. I never played previous F1 games or racing simulations in general but I truly like this game, as it leans more towards the 'game' side of things.",1596992430,1596992430,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False,76561198002374009,374,34,2620,0,762,1598796979

My Team: Really fun if you play solo a lot and have no plans to play online.  A great addition I hope is here to stay.

However, to really, really enjoy this game, you must join a simracing league IMO.  I've been playing F1 games since 2016 and have never really put more than 20 hours into these games.  Once I joined a sim racing league, my time skyrocketed, as you'll find yourself working on your racecraft, practicing the same track over and over, all to just potentially bin it in turn 3 on an online race that isn't full of torpedo users.  You'll also start meeting people and having conversations about F1, MotoGP, and other motorsports. 

In other words, it is the gateway to the premium racing experience that a ranked/unranked lobby could almost never produce.

Overall: A great game with some bugs that have lasted over the years for some reason.

0,73663231,english,"In my opinion, I would say that this is definitely the best game out there for formula one simulation and no other game comes close but it is not without its faults.

Starting off with singleplayer, the most frustrating thing is trying top nail the difficulty and I feel like there needs to be some sort of benchmarking mode where you complete a few laps or a race and the game gives you a difficulty that you should use. The main problems that i am having with this is that the difficulty that I play at makes it way too difficult to complete practice programs successfully but I end up doing a lot better in qualifying. Furthermore, in the race, I end up doing a lot better than I should in the car that i am in. It just makes no sense at all and is not at all realistic. This overall leads to a very annoying experience. I love formula one as a sport but I feel that this game is too flawed for me to have any fun in.

Now onto the online mode. I personally only play ranked as it has the fewest dirty drivers however in every lobby I go into there are always drivers that either are not very good at the game or drivers that are just straight up dirty and try to ruin your race. This leads to a very annoying experience that is made very hard to enjoy. I am unsure of how this can be improved but something needs to be done. 

In conclusion, this game is very flawed and I find it very hard to enjoy. I would not recommend it for anyone wanting to play the game seriously at all. As far as new players go, codemasters have made it quite easy for you to pick up the game and play but the difficulty system will be vary annoying and it will be hard to find a difficulty that suits you at all.

The sim is amazing in the dry and wet, it's a seamless experience and a well designed one, much improvement over F1 2017 which I played last. 

To pour some whine into it, the AI level seems very inconsistent between different circuits, practice programmes, qualifying and the races. I'm hoping this is either an issue more pronounced in F2 or something that will be patched soon. I can race decently within 75-90% AI but some of the practice programmes can be impossibly hard even with this moderate AI level, leading to some frustration.

Regarding the micro-transactions, I was also worried but I'm not bothered by it. Might be a matter of taste, but to this day I haven't unlocked anything in the podium pass VIP section that I would want on my car/character, so they are basically options for those want to have everything or with some particular items aligning with their taste.

As offline racing goes, only tested out the time trial which seems the same. Did not check the ""My Team"" and Career game modes yet.

Choosing sponsors, liveries, second drivers, facility upgrades and more help this mode stay fresher for longer than in the past. Otherwise, it's the same deal as every other F1 games in terms of modes, but the handling model in this year's game is much improved and makes the cars feel weightier and grippier. The AI has also been retuned, and will make mistakes much more often than their robotic counterparts in former years. I caught Daniel Ricciardo out of Portier at Monaco when he had a kick of oversteer on the exit, which I had never seen the AI do before. It makes everything much more entertaining.

With no assists I can barely get out of the pit lane.

There are many F1 gamers out there that want a real 100% simulation, which I am sure you will get, but for the rest of us who can't back out of our drive way without committing a moving violation and leaving tire tracks on the carefully manicured lawn opposite, this game is a blast.

Codemasters has actually done it this time. A perfectly balanced single player experience with a phenomenal 'My Team' mode, that puts you in the seat of the CEO and No.1 driverof your own F1 team. The racing with the AI is for the first time reminiscent of Geoff Crammond and very engaging. All pitstops and rules work pretty flawlessly and everything looks completely stunning. The controls feel tight with FFB lacking a bit of the fidelity of a AMS or RF2, but it is the best Codies implementation to date hands down! In actuality it is now fun to drive. For the first time EVER did I wish at the end of a 100% race for more laps. More laps to push the car to the limit and gain that one extra position. (I have not tried multiplayer yet.)

This game is great!! One of the best after 2018, with the handling being very good again, the car feels planted through every corner and i have so much fun :D handling feels similar to 2018 actually, except braking is much easier on this game.

I LOVE the My Team career mode, it's the most immersive a career mode can get, creating your own team and managing it whilst driving it through a season! This career is way more fun than the regular driver career which i can find boring sometimes.

I also believe the engine sounds are the most realistic they have ever been. The Ferrari and Renault sound the closest to real life in my opinion.

The AI have improved again as well, feels like you're racing a real person when you're racing with them, makes me less bored of GP mode races.

The overtake button is a good addition, it makes ERS management so much easier, I hated managing it in the other games, I couldn't drive as fast as I could because the ERS was too low and I had to save it...

I feel the automated highlights have also improved from 2019, they actually show overtakes made during the races.


Now with those great features of the game, let's get onto some cons.

There are less options for helmets... kinda disappointing tbh, I can't use the design I used in 2018 and 2019 because it isn't an option :(

Game crashes, not as much as 2019, but this is still a problem, even for OP computers.

Bugs including:
- not losing a single part of your wing after hitting a wall hard (has happened to me and some others)
- Desynced timing and lag (especially in spectator view, there are timing glitches)
- Drivers can sometimes be on the podium with no heads or no body (this has been fixed)


Now you might be wondering: why did I not mention the communicating with online services ""bug""?
Well, I honestly don't think it's a bug, it is just because the game has freshly come out and a lot of people are playing online and it can't handle it. I barely get it at all either so it's clearly not the game... it's related to the connection of someone to the host. Communicating with [b] ONLINE SERVICES [/b]. It's connecting to the game servers, so it's clearly related to connection in multiplayer. It's like when the internet speed at your home drops because a lot of people are using it. So yeah, rant over on that.

Overall, F1 2020 is one of the best F1 games to be made, with great handling, great features, and a career that brings me back into enjoying what I used to play before starting league racing! :D

Although i still wish that:

1. My team career mode and online car customization was better.
We have several examples of good customization in racing games. Customizations that could be in the game are custom liveries where you can place and color geometric shapes to make your car look how you'd like it, choosing the chassis look, like different noses, spoilers, aero bits, wheels and wheel colors, number placement, custom sponsor placement. And most of all: a decent color picker, because the one in game sucks.

2. Pit animations weren't atrocities from the 1990s like they are today, the car looks like it is floating when it comes in.

I enjoy the game greatly but removal of a large amount of classic cars, livery's now locked behind a store which involves a ""Podium Pass"" are quite the negative for people trying and playing this game for the first time or returning to the series.

The Podium pass still is a let down that its there.

A lot of people are enjoying  F-1 2020 - I wish I were also.

But all I get are crashes ...

Bought the game after patch 1.05 came out

Crashed right out of the box! Right after intro movie - EGO dumper.
Running Nvidia 1080Ti.

Have tried everything to remedy (I found online - no help from Steam or Codemasters)

Many Nvidia Drivers 

Steam says I have played 1 hour - - but it is just watching the Intro Video and EGO dumper. 

 Too bad I really love F-1 .

If you are lucky and it works on your system - it is probably a good game.

If not - expect hours of frustration - - - with no solution
Judging by online  discussions, many people with good systems are having bad experiences.

From the visuals to the audio down to the gameplay this game is fantastic, compared to 2019 codemasters have shown they can consistently put out yearly releases of F1 games and make it worth the price every. single. year. Let's start with the visuals, F1 2020 has some gorgeous visuals compared to 2019, improved shadows, shaders, and textures are a key part of the beautiful new visuals in the game. The gameplay is super fun, with the new OVERTAKE mode on F1 cars you are able to play more competitive in straits and it makes the competition super fun! The controls appeal to players using a wheel and a controller, F1 2020 is very flexible with controls and anyone can play it!

The new mode (My Team) is very cool and a very awesome addition to the game! Though I do wish there was more customization in regards to livery making, all the liveries seem very bland and doesn't really come off as something an F1 team would put on their cars, and in general I'd love for more customization with things like player number fonts, sponsors, I was thinking to maybe have custom liveries in the steam workshop, that would be cool!

My team has been greatly improved from last year! With a lot of new features, it steps the game up and really feels legitimate, I play it all the time, personally my favorite mode in the game.

I love racing games and the Codemaster F1 series of games so far. I've been buying this series since F1 2011 for what my opinion is worth. There have been good and bad games from Codemasters but on the whole mostly good. This one did not work for me originally and I got a refund from Steam. I was convinced by a fellow F1 fan and player to purchase it again and with a lot of work we were able to fix my issues. The game is as fun as the previous years and offers a couple of new challenges. It feels a lot like F1 2019 but the My Team and ERS aspect are cool add-ons. Graphically it feels similar to last years so you may still want to hold off unless you have to have the new features. There are still some bugs to be worked out but at least Codemasters seem to be working on patching the issues. I will leave my original post below because I feel like they really should have tested it before releasing it especially for the cost.
*Warning The game still does not work for some people. Lots of DX12 and crashing issues* 

Original Post
I have I loaded the game and got the bug where the car and driver are missing with a blank screen, figured out hot to fix it. I started new team mode which I do think is a cool idea. I go through 3 practices, qualifying, and a 29 lap race, only for the game to crash to desktop. I open the game and it wants me to do the race all over again? No way! It did ask me to submit my crash (ego dumper) but I'm not you beta tester Codemasters. I'm just the excited F1 fan who paid $60 for a buggy game. Luckily Steam gave me a refund. I love F1 games but It doesn't look that much better than 2019 and a lot of the cut scenes look pretty much the same. Oh and the paycoin micro transaction thing is kinda lame for the cost. The game might run fine for you but a lot of people are having problems with fixes that sometimes work. I may reconsider it if they fix the issues or I'll wait for a sale.",1594585601,1595529185,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561197967441507,422,5,4745,0,225,1598220671

57,73167228,english,"This one is a pretty comfortable recommend from me. Do you absolutely need it over last year? Not really. But if you're an F1 fan or just a racing game fan - this is (for me) as good as 2016.

The My Team game mode is pretty enjoyable. It's got some kinks to work out but if the devs stick with it - it will (in my opinion) become the big attraction for people to play the F1 series. If you enjoyed Motorsport Manager (or really any of those management sport games) you'll enjoy it. If not - it's just as easy to do regular career modes, or hop into Time Trial and try to climb the leaderboards. Lots of promise for My Team and really excited to see where it goes.

Graphics are, as usual, fantastic - replays are well done and photo mode is very Instagram-like. Sound is good but I could use some more visceral noises from the environment like rumble strips and the like. UI is getting better although having to manage stuff for my season in the loading screens between tracks is still clumsy. AI is mostly fine - although I spent a lot of time playing GRID recently so pretty much anything that didn't block all of my overtakes and/or ram me off the track feels realistic.

The cars feels great this year. Some of the best handling and responsiveness I've seen in a racing game in quite a while. I play with a mix of controller/steering wheel depending on how many ****s I give that day and both work great. Feedback to the driver is very tactile and, much like driving a real car on a track, will give you as much information about what your car is doing as your eyes and ears will. That is, unless you turn on the assists. I know you might feel like you need that crutch but *don't do it*. Maybe TC at Medium to help with standing starts but really that's all I would use. Let yourself make mistakes. If you max out assists, you lose the feeling for the edge of your car's performance because it's always smothered by the computer holding your hand. Embrace the suck.

My biggest gripe with F1 is going to seem a little odd to most people - the Classic F1 cars. As of right now, all classic F1 cars are ranked on the same leaderboards in Time Trial. So the laps I turn in a '88 McLaren are gauged against 2004 Ferraris. That's... really discouraging. I don't think it would be too hard to sort them by chassis but it's been like this for several games in a row now.

Moving forward, I'm really looking forward to what they do with My Team. And I'd like to see some changes to the classic stuff. There are a lot of players out there who would love to see that developed more. Personally, I would like to see any cars past 2004 removed (everyone knows the 2004 Ferrari is going to post the best times anyway) and replace those with cars stretching back further into the 80s and 70s (and maybe farther back?). But more than that I would love to see some of the old tracks. Old Hockenheim. Old Spielberg. There are some really wild courses out there that we will never see cars racing on again - except in video games. The devs have the power to make it happen. And it's not like we need a perfect 1-to-1 Old Spielberg that's scanned in using GPS and whatever technical wizardry they use - just watch some old footage and wing it, it'll be good enough and people will eat it up.",1595519709,1595519718,True,22,1,0.723529398441314697,0,True,False,False,76561197996847131,602,50,1068,0,963,1596416525

This review won't include an incredible amount of depth about the game mechanics in general, because I have covered the other games in different reviews, and this is mostly aimed towards those that have played the previous games and are unsure of whether the $60 price tag is worth the upgrade. F1 2020 is the third of the series I've played, the other two being 2018 and 2019, and I'll immediately start off by saying that it is by far the best, and my favorite of the three. While the overall feel and content of the game is still very obviously a built-upon version of the older Codemasters F1 games, 2020 delivers so many QoL improvements and overall engine upgrades that the feel of the game alone makes it worth buying for fans of the series. 

Firstly, and most importantly, the biggest improvement from 2019 and prior is the feel of how the cars actually drive. I'm not an expert in car physics, but I can certainly say that the general feel and maneuverability of the cars this year is such a vast improvement from the other games; They just feel more responsive, and are more fun to drive. Tire degradation also feels much more ""accurate"" (if you want to use that word), and different tire strategies feel a lot more viable now. Setups seem to make more of a difference in driving styles, and braking in particular feels a lot more responsive, and doesn't have that same ""floaty"" feeling that the older games had. In general, you feel much more connected to the road. 

Another area I love is the reworked ERS system. You no longer have to spend every exit changing your ERS settings, as the deployment has been simplified to a much more realistic ""overtake button"", where the only ERS setting you actively have to use during a race is the singular button. This change is much more akin to the real cars, and makes managing ERS much more newcomer friendly, and in general just feels better to deal with than the previous 5-tier settings. By proxy, this change also puts much more emphasis on changing your fuel settings (which are still: lean, standard and rich), which still provides an area for resource management without being constantly overwhelmed by spending a ton of time in the MFD messing with settings during the race. 

The highlight of the game outside of the driving so far has definitely been the ""My-Team"" career mode. This pseudo-rpg career mode puts you in the seat of a team-owner/driver, as you build up your own Formula 1 team from scratch, and borrows a lot of the old career mode rpg element car upgrades, with added areas of facility upgrades, sponsor management, teammate scouting and livery/team color customizations. As a whole, it basically feels like a more fleshed-out version of the classic career mode, with far more content that will take much longer to grow old than the original ""MyDriver"" career, which is still here, with the added benefit of the option to participate in the 2019 ""scenario"" F2 season, a reduced F2 season, or even a full F2 season as a preamble to joining the paddock of F1. 


[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*] Huge improvement in handling and responsiveness from previous games
[*] Revamped ERS system that is more user-friendly and easier to use
[*] New tracks are a nice change of pace
[*] MyTeam career mode is the most fun and most in-depth single player mode to date
[/list]

[h1]Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*] It is a steep price tag for a game that is at its core, a slightly upgraded version of 2019
[*] Online is still a hit-or-miss experience
[*] The VIP paddock pass (while easy to acquire tokens) is still an obvious micro-transaction scam
[/list]

[h1] Overall Score: 9 [/h1]

If this is your first F1 game, this is 100% worth the cost.

Little about me. I have about 405 combined hours in Codemasters F1 games. Some experience in iracing and assetto corsa and ac competizione. Equipment consists of a Fanatec wheel and pedals.


Handling
For reference most Codemasters F1 titles have had issues with low speed grip and this title is no different. Where Codemasters has improved in is downforce, aero balance, braking, suspension and tyres. Ill go bit more into detail below.

Downforce
Downforce has been increased massively 2019 had nerfed downforce bit too much when reacting to the realworld regulations and we ended up with really understeery and draggy cars. Downforce has been increased massively to account for this while the drag seems to be about same.

Aero balance
Aero had a weird balance during 2019 you often times would go into a highspeed corner with a good entry and mid corner/exit get some rotation on the rear causing you to have to correct or spin out even though you had more rear wing and usually understeered into the entry. This has been mostly fixed. You can carry alot more speed into highspeed in Silverstone for instance.

Braking
In 2019 it was really easy to cause the tyres to lockup the tyres had no inertia which conflated the understeering issue. The tyres now better simulate inertia and won't lock up as much but they might've gone bit too far. Now you usually only lock if you turn with about 60-100% brake force. Braking in a straight line you will start locking up at 1-2 gear with almost 100% braking which is bit nuts. Overall I prefer this over 2019 though.

Suspension
The suspension seems to be really forgiving on kerbs maybe a bit too as you can observe the tyre go up 30cm in a frame then go down without unsettling the car. The overall feel is more predictable though.

Tyres
Seems that the tyres load up better and have slightly more lateral grip you don't slide sideways as much in 2020 as in 2019. Apparently the tyres have been reworked massively but I don't really feel much difference, the preassure now changes dynamically though meaning cold tyres are less inflated and heating them up increases preassures. It would be good to add a tyre preassure screen on the mfd too.

Gameplay aspects
FINALLY A VIRTUAL MIRROR.
My team isn't a total flop, but the liveries are a bit uninspired.
Default setups aren't the same ones as in 2016 and have actually been changed to reflect the changes the game has undergone unlike every other F1 game so far.
Virtual currency, for a premium pass. I do not like this at all it is a worrying direction of more monetization for a 60€ game.
Performance is about the same as last year, still no VR support or real multiscreen support which is a bit dissapointing for a esports title.
Allows for dynamic resolution though which should give smoother framerate on low end machines.

Overall it's a massive improvement on 2019, but that's mostly because 2019 was a huge step backwards.",1595428693,1595428693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198040883286,213,15,3005,171,1881,1601919282

Game full of bugs. Bugs everywhere.
So far with those bugs is hard to play. Game is awesome. But all the time you can get a game crash.
Until they fix the bugs I dont recommend to buy it.

_Connecting to online services (when you are driving!!!!!!!!!!!!)
_My team - Corporate - game crash
_Timetrial crash after defeatingyour opponent

Singleplayer is fine, but it can get tedious, and multiplayer is where the replayability is. There's a bug that loops the ""Communicating with Online Services"" screen, and it can affect drivers mid-race. This alone basically makes multiplayer unplayable. Along with other small bugs, such as the person walking on water in the Australia cutscene, the timing bugs from last game at the start of MP races, and the STILL useless league system, it really just doesn't fly.

It's been two weeks since release, and people have had access to the game for far longer - this really isn't acceptable to have such serious bugs and to not have them be addressed at this point.

60,72969942,english,"As a whole package, F1 2020 is definitely on a new level compared to its predecessors. The cars handling and general driving feel have improved and the game feels a lot more smoother in general. Online multiplayer  also seems to have improved and is way less buggy than 2019. 

Some new game modes like ""Create and manage your own team"" and Splitscreen  have been sorely missed in the previous games and provide a new level of immersion. But this is where I feel some more work can be done. 

Upgrading your cars and facilities still seems a bit straight forward and trivial.  It would also be great to have the option of choosing a specific overall design philosophy for your car where one would  focus on either Aero, chassis, power or reliability. This would then perhaps unlock special upgrades or perks for that upgrade tree. Then the way in which one manages other aspects of the team could all influence how well your philosophy works. 

Customising liveries is still quite restrictive and those that are most appealing must either be unlocked by levelling up in the game, or by purchasing them through micro-transactions. I feel that codemasters could do better to give us full customising abilities, similar to NFS. Get rid of these pre-designed liveries or at least give us the option to design our own. And that's for helmets, drivers suits and gloves too.  I would also like to see some real sponsors in the sport as options for my team.

To end off,  I would 100% recommend F1 2020 to any motor sport enthusiast.

17,72913569,english,"As of right now, I would tell people to hold off on buying this game. There are some bugs that Codemasters clearly need to get worked out. When I first started out, I was really enjoying this game, because the ""My Team"" mode is a lot of fun. I made it through my first two races and then got to my third, which was ""Hanoi."" When i got to the second to last lap, my crew chief would come over the radio and tell me that I need to change to the compound (tires) that I haven't used. That seemed odd to me, because in that race you must use a soft or medium compound, as a mandatory requirement. Well, I started out that race with soft and my pit stop switched them to mediums, to finish out the remainder of the race. The first time, I ignored the crew chief, because he was simply wrong. Then, as soon as I hit the last lap...BOOM...DQ'd. So, I was like ""okay, let's try this again."" So, I restarted the race and when I got to the second to last lap the crew chief came on again, saying the same thing he said last race. I decided to just listen to him and when I came back around, I went into the pit and let them change the tires. Now, everything is fixed, right? NOPE...as soon as I left the pit...BOOM...DQ'd again, for not using the compound. 

I contacted Codemasters and they said something about it being a ""mid-session save"" issue. Well, that was about a week ago and I tried it again, today, with the same result. So, as I said (above), I don't recommend anyone buys this game, until Codemasters figure out the bugs and fix them. Apparently they need better game testers, because this seems like an issue that a blind monkey could have caught. 

I hope the fixes come soon, because when this game is running properly it's actually quite fun to play.

Of course for some hardcore players, it will feel a bit 'arcade'-y, but not really, as many people has said, F1 car is a high downforce machine that is also nimble and can grip well to the track at certain speed, you can't just compare it with your typical GT cars, and if thats what you want, you can get AC or Project Cars to begin with.

Also the rival drivers where right behind me, but the times gives 18 seconds or more.

Pros:
-still best career mode of all simulation racing games
-MyTeam career mode (POGCHAMP)
-very friendly to beginners 
-physics designed with the help of real F1 drivers
-cars feel a lot more predictable 
-great sound and graphics 
-improved AI that behave a lot more natural and make real mistakes from time to time
-cool new car designs and stuff to unlock via basically every race/challenge/time trial
-still a very high skill cap for those who really want to push the top times

cons:
-driving with certain assists can still give you the best times (debatable)
-very simplistic tire model, but its not bad at all as it is
-very limited track evolution (except weather transition)
-still limited car setup options, but you can now change tire pressure per tire instead of front/rear only
-nothing new for multiplayer except technical improvements and car skins
-very high curbs still dont kill you or your car like in real life (e.g. right inner curb at monza's second chicane)
-track limit penalties/warnings on ""strict"" setting are very unfair at some corners if you compare it to the real life racing line that the drivers are allowed to use even if they are behind the white line (e.g. Austria last corner). Sometimes the game will give you a warning, even if you lost time by running wide for example

In itself, its not too bad, the ranked and unranked is still a good idea, but theres a few bugs ive encountered a fair few times, for one when going into a lobby and going to spectate, when the race finished i am met with a black screen and have to Alt + F4 the game, which isnt too bad if it didnt happen every 5 or so rounds, this can also happen after a race, which if you're in ranked mode, decreases your safety rating and skill score, which is annoying as being a clean racer, (well i try to be), and getting left with the ""D"" safety rating, put in lobbies with lots of dirty drivers can get very frustrating and offputting from the game. Theres also the fact that you can get infinetely stuck on the grid, meaning you again, have to exit the game, which im guessing is server sided, that wouldnt be so bad if there also wasnt so many god damn crashes, i can be sitting on the grid, and then itll just crash, i can be traversing menus and itll crash, which, this combined with the other issues can make for an irritating experience, this being said if they do manage to sort these bugs etc, whivh have been in perviopus games as well, the game, both offline and online aspects of it would be very enjoyable.

oh and also split-screen which ive tried a few times, with myself, because yes, seems to work perfectly.

So TL;DR: good game with annoying bugs",1594990859,1594990859,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198975605230,28,1,5119,515,1628,1601662847
96,72839535,english,"I honestly can't say I can recommend this based on my own sim racing experiences.  I love sim racing as a whole, but coming out of sim racing titles with VR support, playing this feels like a massive slog.  Not being able to judge distances and properly watch the road or mirrors has makes it hard to not make mistakes.  

I wanted so badly to enjoy My Team, but with the gameplay feeling like a massive chore to me and the AI happily killing you with zero consequences, I just can't bring myself to enjoy it.

So what about Multiplayer?  Sadly, it's kinda disappointing that nothing has really changed.  1-shot qualifying with track limit scrutineering that'll disqualify your lap if you so much as let a marble land on the lines.  I've never seen so many disqualified laps just from spectating alone.  In a lobby of 12 people, maybe 3-4 would make a lap.  I'll make a turn normally and my wheel will go onto the curb(as most racing lines would normally have you do) only to have the game go ""NOPE INVALIDATED!""

83,72757171,english,"Probably one of the best handling models they've done so far. I use Logitech G29 and the car feels much better and the brakes are much more balanced than the other games which is amazing. 

The AI behaviour has improved massively as now they can crash and retire much more often.

There're still some car liveries that needs to be replaced such as black merc but i'm sure they'll do it in time as codies work really hard.

The amount of MyTeam & Multiplayer liveries is poor unlike the liveries we know in the previous games. Even tho there is a season pass it still feels poor sorry codies but i like them ngl.

The engine sounds and gear shift sounds are much better than the last years game.

The MSC Edition is definitely worth as you can play as The Legend himself and you can drive his previous cars. One thing that annoys me that the oldest historic car is '88 Mclaren. The fact that old Lotus, Ferrari cars are not available at this game kinda sucks.

The ERS system has been much complicated since the new era but what they've done at this game is a huge improvment as they added the overtake button which kinda feels more realistic as we hear on the team radio's.

The F2 journey to F1 Career path is quite fun but it the fact that i can go to a top tier team at my first year in F1 is kinda unrealistic to me and i'd be much more happy if i'd only have limited contracts and i wouldn't be the one who chooses them but to be the chosen person but it's still really fun.

And of course i must comment about the fact that you can literally get the legend, the myth Mahaveer Raghunathan and make him a 10 time world champion. 

The Casual and Standard gamemode's create a huge enjoyment for both the people who wants to challenge themselves and the people who just want to enjoy driving a F1 car. Fuel, steering etc. assists were really something some people needed a lot as they just wanted to enjoy the car or to people who drive with a keyboard which is really hard to operate the car.

I'd really want to play it much more often if i could have the time cuz i'm telling you the game is amazing but just like every amazing thing, it can be better and it can get improved a lot. A huge shoutout to Codies as they've done an amazing game for us to enjoy.

Racing online is like a russian roulette. You take a chance in every lobby and pray that you won't eat the bullet, that's divebombing the first corner like a japanese pilot seeing a U.S. Navy ship outside of Pearl Harbor. 
I have no idea why i'm coming back for more in this game, maybe it's the adrenaline rush of avoiding the said pilot or a little hope of Codemasters honoring their name ""CoDeMastER"" and actually implement a fix. Anyway by judging of the 2019 game, I won't have my hopes up.

44,72699252,english,"Alrighty, well, here we are again - another year, another Codemasters F1 game. 
There is good and bad here if you'll hear me out. 

I'll cut to the chase and say that on the whole its probably one of - if not the - best / most complete F1 games of the past decade and caters to a wide range of engagement; whether you're just interested in a more simple style of racing because you think F1 is cool, or if you like to go all in with no assists and full length weekends etc. 
The standard fare of modes remain, time trial, challenges, online - along with a returning collection of classic cars and F2 to make use of. 
The driving model has been tweaked since '19 and I'd say does offer a better experience across the board. 
The big selling point is obviously the ""My Team"" bit, and if you enjoyed any of the manager style games of F1's own mobile game it has cherry picked enough features to give an accessible but appropriately challenging management aspect alongside the standard career mode. 

Now, this is going to sound really picky but I think at this point (seeing as the main chunks of the game is only tweaked from year to year) we really should be holding Codemasters to a higher standard, and as good as the bulk of F1 2020 is, I can't help but feel they've got away with cutting some real noticeable corners here out of nothing more than laziness and because they alone hold the license for F1 games. 

F1 cars changed to a wider rear wing a few years ago now, and in the past three games, Codemasters still hasn't adjusted the pit crew motion capture to account for this (character clips his hands through the body to the narrower position). 
A lot of you might say this is incredibly niche and generally not noticed, but I'd say it shows a real lack of effort behind the flashy marketing of any new features. 
To the same effect, while the team and car customisation is good and wider in scope than previous games, its actually limited in key areas that feel they should be easy to implement and slightly sour the overall experience. 
Driver number style and colour on the car - seemingly tied to overall design preset, not individually customisable; steering wheel - not seemingly customisable (again, sure you can turn it off or you shouldn't be looking at it, but it is front and centre in the car if you play cockpit view and would be nice to select from 3-4 designs?). 

If you like F1, from novice to seasoned racer its probably worth playing - its the best upgrade in several years.

The pit pass had me wary at first, but with just 35 hours in I'm already almost done with it. I don't really care about cosmetics in this game as I play cockpit and you can really only make other folks tail lights look so cool to me. That being said, there are some really neat liveries you can only earn by completing challenges within the game, so that was nice to see.

96,72658473,english,"The Codemasters Official Formula One games have been getting better and better each year and I must say F1 2020 Is no exception to this and belongs right onto this list.

SYNOPSIS??? IDK WHAT DO THEY CALL THIS? A BY-LINE?:
F1 2020 Add a whole load of new features some re-created for the new MyTeam Career game mode that is so close to being perfect but as a new game mode into the series is absolutely fantastic and we'll mostly talk about it but first;

HANDLING:
From F1 2019 to F1 2020 The game's handling model feels so much better, F1 2019 had this weird thing where the cars would feel incredibly light and you would often spin far too much because not enough information was given to where you could correct yourself in time, in F1 2020 The cars have a more weighted feel and more information is given through in my case a Racing Wheel. At the time the only complaint I have is that the cars don't translate tyre information at all this was also seen in the last two games, F1 2019 & F1 2018.

FORMULA 2:
In F1 2019 I absolutely hated the F2 Feeder series for the career let alone the F2 Cars themselves and mwah in F1 2020 They are soooooooooooooo much better and so much more fun to drive as like stated before these cars actually have weight to them and are actually controllable I might even end up doing a full F2 Season whenever I start my Driver Career which probably wont happen because of the addition of MyTeam : / but still a wonderful upgrade since F1 2019.

THE NEW CIRCUITS:
Before we head towards my favourite addition to the game we should address the ""Elephant"" in the room, the addition of the two new circuits, Hanoi The Vietnamese Grand Prix and Zanvoort the Dutch/Netherlands/Verstappen Grand Prix.

HANOI:
Let's get Hanoi over with first shall we,Starting as the 3rd race in the calendar is a pretty big problem for those who didn't develop Aero upgrades in their MyTeam Career which we'll talk about in a bit.Hanoi overall, is a lazy piece of shit of a circuit with a mild enjoyment in the Esses during Sector 3 before you make those dreadful last two corners that you'll never make it around without nailing you front wing or the bloke ahead into the walls.I'm someone who thoroughly enjoys Monaco, Sochi and Kinda Baku (Castle is scary as fuck man) as street circuits but circuits in general to race on but Hanoi is designed in the laziest way possible with the idea it'll improve overtaking, yeah right.All you need to recreate Hanoi is You grab A reallllllllly long straight and two asymetrical-eliptically-chicane squashed roundabouts with a wiggly bit with fuck all runoff and call it a day, racing around the track very difficult and if you enjoy the circuit, I fucken congratulate you man but honestly not a welcomed addition to the Formula One Calendar.
ACTUALLY IT'S SO HORRIBLE IN FACT LATIFI WAS LAPPING FASTER THAN I WAS AND LAPPING AI RAN ME INTO THE WALLS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FUCKING CLOSE TO THE TRACK YOU CAN DO ANYTHING TO SAVE YOURSELF AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....

ZANDVOORT:
Zandvoort is a beautiful addition to the Formula One calendar and Game with it of course being resurfaced to suit those needs. When I first heard of it's announcement I was skeptical on how it'll perform as a racing circuit for Formula One but honestly it's such a fun free flowing circuit, now we havn't seen it live yet because of stupid virus but so far in game it's pure fun that even at a 50% race distance I wanted more of the circuit as it's completely possible to overtake and battle with other players and AI.The pitlane I will admit is sketchy but if you slam on the brakes and turn on Pit Limiter as the dividing wall comes up you'll make the speed limit with 5-10Kmh to spare... except that one time I flew into the diving wall, sorry to those who's lobby I was in lmao : /...Overall, A welcomed introduction into the Formula One Calendar.Just can we have Hockenheim Ring back pls and if Codies are willing to add Mugello

MYTEAM CAREER GAMEMODE:
Now for MyTeam, MyTeam is fucking fantastic for a new game mode, it's amazing and it pretty much makes sense to have in an F1 Title, a sport where everything is dictated by team growth, management, Research and Development and so much more, the MyTeam Career game mode translates this incredibly well and extends on the RnD Features that have been expanding upon since F1 2016 Where it was first introduced at it's minuscule scale.
The ability to manage everything from your RnD Departments all the way to your Team Mates which can include Lord Raghunathan Mahaveer, you get to pick your engine suppliers from Merc, Renault, Ferrari and Honda which adds to the realism of the MyTeam Career.
As a sidenote, I have not touched the Driver Career you but you do get the options of Skipping or Running a Full, Half, Quarter F2 Season before you start in F1.

MYTEAM DRIVER MARKET:
I will say this, the driver market has its flaws but pretty much works as you expect it, drivers exist in the market and you can hire them when your current driver's contract expires which is beautiful however and i'll state this later on there needs to be a larger driver pool because we only have access to F1, F2 and Lord Mahaveer Raghunathan i'd personally like to see Ex-F1 drivers and maybe even the fictional driver you see whenever you use AI in a Multiplayer/Classic Car Lobby.

VEHICLE VISUAL APPEARANCE:
Something that had never crossed my mind but the more I think about it the more it makes sense, a game like Formula One needs some way of customising your Formula One cars or at least have the ability to dynamically alter the appearance of the vehicle dependant of your RnD tree this is sort of one of those minor details that'd make the game far more immersive I suppose but for multiplayer purposes a full customisation kit would be outstanding, would also make it so all the cars didn't look like a HAAS or Ferrari...

SEASON LENGTH (BOTH MYTEAM AND DRIVER):
So at the moment we have access to Preset season where we can add and remove desired races however I and a few other find that to be too limiting and really the best way they could've made the season system is exactly how they have it for Multiplayer Leagues and Singleplayer Grand Prix events where you have complete control of the entire season up to 42 Races I believe, don't quote me on that... And with that being said there should be the ability to create a new list of tracks each season during your career so if you wanted to you can recreate this current real 2020 season with several double headers and what not and by the time you finish that season you jump back into the full 22 race calendar.

RECOMMENDATIONS/THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE IN FUTURE UPDATES/GAMES:
The things I would either like to see in next years game or in a future update mostly relate to the MyTeam Career, or they all relate to the MyTeam Career.

Something for the Driver Market that would be neat is the ability to hire Ex-Formula One Drivers as we have seen as of recently that Alonso is returning to Renault next year and I would personally like the ability to hire someone like Jenson Button or even Mika Hakkinen.
It would be nice to also see those fictional AI Drivers seen in Multiplayer/Classic Car drivers show up in the Driver Market too.

Another thing would be the addition that each 2 or 3 seasons a new randomly generated team joins, maybe comes up from the F2 Feeder series or is just a completely new team, idk I just think that'd be neat.

Something to turn the MyTeam into maybe a more Hardcore experience is the ability for the player to manufacture their own power units and maybe eventually be able to sell them off to other teams.

As stated way above vehicle appearance weather purposeful or dynamic would be a really logical and quality of life addition to the game.

Overall, Would 100% Suggest and Recommend F1 2020 To anyone weather they have owned a previous F1 Title or not.",1594706809,1594727758,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561198171956669,235,18,8603,587,2521,1601294347

The MY TEAM mode: It's the big new thing in the game. The upgrades and options are cool, you will probably get a kick out of it, but the customisation options are completely underwhelming. The sponsor placements, the liveries, the race suit options... no matter what you do, at the end of the day your team will look like a cheap knock-off from an unlicensed racing game. It really stands out amongst the field, but not in a positive way. I'm playing it to have some fun, but the regular Driver career (starting with the full F2 season) is much more engaging imo.

In terms of content, F1 2020 packs a lot, a LOT. the tracks are great, including the additions from this year's season that never came to be. Zandvoort in particular is a rollercoaster. The cars also look great, the classics are still there (although the models from the 70s and 80s were removed, sadly), and the game still offers weekly challenges, pre-made championships and two career modes. There's a lot to do.

Gameplay improvements are noticeable, but my main highlight is the sound. The game sounds amazing, and they added many more interesting little details on the soundscape. It definitely seems like the sound folks were the ones who worked the hardest in this year's iteration.

There are bugs, there are typos and the career mode could definitely do with a lot more. Codemasters really has to step up the game in several fronts, but having played the game like crazy since the pre-release, I think it shows I'm having fun.

Oh, the Podium Pass thing, don't bother. It's a set of weekly challenges and a XP system to unlock customisation goodies. You don't need to spend money on it, not at all, just go and enjoy some good racing/",1594658094,1594658094,True,6,1,0.59301912784576416,0,True,False,False,76561198042406646,128,18,11269,628,1436,1601855211
56,72628386,english,"[b]Summary[/b]
What can I say, coming from previous iterations of F1 games this by far, is the most developed, detailed and rewarding edition thus far. If you love F1 the new My Team mode is a enthralling addition, fighting your way with the Williams during your first races to the mid-field battles (this is as far as I have made it so far) has to be the most compelling reason to buy as a fan of the sport.

It is a strong recommendation for racing game fans and F1 enthusiasts without question, just don't jump into it expecting iRacing levels of accuracy or Grid first to last races.

[b]The not so great[/b]
It isn't all perfect though, there are bugs (thankfully no crashing this year), do not disconnect your controller at any point with the game open or you controller settings will reset to the default, forcing you to enable another profile, then enable your custom one. Others are related to face LOD's not loading in right away on close ups, or blurring of background drivers going haywire/flashing or just not rendering correctly.

Balancing of upgrades can seem quite broken, I currently have quite a few engine upgrades for the ERS systems and you can quite often just breeze past much faster teams and then hold them behind as they cannot overtake even with DRS. 

The AI is very very racey and that is great but performance on some tracks can vary wildly depending on the difficulty - I have spent most of my time with it set to 90 -105 depending on the track and game mode and can outperform my teammate by about 0.2 and 1.2 seconds in qualifying sessions.

Graphics performance is a strange one, most tracks run excellently with 21 other AI cars, but some like Austria's T7-T8 run up the hill have massive dips, even on my 3900X 1080Ti rig. I do not play with dynamic resolution modes enabled however and this will resolve the issues for most.",1594657453,1594657453,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198099963068,607,1,3995,0,1036,1598526731

Just to get it out of the way, for reference, I'm currently ranked gold in multiplayer, (I don't really do TT except to make a setup) but rank top 1000 on all circuits when I get to them, 105% AI is about perfect for me, I use a T300RS GT with no assists, and have been playing since F1 2010 (unless you count F1 1998 on PS1)... But yeah this is a long one. 

[b]TL;DR it's a step in the right direction, but many things that make this game infuriating are still there.[/b]

[b]Things that were improved that I like:[/b]
[olist]
    [*] Handling seems fine, a bit more planted. Can't downshift into a super low gear to get absurd amounts of ""extra rotation."" Although I will miss hearing JD say that, and that was my driving style from 2014 all the way through 2019. I prefer it this way now though, seems much more realistic and down shifting for a split second is no longer a safety net when overshooting the corner.
    [*] Can utilize 100% brake pressure with no force feedback pedals. No longer are people who run ABS able to just run 100% brake pressure and out brake you every time.
    [*] MyTeam is a nice addition, I don't really see a reason to play Career mode anymore unless you want to start with a specific team.
    [*] Finally starting to implement better track limits. It's a bit inconsistent atm, but hopefully they fix this. I would like to see the track limits be extended the same way they are irl. For example, the track limit should be extended to the outside of the red/white curbs on tracks like Redbull Ring (Austria).
    [*] I like not having to constantly change ERS for every corner and exit. The push to pass is a good addition, but I really really wish you could change it from toggling to on while pressed. 
[/olist]

[b]Neutral things I have noticed:[/b]
[olist]
    [*] Much harder to lock the brakes with no ABS now. I don't know if this is more realistic, or just made to be easier. If it's the latter, then this is a negative in my book.
    [*] Can 't change gear in pit lane. I personally would like to leave the pit lane in 2nd gear.
    [*] You can still brake while straddling the outside curb (for example Spain T1, left wheels on the left side of the curb, right wheels on the track). Because it's consistent I guess it's OK and you just get used to it, but I personally don't like the idea of having braking zones where you can unrealistically widen the track because there's magically grip off the racing line.
[/olist]

[b]Things that absolutely drive me up the wall:[/b]
[olist]
    [*] Why is it possible to accidentally shift into neutral still? Why is neutral even in the game besides when you're sitting on the grid (you never need to use neutral yourself, ever).
    [*] Still sometimes get black screen when a multiplayer session is over and you are returning to lobby. You have to cntrl+alt+del and restart. Sometimes it happens after the podium, and before the game awards you XP, nullifying the entire race you just did.
    [*] There's still for some unknown reason a ""pre-qualifying intro video"" between the lobby starting and qualifying for multiplayer. Everyone readies up, then you wait for everyone to load, then this stupid intro video plays that everyone skips, then you have to wait for everyone to load again before going to qualifying. WHY IS THERE A STUPID VIDEO AT ALL!?
    [*] If you lose connection to a multiplayer race, but are still in game, the screen gets smoked (really dark) and in the middle of the screen the text ""RECONNECTING TO GAME"" (or something like that) pops up, BUT YOU STILL HAVE CONTROL OF THE CAR! So you just have to hope you can drive without being able to see until you reconnect. It's absolutely absurd.
    [*] You get so many warnings before an actual warning is counted toward the 3 you get before a penalty pertaining to track limits. I don't understand at all. It's like warnings for warnings? You can abuse track limits and never actually get a penalty in ranked multiplayer.
    [*] The Career/MyTeam qualifying pace practice program time is absolutely horrendously difficult. With 105% AI in my first race in Australia (so no upgrades) I was over 0.600 seconds off the qualifying program. But finished 6th in the actual race? Actual race pace and the qualifying practice program time do not correlate in the slightest. 
    [*] For the competitions or ranked play, you should be penalized more for using assists. ie, winning a ranked 5 lap race should not gain a driver using assists the same XP as someone who wins a ranked 5 lap race without assists. 
    [*] Flying lap still molests your tires way too much over driving out yourself. Bahrain, for example, will wear your qualifying tires to about 6% by the time you get control to start your lap. Do the out lap yourself and you can begin your lap with only 1-2% wear.
    [*] Need a way to communicate on PC. Most people mute mics. I need to be able to type messages to the lobby. You should still have the option to mute or language filter, but every ""racing incident"" leaves one or both parties confused on what exactly happened. Or if someone purposely is driving you into the wall to stop you from overtaking, I should be able to make it known in the lobby what happened so we can vote kick.
    [*] Online ""safety rating"" has been a cool idea, but it's completely broken. You can get pole, lead the entire race and win, and still lose safety rating. It makes so sense.
    [*] Edit/view car setup button doesn't need to be its own button. Why can't I bind it to a button like, pit/DRS? I obviously have no use for that button while sitting in the garage... Right now it's stuck bound to ""L2"" or button 11 which is on the base of my steering wheel.

Everything else is basically the same or not worth mentioning. I have a lot of negatives, but there are still more pros to this game than the negatives I listed. It's just not worth it to list out every positive that carried over from previous versions. As you can see, I still recommend this game, and I think it's extremely fun.

76,72569378,english,"[h1]Codemasters does it again, and even better![/h1]
[h2]A new F1 fan's perspective on the game and why he thinks you should buy it[/h2]
[h3][i]By: StrawHat[/i][/h3]

[h2]Why I bought it[/h2]
F1 2019 had a great impact on my life, as I've stated on that game's review I wrote, and, in short, it not only deepened my newfound love for the sport, but it also made it possible for me to reconnect with my father on that special sports-loving kind of way. Again, Codemasters, thank you dearly. This drove me to purchase this game basically one day after it's launch.

[h2]Why (I think) you should buy it:[/h2]
When it comes to racing games, a lot of people prefer the more arcade-y style. Games like Need for Speed, RedOut, etc. Games with a lot of flamboyance and sometimes deep mechanics. F1, however, is a completely different beast... Or is it?

Sincerely, one of the things I love most about this series of games is that it gives you, the player, the tools to craft a unique experience suited for your playstyle. You can make it as arcade-like or as real-life-simulation as you want, and this is a feature I think a lot more games should implement. 

And then someone comes and says:
[i]But why F1? It sounds and seems so... boring, so risk-free. There's no traffic, The tracks themselves are contained, controlled spaces. There's no feeling of, y'know, ""rush""[/i] 

I've heard something along those lines countless times, and it is a wrong affirmation. While yes, there is no traffic or illegal aspects to F1 racing, it is the most dangerous of all, in my eyes.

First of all, these games have no rubber-banding. The AI won't simply b*llsh*t you out of a win because the devs thought it would make the game more ""thrilling"". No, you have your car, your opponents have theirs, may the best horse with the best horseman win. No BS. Pure and simple racing.

Second: Not only there is a ""rush"", but the tension and the pressure can sometimes feel bizarrely intense. I didn't realise this until I was in the middle of the pack in Monaco trying to not hit anyone while at 300kph in a COMMON STREET. Sometimes it can feel as if there's no room for breath, because there isn't. Mistakes will be severely punished, yes, and there's even a replay feature that allows you to flashback to any point you want within that replay so you can re-do whatever screwed you voer. It's a great tool for learning the ins and outs of driving these machines, and OH BOY does it feel good.


[h2]F1 2020 vs F1 2019[/h2]
F1 2020 is a very impressive improvement on 2019's mechanics, visuals and so on and so forth. Regarding what is, well, the same as last year's iteration of this game, I felt it was all improved in one way or another.

What they added, though, is realy special. My team mode is a blast, and I have a feeling i'll play that most of the time. If you can't be bothered with management, though, carreer is still there, still as great as ever.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
So, yeah, you should buy it. Not only because it's a great game and Codemasters did a hell of a job yet again, but to experience the amazing feeling that is partakin in the Formula 1 sport.

98,72552199,english,"In terms of rankings:
1.) Driving an actual F1 car
2.) F1 2020
3.) F1 2019

The ERS management is a tonne simpler now, you just have a big fat button labelled ""OVERTAKE"" to turn it up for extra power. It's actually good now too, adds like 20 mph to the top speed even on a low end car.

They update the drivers now based on their real world performances, you get an in-game message saying ""Driver stats have been updated"" and a button you can push to apply it to your current save (by default it only affects new saves).

It's got two new tracks, but the previous tracks remain largely unchanged aside from some changes to the suggested driving line. 

Additionally some of the 2019 kinks are ironed out, such as the weird pit lane entry if you had Pit Assist on, which is now significantly smoother. The AI is a bunch smarter, and will overtake you in some pretty clever ways. in 2019, the AI cars had set pace times, which would decay overtime based on tire wear (as opposed to having to actually drive, it was like they were scalextric cars stuck to the driving line). Now, they seem to have to drive under the same physics system you do, subject to lock ups and occasionally running wide when the conditions get a bit weird. In 2019, the Safety Car was basically a mythical creature - this time it actually shows up. You can make your own team now, with your own livery and second driver (it's usually some obscure GP3 or old F2 driver)

2020 has its own issues, the practice program times are absolutely absurd compared to the difficult and incredibly hard to hit early on. This does however seem to level off once you get going with upgrades to your car. Also, the cars aren't hugely in tune with their real life counterparts, and the starting grid is basically always Merc-Merc, Ferrari - Ferrari, Red Bull, Red Bull, etc.

21,72538694,english,"A few months ago I criticised F1 2019 for lacking some quality of life features you'd usually expect out of an F1 Game. And whilst we didn't get livery changes or helmet sponsors (smaller features in themselves) I think none of us expected MyTeam be this game's headline feature. Before the announcement of MyTeam it might've been sensible to predict F1 2020 would be an addon to F1 2019 as DLC, since there was nothing really special about the 2020 season itself. However, we got surprised to by far the most fun and entertaining gamemode in any F1 game, and is perhaps up there with some other great racing games modes as well.

MyTeam gives you the opportunity to create your own, personal dream team in the world of Formula 1, becoming the 11th team on the grid. It is your job to manage finances, fund development, find a suitable teammate, manage time and activities, manage facilities and most importantly of all: drive the car itself. The initial livery selection is rather slim and disappointing, but hopefully the next generation of content will allow for more in-depth creation. With the 'podium pass' (more on that later) you can unlock more liveries which are more visually appealing to you. You're also tasked with making a team badge, selecting team branding colours and making your race suits. Money is mainly gained through sponsors which you put on the car and race suits. The way you spend your money is completely up to you: want a top-of-the-line teammate? Cash out on a top tier driver. Want your car to get to the top as soon as possible? Focus on building your facilities. The same R&D system we know is still in game, and the build speed, quality and quantity is all managed by the respective department for that part. There's a lot of complexity to MyTeam that I can't explain in a review, so if you get the game do look into it more.

The handling model on this game feels a lot better than F1 2019 as well. With the input of real F1 drivers thanks to the virtual Grand Prix series, we finally have a slight indication as to how a Formula 1 car may feel. You can generally go onto the accelerator earlier and have more confidence putting the foot down, and the same applies for breaking and putting the breaks on later. Wet weather driving has become a lot easier to acclimate to easily, rather than having to guess breaking points like in previous games. I wouldn't say overall the game is easier, since the challenge of driving an F1 car will never be easy, even in the virtual world. But the small tweaks that the game has had have really separated this game from the rest and makes it my personal favourite by far. I've sunk nearly 70 hours into the game and I do not regret the purchase at all.

A controversial addition to this years game was the Podium Pass, a season-based system where level up to gain access to more liveries, poses, emotes and more. You can also pay ""PitCoin"" to level up, this doesn't affect your XP but does allow you to unlock the cosmetics you want. As you may have expected, PitCoins are gained by paying real life money, at least for the people who didn't pre-order, instead those who pre-ordered get a 15000 PitCoin bonus at the start. The Podium Pass VIP package allows you to get more bonus content from levelling up, alongside VIP challenges - this costs 9000 Pitcoin. There are also standard and series challenges you can complete, and all challenges give you some sort amount of XP to gain more levels. However the saving grace for the Podium pass is the fact that if you grind enough, it is actually possible to get enough PitCoin by levelling up to pay for the next season. My take on paying real life money to get features in already paid game is its own story, but I do like the approach Codemasters took to implementing this.

Every game has its bugs, so if you're still on the fence about getting this game I'd recommend waiting a couple of weeks for most of the bugs to get ironed out. If you're making a decision to get it right now, I think it's worth a shot. Don't expect a flawless experience straight away, the game is still in its early days but we should see a performance patch and numerous bug fixes over the coming days. If it ain't your cup of tea, the steam refund system is always a thing - just don't play over 2 hours and your money is guaranteed to be back.

27,72413520,english,"Leaping to this game from its 2019 predecessor feels like 2 steps forward and 0 steps back. The regulated engine audio on this game no longer sounds like your average muffled kettle, but rather something aggressive for once, with different engine pitches and sounds at different RPM's.

A major issue right from the get-go for this game is the controller vs wheel debate that’s been sprung around since the release of this game. A YouTuber by the name of TRL Limitless has brought up this issue by summarising that the controller is more favoured on this game as it has “in-built” traction control compared to the wheel where you get no sense of the traction through the pedals and instead through the reliability of the force feedback in your wheel, whereas compared to the controller you get a sense of traction through the trigger rumbles and can accurately pinpoint when to go full throttle and when not to.

The new ""My Team"" feature added into this year's game sounds amazing on paper, and it is, but you're quite limited as to what you can play around with regarding how your car looks. For starters, you're given the standard FIA issued 2020 Formula 1 car, meaning you can't really tinker around with different body parts such as the front nose or the rear wing, meaning you're somewhat stuck with a car that closely resembles the Alpha Tauri. In addition to that, there's not much choice regarding the livery / sponsorship deals you can customise your preset car with. All in all, your car colours will definitely resemble something out of a 2010 flash game, rather than the real cars you compete against. Credit to Codies though, they did as much as they could to give you as much free will as possible without breaking any sponsorship deals that would require being put on a ""non-existing"" car. Regardless of these flaws, the new career mode is amazing as it gives you a true sense of racing in your own team; and the fact that you have to work your way up with what you have sounds like a more achievable dream compared to getting a free seat to a Mercedes W11.

The graphics on this game look astonishing with better lighting, FXAA, and general details compared to the previous game. In addition, the photo mode now supports a feature to take ""super resolution"" pictures, 9 times the current resolution you run in game. For example, because I run the game in native 3840 x 2160, I can take high quality images with a resolution of 11520 x 6480, as shown in the following photos:

Make sure to zoom in and see the details for yourself!

About the game in general though, the AI has been completely ramped up from the previous game; no longer is Hamilton the ""OP AI"" that leads the pack by a margin of 10+ seconds, but all of them got a general buff, relative to as they should be performing IRL this year (e.g. Albon, Leclerc, Bottas, etc.). As a general difficulty recommendation, 2019's 100% AI is somewhat comparable to 2020's 95% AI. I recommend using those figures to find out your suitable difficulty; the difficulty I commonly use is somewhere around 93-95 and I've barely skimmed over 10 hours on this game, as of writing the original review. 

However, a big issue for me is the exaggeration of dirty air on this game, something that the AI can visibly easily cope with. Following closely behind a car on a circuit with the combinations of ""flat out"" turns and turns that require the perfect braking + racing line such as Silverstone is damn near impossible as there's a high chance you lose traction as well as grip on the exits of turns due to said dirty air.

The new ERS mode is somewhat a debatable overhaul; there is no option to turn it off completely to recharge your batteries relatively quicker but it is a very useful feature as you can now maximise your engine power with one button rather than having to scroll through the MFD mid corner as you would in the last game. The new ERS mode also depletes incredibly quickly, so you have to carefully think about when to use it and if it's worth using it to defend an attacking opponent from behind or if you want to set the fastest lap in a race. However, because there is no way to turn it completely off, it is nearly impossible to save ERS on some tracks even when avoiding the overtake mode. For example, on Zandvoort, each lap saves a very minor amount of ERS compared to different tracks like Spielberg, where the combination of DRS and minor ERS can save a more significant amount of ERS.

After a couple of updates on this game, microtransactions have been added similar to how a “battle pass” would work on your modern shooters. Activate this so-called “battle pass” with your purchasable currency and you have access to working your XP up to unlock more varied and appealing liveries for your your “My Team” / Multiplayer car, driver cosmetics, podium poses and whatnot. These cosmetics don’t affect the essence of the game in any way whatsoever but you be the judge of whether you appreciate the fact that a triple-A game has microtransactions regarding the customisation of an F1 car and its driver. 

Despite the ""negativities"" I've pointed out above, these ""negativities"" make the game lean more towards the simulation side of things rather than last year's sim-cade formula, as everything is in general much more challenging compared to last year.

To summarise, this is a fantastic game I can see spending the majority of my time on this year, cheers Codies.

38,72528497,english,"F1 2020 provides an improvement over the previous games in the franchise, notably the accessibility options, 'My Team' mode, and the car handling to a lesser extent. With that being said, at time of writing it is still buggy, and is more or less crashing about as much as Grosjean does on a typical race weekend. 

The main question comes down to whether it is worth the £45 price tag. My answer to that is that it depends. If you're a fan of F1 and have enjoyed previous games in the franchise, then I think this is a reasonably safe purchase for you. On the other hand, if you don't fit that criteria, then justifying the price tag is a bit more of a struggle, but, this game offers more accessibility options than ever to help inexperienced and newer players at the start of the game.

[u] Advantages: [/u]
- Greater accessibility options than ever before which is great for people like me, who could hardly be described as being particularly talented at driving virtual F1 cars 
- The 'My Team' mode adds an interesting dynamic to the game, and makes you feel more personally connected to the career mode. (The traditional career mode still exists if that's your thing)
- The cars just feel a bit better this year, I don't know quite how best to describe this, but I just feel a bit more 'connected' to the car
- The graphics are looking as good as ever, and the performance is good even on my somewhat mediocre PC
- The new tracks are well executed
- The ERS has been simplified to an overtake button, instead of constantly having to micro-manage it. To me this is a significant improvement, and makes the game more accessible

[u] Disadvantages: [/u]
- Still quite buggy, I'm sure most of these will be fixed in the 'Day 1' patch. In about 6 hours of game time my game has crashed about 6 times
- The 'pit coins' micro-transaction thing, really? I'm pretty sure this only gives you appearance stuff, but still this game is already £45 as it is
- The AI still feels a bit ropey in places, especially in wheel-to-wheel battles, but it does feel like they've improved a bit since 2019. 

[u] Is it worth it? [/u]

Also Force Feedback (I have a Thrustmaster T300) is a bit worse (I don't think it's bad at all, but compared to F1 2019 you feel a bit less front tyres grip).
The only real improvement of F1 2020 is the fact that finally you have the overtake button instead of that crazy ERS management system and slipstrem effect has been reduced (it was overpowered), but that's enough to justify the buy and I also think that if I where to chose to buy F1 2019 or F1 2020 even for the same price I would  go for the first one.",1594482948,1594482948,False,4,0,0.437086105346679688,0,True,False,False,76561197978589615,405,12,2543,841,148,1601839592

They also improved the handling of the car (downforce and throttle). Especially in wet weather I feel much more comfortable on the throttle (without any traction control turned on).

- Repolished career
- Obviously the new My Team
- Gamepad handles good, maybe a little too good
- Podium Pass which you can earn customization items in tier levels by playing the dang game, honestly a good feature

- Solid AI racecraft

cons
- AI sometimes are unrealistically too fast on straights (eg. F2 AI on 100%+)
- AI keeps getting bonked down on their second phase of race starts compared to player
- Classic car contents are sort of pointless aside from the few events, again
- Multiplayer experience and netcode are still a bit janky
- Random FPS drops here and there

I have been playing F1 2018 to get a feel for the franchise so I thought I would buy this game in the hopes it wasnt just a copy and paste like Nascar Heat 5  

🌟🌟🌟🌟Graphics🌟🌟🌟🌟
There have been some major improvements on graphics and with the current line of cars from the 2020 season the whole game looks 
amazing 

🌟🌟🌟🌟Gameplay🌟🌟🌟🌟
This is the part that was a big win for me for the first time they have added a team creation mode and ill have to say it feels like you are in charge of a new F1 team you have to balance money from sponsors R&D and driver contracts its all here and its brilliant. The car feels really well done when driving and you can tune the difficulty to your skills definitely an improvement

I think this will be a game I will be playing for quite a long time the team creation section lasts for ten seasons thats ten seasons you have to catch up to the major teams I will definitely be playing this one for a while

19,72489496,english,"F1 2020 definitely seems like another good step in the right direction for the F1 games. Codemasters have made a good few improvements since 2019's game:

[b]Driving[/b]
When it comes to actually driving, I'd say the handling model has received improvements. The ERS system has been changed to more accurately reflect how the drivers control the battery in real life (based on real drivers' feedback). Importantly for non-multiplayer players, the AI seems much smarter this year, and much less likely to drive into you - provided you have a basic understanding of how to race them wheel-to-wheel.

[b]Features[/b]
The MyTeam mode gives Motorsport-Manager-like team control, while letting you still drive similar to career mode. The addition of a full Formula 2 season pre-F1 career is something I've long awaited personally. Multiplayer split-screen also returns - particularly with the addition of casual racing settings, it does seem like there's pretty much something for everyone.

It goes without saying that the game still has a handful or so of bugs, and it's still not quite an F1 sim experience, but I personally believe that this is the strongest F1 game there's been in a good few years.

So I have managed to stabilise F1 2020 on my PC so it's as rock solid as F12019.  I had to force it to Direct X 11 mode, and also make sure that my Logitech G29 steering wheel is connected *before* I turn my computer on, failure to do this will result in it ignoring my maximum wheel rotation settings.  I don't know what I'm missing from being in DirectX 11 mode exactly, but I'm getting high 90's FPS in UW4K so it's all good for me.

Anyway, I managed to have good session without any crashes, and although there are obvious bugs and annoyances that existed in the previous version, it's a great game and highly recommended.  Just be cautious that you might have crashes and wheel related issues that might need some tweaks.


Previous Review:

So far have played for around 100 minutes, it's crashed completely 4 times with an error reporting dialog appearing on the screen, shutdown my PC once. And totally messed with my steering wheel at one point that I couldn't even open the game until I powered it off and on again, even though the Logitech driver software was reporting everything working fine.

Disappointed, yes. Can't recommend until it works well enough to do time trial on a single circuit without it crashing.",1594400986,1594458128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198035876811,124,13,315,0,99,1595065149

It's a solid, even excellent, driving game.

However, without a day one patch it sure is buggy. I play on a very good pc rig and when it works, it shines, but if you use time-trial mode, as soon as you beat your closest rival it crashes. 

It desperately needs a patch or two, but I am confident that will come and it really will be an excellent game.

My biggest gripe is that Codies have stooped low enough to include micro-transactions.

DO NOT BUY THESE. DO NOT SUPPORT MICRO TRANSACTIONS IN ANY FORM. MICRO TRANSACTIONS ARE FOR MOBILE GAMES, AND EVEN THEN THEY ARE QUESTIONABLE.

26,72485458,english,"I love this game even though one may argue that it is not sim like. In this review, I am just going to focus on wet weather driving as I feel that it is the biggest down fall of the previous iterations of the game. Please note I play with all assist off.

[h1]F1 2019:[/h1]
- The rear of the car is somehow just all over the place. I am able lose control of the rear occasionally in the dry and if I was driving in the wet, the car would just be sliding all over the place.

- Brakes are manageable in the dry but in the wet again they are atrocious. I really had to dial down the brake pressure by a ton just not to lockup. If I had a dry qualifying and a wet race, I just had to pray that I had the race pace due to having parc fermé enabled.

- Overall not really a good experience for driving in the wet.

[h1]F1 2020:[/h1]
- Really controllable car in the wet. However, if you push the car to its limits you still can lose traction. It is so much more fun to drive and the car is more predictable. This gives me more confidence in the car.

- Braking in the wet is so much more manageable and even in the dry too. It is less easy to lock up. Hence, I am able to run higher brake pressures for qualifying and the race as well.

- Overall racing in the wet boils down to how well you know the car and how much are you willing to risk in terms of acceleration. This leads to a more competitive racing.

To sum it all up, F1 2020 makes me look forward to wet weather racing. In the previous iterations of the game, I use to dread wet weather racing and it was really a struggle for me especially in career mode.

52,72477549,english,"[h1] F1 2020 brings the formula 1 season that the pandemic took away from us [/h1]

F1 2020 is the newest game in the annual F1 series by Codemasters. 2020 brings some much needed upgrades to 2019, and is a more polished experience. It comes with a new ""create a team"" option, and brings back local ""split screen"" racing, something that has been missing from f1 games since 2013!

I have not driven the game a lot, but the handling seems to have improved. I did not get any of the odd slides that plagued the previous F1 game, and I personally think the cars are a lot more fun to drive this year. F2 is back, but gone are Lukas Weber and Devon Butler, your two career mode rivals. I welcome this change, as Butler annoyingly used my racing number (71). Other than that, f1 2020 is practically a re-skinned 2019, with some quality of life changes, like a customizable HUD and a virtual rear view mirror.

However, there is one big change from 2019, which is the ""Create Your Team"" mode. In this mode, you are able to become the next Christian Horner, or Toto Wolff, and manage your own F1 Team. This means taking charge of car design, development, sponsor, facilities, teammates and more! Annoyingly, you can't just sit back and be the boss, as you still have to drive the car on the race weekends. Although the ""create your team"" career mode is a lot of fun and brings a new dimension to the f1 series, I still wish that I could hire two racing drivers, and just focus on managing my team. Maybe next year in F1 2021...

Once again, Codies have released a solid game. There have been a few changes to the irl cars very recently, but I imagine those will get patched in very soon, as codies have been pretty good about that on previous game launches.",1594441676,1594441676,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,76561198119129033,79,31,1285,0,786,1595393619

65,72470823,english,"Massive improvement on the previous game, it's great to see that the developers are intent on actually innovating and improving the game year on year, unlike some annual sports games (cough, EA).

Improvements I noticed:
- Audio is much better, pretty much every sound in the game has been redone. I thought the cars sounded meh in previous games but in this one they sound much more like real life, I really like the Honda engine. Every impact from crashes to cars running over curbs or bumps now sounds much more crisp and real. 
- FPS problems completely fixed. Have not had a single issue with it.
- AI is noticeably better, 99% of the time. They are much more aggressive and capable when it comes to close racing, and they also behave in a much more ""human"" manner, you will sometimes see them making small mistakes, losing the rear on the exit of corners and the like. I have noticed a couple of issues, notably the AI does not know that you're not allowed to move across the track in the braking zone when defending, I lost 2 front wings because of that, and also they will drive straight into you when you are exiting the pit lane if they happen to be passing, so you may want to try using the manual pit limiter to avoid this. But overall the AI is great.
- Car handling feels a lot better. The slower cars with less downforce are harder to drive this time around once you turn off the assists but that's not a bad thing, it makes for a more challenging and fun experience overall. 
- ERS system is much better and seems to more accurately reflect real life, from what I've seen on the TV at least. It's much less of a chore to manage now.
- Entire new game mode where you create your own team, raise funds from sponsors, hire a second driver and develop your car over time. They managed to get the balance between accessibility and depth pretty much spot on with this, and I hope they build on it in future instalments. 
- Much more customisation options. Sadly there are microtransactions, but it's just for cosmetic stuff and there's a fair amount you can unlock just by playing. I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt on this one that it will stay that way and not go down the same path as other developers (cough, EA).

I've done six full race weekends and a bit of time trial and multiplayer, and honestly so far my only criticism is that the team performance in-game vs real life is quite off, in-game Ferrari is pretty much on par with Mercedes and has the best power unit in the game, which is definitely not the case in real life. Hopefully this will be patched soon. Oh and also the race engineer is dumb and kinda seems like he's watching a completely different race sometimes.

[h1] The Good [/h1]
[u] Quick Pros [/u]
[b] Myteam adds a fun mode that will keep you occupied for hours on end [/b]
[b] Better AI that won't run you off as much (as long as you know how to race wheel to wheel) [/b]
[b] Free Podium Pass that adds cosmetic content for weeks to come [/b]
[b] Better car handling so you can be that much faster and more competitive [/b]

the car feels much better than 2019 did, where you'd seemingly lose the rear of the car for no reason now you can start to feel and drift that might start to occur and correct for it. (But all in all you just slide less.) 
My Team is definitely the reason to get the new instalment, i find myself wanting to do more of the background management than actually doing some of the GP's (especially Monaco.) team building is fun and watching your rise from a midfield car up to the top is something special to witness. Also with the new podium pass you won't be getting tired of your livery since they're adding new ones all the time, is it perfect? No, we'll get into in the bad but it does add more depth. Not to mention you can progress in the podium pass regardless of where or how you play.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[u] Quick Cons [/u]
[b] Net code is still...iffy [/b]
[b] Bugs, lots of bugs (pre day 1 patch) [/b]
[b] Limited customisation for the artists out there [/b]
[b]  [/b]

For the not so good side of this game the first one that comes up is the bugs, now bare in mind the day one patch as of writing this has not been released, the bugs in this game aren't game breaking barring maybe one black screen after a GP that forced me to restart the race, and one particular bug that's just horrible, if you change strategy on the mfd, it'll set you to a 0 stop, you'll still complete your stops and change tires but sometimes it thinks you've only used one set and you're DQ'd. The ones that won't break your game you'll notice all over the place, npc's out of place during loading screens, character models missing limbs, most of them are visual but when they aren't and it affects your race it's infuriating, i'm sure that will have changed within days of this review being published. Online is fun as ever but don't expect all the cars not ghost via netcode issues or you to teleport in front or behind somebody, again this may be fixed soon but considering how f1 2019 was at times this seems like a small issue that we may just see from time to time. take away the rare teleport or ghost its a great online experience. Then there is the customisation and changing your badge and liveries, now let me get this straight there are a bunch of pre-made liveries, suits, gloves, helmets, whatever you can think of. You can also change the colour of said liveries, swapping a red for a white or whatever your heart desires. Now if you want anything past changing colours and choosing sponsors you're out of luck, no custom livery editor, or the small details you'd want to see from a team, yknow like their name on the car... it's small details like this i'm a sucker for and unfortunately you just don't see much of it. The badge you create is pasted everywhere and if you get one you like you'll be sure to be pleased when you see it but it would have been nice to get a more complicated badge like some of the other teams. WITH ALL THIS BEING SAID, I have heard of the ability to mod in different helmets and other designs, so this might fix all those issues but to miss out on an in house editor that was more than a colourway swap would have been nice in my opinion. 

[h1] The Conclusion [/h1]
There's a lot more to this game than what i'm willing to type in a steam review but all in all it's set to be the strongest formula one game we've had in mainstream gaming, there's something here for casual racers, and veterans who want to test themselves. Overall i'm pleased with the game but i welcome the patches that are without a doubt soon to follow, if you're fine wading through them prior to the fixes, well then join the club hah. If you are a F1 fan you'll enjoy this game, and if you're on the fence about if you really like f1 or not this game is the pinnacle of the series so far as far as dynamic career and team modes go.

8,72456196,english,"First things first - this review is for/by people that aren't that great at prior versions of the game (or just don't have the reflexes to play at ""real"" difficulty). If you're wondering if the simulation is complex enough or if the tire wear perfectly matches the real season -- go find other reviews. :)

Ok... for those still with me who might be new to the franchise or just *terrible* at prior versions of the franchise (I'm the latter) -- here's why this is a good game to jump into F1 with.

Caveat 2: At this point, I'm 3 (and an Invitational) races into my first season using ""My Team"", so that's my perspective.

1) The ""My Team"" career option. If you enjoy the idea of managing sponsors, your other driver, your livery, engine partner, etc. without the full complexity of a Motosport Manager type thing and with still being able to drive (and hence steer the team destiny), this gives it to you. For those of us who would be told ""git gud"" on the discussion boards -- this also lets you drive with ""Casual"" mode (more on that next), so you have the option to focus more on the team or more on your driving (or both). Personally, I find it a lot of fun -- though sorry, Mick Schumacher -- you're going on the chopping block once your contract is up. Pass a car already, man!

2) The aforementioned ""Casual"" mode -- this is 100% why those of us who just aren't that good but want to have fun with F1 should buy this. Yes, if you want to become a world class driver you probably shouldn't start with it -- I get that. I know full well, I'm not going to be.... and for folks like me, this gives a nice set of assists that let you concentrate primarily on keeping the car on track and preferably at the apex as needed. It handles shifting (and to some extent braking/gas) for you. Braking, however - you'll likely quickly start to override as you get a feel for the car and the tracks. ERS is mostly managed, but again you can override. So -- like training wheels, I feel this lets more normal folks get going -- and then we can relax the assists once we get more of a feel for the game based on our own level. 
The only down side so far is that it prevents you from doing fuel mix management - which I mention because I can not pass the Practice Session fuel management regimens. Oh well.

3) Even in Casual, the AI doesn't take it completely easy on you. And there is a setting for it, so if you find the AI is being too gentle, you can start to ramp them up. I'm finding Mercedes still very competitive (especially on curvy tracks like Hanoi), so don't worry that you'll get a cakewalk -- there will still be drama and challenge even on the stock settings. Well, unless you're getting good - and then you can dial it up.

General comments on performance and whatnot -- it seems fine, graphics are nice enough. Sometimes I get some stutter (but I suspect that may of all things be Windows 10's wallpaper rotation - it causes hiccups on my system). Using an X-box wireless controller and it works well enough.

No comments on Multiplayer or Online stuff since that isn't my thing. I will note that there is LAN multiplayer as well as split-screen multiplayer (according to articles). Haven't tried those yet but expect to. So for a nice session with friends/family, looking forward to those options.

TL;DR: Fun for the newbie or the not-Leclerc crowd, adjustable challenge level but even stock casual has drama. Team management is a fun dynamic if you're into that (as I apparently am).

20,72451678,english,"Overall the game has improved from F1 2019. ALOT.

Pros
1) You don't feel like your driving on a hover craft like in 2019.
2) The down-force and overall grip levels are more realistic
3) The sounds of the vehicles are significantly different, and in my opinion are better
4) The ""My Team"" feature adds a new component to the career mode (a lot of cool features)
5) There are new and different assists added to the game to make it more user friendly for beginners
6) The Podium Pass is a cool feature to match the season pass utilized in other modern games
7) Overall driving experience has improved (i.e you can feel the up and down shifts on the controller or steering wheel)
8) The tyre grip has improved ALOT.  You can feel the tyres and how they are reacting. In 2019, I noticed that when you are warming up the tyres in the formation lap (for example), it felt as if the vehicles back end could slide out at anytime.  In F1 2020 that uncomfortable sensation/uncertainty is no longer a factor.

Cons:
1) This isn't really a con but more of an adjustment to get used to; the game is less forgiving for late braking (with assists off). In previous F1 games the consequence for late braking was typically locking up, however the steering was not significantly impacted. In F1 2020, you will receive more understeer if you try to go for a late pass or late brake to block. But I don't necessarily disagree with this as this is more realistic.
2) Downshifting - I noticed that if you try to downshift the gears at a fast rate, the game will sometimes not register all the shifts. This can be a tad frustrating when coming into hairpin corners at 8th gear as it impeads on the drivers ability to stop in time (with the assist of slight engine braking).

Game is pretty good compared to F1 2019 with its new features in the career mode and cosmetics (customizations). MyTeam is a really nice addition to the game and has a deeper integration compared to any other previous installments. Customization is so much better compares to F1 2019. Its a huge step up. You can customize anything ranging from helmets, suits up to new podium celebrations. 

Codemasters also added their ""battle pass-like feature"" called Podium Pass. 30 tiers, challenges and so many cosmetics included however you need to grind the game a little bit in other to finish the tiers. First pass' items are great but im more interested in whether they will keep putting nice items. 

The only bad thing about the game is its bugs... Codemasters cant seem to release a zero-bugs game. It's day one right now as im writing this review and i have encountered into so many annoying bugs...hoping that the day one patch will solve most of it rn. Thus im expecting bugs to be significantly lower as they start releasing updates. Overall a much better and feature rich game compared to F1 2019.

i play sim racing games all the time and see a lot of people crap on these F1 games for being not very simulation but what im seeing is the cars behave almost exactly how they would in real life, these are extremely high downforce, light as hell racing cars, nothing else comes close to the cornering speed and people are expecting you to feel the car bouncing around a corner like its a GT3 car. ive played plenty of ACC and yes F1 is a much easier game but thats because F1 cars are much easier to drive than a skittish gt3 car with little downforce in comparison, up the AI difficulty and you will have as hard a challenge as you like, take off the assists and you will be having way more crashes than any ''simcade'' racer has the right to give you.

It could be argued that the game makes it too easy on you, like taking over the pit lane driving but its so minor and keeps things flowing how a real race would. it could also be argued you dont have much control over the cars mechanicals on track but the reality is 90 percent of an f1 steering wheel is for the engineers - not the drivers, and really, playing f1 2020 ive had to ''manage'' the car much more, tyres wear and overheat and fuel is a real pain in the a$$ actually. im pretty happy that its good enough and represents what we see f1 drivers go through really pretty well.

does it feel a lot like f1 2019... yeh, ofcourse, but its been subtly improved, no more downshifting to 1st to rotate the car more, the brakes really bite a lot more as the car gets slower and approaches a corner and its a pleasant suprise how much content is packed into this, the my team mode is actually a legit reason to upgrade, lots of subtle changes add up to make another great improvement.

EDIT: just want to add the developers kept microtransactions hidden until the game was released and got its reviews, i was a little disappointed to see not a lot of customisation options in the base game to start with and this so called ''podium pass'' was locked away and hidden until the reviews were out, the game is pretty packed with content so i kinda just wished they were straight up and open about this from the off that there will be tons of customisation but its hidden behind extra money, i can live with it as its not so important for me but it may turn some people off who dont like content hidden behind microtransactions and people need to know about this, you wont see it mentioned in any reviews because... hidden until reviews dropped. like most microtransactions you can earn a lot in game but it takes a lot of time and some content is time limited forcing you to make a choice to buy or lose the chance to get, its not great but it does not detract away from the quality of the game, its a brilliant racing game.",1594313583,1594404773,True,200,5,0.939264297485351563,2,True,False,False,76561197987843060,150,28,2160,205,1054,1601734887

39,72446341,english,"I didn't want to buy it this year, because there's still no VR support. But I bought it anyway, because I'm a weak person. 
After a few hours, I'm very happy with my decision. Handling has been improved, but of course it's by no means a sim. But that's not why people play this game. After a few races vs. AI I noticed no major changes in AI driver behavior. They're still decent, if you find the right difficulty setting. 

FFB could be better. You can feel and catch oversteer, but in some occasions, the car behaves really floaty. There's no hard ""snap"", details could also be better. Basically, it's enough to get some enjoyment out if it, but it's far away from the real deal.

The new My Team mode is a fun addition. It's not overly complicated, basically it's a fantasy fulfillment system. And I'm fine with that. The old career mode is also there, you can also play F2 and classic events. Sadly, it's still not possible to set up custom grids. It's a bit annoying to race against random names in single races. 

On track graphics are amazing, as always, performance feels vastly improved. I'm running the game on max settings with a 1070 and an i7 8450 @ 144 FPS, no stuttering so far. Engine sounds could use a bit more oomph. Last year's game kept crashing for me for a long time, as of now, there have been zero issues with the new one. (DX 12, latest drivers)

Furthermore, there are lots of little adjustments and improvements. Some menus are the same as before, others have been overhauled. Practice programmes are less of a chore, which is nice. They finally removed the ERS management mini game and simplified the whole process, which was VERY needed. Now you have 3 ERS modes, using the overtake button is cool. And it's more realistic than changing ERS settings manually all the time. 

I'm not interested in the multiplayer, so I can't comment on that. I guess it's the same as last year, with all its strengths and weaknesses.

The Schumacher edition stuff is neat, but let's be honest: It's nothing more but a little bit of glitter that adds nothing to the core experience.

So, should you buy F1 2020?
If you liked last year's game: YES. 
If you've never played an F1 game and want to get into the franchise: YES
If you're a hardcore sim fan (rF2, ACC, etc.): MAYBE - Watch some Jimmer to decide. F1 games are not realistic. They're games, not sims.

Overall, it looks like F1 2020 could be the best game of the series.

F1 2020 is an improvement on F1 2019. It comes with the all new My Team mode, which allows you to run your own team. The AI seems to be more aware of player actions, as well as having the same issues as the player at times (Example: the kerb at Bahrain that spins you). The AI also seems more aggressive than it was in F1 2019, with more divebombing and running you out of your line. My only gripe so far is that while you may be getting semi-regular points finishes in My Team, your 2nd driver will mostly finish at the back of the pack until you heavily invest in Driver Training section of your team, and also the car to a certain point. And the old school regular Career mode is still around as well, so you have options. This time in the traditional Career mode, you can run an entire F2 season, a shortened season, just 3 races, or you can skip F2 altogether. With all that being said, I highly recommend this game.",1594394046,1594394046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198809945724,127,31,2731,0,1837,1595904121

Whether you've played (sim)racers before, or you're looking to make F1 2020 your first one, I'd say this game is definitely worth it. 
The new My Team mode is an interesting spin on the classic driver career, adding a lot more to the management aspect of the game with things like securing sponsors, co-drivers, improving facilities, etc.
The driving itself feels amazing, even on controller.

Having not played the previous game I can't really compare it. Nevertheless, it is still awesome. I was worried I would get bored seeing as this game doesn't have the variety of cars like games like Forza. What it loses in quantity it makes up in quality though. The cars are incredibly in depth with the ability to manage ERS, DRS, fuel concentration, front brake bias, differential and more. Controller controls are easy to handle too, so you won't be at a disadvantage against wheel players too badly. Overall it is great, I also love being able to play through this years full season even though half of it was cancelled due to you know what.

The only downside I see is that some cars like Mercedes don't have the correct liveries, but this is down to the real life team changing it quite late to support anti-racism messages which is understandable.

This is the quick reviews

Cons:
1-The commentator will call your team as ""the driver owned team"", which will lower the immersion you get
if they call your team just like they call your name (Audio name) it will be perfect.

2- some commentary were cut off, the immersion got hit again. now its only on racing day they begin talking like usual while practice and quali will be met by silence.

---thats it, the cons for this sim racing game is the immersion will be lower than you expect---

PROS :
1- Podium pass, yeah this one is like a battle pass, BUT.. you can get them all for free and just playing the game and challenges, you'll get its rewards, with the exception the VIP ones (again, you'll get coins on higher levels to buy the vip, literally free but with grinding coins of course)

2- MyTeam , is super fun, the management part and driving yourself is cool, and suprisingly its not tedious as it looks like, mostly just infos to increase the immersion as the BOSS of the team, taking Stroll games to higher levels than current racing point :p

3- AI actually can do make mistakes, you will soon realise that they sometimes didnt take the same pattern as the other drivers (their character attributes like awareness-pace- etc has an impact) but the chances is low to make them spin or ramming the walls

Overall its a Solid 8/10

The AI in this game is very good to put it simply. They make very human like mistakes wich only immerses you when you play the career/ my team modes. Speaking of my team. My team is a great feature to this game wich adds alot of longevity and replayability.

Short career mode is a good addition too and traction is much more realistic than last year and ERS is much more simple since real F1 pilots like Leclerc and Norris played the game during the quarantine period and provided feedback about how the cars are much more punishing in terms of traction than in real life, as well as ERS itself.

- AI on wet track is beatable (not like in F1 2019 where it was almost impossible to beat them in wet weather)
- AI makes more mistakes - more realistic (not so ofter so it's definitely more real)
- My Team - 11th team on the grid - you can sign even F2 drivers so they have finally chance to be with us in F1 too!
- Schumacher's edition gives you some nice liveries (suits, helmets, celebrations) you can use in ""My Team"" and multiplayer
- Podium Pass (probably more known as battle pass, raid pass, etc...) where you can get liveries, celebrations etc for completing missions or races
- Standard race style for skilled racers and Casual for newbies

27,72418263,english,"As of this review, I have spent 18 hours on the game. Mostly diving into MyTeam. As a player following codemasters F1 series for awhile now, I've got to say that MyTeam is by far the best solo career mode in any of their F1 games. There is an added challenge of starting with a bad car and working your way up the field and slowly managing your finances to upgrade your facilities. All in all, great offline career mode.

Moving on to the Multiplayer aspect of the game. Understandably that the game is only in its pre-official release version, I've been having (along with many other users) connectivity issues with Codemasters servers whereby the ""connecting to online services"" prompt pops up every 5s. What has always been a displeasure in Ranked mode was how you can get penalized for getting hit by another driver and it is not different this year. A lot of users also agree that corner cutting and track limits warnings are more loosely handed out this year. I guess I was unlucky to be faced with many dirty drivers in my placement games and was always penalized for people hitting me or falling for unavoidable incidents. Overall, all I can hope is that codemasters fixes this in a future update.

Ultimately, F1 2020 is a great game to purchase if you're a F1 fan and enjoy the thrill of racing F1 cars alongside the very enjoyable AI this year. This year's AI intelligence seems to be the most enjoyable to race against (I play at 100 AI difficulty) Despite its shortcomings, I still very much enjoy the game as a huge fan of F1.",1594366590,1594366590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198047586068,125,4,5598,246,1086,1601803064

* My Team career with tons of new features, such as building facilities, hiring drivers
* New handling model makes driving in rain so much more fun

Pros
-My Team is amazing and addictive
- Career has been stepped up a level due to implementation of cash
- Gui's/hud have improved greatly over F1 2019
- Implementation of F2 testers and full seasons add another side to the game
- Runs well on an average computer, F1 2019 was quite laggy in multiplayer, 2020 is not.
- the new tracks are made to perfection being near accurate to their real life counterparts
- Advanced assists - Although I have not tried the advanced assists (steering assist, ect.) it welcomes new, inexperienced players to formula 1 in an interactive way

Now to the cons
- Constantly says 'connecting to online services', even in singleplayer
- Online lobbies sometimes glitch out
- Occasional crashes

63,72389190,english,"F1 2020 is a joy to play with a wheel and pedals and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing racing games. The car handling and the feel of the FFB with a wheel is the best I have experienced in any F1 game to date.

With only two exceptions (F1 2011 and 2015), I have owned every version of F1 going back to F1 2010. Among those games, F1 2013 has remained my favorite in the series - until now. Codemasters has finally managed to make a version of F1 that surpasses my love for F1 2013.

Codemasters have been steadily improving on Career mode over the last few years and they took the next step in F1 2020 with the addition of My Team Career mode. This mode allows for the creation and customization of your own driver and team. The Standard Career mode is also included giving us two different Career modes to choose from. I am thoroughly enjoying My Team Career mode. The challenge of building up a team and new car from the bottom of the ranks is something I really enjoy in racing games. My Team Career mode provides the perfect opportunity to do just that.

Codemasters have also added PitCoins which can be used to purchase items in the new Item Shop. They have also added the Podium Pass which can be leveled up to unlock more items for free. You can also use PitCoins to purchase a VIP Podium Pass which will unlock even more content with each level gained. PitCoins can be purchased with real money or earned by completing challenges within the Podium Pass. These challenges include Daily, Weekly, and Seasonal challenges as well as an entire section of VIP challenges that unlock with the purchase of the VIP Podium Pass. This will be very familiar to those of you who have experience with Rocket League's Rocket Pass.

F1 2020 includes the usual goodies along with the new additions to Career mode, Podium Pass, and PitCoins. Multiplayer, F1 Esports, Driver & Car Customization, Showroom, and a Theater section for your racing highlights are all there. The F2 cars are there as well.

In my opinion, Codemasters have put together a real gem with this iteration of F1. I can easily give F1 2020 a Thumbs Up.

Driver Market is wonky as hell, in the first season Sebastian Vettel is scripted to retire, I don't think it's realistic at all, he is 33, if anyone wants to retire it probably the Iceman Kimi. Then on the second season 80% of the driver changed team, even Lance Stroll moved away from his daddy's team. I think the solution here is to add contract length

75,72405004,english,"I have played it for a few hours and tried the new MyTeam and did some 5-lap race weekend to see how they changed the physics and oh boy… it is more challenging now.

The MyTeam is a great feature, you can pick Nyck de Vries as a consistent 2nd driver or Lord Mahaveer Raghunathan just for memes alone. MyTeam has a big modding and roleplaying potential. Imagine resurrecting old teams such as Toyota, BMW, Honda, Manor, HRT, etc. or introduce a new team such as Porsche, Audi, Lamborghini, etc. or scratch that and just name your own team as Fast Bois. The one thing that I don’t like is when choosing your 2nd driver when starting your MyTeam, it is random and you can’t display all 2019 F2 drivers, and to find and choose your favorite driver you must discard and start a new MyTeam again to generate the new 2019 F2 driver list.

The physics is more challenging now, especially on a rainy race weekend and even on the right tire compound, sometimes it feels like you are driving with slick tires on light rain. Getting traction while cornering and exiting is challenging and I often lose the tail and S🅱️in on high-speed corners unlike in F1 2019.

AI drivers make mistakes during qualifying and when you are pressuring them which is one of the best features (along with rear-view mirror) that they have added to this iteration.

Some liveries, aero parts, and performance stats are still outdated, and I do not know when they will patch it as the game has just been released. As for the 2020 F2 drivers I do not know if they will add them in the future updates.

81,72402899,english,"F1 2020 is the best F1 game i have played from Codemasters. Year after year, they have proven to all racing sim fans that their ability to make a new F1 game never dies. In this review, I will be telling you the pros and cons of this game and why you should buy it.

PROS 
~ The graphics are of course as good as usual! It really feels like real world F1. The thing is that its pretty similar to F1 2019, so that's a little sad :(
~ The car sounds are a TONNNNN LOT BETTER than F1 2019!(especially the Ferrari and the Red Bull) 
~The new features for this game is ABSOLUTELY SICK. The MyTeam Career mode has really caught my eye since the release of this game (got it on 7th July) and I have been playing it ever since. Codies had did a good job to make owning an F1 Team as realistic as possible such as hiring sponsors, teammates and upgrading your very own facilities! The addition of splitscreen is cool for casual gamers who want to race against their friends, but wont work very well for PC though.
~ More customisation options are available in this game. Like for example, if you are hoping to make a car livery of your choice, you can edit it anytime. Badges are even coller since you can create your own one! 
~ Handling has also improved a LOT, especially for pad users. However, wheel users are still better than pad users in the game :(( 

CONS

~ Online is still the same old shit.
~ In terms of online races, if we go a little off-track, we get a penalty. Sometimes these penalties leave me bewildered 
~Podium pass is good! But the fact that we have to pay real money for PitCoin(their currency to buy in-game customisation liveries, badges, emotes, gloves and more) is a bit of a disappointment. On the brighter side, the PitCoin isn't that expensive for a bucketful of 50000, unlike EA or 2K, putting the cost of their currency at $100 + for a small amount of them, which is like wtf? 
~ If you hate the podium pass because it is like ""Fortnite Battle Pass Style"", pls do't hate it. Codemasters is giving us a chance to earn rewards for free(for the free pass), which is better than last year when you have to spend actual money to buy all the customisations and liveries in the game. The thing that let me down the most was the VIP pass, becasue we have to use PitCoin to buy it, and PitCoin cost money. Really hope Codemasters would do something about it next year so that customers with the game don't have to spend extra money on the game since they already bought it for like $50.

SHOULD YOU BUY IT? 

Short answer: Yes
Long answer: Yes, you have to! Codemasters have really shown drastic improvement in their games as the years past. They have heeded our advice on how to improve the game and so on, like last year in career mode, we can only go through three races in F2. But this year, Codies gave us a choice to choose between a short, medium and long season, which is pretty cool. For a fact, F1 2020 and F1 2019 both are the exact same price, but F1 2020 offers more gameplay features for a richer gameplay experience for everyone at the same cost as F1 2019. That's why it is worth it to buy this game. I spent $59 on this game I dont regret buying it. To everyone reading this, if you want to refund this game and go back to F1 2019, think again... 

Conclusion 

Overall, this is the best game of the franchise so far. It literally amazes me how fun the game is! The handling, the features, this is a must buy. Everything about this game is super fun! 

Codemasters, big thank you to you for always making your games top-notch! :D

Buuuut there are still legacy bugs, and the game crashed a couple of times, in Singleplayer you can now save mid session though, so if you make a habit out of that, even if it crashes it's not the end of the world, but that cannot be said for Multiplayer of course, which also seem unstable network wise...

96,72398584,english,"Codemasters have made a pretty good franchise with F1 over the last couple of years and this one is no different. It takes the aspects from last years game and tries to improve upon them even further. But like with all titles, it has good points and bad points.

PROS:

-Graphics are really good quality, whilst not needing a supercomputer to run it.
-Like with a lot of racing games, it's not hard to learn how to play it, it just takes practice and patience. A lot of patience. Trust me, this game will test your patience big time.
-It's quite detailed, and has a lot to offer for both casual gamers and for sim racers too, whether it be the handling model, the ability to use a wheel and map many different aspects of the car to all types of buttons and switches, or the depth when it comes to the setup of the car. I think it borders the gap between racing games and racing sims quite nicely.
-A fair bit of customisation options are available to people, and whilst you can pay to get them, you don't need to, so unlike a lot of games these days, it's not just a cash cow.
-The My Team part of the game is a brilliant addition and gives everyone a reason to be excited for the next games as they make this side of the game more detailed and personalised.
-The AI is a lot more realistic this year, they're more aggressive and opportunistic and are just as prone to mistakes as the average player, making any race more exciting and random.

CONS: (From my experience)

-The difficulty in the AI seems to be widely varied in different situations, they can be blisteringly quick in single lap pace and off a safety car restart, yet horrendously slow in the opening laps of a race, I think a balance needs to be found there.
-The practice programs have always been a good part of the game, however, after 4-5 years of it being the same with only minor differences, I think it needs a change-up, maybe a program that focuses on the airflow of the car, allowing the player to see whether the next upgrade should be a front or rear aero upgrade, etc.
-Also on the practice programs, the lap times this year are a bit ridiculous, especially with the ERS Management and Qualifying programs, the required lap times are often faster than what the leading cars are churning out, so hoping for a patch to that soon.
-Whilst it's nice to see the AI being more aggressive, I can't help but think it's too reckless, if the AI sees a gap, it will go for it, regardless of whether your car is there or not, it will also close the door on you hard, so be prepared to be changing your front wing a lot.
-Setups seem to be more important this year than ever before, and whilst this can be a good thing, as it means that people can spend more time tuning the car to suit their individual driving styles, if you don't know what you're doing, it can be very difficult and some new players could be turned away by being so much slower than the AI and other players, all because they haven't tweaked their setup. I think a good idea could be adding in winter testing into career mode and using it as a platform to teach people about how to form setups, anyone who knows can skip this part or use it to find their own setups and see the difference from the last game, but it would be good for players that don't.

Overall, it's a good game and the series keeps building on its potential, and the bad aspects of the games are certainly things that can be easily fixed, and I hope they are. So if you're an F1 fan or a racing fan, give it a go, just be prepared to go through a fair bit of frustration along the way.",1594338078,1594338078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198211310391,73,2,7258,1675,1749,1602043500

From the moment you boot up F1 2020, you’re immediately met with a dizzying array of options that is indicative of the skills required to master the world of Formula One racing. Codemasters pulls no punches in what is most certainly their best iteration of Formula One racing to date. This is a deep and enthralling racing game that has options for rookies and veterans alike.

The standout mode this year is easily the entertaining ‘My Team’ mode. Codemasters have overhauled the career mode to be much more deep and engaging. You’re given the reigns of a brand new custom team in the F1 season, and you have to drag yourself to the top. Success depends on much more than just good racing. To win, you’ll also have to make smart decisions in R&D, keep sponsors happy to ensure a steady flow of funds, and tune your car for maximum efficiency in each race. As a huge fan of management games, I felt like a little kid who just got a shiny new PlayStation for Christmas.

You could easily lose yourself in the menus. Well, that could partly be due to the fact that the menus still don’t have mouse support (Codemasters pls). There are options for the options. This can be all too overwhelming for new players, but a smart tutorial system and a willingness to learn meant I’ve quickly gotten used to what is required of me to compete at a competent level. The community is fantastic and I quickly found myself on the Steam Workshop on day one to find new car setup guides to help shave those valuable seconds off of lap times.

If all the robust systems in the game feel too overbearing, the game does give you the option to fine tune the difficulty to your liking. Races can be shortened to 25% of their length and you can turn on driver assists for the more complex systems such as DRS or ERS. The game also has an option to change the driving to ‘arcade’. This has the added effect of ensuring that your tyres don’t lose grip on the grass after you miss a sharp turn. The accessibility settings are a nice touch for a “rookie” driver such as myself. I never found myself blocked from accessing the game. Instead, I’ve found myself slowly turning off the assists as I grew more confident in my driving.

Codemasters have also nailed the racing on the track. The cars feel fantastic, and the force feedback on my wheel was great. The visuals are also stunning and the attention to detail on the tracks so far have been faultless. It took me a fair few practice laps to master Turn 15 on the Australian Grand Prix. There is a real sense of speed as you burst through a straight with the ambient noise filled with the motor whirring at full power. There’s a sense of satisfaction that is rarely matched by other games when you pull off a perfect overtake on a hapless driver. Speaking of drivers, the AI seems to be quite aggressive this year. I’ve seen some very aggressive overtakes and they aren’t afraid to go toe-to-toe with you for the racing line.

That said, there are a few missteps along the way. Soft tyres are currently far too overpowered on the shorter races. There seems to be little disadvantage to using soft tyres on short races. It seems like the scaling may be a little broken. The soft tyres seem to last for more than 50% of the race, resulting in little wriggle room for tyre strategy. This problem is largely alleviated if you bump up the race length to 50%, but its still worth mentioning. It is also important to state that this issue didn’t really detract from my overall experience of the game.

My time so far with F1 2020 has been exhilarating. I’m constantly being drawn back to complete that next race in My Team and to try and shave a few more seconds off my lap times. Codemasters have managed to create an engaging ‘CaRPG’ that is equally tactical and beautiful. If you’re a seasoned F1 fan, I’m sure you’re already busy playing, but if you’re someone who’s on the fence, F1 2020 provides the perfect springboard to kick-start your F1 career. For now, you’ll find me back on the track.",1594333072,1594333072,True,6,0,0.593959689140319824,0,True,False,False,76561198044883386,416,29,466,0,378,1594383174

This year features a decently in-depth 'My Team' mode where you are the owner-driver of a custom team.  They also brought back split-screen multiplayer which the last five or so games were lacking  The handling model for both a wheel and controller is the best it's ever been in my opinion, and there are new assists to help players that are new to F1 or racing in general.  There are still a few bugs and minor AI behavior issues, but they don't severely detract from my enjoyment of this game.  I have faith that most of the issues will be patched soon as they've done in previous years.  I'm actually a fan of the new Podium Pass, which allows players to use in-game currency to unlock visual customization items via completing challenges.

My largest complaint is that just like in last year's game the vibration on my pedals don't work with assists off, even when using Fanalab. (unless someone knows a work-around)

My computer is more than capable of running this game, so it is not a hardware issue. That being said the My Team career mode is incredibly fun.

F1 2020 is a big fantastic upgrade from his 2019 ancestor that was already great, MyTeam is surely the biggest star here, dope mode that has a huge replay value and for that alone it's 100% worth already, really fun to manage your team and drive for it. If you want to add even more to your playtime the standard career mode still avaliable even with the option of doing a full F2 season before leaping into F1 which is neat.

Lots of customization for your car and driver, I love customization features and F1 missed one, 2020 did it very well. It has an ingame money system which you can use to buy items from the shop, it also has a ""Podium Pass"" that unlocks new stuff as you play and do objectives to level it up, you can also buy a VIP Podium Pass with the ingame money as well.

It has a new ""casual mode"", I play more casually but with most of the assists off so I haven't tested it, though this game aims to be the most welcoming for every kind of racer, being casual or tryhard, steering wheel or controller, you're welcome in all ways.

As a fan of F1 and racing in general, I totally recommend this game independent if you're a tryhard racer or just wanna have some fun driving around, played F1 2019 a lot and I'll surely play this one even more.",1594317307,1594318124,True,6,0,0.563795864582061768,0,True,False,False,76561198066729762,374,9,6025,272,535,1600979247

If you are a fan of the F1 series than this is probably the game you have been waiting for. When it comes to driving, this is a mega step up from last year's game. In short, much more grip in highspeed corner but lots of understeer in slow corners. They added a new game mode to the game called ""My team"" where you basically make your own team and put in play against the real teams and if you are a solo player, this will add countless hours to your playtime. It is a much-needed addition to the game that makes it feel like it has a lot more content to dabble in compared to the other games in the series. AIs are massively improved, there are new ways of playing for total beginners and the game is genuinely much more optimised. 

I 100% recommend it if you are a fan of the sport or if you want to maybe join something more serious and invest a lot of time into making your driving better. Also, it has an amazing community

F2 cars are still very squirrely, but it's how it should be and they actually do feel more lightweight and like a formula car than beforehand.

My Team is a solid addition to the game, and I'm very happy they separated it from Career mode. The ERS overtake feature is also something that I've been wanting for a while and I'm glad it's finally come to the game. Reminds me of the KERS days of F1 2013 and before.
For a casual racer, the difference might not be big in terms of car handling, but F1 2020's other modes and features allow beginners to dip their toes into the world of F1.

With eSports and racing games becoming more prevalent, I think F1 2020 is a really solid step in the right direction.

Handling is far better.
AI is 100% better than last year (defensive and attacking), oh and AI is more unpredictable in terms of making mistakes (i'd love to see Vettel spinning in Monza).
OH, you can also play co-op with your friend/family using the splitscreen mode which is GREAT. 
Theres also new features added in this year called Podium Pass, its like battlepass and what you do basically is just do the challenge (time trial, finish podiums, pit stop x times, do some clean lap etc) in order to get XP, each level up you will get 1-2 items (livery, helmet etc.) according to your pass (free or VIP), even if you buy VIP Pass you will be able to purchase the next VIP Pass if you reach the maximum level.

And the best feature is the 'My Team' where we can create our own team and manage it (pick sponsors, 2nd driver, engine, livery etc.), feels like there's an RPG element added into this game lol.

So, in conclusion:

If you are into F1 or just racing in general JUST BUY IT GODDAMMIT.

It feels very solid. The Car gives more feedback i can react to. More grip with higher speed feels amazing. The new ERS mechanics is great. Usually you go for medium deplyoment and press a button to switch to overtake. ""No deployment"" and ""Hotlap"" are used in practice and qualifying. 

But the best thing is clearly the My Team mode. It´s fun to manage your team not only as a driver but to do it as a manager. You now have to deal with upgrading your car while upgrading your facilities and your 2nd driver. Between the races you can do activites wich will give you bonuses or straight up money. Lots of fun and i will spend most of my time in F1 2020 managing my own team. 

Graphics are just a minor step upwards but the F1 games looked always good and 2020 is no exception. 

Sound is state of the art AND the engine sounds are much better this time but they still lack behind the real life broadcasts.

This time we got a Season Pass system wich i think is a good way for CM to make money without screwing us(The customers/players) over. If you dont buy the VIP you can still earn the free stuff in the Pass. If you`re buying it you will make 10.000 Pitpoints by reaching lvl30. Buying the next Pass in 60 days will cost 9.000 so you buy it once and you get the chance to get the upcoming season passes without spending extra money wich is great.
