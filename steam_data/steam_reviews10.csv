2016-11-24,0,0,234,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of the weirdest although one of the most involving games i have ever played.At the beginning it looks like bunch of 5 year olds playing soccer (and it plays as such) but the game gets more complex the more experience you get (e.g. aerial play).It contains some singleplayer season mode but the real deal is multiplayer and because of whichi can recommend this game only if you enjoy playing with other people.,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,204,False,Recommended,Rocket League.This game is not only beautiful aesthetically but also plays beautifully.The gameplay takes a while to learn and a lifetime to master but at its core this game is highly enjoyable at all skill levels. It's hard to say if I would recommend it to everyone as it has no game like it (that I can think of). Yet I feel that anyone can pick up this game and simply enjoy themselves. I've had friends who don't normally game say they loved it and ones of which gaming is their life that say the same.Overall at the price point offered and the accessiblity of the games particularly with friends to play with this game is worth it to almost anyone.,Rocket League®

2016-11-26,0,0,200,False,Recommended,Graphics To be honest this game definitely has the best graphics ever . The lightning the shaders and all the highly detailed texture models. To me this means a lot in a game like this and I can only say that the job is very well done! Optimization This game can run at a minimum of 30 frames pr. second on almost all systems .However running +60 frames pr. second on a 144Hz monitor really makes the experience ever better and gives you a big advantage over players running at about 30fps. In my opinion I would recommend matchmaking based after both skill and average frames pr. second as the difference really means something here. Music &amp Sounds Together with the amazing frequently updated main menu music and the high quality sound effects the game really gets a nice finish! But I must admit that some of the main menu music can occur quite bad and boring . I would love seeing them implement some kind of advanced music control maybe we could use our own song library? That could be really cool! User Interface The UI feels really great. It's simple and easy to use and still yet filled with advanced options . Content With the huge amount of customizable vehicle options you really feel unique. There is almost not a single thing you can't change on the car. The only thing that bothers me here is their newly introduced micro transaction system that offers people to open crates they get in game. Details in the price section below. The game also contains a large varity of maps and gamemodes as well. Gameplay Rocket League is to me yet the most fun and intense game at the same time. Exciting matches and a lot of possibilities!Rocket League also gives you the opportunity to connect a controller to the PC and play. Yes the game is 100% controller supported so don't be afraid to show up with an Xbox or PS controller. If you have multiple controllers you're also able to play splitscreen online multiplayer with a friend! Competitive Gameplay This game has an unranked section and a ranked section. The competitive section is made of 4 gamemodes 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 3v3 Solo (solo meaning you can't group up). The rank system is in the most situations very accurate and mostly decides the right rank for everyone. But I won't give this one a solid ! Because of competitive grouping . Who doesn't love taking a friend with you in a 2v2? I do that myself but there's one thing that bothers me. Players that group does not always get placed against people that group as well. I've experienced many situations where I was playing 3v3 with 2 friends of mine and we were matched up against 3 players that didn't group. And we railed them . It's very annoying because playing 2v2 and especially 3v3 almost requires you to have friends by your side. I really hope they do something about this! Community The community is in many situations friendly but I must admit that I do experience loads of toxic players . Some teammates constantly complain about you or another teammate because you or your other teammate does something wrong. And then there of course is the group of players that keep spamming EZ in chat after you lose a game in the overtime. So only expect friendly teammates when you're in the lead! Price Price is fine. Not very expensive and not very cheap. To me the game is definitely worth the money . What makes me not drop a solid on this one is their crate/microtransaction system. To me they earn enough money of the game just by the price itself but offering people to buy keys for crates they get is maybe too much. What made me buy this game? I was definitely turned on by the gameplay. I don't like football/soccer that much so FIFA is not something for me. But football/soccer + flying cars really made me look at ball games in a different way. Overall I think this is a really great game! Very strategic and action filled gameplay fits for all ages. Worth the money as well and supports controller and splitscreen. TeknoScore 8 05 / 10,Rocket League®

If you're halfway decent you will most of the time find yourself getting put into matches where the score is already 1 to 5. Guess what you're not on the winning side. The game will make you feel like it's you 2 people who just turned it on for the second time ever vs. three ""pro"" level players.

2016-07-01,0,0,49,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Out of this world fun! I honestly didn't know if i would like this game but it adds two very different sports into one new and totally thrilling hybrid. I admit i don't play PvP with my friends and the only real complaint seems to be the matchmaking so I myself never encounter that so I can't comment on it. and while gameplay it a definately is a major plus it also runs EXTREMELY well on a not so powerful machine. I have a fairly weak computer and I can run it on max everything and have more than enough frames to play at the top of my game D GREAT GAME 100/10 D,Rocket League®

2017-07-05,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Overall Rocket League is a very interesting original and unique game. The concept seems so simple but it can get so involved and in depth. The different game modes (such as soccar basketball hockey and an item based rumble mode) will keep you interested for a long time. It is much more fun when you have someone to play with so keep that in mind. The car customization possibilities really make your vehicle feel like your own and there are PLENTY of customization options. My only complaint is that the game does not have market support (meaning you cannot sell and buy in game items on the steam market). Do keep in mind this game will require a decent computer to run smoothly even on low graphical settings. While this is an amazing game I still recommend waiting until a sale to purchase it with it's $20 pricepoint. I hope this helps from Joe.,Rocket League®

It does take time to learn all the tactics but the game is so fun to play. Getting different cars and all kinds of accessories is kind of frustrating because you have to trade/unbox/or straight out bought. Though this game has chat you will hardly use it given the fact of cross platform! ) Speaking of that yes you can disable this if it bothers you but most likely you should keep it on. The tutorials are also amazing and really allow you to practice. TLDR you should really buy this. Even full price i would still buy it because of how fun it is.,Rocket League®

2016-06-22,0,0,599,False,Recommended,"This game is perfect if you like a fast pace and a fun game. There's a ton skills involved so you can't just go around mindlessly hitting the ball and that's what i like and don't like about the game. Since it's a lot of strategy involve that means if you play for example 2v2 you either have to be good at reading your teammate and wait for his moves or if you can communicate with him by voice you'll have to get a good way of talking to each other and understand each others play styles and if one can't do that in a team it will ruin the 2v2 match. Other wise the game is AWSOME since it doesn't have anything ""Pay to win"" free DLC map! the cars you need to buy but nothing really is anything different in the between the cars except the visiual part Idk some say the speed and turn radios and the hit boxes are different but personaly I don't feel anything different from the cars except that some are lighter that makes it easier to get of the ground with flying and some do have smaller hit boxes but that doesn't make it so you have to have the car with the best turn radios the car you choose is your own choice and what you prefer and feel good with. The only thing i want them to change/ add to the cars are more decals and fully customizeble decalse where you can make your own decals for your favourite car D that would be awesome. The new trading system is awesome and I don't know what more to say. This game is one of the few good balanced games out. This game is almost close to Perfect in case of Balance between cars. I just wished that they some how fixed smurfing and bad match ups in competetiveall in all this game is awesome well balanced with few cons here and there (no game has ever been perfect except Infinity warfare!

2016-03-14,0,0,456,False,Recommended,The heart of Rocket League lives in that feeling of unrestricted movement. It s thanks in large part to the use of what I would call physics plus where the laws of gravity and momentum get a colorful overhaul to allow for driving on the walls and ceiling and ridiculous mid air direction changes that would liquefy the driver in the real world. But its fantastic movement is so arcadey and satisfying that I often have to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the tricks when a simple nudge or bump will do. ),Rocket League®

This game makes you feel like you're part of the game you need to think fast keep an eye on your teammates and hit the ball at the right angle at the right time in order to score it's not just a press of a button.

Even if your not a fan of football its still a great game. Definitely a fun and hetic game. To add you can also make other cats explode on contact if you have enough speed. Overall Verdict Graphics 8/10Gameplay 8.5/10Variety 4/10 (No new content) Final Verdict This is a game which should be in everyones Steam libary even if not for a serious game just to relax or a bit of quick fun.,Rocket League®

2016-01-09,0,0,359,False,Recommended,"""Easy to learn hard to master."" Most people who have played Rocket League would probably describe it this way. It's a game that most people will understand before ever starting to play. It's soccer (or hockey thanks to newer playlist Snow Day) with rocket boosted RC cars. Play 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4. Blow up enemies by boosting directly into them or don't if you value sportsmanship over tactics. Your choice.Eventually you learn the finer points of flipping off of walls and flying like a witch on a broomstick but the core game is for all intents and purposes universal. This is one of the few games I do not consider a gamble. If you are even remotely interested put down the money for it it is more than worth the asking price.I recommend playing with a controller as I feel most driving games tend to feel more immersive with triggers for pedals but do as you like. Lots of customization options make it so that you still have a sense of personality in a team game. DLC is very reasonably priced for how much I get out of the game and is released fairly regularly.Nothing but love for this game and the devs that made it. When Snow Day playlist was yanked post holiday season the developers listened to the public outcry and immediately brought it back. I wish more people were like this.Games are relatively short and very good for a quick ""pick up and play"" type game. Want to kill 10 minutes? Rocket League has you covered. Want to kill 2 hours? That isn't difficult here either. By virtue of its accessibility it is easy to revisit this game and pick right back up without getting too rusty and as such I find myself constantly returning to this inbetween all the other games I'm trying. I won't be surprsied if I'm logging hours in this forever.",Rocket League®

The second thing i kinda dislike is that there are some achievements for buying cars with real money i'm not really into spending lots and lots of money in game so this is an obvious one. Although buying a car with real currency has no bonus effects in the gameplay other than a cool looking car to drive.Still loving the game tho !!!,Rocket League®

2016-11-27,0,0,379,False,Recommended,Rocket league is an incredible game to both play by yourself or with a group of friends. As it developed they added countless new aspects to improve the game (not that it needed it).

2015-10-02,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,So I was playin' Rocket League at a friends place. I thought it was awesome and I don't own a console just a pc. I assumed that owning a controller would be a better experience so I bought one for my pc. I bought a Steam Card with 20 and got myself Rocket League. Yay so far.I go into settings to enable my controller instead of this crappy keyboard setting. Don't find any setting that would myself allow to change anything cuz' this game does not recognize my stupid controller! I go online google some info and find myself dumbfounded. Controller are not supported only with a X360 Controller and some programm I MIGHT play this awesome yet HORRIBLE game. You have to F5#!$ing (nice censoring right?) inform people beforehand that they can't play this awesome game with their controller!How do I refund? Anybody? That's something which has to be fixed like.... please? First time I write a review. Because I'm pi$sed. Did I write a nice review?,Rocket League®

2017-06-30,0,0,4237,False,Recommended,What can I say about Rocket League been playing it since it came out on pc and even played it on Xbox with my scrub friends there who didn't pc game at the time it's one of the games still in my daily rotation and one I don't see getting tired of anytime soon. Psyonix has proven to be one of the best developers out there with the way they're maintaining this game always keeping it fresh and releases new arenas modes vehicles and items in timely fashion. For being such a simple game the skill gap is what makes it fun and intense. Once you get a higher rank and start going against people that know what they're doing and once you've learned and mastered the different techniques of dribbling and aerial shooting then it is rather satisfying when your playing with a group of people on the same level and connecting and putting together these nice or insane plays and scoring.This game should be in everyone's library if there's any kind of negative critique I could give is they could rework the crate system a bit such as they really need to retire crates after a certain amount of time to add some kind of value to older items in the game. The value of 90% of items will drop significantly within a couple months usually when the next crate comes out then everyone is all about it so everyone all at once is trying to sell there older items and the value just tanks. The trade up system could be reworked I know they have plans to address that such as being able to trade up items of the same type from multiple crates right now you can only trade up items of the same value from the same crate and then you can get a random item from the next tier of that crate. An easy fix for that is a trade up requires 5 items of the same type so let people choose any 5 items of the same type from any crate and each item gives you a 20% chance of getting the next tier item from that crate so if I trade up two crate 1 rares one crate 2 rare and two crate 3 rares then I have a 40% chance of getting a very rare from crate 1 20% from crate 2 and 40% from crate 3. Not only is this fix simple and makes sense the only drawback Psyonix could see is there's so many rares very rares from older crates so people might buy a lot of them cheaper and take 4 rares from crate 1 and take 1 rare from whatever the newest crate at the time and have a 20% chance of getting very rare from the new crate which that percent isn't too high and I don't think that big of a deal the only thing that'd really do is increase and add some value to older items actually and just promote more trading in the game specially of older items. Would also be nice if you could get keys randomly too rather then having to buy keys.,Rocket League®

At first it might be hard to get a hang of it but after a few hours you should be able to do somewhat well. I recommend playing with bots at first until you get comfortable. The ranking system in this game sucks you in and makes you want to keep playing and ranking up. I'm not too great at the game but I've had tons of fun with it ever since I got it now I play with my friends in a party and it's amazing. P.S.

2016-08-15,0,0,614,False,Recommended,this one is hard to rate...its super adictive but is something missing here...TL/DR game is awesome but people leave as soon as they see that is a lost match... needs penalty for leavingpros well optimized. (i can play on my laptop that is not the best for gaming) car customization. 5 min games.(alot happens in those 5 min read point 1) good graphics. good music (but only on menu)cons leavers or afk on ranked match. (3v3 if someone leaves goes to 3v2 or 3v1 no bots allowed) no penalty for leaving games (read point 1) mute. (needs option to mute everyone except party created by the player some players talk in diferent language or just make noise and mute will on make you stop playing the game to mute them while in match) novice pro expert etc... (these labels are per levels i display expert in game and some ppl think i play like one no i'm casual player i like displaying expert but i may play bad like anyone else...)point 1 5 min games are the best you can play while waiting for someone or to make some time or play 1hr or more and play enough matches to get sick of playing but some times those 5 mins are the worst you can lose (or win) by 10 2 or sometimes after the first oposing team goal people leave and when that happens is hell bot enters player enters and leaves then bots enters and a loop can happed until someone enters and says well lets lose the fast and start over.people entering the match may lag the game too soo it gets worse...sometime when a guy leaves the luck or matchmaking he enters the same match again and again and again... and that is no help to win a match...,Rocket League®

It's one of those games that keeps you coming back for more.You build your own vehicle red and blue which you can further personalize with items you get from playing the game else you can buy the DLCs and unlock this really amazing vehicles such as the Batman Armored Car and the Back to the Future Lorean.If you're more of a serious gamer you can always join the Ranked matches and try your luck. However the best approach to the Ranked matches would be with a decent team after a couple of training sessions luck is not enough sometimes.This game is the gem of the realm in the indie genre.

2016-09-11,0,0,72,False,Recommended,My favorite and only sports game I own on steam.Pros Provides a huge learning curve for maximum replayibility. Full vehicle customization. Flying in cars and hitting balls is just as fun as it sounds. People still play it today. Awesome soundtrack and sound design. Cheap price compared to AAA games today.Cons Competitive matchmaking may not give you players in your skill range sometimes making the game frustrating to play after after a long period. PC controls are arguably terrible having a controller for this game is almost necessary.Another thing I like about this game is the fact that they are still updating it a year later that just capitilizes on how loyal the developers are to their community and fans which is always nice. Rocket League takes a good concept on paper and executes it spectacularly I only wish that there was more people to fill up competitive modes so there could be more accurate matchmaking. 9/10,Rocket League®

2016-04-21,0,0,1302,False,Not Recommended,I love this game so much. It will have a place in my heart forever. I've been playing since PS4 beta in Spring 2015. I started at a time where almost everyone was bad with the exception to the SARPBC players which controlled the top ranks. The days when skill brought you to the top.Now Rocket League lives in a dark age infested with smurfs and boosted accounts. There's huge amounts of inflated pockets within all ranks making the mid to higher ranks a cess pool of people getting lucky smurfs a very miniscule amount of people that are actually supposed to be there and finally the mechanically skilled players who are desperately grasping to any stategy that wins them the current game. I've seen no signs of Psyonix making plans to change this even something as small as adding it as an option for reporting. Yet when you see one of these smurfs out there who openly admits he's smurfing and you get frustrated and swear at him you get the day ban. Until I see signs of change I'm no longer reccomending the game to new players.,Rocket League®

2018-05-10,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Ok so rocket league is a gmae about cars and soccer and those two topics combined sounds cool the game is great and is fun to play with friends you will have a blast playing this game.,Rocket League®
2017-01-14,0,0,1368,False,Recommended,Do you like soccer? Do you like basketball? Do you like cars? Do you like competitive games that can also be casual and fun to play with friends? Do you like games with potentially thousands of hours of playtime before you get bored? If you answered yes to at least two of these you will LOVE Rocket League. This game is only $20(although I highly recommend some of the dlc as they are usually cheap and have cool cosmetics) but can provide so many hours of fun throughout. The premise is simple everybody has an unmanned car and much like soccer you hit the ball into the opponents' goal. You can jump use boost turn your car and eventually fly. Sounds simple right? Wrong. While it is a very simple game when you first start playing after you begin to master the basics this game turns out to be one of the most difficult to master competitive games on the market right now. To put it into perspective I have around 2 000 hours reached the highest competitive rank in season 3 and STILL am learning dozens of new tricks to improve my play both advanced and basic.Now why did I use those questions at the beginning? They were not questions entirely made to draw in a viewer they were quite legitimate.Do you like soccer? Now this one is basic the game revolves around rocket boosted vehicles in a soccer like format. There are jukes passing plays and saves much like any typical soccer match. You hit the ball into their goal and you score highest score at the end of a five minute match wins. If it is a tie then the game goes on forever until a team scores the winning shot. I personally am not a big fan of soccer but I will explain this in the next section.Do you like basketball? While I am not a fan of soccer the basketball aspect of Rocket League is what keeps me interested. While there is a Hoops gamemode in Rocket League that revolves around a basketball format I personally do not think it is very good and this is not what this section is about. Rocket League may be a soccer game in its purest form but a LOT of the mechanics are inspired by basketball. There are dunks air dribbles ceiling shots freestyling and more that will keep any non soccer fan interested in the long run. This game is not really a soccer game as much as it is a BALL game anything that is possible to do with a ball is possible in this game. TL DR Rocket league is a cheap game at $20 with an assortment of cheap yet high quality dlc. It appeals to people who already enjoy soccer but also appeals to people who enjoy basketball just as much. It is a casual game if you want it to be and a competitive game if you want it to be. It is very difficult to master requiring about as much effort as getting good in CS GO. There are also many gamemodes that have been released and are continuing to be released. Things such as Dropshot(break the floor tiles and score inside the floor) Rumble(basically Rocket League's Mario Kart Battle Mode) Hockey and Hoops. Well worth the $20 even if you only play it for a month.,Rocket League®

I will warn you itt is a sporting style game so if playing matches with the same style of play bores you then it isnt for you. If you are looking for a competitive fun and fast paced game then this just might be what you want. I am sure lots of you have ssn videos online at this point. It is quick to pick up but hard to master. Matchmaking is great you dont get players too far out of your level. bots are fun to mess around with and the AI is decent for solo play.,Rocket League®

2015-08-25,0,0,552,False,Recommended,This game is unreal. Very simple concept but the execution is so well done. The controls are great the visuals are stunning and even though it is an easy game to jump into mastering more advanced techniques is actually quite difficult. Be prepared for a learning curve if you want to go far in this game. Rocket League offers a bit of something for everyone even if you're not a huge soccer fan. The developers have put a ton of effort into this game and continue to do regular free updates. Anything you purchase is strictly cosmetic so it keeps the game fair.The only drawback I've found over my time spent playing this game is that the community can be pretty toxic. However this isn't always the case and the developers have been cracking down on the toxicity a bit more. Plus you have options to mute the various forms of chat in the game or all of them if you wish. Just try not to take things too personally and you should still have a lot of fun. I wouldn't let this discourage you from playing this game in any way. It is one of my favourites of all time!,Rocket League®

2016-06-29,0,0,1085,False,Recommended,Question number 1 (and only question ) )Should you buy this game? YES!Positives This game rewards training teamplay and overall skill! Cool and free updates to the game that will keep you entertaint FOREVER! Will get you hooked in about an hour or two. (god dammit I have no more life because of this game!) There is a huge amount of things to learn in this game! You will find that when you play it you will discover a new mechanic about the game every day! Huge amount of things to learn never get bored ( in principle )Negatives toxic players that will come to your house and strangle you when you are a bad player on their team. maps that differ from the normal set and are put into ranked can be annoying (cough cough neo tokyo) keyboard controls are quite crippling (controller recommended!)Overall this game is a lot of fun! And will keep you entertaint for a good amount of time.I recommend anyone to but this game if they are looking for a simple to learn game which is still hard to master!(Btw I hate football but love this game. If you don't like football too don't let that be a factor in your decision to buy this game!),Rocket League®

2017-11-17,0,0,847,False,Recommended,"Fun and challenging game filled with many possibilities. Like most online games though the designers have no fair match making system and continually team you with people that are no where near your skill level expecting you to carry them. The game features many great design concepts aimed at antagonizing opponents such as a calculator that says it's EZ or a salt shaker to make fun of people that get angry. If you retaliate against trash talkers they report you and you get banned. The game encourages unsportsmanlike behavior and punishes people that get reported enough regardless of what they say. The best way to play rocket league is with all forms of communication silence. Also if your game crashes during a match or you lose internet connection you will be banned for 15 minutes. This is their way of dealing with people that leave ranked matches. If you care about rank find friends to play with DO NOT PUG. From bronze to gold 2 there is a plethera of people that cannot play the game because they have been carried in rank by sleepers (players that are actually high ranked but intentionally lose games to lower their rank the community calls them smurfs for some reason nobody ing knows why). There is 0 customer support only automated messages. If you want to get your hands on rare items you must either purchase keys for chests or play the game enough to trade in about 100 items for a random shot at something shiny and flashy. Every couple of months a ""new"" map will be released or rather a new skin for a map. Upon it's launch the game had different sized arenas and even had a couple with circular walls or ramps on the sides but these were removed from the game at some point. The game is absolutely great but the community is toxic and filled with people that prefer the safety of their keyboads to unleash their inner trashy side. Remember if someone calls you a name antagonizes you or spams the chat box nothing will happen to them. If you make the misstake of saying anything back you get banned and psyonic will not hear what you have to say. They will even make you go through this condecending survey with grade school answers in order to dispute your claim. The game is the most insane jaw droppingly good fantastic experiences you'll ever have in gaming. But if you have a bad temper like me turn off communication.",Rocket League®

It blends an original game design fluid overall gameplay and a competitive element in such a way that I believe truly creates an absolute masterpiece. For the sake of a more complete review here's my list of pro's and con'sof Rocket League.Pro's + Very unique game concept (Not sure if it is the first however it is the most successful soccer battlecar game I've seen)+ Competitive (Embodies the phrase 'easy to learn impossible to master')+ Casual (Casual playlists and more lax game modes allow players to enjoy a more laid back Rocket League away from the firece competitive gameplay)+ Huge community (I'm from the Eastern U.S and it never takes more than thirty seconds to find a game in any given game mode)+ Customization (Some see this as a detraction being as customization is largely done through items aquired from crates. I personally don't mind opening crates if I have a little extra cash.)+ Ranking system (Despite its flaws nothing creates more of an adreneline rush than duking it out on a deciding game for your rank)Con's Ban system (Being as I only have roughly 10 hours on the PC at the time of writing this my experience with the ban system has yet to be seen. With that being said some people have spoken out against unwarrented bans usually stemming from an encounter in the game chat) Less than frienly players (With a large community you will run into to some very toxic people while playing. Had a rough game? Your teammate is more likely to type ""kys teammate"" as opposed to something friendly and encouraging. Ranking system (There have been claims of players being demoted after a single loss following a several game win streak. I've never personally encountered this so I cannot speak to the veracity of these claims however people have spoken out against this as well. Microtransactions (As I stated before I've never had an issure with spending small amounts of money on in game items especially when this game occupies a large amount of my spare time and only costed me $20 or so dollars. However if you are someone who despises microtransactions you may want to consider this) Time intensive (I see this as a positive but if you are someone who is not looking to invest hundreds/thousands of hours into a game then I'd consider whether spending your $20 here is the right decision) Final Verdict Through all of its flaws I personally love Rocket League. If you have the money I'd 100% recommend trying this game out and seeing if its for you. (I'm sure there are a pleathora of both pro's and con's that were overlooked in this review. However those that I listed are the pro's/con's I felt most strongly would sway a player toward or away from this game. I hope anyone reading this review can appreciate that)",Rocket League®

2016-01-22,0,0,385,False,Recommended,Where do I start!!!!! Well as a Gamer for over 24 year of my life I can honestly say I have never played a game as addictive as Rocket League. This game keeps me coming back! For me the game play is outstanding and let s face it that really is what makes a good game! The idea of a giant ball and cars racing around trying to score sounds crazy and yes it is a little crazy but once you start playing you will be hooked. There are lots of cars to choose from with various hop ups such as wheels aerials paint decor etc... However what makes this game is the multiplayer... hook up with some friends online create a party and there you have a perfect games night!!! There are various stadiums to play with different scenery and locations. There is also the additional mode Snow Day instead of playing with a ball you play on a ice rink with a giant hockey puck! The only slight issue for me is the limited loot as you play the game you unlock different items for your cars. However once you have unlocked all these then you receive no more items. I hope that they release rare drop items the more you play that would hook me in even more. So if you are reading this do yourself a favor buy Rocket League now... you will not be disappointed! Well done to the dev team who made this such a great game. Long live Rocket League ),Rocket League®

2017-12-13,0,0,125,False,Recommended,Yes this is my second game review. I am reviewing this cause it's a perfect game to play soccer &amp cars (with boosters) with a touch of playing offline season against CPU teams also online gameplay if you're truly skilled. This is a popular 2015 released game they have added a new stadium (check the Rocket League website which is ran by Psyonix check new releases in game or check updates on here if you're able to) and altered or added copies some previous stadiums (the following were Champions Field which only had a night version so they released a day version same for DFH Stadium) and plenty more. (You gotta read updates for lots of remaining stuff) If I am able to create my own tournament in I might as well call mine the Rocket Champions League (as related to UEFA Champions League only Rocket League version style) but not yet.,Rocket League®

2017-08-15,0,0,1055,False,Recommended,This game is one on my favourite ive played 509 hours of it and still love the gameplay . The customization options are endless with different cars for each player. Plus if you see a cool car in the dlc section they are fairly cheap and you can get all of the dlc you like for under 15euros. Dlc is cheap if you see 1 or 2 cars you think look really badass. Gameplay is fun and enjoyable.It can be fun but also competitive and stressfull you can go from meesing around do jokey stratagies to playing in ranked and trying to bet the best freestyler or dribbler.Overall very fun game even if it takes some time to get good at it.,Rocket League®

There is a Rating system in the game based on how much you play the game and when you rank up you play against better players and it provides you with a more fun gaming experience.

2016-07-18,0,0,33,False,Recommended,What can be said about Rocket League that hasn't already been said? If you're reading this and considering whether you should buy it you probably already know that you want it and you don't need over 78 000 other steam users to tell you that it's great.But if you do need convincing Rocket League is one of the only games I've played that makes me giddy with excitement. It's the only game that I've ever shouted at my screen in excitement rather than anger. It is the only game that has ever caused me to fist pump or throw my hands up exuberantly. Rocket League is a joyous and silly game that anyone can learn easily and play for fun while simultaneously having a high skill ceiling and great competition.Best of all it offers 4 player split screen which is great for 2v2 and you can take your friends online.,Rocket League®

2016-07-19,0,0,303,False,Recommended,As someone who likes soccer and cars this game is amazing! It's also amazing if you don't like soccer OR cars or hate both. You can throw 15 minutes 2 hours or half a day into this game without ever feeling bored. Every game is different and you're always learning new tricks and getting better. Pros Length Fun good length games allow you to play a single match or two dozenCoop Good for coop with friends you can play doubles or triples so doesn't even matter how many friends you have!Interesting Soccer... cars... together they make for a great concept!Customization You can customize car colours decorations etc. and some of them are pretty funny!Cons Steep learning curve if you hop online you start barely being able to hit the ball although you pick it up quick.Matchmaking online sometimes you'll get matched against a team of hardcore veterans who destroy you and sometimes you get matched against a group of new players who you feel bad destroying. The balance is a biiiit off sometimes,Rocket League®

2016-01-24,0,0,191,False,Recommended,This game is amazing. You can either pick it up for 10 minutes or for 4 hours and never get bored of it. Nothing beats the feeling of hitting a crazy aerial or breaking ankles and dribbling it in for the goal. Part of what makes this game so great is the developers. Psyonix has consistently shown they are in touch with the community and the difference between them and a company like Valve is obvious. They reverted a change within a day of making it when there was some backlash from the community they run the subreddit for gods sakes (and they do a great job at it). So different from the games I normally play but definitely one of my favorites. 10/10,Rocket League®

The Dev's have done a great job molding this game into something that is not only just playable and fun for a short time like a novelty item but for long time players and over time they have optimized this game in an incredible way. Awesome graphics A LOT of customization easy to use interface intense and very competitive gameplay 5 min games which makes it a fast paced game with low queue times regular free updates (which most of the time make perfect sense) and a great music soundtrack to play by. Oh also I can't forget about the awesome training simulator they have set up. Spend some time training with their pre set simulators or try your hand at other players customized training sessions. Great Add on!I myself only have around 200 hours invested and I do not see myself taking a break anytime soon. With every game there are some negatives. While I can't think of too much at the moment I can say that the whole having to buy keys to open the crates thing may be a turn off to some players but you don't need to spend money on keys to be a great competitive player. If you can buy the keys then you should The Devs deserve the $ because I'm convinced that they will continue to invest our $ in making this game better and better. They have already proved themselves.I could go on for another hour but I have some things to do so I will leave you with this. For $20USD I would definitely invest in trying this out. If it is going to break your bank watch some insane players stream their matches. You will get a good idea on the framework. Enjoy and I hope this helped!

2016-12-24,0,0,20,False,Recommended,Just...just one more game. Rocket League has exploded in popularity and is the driving and football simulator you've (never realised you've) been waiting for! I'm just going to warn you guys that I suck at this game so I don't really have any review of the more advanced level of play. And even without an advanced level of play I have a great time. Even though I can barely hit the ball and a goal eludes me at all times I still have an amazing time. I can easily recommend this game to anybody who isn't too easily frustrated or put off by the mostly multiplayer only focus. However even here there's a single player season against AIs which is great if you want a break from sucking and want to practice/start winning.,Rocket League®

2016-11-16,0,0,400,False,Recommended,A very finely tuned car football game (if it can be called that?) with extremely precise mechanics which allow you to hit the ball as badly or as creatively as you can once you understand the controls. I feel like I've hit a plataeu of skills but I'm always improving which helps in appreciating the effort the eSports mega players put in and their precision and timing. Customizeable vehicles is a great additional although it would be nice to have a few more stock decals rather than spending so much time trading and buying keys for only a chance to get what you paid for... but in saying that I gotten a few exotics and legendary items already using the seasonal event keys but they're non tradeable.

2017-02-21,0,0,1600,False,Recommended,In my opinion Rocket League is one of the most interesting games on the market because of the physics and the replayability of the game. When you play on a 1 versus 1 game you can enjoy the game but you can also be mad as because of your oponent who is literally roasting you BUT the game become really interesting when you are playing with some mates and enjoying the moment where you are making a random pass aand one of your teammates come out of nowhere and just scored.Basically this game is Just AWESOME !// À mon avis Rocket League est l'un des jeux les plus intéressants sur le marché en raison de la physique et la rejouabilité du jeu. Lorsque vous jouez sur un jeu 1 contre 1 vous pouvez profiter du jeu mais vous pouvez aussi être fou comme baiser à cause de votre adversaire qui est littéralement torréfaction mais le jeu devient vraiment intéressant lorsque vous jouez avec certains copains et profiter du moment où vous Font une passe aléatoire et un de vos coéquipiers sort de nulle part et vient de marquer.En gros ce jeu est juste ENORME // OH MY GOD YOU STUPID RUSKI PIDAR FRIES MC DAWAI!!!!!!!!!!!!! //,Rocket League®
2017-02-21,0,0,64,False,Recommended,It's not often that a PC game comes designed so well for not just split screen but custom split screen.Having purchased this game on PS4 and PC I can safely say that while the PC players are much easier to beat especially those using keyboard and mouse (this is very much a controller game) the most important feature of the PC version is the config file.From the config file you can set a custom resolution which in my case meant setting it to fit my dual monitors so that the vertical split screen was effectively two separate screens something I wish the PS4 version would allow.I am also happy to say that the server issues are nowhere near as bad as the PS4 version with almost every match being completely lag free (I still don't know why the PS4 struggles with my 16 ping).So in short if you're thinking of buying this but you're being put off because you already have the PS4 version I assure you this is a worthwhile purchase though it is important to note that only Player 1 can sign in all others with be Username1 Username2 etc.Hopefully the Steam version will add the multi account feature of the PS4.And yes I know the game is on XBox One but I don't own the game on it so I can't really talk about it.Tldr Great game for split screen but if you want to progress separately get the PS4 version (one PS+ Membership required for online play).,Rocket League®

2017-06-06,0,0,396,False,Recommended,Extremely simple and straightforward game yet with a seemingly unending layer of depth and complexity.When you start playing this game you're going to miss the ball and miss easy saves. 10 hours later you will be hitting the ball much more consistently and starting to score more goals. Soon you'll start telling yourself Hey I'm getting pretty good at this game! This is only when you realize you've only scratched the surface of Rocket League.As you start getting better at hitting the ball towards the net you will realize the opponents will start to get better at blocking the shot. You need to get more creative with your shots juke the opponent out dribble the ball ontop of your car go for an extremely crazy arial shot. Learning these things and perfecting your technique takes countless hours of practice.Rocket League is one hell of an experience. It is an amazing game that you can start having fun in right from the beginning. This game will make you eager for more because you will want to get better and improve your skills. You will become better and better just by dropping hours of enjoyment into this game and that's what makes it great. Give this game a try it is definitely worth your time and money.,Rocket League®

I'm not much of a sports gamer but after seeing so many high scores and comments about this I decided to go and give it a try. Now it's up there among my favorites from this current generation of games. With so many customization options you can have almost as much fun designing your vehicle as you can scoring goals. The one big catch is that you'll need a controller in order to properly play this you CAN use a keyboard and mouse but it's not recommended to play that way (I have tried this and can confirm it is a lot easier with a controller.) Easy to play and highly addictive this is easily worth the price tag.,Rocket League®

Rocket League is an awesomely accessible game that anyone can play and super addictive. This game is best played on a controller for optimal enjoyment. The Devs do an awesome job of adding content that is free and also some paid. At the cost of the title I can totally understand paying for content but I love that it's not required to enjoy the game to it's fullest. My only gripe would be the connection issues I have a perfect ping most times and I still see connection issues and crashing every fourth or fifth match.

On pubs you can be a part of an all rookie team against a team of higher ranks.Putting effort in competetive. It doesn't matter. If you join a team of weaker players you can't avoid getting a bad score in competetive. Your goals assists defends and so on don't matter just the wins. (At the time of writing this it was December of 2016 so it might have changed I haven't played it lately)I'm not sure if I can recommend it with the broken balancing but I am sure you can have fun with it.

2016-09-19,0,0,4,False,Recommended,"This is it one of the most hyped games since Destiny in 2015. If you ask ""What on earth is Rocket League?"" have you been on the internet recently?What on earth is Rocket League?Basically football/soccer for petrolheads.What do you do in Rocket League?Football with Cars.What is the Plot?FOOTBALL. WITH. CARS.How does it play?FOOT... oh wrong question.Actually easier than I thought. Of Course at the beginning it is quite hard to keep the car or the ball under control but after a few games you get used to the gameplay very quickly. Don t try to play this with a steering wheel though. Not a good idea.How does it look?Thanks to Unreal this looks very gorgeous. The arenas look awesome the textures are very sharp and the effects like boost flames look gorgeous.Car Customization?Yes. But it could have more options. You can customize your car in Bodies Stickers Wheels Boost Effects ""Hats"" and Antennas. The first two (which are for me the most important ones) are only limited. There are only like 15 bodies to choose from although I have to admit that they look very nice. And also there are about 15 stickers for each car but they are all the same. You get these parts by gaining XP through games and special moves in those games.Worth the hype?As an initial hater of this game I say yes. It is very fun It looks awesome is at least original and is another kind of ""Easy to do hard to master"".Worth the emone?To be honest I wouldn t buy this game for over 10 dollars. Wait for a sale to buy this.There is DLC is this Pay 2 Win?Nein the DLCs are only optical stuff like new bodies.The End?Yes. It s cool and fun.""I like playing with my balls and with cars here you can do both at the same time ( ʖ ) 10/10 it s okay""",Rocket League®

I personally put off getting it for a while as I really don't like Football games but this little gem is anything but a football game. Ok sure there are goals a ball and a pitch but that's where the similarities end. The moment you fly through the air boosting your little car wildly towards a falling ball and then smashing it into the opponents goal is the moment you realise just how mental (in a good way) this game is. The gameplay is varied and frantic but also balanced and exciting. I cannot really find the words to accurately express how much I really like this game so I'll conclude with It's frickin' awesome get it now!,Rocket League®

2017-05-14,0,0,22,False,Recommended,Ever wanted to play football outside but you were to lazy? Then you should buy Fifa not this. But if you ever wanted to play football with a F*CKING CAR! Then this game is for you! at first you will be welcomed by not being able to touch the ball for the whole match for about 1 day to a week. After you pass the rage and the steep parts of the learning curve now it will be your turn wrecking noobs and scoring insane areial goals (only if you have time left from trying to trade to mystery decals and opening crates that will guarantee you a 99.99% key loss). Watch as the game sucks you in to opening crates by giving you 1 CRATE FOR EVERY 2 4 HOURS OF MATCHES! So they must probably guarantee a nice item? Right...? Well the answer is f*ck you! Get ready to have rare decals worth 0.1 key rain on you from each crate!Overall I would recommend this game to everyone (who doesn't have a short temper) but don't open crates... just don't! Keep your keys (that you totally didn't buy for cheaper and skipped the 7 day trade ban by buying online) to just trade for the item you wanted!Gameplay 9.5/10Community 6/10Addictiveness 9/10Controls 10/10Competitive 8.5/10Microtransactions/Crates luck/purchase justification 3/10Best played With friendsThanks for reading!

I know that they need to make money on the game but still all the cool stuf is in crates. I think there shoud be candy corns coud be called rocket coins and that you get 1 per game you win. with the rocket coins you shal be abel to buy decripters toppers crates and boosts. I think a decripter is worth 100 wins/rocket coins a crate like 50 toppers 20 and boosts 25 75. I ll rate this game 8/10 but still love this game so much. Please Psyonix see this.,Rocket League®

2017-10-25,0,0,1050,False,Recommended,An innovative and fun idea that gives you hours of compelling gameplay. Rocket League is a well designed game tha has dozens of complexities and skills ranging in difficulty it gives a challenging ladder to climb through different ranks and skill levels learning all the way. The cosmetics of this game are spectacular with a community driven in game fully fledged market. This game has provided hours of gameplay all equally as enjoyable as the last this game is amazing.Another amazing part of Rocket League is it's professional player base who are all amazing to watch and the E Sports tournaments are spectacular really allowing people to get behind their favourite teams and support them. Overall Great game! The community can be quite toxic but you do get used to it though.,Rocket League®
2016-02-05,0,0,2118,False,Recommended,I do not like racing games or sports games very much. But I LOVE Rocket League. This is worth a test no matter what gaming background you come from.Additions after playing 1300 hours What makes Rocket League great * Very easy to pick up EXTREMELY hard to master* Fun as a party game with your friends most people love the chaoticness before people start to learn the mechanics* A good e sport no balancing issues perfect spectator game (very little specific knowledge about the game is needed to enjoy watching it) and infinite ways to improve your skill* The developers listens to the community provide awesome (both paid and free) content patches bugs/issues very frequently and constantly tries to improve the game* While there's no official mod support yet people are free to do whatever they like as long as it doesn't alter multiplayer game play. This has spawned awesome mods/tools such as RLMapLoader RocketLeagueTrainer and bakke's mod.* The community is very friendly and helpful (despite many people complaining about the toxic player base that all e sport have). The subreddit is very active both from the community and the devs.,Rocket League®

2015-12-03,0,0,38,False,Recommended,My full review is here https //commaeightcommaone.wordpress.com/2015/12/02/rocket league review/This game combines two kinds of games very well arcade racing and arcade soccer. I was on the fence myself for awhile but I'm glad I picked it up. It is simply fun to play. It isn't very complicated either you don't have to be particularly great at soccer or racing to enjoy it. But it still has some nice customization options a season mode Ranked play for those who want to play with the advanced crowd and even split screen for when you have people over. Just make sure if you are going to play locally with friends you own multiple compatible game pads. You can't use the Keyboard for player 1 and a game pad for player 2. That and a lack of LAN play are really the only major caveats. Other than those complaints it's easily one of the best releases you'll play this year. It really is worth the praise it gets. Accessible to everyone and rewarding for people who get competitive as well. Plus you can do air stunts and who doesn't love those?,Rocket League®

You will chase a ball like a Golden Retriever and there will always be that single heaving locomotion secreting the nowhere voices moments dribbling drops of enthusiasm abstracted and you at the trough with everyone else lapping it all up greedily.You will be rich you'll have the jewels and latest adornments. You'll be a gaudy fire spewing prize fighter lacquered and liquored like every eve is New Year's Eve. The sun will burn anyone who sees you even at night.

Usually goes on sale or is available at a reduced price somewhere.Cons Horrible lag handling.Personal experience It's a little difficult at first but it slowly becomes easier with experience.There is the occasional encounter of an online but that's the nature of many multiplayer games.I have paid a little bit above $50 on this game overall (DLC and crates included) and have received almost everything I could have asked (including two import cars and a black market decal).

Even if you're not into sports games you'll love it. There's something special about rocket league. It's an easy game to jump into but a very difficult game to master. And due to the short five minute games (not counting OT) it's a game that you'll have played for hours thinking that you've only been playing for thirty minutes. Highly reccomend.,Rocket League®

2018-04-03,0,0,321,False,Recommended,Simply put it's an incredible mix between RC Car battles soccer and hockey.This game is something I never even thought would be a game at all let alone a viable one to last as long as it has. However through its persistent updates DLC and pro league scene it's a game that will stay alive for a while to come. The matches themselves can be some of the most fun you can ever have that is if you allow yourself to have that fun. It is easy to get yourself caught up in a mistake and ruin your great time so if you do mess something up acknowledge it and move along. A personal favorite aspect is the car customization options available. There's a wide variety of vehicles you can choose from the slim and long Breakout to the bulky Merc. There are also loads of cosmetic options available to you with decals paint finishes boosts etc. Along with that the amount of ways you can play the game stay on the ground jump around or fly like a lunatic encourage a creative side of you to try different ways to score a goal. You're not going to find a story but instead several ways to tweak and improve your playstyle from car type to flight and everything in between.There are some things that could be worked on. A prime example is hit detection. While it is great in a game as competitive as this it needs to be near flawless. A friend of mine has often had issues where he sees himself going through the ball expecting to hit it. Another one is a server issue. While rare there will be instances where you thought you'd be driving up to the ball and all of a sudden you're upside down in the airon the opposite side of the map with no indication of being bumped.The community for the game shows very little negative behavior (at least in my experience) but you may find yourself in a game alone as people leave while they start to lose relatively badly. This leads to constant mid game joining which not only causes a severe lag but can also lead to frustration for not having a fair fight. Luckily you do have a bot system to work with you while those slots are empty so it won't feel entirely unfair.Overall this combination of RC cars playing soccer with hockey rules is among my favorites in my library and I absolutely recommend you TAKE THE SHOT!,Rocket League®

For the simplicity of the idea of rocket cars playing football the game has a surprising depth of mechanics which allow for all kinds of redirects dribbles flicks and various shots etc.For the first few hours of gameplay it can be frustrating as to begin with everyone struggles to hit the ball at higher speeds. After putting some time into the game you gain confidence in different styles of shots and begin playing the competitive matches whilst further developing your mechanical skill. The competitive system uses individual ranks for the different playlists (solo duel 1v1 doubles 2v2 solo standard 3v3 and standard 3v3) meaning you are not limited to a singular rank that matches you against everybody it will depend on your performance within that match type. This makes the ranking system fairer as you don't need to worry about more difficult opponents in playlists where you are less confident or play less frequently than others.Car customisation is vast and the trading economy is very healthy (although outdated crates will be dropped to you sometimes in matches which are worth next to nothing and cannot be removed from your inventory unless traded away) If you aren't happy with the level of customisation there is a free software called Alpha Console in which you can select any paint type color and decals etc but this will only be visible to you ingame.,Rocket League®

2015-09-02,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,I received Rocket League as a free bonus for pre ording steam hardware and as a huge fan of fast paced team based games I was looking forward to trying it out.One of the first things that stood out as a huge positive for me was that you could not build your car to be better or faster which means that if you want to get better at the game you have to improve your own skills. More games need to adopt this philosophy.For the first couple hours it was fun but after that it steadily got boring and annoying. The boring part is the lack of overall strategy. After playing around 100 games 90% of the goals were scored from either clearing the ball from one end of the field to the other or just knocking it into the round corner and letting the borders do the work of centering the ball infront of the goal. Having the corners rounded benefits the attacking team so much that there is no need for an alternate strategy so that's what everyone does... every game.... I truly believe that they need to have separate stadiums with square corners to promote other possible methods of attack.The annoying part is the socc... I mean beach ball. Each match is 5 minutes long and it seems like the ball is floating in the air for about 4 and 1/2 of it. So you are left a choice of either using up your boost to reach higher and get an aerial hit or join the mosh pit of cars that are trying to reach it jumping from the ground. If those things don't seem like that big of a deal to you than your going to like this game. I however just kept losing interest the more I played it mainly for those reasons.Oh and I forgot to mention the community. A team based game should have a good community to back it up however the community for this is terrible. One of the many reasons why is that there are A LOT of immature pre teens mouthing off every chance they get. (At least the the game has an option to turn off voice communications).Overall 5/10 (I personally would not recommend it for $20 maybe $10),Rocket League®

2016-04-27,0,0,1374,False,Not Recommended,I love this game without a doubt this is the best game i have repeatedly come back too and always had fun. Before the hoops update i had encountered crashes when i scored (rarely) and when ive been blown up (most common) and this has cause my computer to crash unexpectedly and spoil the fun. This may be a issue with my computer alone but when the hoops update got released i did not only crashed at being blown up but i am now crashing at people boosting which to me is the unplayable point. I am not going to slag off this game as it is my favourite game to enjoy on steam and it is a shame that i can not further enjoy it as the ways of my computer crashing is becoming too high Unfortunately i have to stop playing this game until it is fixed (if it is ever fixed) and have to find another entertaining game at the same level. For those interested in solving this issue i think it is my graphics driver that is crashing but i am unsure. My graphics card is a gtx 750 and i am interested if anyone else has experienced this issue aswell.i rate this 9/10**edit**Well the issue was fixed when i got my new pc so im gonna guess that it was a problem with my graphics card or some heating related issues but even with this problem fixed i still can't recommend the game as matchmaking is now broken. Matchmaking consists of people leaving and getting stuck with bots that dont get replaced i still get the match canceled issue when someone who has reserved a space doesn't join in time toxic/immature community (this isn't pysonix's fault but still a major drawback because of issue no. 1 so in turn they have part the blame) terrible servers which makes the whole experience much worse(this is not a salty complaint there has been many occasions that i have hit the ball but instead it warps around my car as it did not update fast enough for everyone so i didn't hit the ball and has lead to many missed saves)Overall since my last review my opinion of the game has lowered as this is unnacceptable for a game that is supposed to be considered an Esport when you can't even get past platinum rank without one of the issues happening.I rate 3/10 until the fixable problems are fixed.,Rocket League®

The controls are fully customizable as well as the design of your car. On top of that there are a bunch of different car bodys to choose from. A huge thing for me is that this game isn't pay to win all you have to is practice to be the best. I do recommend using a controller over a keyboard in which this game is fully compatable with a controller. The only thing I wish they could improve is the ranked system. I have won 18/20 games and still haven't ranked up past my division. Besides that this is probably my favorite pc game.,Rocket League®

As games age especially online competitive games the casual players move on and the ""professionals"" move in. The matchmaking system for this game worked great in the beginning but there haven't been many improvements to the matchmaking system from what I can see.

2016-11-23,0,0,374,False,Recommended,It's football/soccer crossed with rocket propelled cars. What's not to like? It's an easy game to learn but a hard one to master. After having played for almost 300 hours (210 on PC and close to 100 on PS4) I'm still having a lot of fun with the game...I'm also still really bad at it. The basic gist of it is to try and get the ball into your opponents goal. You car is equipped with a rocket that lets pick up speed rapidly as well as lets you fly through the sky (and maybe even hit the ball once you get good enough). Each match has a 5 minute timer but games can last significantly longer than that depending on how many goals each team scores (the game time pause between each goal so it can take longer to finish the match if you score a lot of goals). The team with the most goals once the 5 mintues is up is the winner however if the teams draw the game goes into overtime in which it is the first team to score a goal wins.Although the game is multiplayer focused you can play on your own against the game's AI in an exhibition match or take on a season where you play games back to back against other AI controlled teams. There is also freeplay available for you to mess around in as well as some training levels to help hone your skills.Even though the game has been out for a little over a year it seems the developers are still heavily invested in the game and it looks like they have plans to support it for years to come. Since it's launch there has been a ton of free and paid DLC with the paid DLC being cosmetic only. The free DLC has been new maps game modes and minor cosmetics like flags for your antenna hats for the roof of your car and new wheels to roll around in. The devs have also released free holiday themed items that you can only get at certain times of the year as their way of celebrating the holidays with the players.A few months ago the devs also introduced microtransactions into the game. Crates drop randomly after a match (the crates drop separately from your normal items so don't think your missing out on items because of them) and you can then use a key to open them. Much like with CSGO and TF2 there are different crates that hold different items and upon opening a crate you randomly receive one of the items from the crate's item list. This can be a new set of wheels a new boost trail a new decal for you car or even a completely new body for one of the cars. Keys themselves are what you are paying for though you are never forced to do so at any point. You could potentially trade items with other players to get keys and open crates that way if you prefer. Of course these crates are a completely optional part of the game so much so that you can turn of notifications for the crates in the options menu so it seems like they are never there to begin with. Unfortunately the items found in crates can only be obtained from crates at the time of writing this so if you want an item from a crate you'll either have to trade someone for the item or for a key to open a crate to have a chance at the item. You currently can't craft into the items or have them randomly drop for you. However as mention before all paid content is simply cosmetic. You can't buy yourself into a faster car or one with more boost.At the time of writing this it was also just announced that the game will be receiving Steam Workshop support very soon.There are also online ranked playlist available for the more competitive people out there. It allows you to compete with other players of similar skill with the goal being to progress through the ranks each season. At the end of a seaon you are awarded an item that differs depending on your rank. In seasons 1 for example crowns were awarded to players bronze crown for bronze players silver for silver players gold for gold players and a platinum one for platinum players. In season 2 players were awarded a boost trail. Season 3 rewards at the time of writing this are unknown. Even though you may like the look of a certain reward from a certain rank in the competitive playlists it's always in your interest to aim for the highest rank you can achieve as you will also receive the rewards for the ranks lower to your highest reached ranked.After reading this if you are still unsure about the game think about perhaps waiting it out and trying it during a free weekend. It's unknown when the free weekends are/will be but there are has been one in the past and there will most likely be another in the future.,Rocket League®

2016-10-13,0,0,3,False,Recommended,I have this game on console and I love it! I wanted to get it on PC because a majority of the players play PC but my computer was just not ready for it. It was a really good game and I do highly recommend it but I find it very hard to run for computers not designed for gaming.P.S. It probably isn't that hard to run I just MacBook Air... therefore it will only handle games like CS GO and Dota... sadly... Minecraft.,Rocket League®

2016-10-15,0,0,216,False,Recommended,This game is great and you should buy it. If you're concerned about the recent introduction of microtransactions keep reading Recently Psyonix introduced a CS GO esque microtransaction system which means players now can pay money for a chance to receive premium cosmetic items for their car. There are pros and cons to this new system which I will try my best to illustrate below Pros Lot's of cool new cosmetic items have been introduced Microtransactions will provide Psyonix the stable income needed to provide more free content (Stadiums game modes etc.) Microtransactions will give psyonix an incentive to keep creating new and cool items for our cars even if we do have to pay to get them. These microtransactions do not hinder gameplay.Cons As of now there is no way to freely acquire these premium cosmetic items. This is the most valid complaint players have with this newest system which I personally believe should be addressed. Even if we have to play 100 games to receive a key us players would appreciate having a free means of obtaining cool crap for our cars. A surge bunch of whining microtransaction phobic players in the playerbaseIf you cannot tolerate any microtransactions in your game whatsoever then this game isn't for you. Otherwise I believe this game is more than worth your time.,Rocket League®

2018-03-09,0,0,78,False,Recommended,Great game with hours of fun to follow!Pros Hours of fun to be had Alot of customized options for cars Detailed maps (Aqua Dome Wasteland Starbase and lets not forget Neo Tokyo ) Alot of good music to listen to while looking through your inventory customizing your cars or just waiting in the main menu for a matchCons Matchmaking can be frustrating at times and will place you against more experienced players (ie. Master Rocketeer) Some players have TUNNEL VISON and just chase after the ball the whole match. As well as don't support their fellow team mates when it comes to DEFENDING the NET!!!!!Overall I think this game is great for playing on your free time and it can really get you hooked! I started playing this game and before you know it i had put a good 40+ hours into the game! I recommend you all play with friends because it makes alot more fun working togther!

Just a good game with cars that hit a giant Soccer ball. The game is great for casual and competitive players alike. Various updates are free and at the moment there is no freeware concept that other similar games have. This makes it nice knowing there are no restrictions on items anyone can get them all it takes is time.Edit They now have crates and a loot system but it is so well done that its great. The crates aren't neccesary so you don't feel like you need every item in the game. Also there are no real advantages of crates so no downfall if you dont collect them. Overall great game cant put it down. Just. One. More. Game.,Rocket League®

2015-12-25,0,0,420,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a very innovative and creative game with its own twist on car football. The game takes skill in flying and different shots but if you put in enough hours it becomes highly enjoyable. The developers are still eagerly working on Rocket League so there is always loads of new content and DLC's that come with new achievements. You can play with PlayStation owners on their consoles which is a first that I know of it and really transformed the gameplay. And the game modes are insane. However because it is a popular game the community is very sour and distasteful. What started as an awesome game is now ruined by someone calling you all the names under the sun when you score a goal. And gaming communities help make the gaming experience so if you turn that off you take away some of the enjoyment of the game. It would be nice if developers of games such as Rocket League would ban players who consistently offend but hey ho...Overall a fantastic game that I 100% recommend but just get ready to be roasted for no apparent reason.,Rocket League®

2018-01-31,0,0,408,False,Recommended,This game is IMO the best game you can get right now on steam if you want a fun competitive experience. pros the game is very rewarding to players willing to put in enough time. the community for the most part is very nice and supportive. this is great game to play with friends (me and my friends always have a great time when we play)cons the matchmaking in casual is trash. the RNG is kinda t (but for the most part its fine)thats about it i really love this game and i recommend it to anyone wanting a good competitive game,Rocket League®
2018-01-31,0,0,1097,False,Recommended,So at the time im writing this I have 660+ hours into the game and I can't honestly say that this game hasn't frustrated me made my hammer my hand at the table almost made me throw my controller but that's because I love it so much. The game is truly amazing and at least to me it just never gets old. I'm not very used to review games but I thought I would try now.So what's good? Hours of gameplay Teamwork and good sessions with friends Very copetivtive and rewarding Has a crate system for you gamblers out there It's awesome to progress get better and win and that's what keep me coming backWhat's less good? The laggy servers The very toxic community (with exceptions of course)All in all this is a very good game and I will rate it very soild 10/10 stars.Still here? Buy it already ),Rocket League®
2018-01-31,0,0,348,False,Not Recommended,"I have mixed emotions about giving Rocket League a ""No"" vote.The game has a great concept and can be a lot of fun.I bought Rocket League as soon as it came out on Steam. I played Nosgoth(a different game that Psyonix worked on) and I loved it so I decided to give Rocket League a try. It was a great choice I've had a lot of fun in Rocket League.For the last few months though there seems to be far too much lag and desync in games. When I played the game casually it wasn't an issue but as I've started to play more and taken the time to get decent and learn how to fly dribble and some of the other less basic things the desync makes the games more frustrating than fun.Multiple times a game I'll fly/drive right through a ball or a boost or another player and it wont register. It makes for a very annoying experience.I regularly have 20ping and 144fps in game but it still feels laggy.If you just want a game that's fun to kill small spans of time with friends I'd honestly still recommend this game but with a caveat Don't take it seriously and don't try to get competitive. Unless you're playing on LAN the game just doesn't feel smooth and isn't an enjoyable competitive experience.",Rocket League®

When you make your first goal and watch that ball explode everyone away from the goal as your name is plastered on the screen you will be hooked. Even though you messed up one hundred times before then.What makes the game great in my opinion is the level playing field. There is no RNG no stupid powerups no weapon loadouts no pay to win nonsense. Every player gets a similarly handling vehicle and there is collectible boost on the stages. That's it. The only thing seperating players is their skill level. The various techniques are nothing but an application of the resources available to all.

The game is competitive and there isn't much randomness you just know it's your fault for losing (except in rare situations when you play against noobs who get lucky bounces).Coming from Counter Strike Global Offensive I need getting used to the controls and I strongly suggest playing with a controler or binding your boost and jump keys something that's NOT on your mouse.Also change your FOV to max.,Rocket League®

The matchmaking does a good job of pairing players with similar skill levels so newcomers don't feel overwhelmed.

I'm still dubious as to wether Psyonix actually deal with the trolls reported through the report function. One of the most cancerous and troll ridden communities to surface in a long time. Racist comments sexist comments flatout hurtful comments... you name it it's incredibly tiring and trying (chat off guys) and I have yet to get a proper reply from Psyonix through social media (i sent screenshots of the verbal abuse to prove the point) which is a shame. It's a shame because this game...is incredible. It's really easy to pick up but difficult to master. ""Let's play for 30 minutes"" turns into 2 hours. Playing with friends is that much more fun.

2018-02-16,0,0,1151,False,Recommended,After having spent a countless number of hours on this game and being a diamond player I think that I'm finally at liberty to review the gem that is Rocket League.The gameplay is incredible. It has a very small learning curve so players that have just picked it up can already have a blast playing it. Not to mention all hours of practice pay off on this game and your improvement can be very noticeable.The controls are very similar to any other racing game you might play and even using kb/m the controls are very forgiving however I do still recommend using a controller for a more fun experience and simpler mechanics. The graphics are absolutely stunning and completely underrated. The breathtaking scenery complements the atmosphere of the game perfectly without bothering you throughout your playthrough.The community may be the only downside to this otherwise terrific game. Matching up with teammates that criticize you for every little mistake or even go so far as to intentionally score on your own goal is not a rare sight and at higher ranks could happen very frequently. The easiest way to get by the ranks is to work with your teammate not against.TL DRGameplay 10/10Controls 9/10Graphics 10/10Community 7/10Overall 9/10get this game,Rocket League®

2017-04-26,0,0,1823,False,Recommended,the gameplay itself is flawless. Extremely fun to play. for 20 bucks you cant beat it. But the matchmaking seems to be completely the higher rank you get.

Dont mean to discourage anyone from buying it its worth way more than they ask imo i just hope someday they can implement a more in depth ranking system than just wins cause having to rely on a in semipro whos played 15hrs when your playing masters with 300+hrs to rank up is just plain stupidity,Rocket League®

2015-08-11,0,0,122,False,Recommended,Rocket League is incredible. It's the first no t game in a long while. Stripping away the nonesense that plagues the current industry like pre order bonuses DLC that adds no real value to the game etc. Rocket League creates a competitive and fun game that can be understood by anyone instantly.It's a game that's so easy to pickup and play and difficult to master but the constant earning of new items makes the game all the more fun. In contrast to other popular competitve games a single round of Rocket League will take no more than 7 minutes of your time perfect for anyone who needs a quick break from work or wants to do something whilst waiting for someone/something. Mastering the different types of goals saves and manoeuvres as you play makes it all very rewarding.Some may find this game monotonous and repetitive but the same can be said for any game that has a set map and objectives such as DOTA2 CSGO or LOL. However as all the metagame has been stripped out and the focus is on straight teamwork and personal skill it lends itself to being an intense and engaging eSports game that makes it equally fun to watch as it is to play.Buy this game. It is worth every penny at full price and if you're lucky to get it on sale you can have endless fun.,Rocket League®

2017-05-18,0,0,498,False,Recommended,"Overall the game is very amusing and i recommend everyone who is thinking of buying rocket league. It's a very easy concept you customize a car and you smack some balls. It's an example of a game which all developers should adapt to KISS (Keep It Simple And Stupid) ""most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated."" Wikipedia KISS principle. This is exactly the case with rocket league it's simple and fun while being fairly balanced (you're not 100% forced into a specific spec). Every game takes about 5 minutes which isn't a lot of time... that's a lot of matches! Various game modes give you a variety in gameplay choices. Don't want to play tryhard ranked or a normal match? Try out hockey basketball or any other random mode.First of Cars. The first thing you need to know is car stats http //wiki.teamliquid.net/rocketleague/List_of_car_statsWhile cars are pretty much the same with regard to turn / boosting their hitboxes vary a lot. Some are very long while others are wider. Every car has it's pro and con try them all and see what kind of car you prefer. Some cars are also pretty much reskins of other cars (stats are pretty much the same). The 'best' cars for ranked seem to be Batmobile/mantis dominator/ice charger and the octane/RSZ. Endo and merc also seem fairly good... but as said overall you can choose which car you drive just try them out and see which one suits your playstyle. You can customize your cars with hats and such and the best thing the car's hitbox doesn't change. So you're free to put anything on your car there are so many possibilities!Next up is the learning curve (as the game itself is fairly simple). The game DOES have a learning curve but it isn't quite as hard as you think. You simply don't drive around 24/7 chasing balls and touching every ball you see you're most likely bronze / silver (even higher ranks still do this). A great tip look up a lot of YT RL training videos on various topics (air dribble defense / offense ...). This will help you out a lot and utilise the tutorials which are in game available they really pay of.ELO System / ranked gameplay first of you NEED to know the basic of an ELO system ""The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players. player's Elo rating is represented by a number which increases or decreases depending on the outcome of games between rated players. After every game the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. In a series of games between a high rated player and a low rated player the high rated player is expected to score more wins. If the high rated player wins then only a few rating points will be taken from the low rated player. However if the lower rated player scores an upset win many rating points will be transferred. The lower rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self correcting. A player whose rating is too low should in the long run do better than the rating system predicts and thus gain rating points until the rating reflects their true playing strength."" Wikipedia ELO rating system (https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)Everyone in ranked is a number rather than a rank (456 instead of silver 2 div 2 for example).You can find your own ELO ranking on various websites go to google and type in RL rank. any 'tracker' or 'stats' website will tell you what you need. It will also explain you how all the ranks are divided.Now you actually know how the system works you know the system in place is working as intended. Unfortunately this is not quite the case. Every system needs to be adjusted accordingly. I'm fairly sure the current system still needs some adjustments because players are fluctuating between ranks fairly easily. Imo the biggest flaws of the system isn't the system itself but the other factors taken into account groups and matchmaking. Most groups ranks (individuals) are not the same. A good example is one gold player one silver player and one bronze player... my team has 3 silver players (lower silver). Now does this make sense? If you think of the ELO rating yes. All ELO combined is on average on par with the silver players but the thing is... their actualy skill level isn't. The gold player obviously plays on average better while the bronze player plays on average worser. In low ranks this matters a lot since one player can really make a huge difference. You will notice a lot of misses and such meaning one decent player can score 'easy' goals. Matchmaking only makes things worse after 2 minutes the barrier of looking for equal ELO numbers is eliminated and that's where things go wrong. Two gold + one silver (group) against 3 silvers is not what you were looking for. BUT i still believe playing ranked is more amusing then playing casual you will get ranked with players who are on average as good as you are. Casual also has an ELO system but the categories are much wider meaning someone's actual skill level varies a lot. In ranked the elo system is way more in depth. And remember playing against higher ranked players actually isn't a bad thing eventually you'll have to compete against those anyway (since you're trying to rank up). If you are losing don't just quit but stay and learn from your opponent (or simply #NEVERSURRENDER).The community Overall the community is very toxic and you really need to adapt your mindset. Players WILL quitt and afk / grief if you're 'trash' according to them. Most matches also contain a lot of foul language i had to wash my eyes with bleach multiple times by now. What comes out of one's keyboard is sometimes very astounishing (and very creative LOL) but in a negative way. On average in ranked it's worse but then again... do you like to play with your own rank (win)? An other big issue are smurfs as in every ranked game. Unfortunately those also exist in RL. Players who are on average (way) better then you but have the same rank as you simply because they made a new account to reck some noobs. Optimization Certain maps are very poorly optimized. Prime example is the map aquadome. It is VERY laggy and the devs literally scaled down / removed features (swiming fishes crowd ...) to improve performance while it still isn't good enough. Anyone with a decent computer doesn't struggle that's why this isn't a huge con anymore. A (very) decent RYZEN computer is about 1000$ including monitor and all (literally a complete setup) or just get a console this will give you enough FPS for rocket league. Even on my potato laptop it's okay but i've seen better (especially with regard to certain maps).My conclusion it's a good and very amusing game minus the toxic community and ranked fluctuations. Anyone can play it and one match takes about 5 minutes. Just click 'Play Online' 'Find Match) and you're ready to roll.PRO and CON + Lots of customization including lots of cars available.+ Very simple game literally anyone can play it. If you want to be good just practice and PLAY it's the best way to learn.+ Cross platform the community is big! PC Xbox and PS will come together.+ Very amusing game if you like cars and fifa (lol) combine your favorite hobbies!+ Quick game only takes about 5 minutes for one match (excluding goals / goal review).+ But wait there's more...Various game modes you're not bound to playing only fifa with cars.+/ ELO Rating System it's a good system but needs adjustments.+/ Optimization is good enough but certain maps are badly optimized. The community it is VERY toxic. This also includes smurfs which ruins the fun for newbies. Got banned 24h for calling someone salty wth psy. (",Rocket League®

2017-03-31,0,0,1306,False,Recommended,For a game at its cost Rocket League is really good value in so many ways. You can easily play it by yourself or with a few friends for tons of hours if you are into competitive play or just likes a challenge. There are so many skill levels and while the progression can be slow it's entirely up to your skills as well as your teams. There is no pay to win implemented in the game what so ever and all the money you spend except for the game itself goes towards cosmetics in the form of premium looking cars or items obtained from chests needing a purchased key to be unlocked.That said I think it is unfortunate that some content however only being cosmetic and thus not affecting the actual gameplay it is is not obtainable at all unless you spend additional real life currency. I would wish for the tiniest chance to get a key through gameplay also to allow players to experience the whole package.,Rocket League®

2017-11-29,0,0,2139,False,Not Recommended,I don't normally write reviews but I felt I needed to for Rocket League. After playing 1 500 hours of this game I stray further away from it by the day. Despite the game being very well made and a unique concept in general the servers are poor and the community is disgusting. If you solo queue at all you will be blamed for 99% of losses and flamed throughout the entire game. I'm not sure if the community is this bad in NA servers but in EU stay away. This game isn't worth the time because of how disgusting the people that play it are. As much as I love this game I cannot recommend it. The only way to bypass the toxicity is by muting all forms of communication which in a game like Rocket League is crucial. Not only do teammates criticise you all game but eventually they'll probably grief afk or abandon. Aside from the community this game takes a lot of time effort and patience to master. Having played 1 500 hours and not been champion once there are a lot of elements in this game that need to be perfected in order to reach such ranks. If you have friends to play with you obviously don't have to suffer with toxic teammates but now that friends have stopped playing I have to solo queue only to get rude harmful teammates every game. If you're looking for a game with an accepting and welcoming community I suggest you stay well clear of Rocket League.,Rocket League®
2015-10-08,0,0,623,False,Recommended,I recommend this game in the name of doge.I have not yet seen any game which was anything close to this. Rocket League has Normal and Ranked Games for fun and more serious playsIt also has nice and easy controls which are hard to master so you'll have to play a lot to get better and better.I'm not bored at all but a little bit upset of all the flamers ingame which doesn't get that it is still just a game. But i guess that's not a problem of the game itself. For me the 20 were totally worth and i will continue playing it every now and then for some hours.,Rocket League®

Unlocks done right DLC is for pretty stuff each player is on an even playing field. PS4 and PC crossplay Let's face it not everyone owns a decent pc. Why not get your console buddies involved? Great Audio/Visuals Unreal engine makes the game crisp and clean the audio suits the game well. One of the few spectator games that actually amaze.If you're on the fence about it I'd only not recommend this if you don't own a controller. If you do it's absolutely worth $20.00 .,Rocket League®

Found the gameplay to look very chaotic and seemed difficult to get a hang of.A friend assured me it was worth a try at least so I purchased the game. (Fully expecting to use the Steam refund policy)I was blown away by how fun it was! F***ing awesome! There wasn't much of a learning curve either I found. The 5 minute match length is perfect for casuals like me who have limited playtime or when sitting down for a game night it keeps it fresh and exciting.I've only logged about 50 hours on it so far but I definitely will continue to log many more.,Rocket League®

I feel obligated as I've played well over 1000 hours at this point. What an amazing game.. Soccer with rocket cars. Who knew? No matter the skill level because of pretty darn good matchmaking you don't ever feel completely out matched (unless you have players who created new accounts to boost stats against newbs). That being the only real downfall everything about this game is fantastic! From Car customization to competitive gameplay this is up there with CS LOL etc. AND the physics. Few games have done as masterful a job.. It's science.If you're on the fence or when you get a chance watch some of the experts play on Twitch they are phenomenal.

2017-04-14,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Now mind you I only have 30 hours in this game as of writing my review but that's only on the PC version. I've owned the PS4 version for almost two years now.Rocket League is a game that at its best is challenging intriguing it's fantastic and one of the most skill based games I've ever played. You grow at your own pace and when you understand things like controlling your car in the air and on the ground how to hit the ball juuuuuust right so that it goes where you want it and then how to play mind games and fake people out it all comes together. It's like watching a machine being built in slow motion the cogs and gears are all slowly put into place and when they mesh that's when it all works.At its worst it is difficult to enjoy it. The game being skill based people like to think they have some sort of superiority completely forgetting how to not be unpleasant to people. You'll likely get mad be frustrated have off days it won't always be perfect.But man at it's best.. Just tonight I played two sets of 1v1s against a really cool guy. I have a thing about sportsmanship and I want people to enjoy the game as much as I do. When you meet people like this guy who demolished me and then waited for me to respawn and passed the ball to me and also tied up our first match (went from 0 3 to 3 3 because he let it happen) just so we could keep playing that's the best feeling in the entire world. We battled twice both times I won extremely narrowly (the first because he basically put himself on my level) and both games even when I was getting my kicked I had a lot of fun. If you understand that enjoying a game doesn't have to be about winning and that there's just as much to gain in winning as there is losing you'll find yourself probably alone online for the most part.But those people who respect you as a fellow player? Who're in it to play and challenge themselves not necessarily in it to win? That's the kind of magic that made me fall in love with this game and it's this same kind of magic that keeps me playing it today.,Rocket League®

Just go into ranked if you're looking for more of a challenge. I know that a console style controller is recommended for this but I use mouse and keyboard and was able to place silver in ranked. So don't get discouraged from getting this game just because you don't have a controller. I have lots of fun playing with mouse and keyboard.

2017-04-16,0,0,893,False,Recommended,From a quick pick up 'n play (for those who can manage to stop I usually can't) to a whole day's gaming alone or with friends this game really does tick every box. Like many other people out there I'd never really bothered to look at Rocket League despite seeing the steam message in the corner of my screen regularly informing me I had friends who play it. Truth be told I'd been in semi retirement from sports based games the last few years after hanging up my FIFA 13 copy some time ago. I'd very much become an FPS and open world type of guy......until I saw this game being played at a MacMillan 24 hour gameathon to raise money for the charity. As soon as I picked up the controller I was hooked. This game appeals to every gaming part of me It's fast paced requires quick thinking quick reactions and at the top end requires tones of skillIt's very rewarding being able to see yourself get better over time as your ranks go up with the hours you put in. Nothing feels better than watching yourself and friends evolve to take on better players over time. It's a game with very little loading time and when you are waiting for a match you can enter training mode so you're always kept busy (I can't stand staring at constant loading screens). You can play with up to 7 friends in monster 4v4 matches using (if required) built in voice chat and can fill any spaces with AI bots. There are so many different game modes basketball ice hockey rumble mode with weapons and the new drop shot game introduced in the latest update is incredibly fun. There's a huge community and whilst you WILL come across the odd toxic raging player (happens in competitive games) there are also tones of helpful players and some great online streaming coverage and communities (thanks Jon Sandman and Woofless Rob). It can be played on a multitude of different system specs and isn't too demanding. There's an FPS slider bar that you can set as high as 250FPS which is brilliant. The graphics are great smooth and sharp the music is just on another level (I've actually purchased the Rocket League albums from iTunes) and the gameplay can't really be beaten. I'd recommend this game to anyone casual gamers hardcore gamers groups of friends up for a laugh or someone who wants to start a project to become pro at a game this game has its own World championship!!! Great game I absolutely love it the only downside is having to find the time to fit real life in!!,Rocket League®

But that being said it's a lot of fun to play with friends and its a game you can easily play for 10 minutes or 20 minutes when you are waiting for something else or you can play for hours with friends. These days it's the type of game that I play sporadically every now and then when I feel like it though I played it a lot when I first got it.

2018-01-09,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Great game as long as you stick to cross platform play for the better players from the consoles less having to put up with teammates that can't accept their losses and bail before the match point. Smurfs gunning for a 100% win ratio are a real problem.It has loot boxes and DLC but it's just cosmetic and you'll always earn something new for every match you play.It's also the rare PC game where you can do split screen online multiplayer. It's also well optimized my old computer maxed it out at full speed and detail and the loading times are almost non existent.,Rocket League®
2016-05-26,0,0,223,False,Recommended,On the cover it doesn't look like a very convincing sell to buy the game but trust me after you get past that and into your first few games it clicks instantly. It is really good. Competitive or Casual fast paced rocket cars! There is a surprising amount of depth to what appears to be a relatively simple game.The progression system is non existant your cars and upgrades are purely cosmetic and the only thing seperating you from your opponent or even the best superstars from day 1 is skill. Granted it will take dozens and hundreds of hours to build up that skill but every game is a learning experience and each match you feel yourself improving. You see your opponent do some amazing trick and you learn to do it yourself over time. No microtransactions levels RNG loadouts. It is so refreshing to see this in a modern game. It is well optimized has cross platform play (so the matchmaking always finds a game) and is well presented. In stadiums you hear the crowd cheer gasp countdown as if it were a football match at the world championships in the basketball mode you hear the stereotypical American announcer yelling SLAAAAMMM DUNK! when you score one. The atmosphere is great and the graphics while not mind blowing fit the theme well. The devs have also been great the DLC's are cosmetic items only and content patches and new modes come out often. An e sports scene is also around for this game I don't get into it personally but I know lots of others love that sort of thing.If you have a controller to play with then get the game and enjoy! If you don't have a controller buy one and then buy this game.Edited,Rocket League®

I can have LOTS of fun with my friends playing casually but at the same time I can also have some nail biting competitive action as I strive to be better than my opponents. I can say that my learning experience with this game has been really satisfying as I get filled with joy every time I learn a new game mechanic or pull off stuff I previously couldn't.If you grind CS GO or any other competitive game on almost a daily basis like I'm used to I highly recommend this game to distract yourself a bit and have lots of fun while doing so.

2016-01-24,0,0,287,False,Recommended,Rocket League is incredible. When I heard about it I was kinda interested but after trying it I totally got addicted. it's a game anyone can enjoy even if you're bad at it it's just so much fun trying. It's a simple game with a very high skill cap for players that like challenge. Once you achieve this air goal you've been dreaming of when you started playing you'll be screaming out of joy! P R O S + Customization.+ Addicting and rewarding.+ Unlocks.+ FREE STUFF with updates.+ Events.+ Hi speed car soccer need I say more?+ Affordable DLCs that are not game changing maps from DLCs are free.+ Devs care about their playerbase. C O N S After level 30 no more unlocks ( . EDIT They are adding more unlocks and quality loot per play time Ranked system is very punishing and some matchups are unfair. EDIT They changed the ranked system and it's lots better! Some issues with local 2 players with 2 controllers minor problem though. EDIT No more problems here. ) No way to save presets for your cars (Customization sets) EDIT Ay they also fixed that 3 9.8/10,Rocket League®

2018-01-12,0,0,57,False,Recommended,The only non Tennis non Golf sports game I like in spite of the community. Goodness grief you stand a higher chance of meeting Santa Claus on a CSGO 24/7 Dust server befriending somebody over a TF2 pub server or getting a pity win from the Killer in Dead By Daylight than meeting a friendly face in Rocket League. The amount of salt in this community is mind boggling. There is less salt among the people who get banned from Neopets after 5 years because they used a swear in a private message. There is less salt in a Pringles factory!The basis of this game is polo but with virtual RC cars. Rounds are quickly over. Basic controls are easy to learn very very difficult to master. The bulk of getting your rank higher involves mastering aerial moves which are difficult without a controller.In the competitive community there are disputes over whether certain car models have different skills. I think there are differences especially when it comes to the hitbox and turning angle. Subtle differences can mess you up because moves require fast thinking and fine tuning. Because rounds are so fast paced and it's frustrating to lose on a randomly botched shot a lot of players get hooked on this game and I guess start to feel passionate about wins and losses. Hence the salt. The competitive scene has its fair amount of jerks as well especially if you're a newbie trying to improve her measly low rank and you lose in a team of semi newbies who've decided that they're MLG because they bought a DLC for this game /Foreigners and children are honestly my favorite playing crowd because I can't understand the insults that foreigners are posting in chat (or saying over voice chat) and young players are either trying really really hard to be friendly or they're forgiveably stupid (at least they can use their age as an excuse).At least this is the sum of my experience with (Western) European players. Players from other parts of the world might have better odds of finding friendly people to play with (though I doubt it).Once in a blue moon you will come across players that are good winners or cheerful losers players that are just passing some time and relaxing just trying to enjoy themselves and maybe make a new acquaintance. You'll have fun times you'll end up spending the entire evening playing round after round and you'll amass a dozen recordings of cool and funny moments. Community aside the game is really good. But I'd definitely recommend a controller.,Rocket League®

2016-04-21,0,0,166,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a car soccer game that has (almost) realistic physics and such.Now the good things about this game is that Easy to learn hard to master. The game can sometimes make you feel like a all star player even if you're playing bad. All sorts of customizations.Although I do like Rocket League here are the things I don't like about this game The ping game tells you most of the time is actually wrong. I'm not joking. It's not really dependable and it needs to be updated. Sometimes you get teammates that joke insult you about how you play. (For example if you couldn't save a goal your teammate just keeps spamming ""What a save!"".) The cars have different hitbox or turning ratio. I'm not sure why this is but it can give you some advantage if you use different types of cars over others. (As far as I'm aware bat mobile has the highest hitbox and the turning ratio.)Overall this game is great. But I can't really recommend it at it's current state. Until the devolopers fix the lag problem (I'm quite sure it's not something in my end) just avoid getting the game. If you are planning to get it though make sure you have a one or two friends to play with as it's the most fun that way.Well the lag problem is gone ish. It's definietly more stable at least which makes me able to enjoy the game!",Rocket League®

2017-10-07,0,0,2195,False,Recommended,I have 701 hours on this game ( granted I did afk a few times on accident). I been aroudn since season one of rocket league and I'm gonna take you through the pros and cons of this game. Start off with pros Great to play very sort games after hundred of hours still so much I need to learn. Those are the pros. Negatives first keys that need to be bought to open crates and that is basically only way to get expensive stuff besides very rare trade ups where youe can get a white octane. They did add decrypters that you can get but those will only be during special events. That is the only really big thing. The only orther negative is the scammers in rocket league. I 100% recomned this game. It is always getting updated. The two most exciting things that are coming is cross network play party mode and tournament mode. If you like any of this buy it right now,Rocket League®

2016-07-06,0,0,332,False,Recommended,Rocket League brings a whole new light to classic European Football or Soccer as Americans call it. This game provides hours of rocket boosting fun for up to 6 friends and a great competitive play mode alone or with up to 3 friends. Graphics are much improved from the prequel a few years back yet they have not compromised the original feeling of gameplay.In recent updates players have become overwhelmingly toxic when it comes to teamwork. Most games play well enough but if you're down just 1 or 2 points in the first 30 45 seconds of a game expect your teammates to quit out or start trash talking you. However if you can look past this you're in for a good time.,Rocket League®

Also like other people have been saying the way you progress in this game is amazing Rookie Level You can barely hit the ball and are useless to your teamSemi Pro You are starting to score some goals now and late into semi pro you actually start helping out your team a little bit and have improved from when you first got the gamePro You might look up advanced rocket league tips...You try to go for airials and miss lots. You only hit very low airials. Late into Pro levels 27 29 You start to understand how to airial a little bit more but realize it is very hard using a keyboard.Veteran You now have a controller because you realize a keyboard won't help you at all. You start to get more airial hits and have mastered hitting the ball on the grounds. You now start to get some but little airial goals. You become useful to your team and start realizing you need to practing hitting airials.(Expert Legend and Rocketeer may not be accurate)Expert I am a veteran at the time I posted this review so keep that in mind. At expert level you start to consistently make airials and don't miss very many airial goal oppertunities. You have nearly mastered getting airials in this game. You become important to your team with veterans and pros.Legend You are almost a rocket league god! You always think about airials and have mastered airial control. You can do nearly everything that is possible in rocket league.Rocketeer You can do a 720 no looker airial hit to wall and fly back to the ball bouncing of the wall and hit it into the goal!

2017-12-31,0,0,176,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a game where you can play soccer with cars and who would've thought that would work out so well. The gameplay is addictive and easy to learn and there's lots of different cars that you can customize the way you like though keep in mind that every car with any customization will play the same to make sure you won't have an advantage over your opponent. Rocket League runs in Unreal Engine 3 with the DirectX 9 api making it seem older than it actually is but it works out just fine and in fact the game looks fantastic and runs great on almost everything. As a competitive game I'll give it a 10/10 and recommend it to everyone who's into competitive gaming with friends or anyone online.,Rocket League®

AI is terrible matchmaking system for me was . If i had more friends playing the game i would have kept playing but to play with randoms against other randoms was frustrating. i had 2 semi pros in my team and we got our asses kicked 4 times by a pro player that scored around 6 or 7 times a match. Ruined the experience for me.,Rocket League®

2015-08-19,0,0,40,False,Recommended,Rocket league is basically soccer with cars. Pretty simple concept but it can be hard to master. Your vehicle can jump and even fly while using boost. This creates some hilarious situations and makes the game a blast to play. Pro.Short action packed matches. about 5mins Great sound track.Gameplay feels smooth and responsive.Cross platform between PS4 and PC.Quick search times to find a match. 30 seconds usually.ConsI dont really have any cons for the game. It feels and plays great.The price point may be a bit high but thats highly subjective.OverallI totally recomend the game even if you may not be a sports fan!,Rocket League®

2016-04-08,0,0,54,False,Recommended,It's tricky to review Rocket League because the game feel is ultimately what makes it work. So here's the deal the game feels great. Cars have enough heft to feel like cars but enough agility to feel like you could theoretically not be terrible at the game. I mean you will be terrible but fortunately that's a lot of fun too.So maybe it's not tricky to review after all Rocket League is pretty great.,Rocket League®
2016-04-08,0,0,48,False,Recommended,rocket league is one of the fue exeptions in gaming where meshing two types of games resulted in something incredably fun to play. The concept of the game is prity simple drive a car and use it to get the ball into the goll. Althought the game play macanics are prity simple it is much harder to play with a mouse and keyboard then useing a controler. ower all the game is fun the leveling up and unlock sistems are well balenced so the player will always fell setisfaction after playing a match in game.,Rocket League®

2016-04-08,0,0,184,False,Recommended,"It does not take much to sum up this game because the concept is so simple. Football (Soccer) with uber mobile jet fuelled RC cars. It sounds kind of stupid and that it might not work but the creators have managed to blend the perfect balance of the sublime and the ridiculous. Both of which are experienced in equal measure when playing rocket league. There are some parallels to be drawn with the feelings you get from playing Mario Kart if that gives you a better idea.The game continues to give me that addictive ""just one more game"" feeling and is an absolute blast when playing with friends. It is that simple game I turn on when I just want to forget about the world for a couple of hours and focus entirely on messing around having fun.Certainly would reccomend it and at the price it is also excellent value.",Rocket League®

There are a ton of entertaining modes both competetive and for fun and a myriad of customization for your rocket propelled cars.The one downside is that the developers followed that atrocious and toxic trend of random loot drops combined with shady microtransactions which works basically like gambling. Don't even try that. It's completely optional and I think you can even turn it off in the options so you won't get any crates that you have to pay for to open.Aside from that you can't go wrong with this game if you are looking for multiplayer fun.

Pretty easy to understand the basics hard to master 'em moves.Amazing graphics everything is very colorful and clear! I love how detailed the grass is and how the cars look like Hot Wheels toy cars. Nostalgic!Customization! You can change your car's body and colour it with different paint jobs you also get multiple wheel choices. You can even attach antennas and hats to your car! Just keep in mind that you unlock stuff by playing matches. A lot of matches.The only thing this game needs to be perfect is a couple more servers spread around the globe since this game's strongest point is its online mode. Playing offline with bots is alright but it gets frustating when you realise you're the only one thinking ""outside of the box"" in a match since bots will usually follow the ball around blindly like 6 years old kids playing soccer.I *totally* recommend a controller to play this game. Yeah I know ""muh master race"" but listen This game is so much EASIER with a controller you wouldn't believe it. I played briefly with mouse+KB combo... it's clunky. I feel like I can't make my car do what I want it to do. Now I use an Xbox 360 Controller and it's pretty much perfect. Go get a controller if you haven't yet!",Rocket League®

2015-11-30,0,0,1490,False,Recommended,"It's soccer among other sports with cars. Not much to it.Pros Cross platform queue times are fast ranked and unranked seasons with playoffs against AI lots of training exercises to hone your skills (and you'll actually use them) games are fast very little downtime so you feel like you're playing a lot when you may have only played 4 games at 5min a piece players who leave in game are replaced immediately with AI to compensate until another player can be found (Ranked is diff)Cons DLC content is usually just additional cars maybe some car toppers antenna wheels nothing game changing and its not needed. At this time I believe there is only 1 map that is different layout than all other ""maps"" (fields) and the community at large doesn't like it myself included This game can/will induce rage quits from time to time You're usually at the mercy of your teammates ability if you have no friends to play with and that can me maddening sometimes as a 'pro' player may be paired with a 'legendary' and create some very apparent skill gaps but again finding new games is never a problem on the online servers.It's fast its fun its a game you can keep coming back to to fill the gaps in between your other perhaps more serious games.",Rocket League®

This is a great game whether you're looking for something to become competetive with or to just mess around with your friends. For me I used to play it casually when I had friends over to my house and I eventually got into the habit of playing daily. Now I'm pretty competetive with it and can get mad at my teamates... oops. Anyways the community is nice for the most part but with any other online game there's the people who have a problem with anyone and everyone.

2016-09-08,0,0,669,False,Recommended,This game has been a staple to my gaming needs. It always seems to hit the right spot. you do need to play this game and practice to get better which some people just are not used to in video games anymore. Though the game is ever evolving (for the better) the core 3v3 vanilla experience remains for the most part untocuhed it only gets refined and polished. i would suggest picking this game up if you would like to see your skill set grow around a game filled with people who always try to do thier best to beat you. This game has a silly side as well. rumble (released today) adds a game mode that is less serious but still keeps the action at an 11/10. In all honesty ive probably played a good 300hrs out of my 340hrs with friends. it has been an experience that has made us scream and shout as well as laugh. Lately we have played competitive 3v3 and we have grown closer over the perfect pass the last frame save or the amazing ariel goal. I havent felt as happy about playing a game with a group of friends since I played my very first MMO. It seems really silly to get carried away like that for soccer with cars but it really does make me happy i picked this game up. If you want a truely special just perfect in so many ways (and still improving each update) buy this game play it with others who enjoy the game and play to improve yourself as much as you would like.,Rocket League®

2016-09-08,0,0,1102,False,Recommended,What a game. Rocket League is one of the few games of today that progressively get better and worse the longer you play it be mindful that while matches are only 5 minutes this can abruptly become a very high stress game. I'm encroaching on 500 hours and while RL has become my favorite game over the past year heed my warning if you're new to competitive online gaming. You will get insulted from your teammates and opponents alike on a regular basis especially while you're learning the game. Approach the game with a cool demeanor and don't let bullies bring you down and for god sakes people don't feed them by responding. Pause Mute Player Resume Enjoy.,Rocket League®

Sad but it fixes my overly powered gaming PC I guess? It's a fun game and it best with friends.Previous review... Negative Sorry but I have to not recommend this game for the computer. Consoles yes. Until then once the optimization is better I'll change my review to positive.. Windows 10. Nivida GTX 970. Nivida Graphic Driver 368.22 (up to date). Everything should work but like I said it doesn't. I reinstalled the drivers checked the game files changed Nivida settings for DVR and V Sync and about everything you can think of is not working.. Then I get on my other hundred games that I have.... and they work perfectly fine.. My friend's laptop can run the game perfectly but this game can't even run on lowest setting underclocked and 30 fps? Yeah no you guys can try it out Buy it but if it starts giving you a graphic 'failed' error and all that stuff that you know isn't your computer... Then refund it before the 2 hour limit. That my suggestion. Thanks. It a really great game otherwise if it didn't crash after the 4th 5th game.... Negative review got 3 like out of 6. Thank You.,Rocket League®

2017-11-23,0,0,28,False,Recommended,Rocket League is fun. It's also frustrating and difficult but when you miss a shot you know it's your fault (or that of a team mate) not the game's controls or physics. If you never get good at the game and I certainly haven't there's always custom matches. If you've ever enjoyed Mario Kart's battle mode you'll definitely love messing with mutator settings (ball shape/size/weight/bounciness gravity boost strength etc.) and Rumble mode (11 powerups to screw with your opponents).If you have friends to play with this game is a no brainer.

2017-07-05,0,0,1041,False,Recommended,"I do love this game and I recommend everyone to play it! But Jesus Christ... Could a gaming community be more childish? People are pouting and throwing games in competitive play because they accidentally get hit or a teammate misses a save or an amazing pass goes unnoticed. Sure its frustrating but delibrately losing a game because someone else ""hurt your feelings"" is one t way to play this game. Psyonix please do something to either ban these types of players or prevent them from playing competitively. Create some kind of system to where reporting players actually has a consequnce! Just off the top of my head I think some form of voting system where players in the current game can vote against someone that is delibrately playing for the opposite team or not playing at all. If enough people vote against that player (say three or more) prevent them from playing any more games similiar to how leaving a match early works. This is just a rant from a player who finally made it to platinum after hours of playtime. I am tired of losing games because of the teammates throwing temper tantrums!",Rocket League®

I get into Rocket League find a game in under a minute and play. Some say Rocket League gets boring and I suppose it's just down to personal preference but I think there's always new challenges every game and also new moves to learn with all these hours I still can't do aerials off walls!TLDR great casual yet competitive game controller recommended but if you manage with just KB+M then props because it's a challenge and a half.,Rocket League®

It is based on a simple premis of car football but there is plenty of tactical and positional awareness needed to compete effectively..It is one of the only games that I don't really have a problem playing online with randoms most are into playing the game instead of abusing and swearing at eachother although those people still exist.

2017-07-22,0,0,283,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rocket League is incredibly fun. It's soccer but with cars that can also fly using a jetpack like technique. It's heavily evolved over the 2 years it's been out and it's only gotten better. There is a system of crates and such similar to CS GO cases but just like CS GO these micro transactions won't give you anything with an incredible advantage over the other players on the field. The only differences between cars are the hitboxes and turn radius which don't affect gameplay *too* heavily however obviously some of the shorter stubbier cars play slightly different than the longer flatter cars. Out of the cars in the game by default there's something that everyone can be comfortable using and if you like the looks of the DLC cars you can purchase them. Some of the achievements require that you purchase DLC if that's your thing.This also is not a game most people can just pick up and be good at. It takes a lot of practice and work to get good at this game despite the fact that it honestly looks really easy. Once you grab a controller or a keyboard and mouse and try to play for yourself you understand how difficult it is. If you're extremely competitive and want to be at the very top be prepared to put in 1000+ hours to get there. If you are the type of the person that refuses to accept there are people better than you and strive to be the very best but aren't willing to commit that much time to a game do not buy this game. If you're content with the grind and enjoy the game despite not becoming good extremely quickly the game is more than worth the $20 price tag.Warning Despite how fun and entertaining this game if you're very competitive and get easily angered be careful playing. I don't let a lot of things make me mad especially a game but Rocket League really pisses me off sometime. Despite that I've invested 200+ hours so far in the few months I've had the game and will continue to invest more time into it.This review is all over the place and structured horribly but I've been up for 24 hours and just wanted to get my thoughts on the game out there given that I've invested a good amount of time into it.,Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,710,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an incredibly addicting game. The use of physics in the game is what makes every game you play so much different from the last which constantly keeps your interest. After every game you always find yourself thinking just one more because you're on a winning streak or to try and break a bad strings of games you've just played. The creativity in the different game modes and maps are also quite appealing as well as a feature to set up your own crazy game however you please. This game is not only incredibly fun for the casual gamer but also for more serious players with how much depth there is into tactics timing positioning accuracy and skill. It is a very rewarding game for those who practice hard too. Also I love that the developers are always releasing the extra game modes or new maps for free which is a huge plus and doesn't split player base or leave casual players behind if they thought that maps/game modes as paid DLC were not worth their money and time.,Rocket League®

With tentative graphics that support even a budget PC yet look stunning on a powerful one accurate physics a wide basis of items (more than 10 Billion different car designs by the way) a crate opening feature multiple DLCs a LOT of music what isn't to like about this addictive game?

2017-11-24,0,0,405,False,Recommended,Just a few seconds remaining and your team is down by 1 point. In the chaos of the game you find a moment of tension and pause. Finally an opening the ball is shot into the air by the impact of your teammate colliding with the opposing player as they both jumped for control of it hurtling it into your direction. With nothing but your reflexes coordination and depth perception your fingers glide with sweaty palms towards the correct combination of buttons and movements. Your vision narrows and even with the weight your teammates counting on you you fly into the air with determination to hit your target towards the goal and even the score for overtime.

2016-04-25,0,0,529,False,Recommended,"New game to me. Tried the free demo over the weekend after hearing nothing but good things about it. My short term objective review about the game Pros very easy to learn with simple controls. Yes there are advanced ""tactics"" that require a bit more finess but coming in as a newb it was easy to pick up on and feel like I was semi competent after going through the short but helpful tutorial. Graphics are great. Ambiance is great.Cons there is a learning curve to the handling. While stated above that the controls are easy figuring out your playstyle and the physics can take a few tries. I still mess up until i find my groove. I'd give it 10 15 matches before you really start to feel it and get confident. Bots. You don't want them on your team. There are traces of trolls so far which is natural for games but there is no way that I know of so far to remove them from the match.Overall I would still highly suggest this game despite the longer cons as they are all relatively minor problems. I'm not even a fan of soccer/futböl but I can't stop playing this. I find myself losing track of time til early in the AM before forcing myself to sleep",Rocket League®

2017-11-24,0,0,175,False,Recommended,I have played Rocket League for 100 hours now and its been a mediocre ride. The game in itself has been very good but sometimes it gets boring. The game is best when played with friends. The best thing about Rocket League is the variety of cars although in a recent update the devs changed the hitboxes so there is only 5 diffrent types of hitboxes (to prevent pay to win) some may say that there isnt variety in the cars but in my opinion it just makes it so the less used cars like Gizmo and Backfire are now statistically the exact copy of the octane (which is the most used car). This makes it so if for example someone really likes the badass look of the Roadhog they can play with it instead of lets say the Octane because they have the same hitbox10/10 IGN,Rocket League®

2017-07-15,0,0,278,False,Recommended,This game is so unbelievably wonderful. My friends and I talk about how amazing it is as much as we play it. Every choice Psyonix makes every update every price is just great.As far as gameplay goes you find matches in a very short time and can queue up again right away to get another one. The downtime is so minimal. Each match is action packed and fun and when you score a goal you get a little time to flip your car around and goof off to show off or whatever.The thing I love the most about this game is that every SINGLE thing that happens in the game was because somebody did something themselves. In other words there is no random number generation or 'luck' or anything. If you hit the ball exactly this way it will move EXACTLY THAT WAY. So you can only blame yourself when you screw up and if your opponent does something ridiculous you can only get annoyed at his SKILL not his level. (Sure maybe he got lucky with where his car happened to be but he probably was going for it that way).So the game itself is only $20 and each car in the game is only $2!!!!! And you don't even have to buy them at ALL (but I love to because it's fun haha). And with each update the game gets better and better.Favorite facets of the game SKILL ONLY Car Fashion (great customizability and rare colored items) INCREDIBLE teamwork GREAT 2 or 3 player game with your closest friends Minimal Downtime Practice all types of exercises by yourself to get better at long shots goalie etc. Great item trading (you have to search listings third party) INEXPENSIVE AS FRICK.

Was banned from all online interaction for 24 hours and most likely damaged my competetive rank from using chat when I rarely type in game. After checking the banning policy it states that quick chat is not a bannable offense and unless I have had a mental break and can't remember the actions that I have made quick chat is all I have used. Long story short I took a break from the game for 5 days and came back to a 24 hour online ban for a vague explanation that I was either harrassing or being vulgar to someone. No explanation no chat log no response from any customer relation type inquiry. Can't say this is the best representation of this game and am severely dissapointed.

2017-06-22,0,0,1207,False,Recommended,Rocket league is by far the best multiplayer game I've ever experienced not only as a player but also as a spectator as the eSports scene grows by the day. This game hits all the right notes whether you are a beginner or veteren gamer it's simple and easy to get into yet has such deep mechanics and a skill ceiling so high that I doubt anyone will ever reach it. People are still coming up with new unique ways to smash that ball around the field even after this game has been around for nearly 2 years.I never thought I'd ever get into a sports game because I really don't enjoy games like Fifa Madden and even racing games aren't really my cup of tea but rocket league is a different beast. This is a game that you can jump into with a bunch of friends and have loads of fun (couch co op or online) or you can play it by yourself and have just as much fun. It's a game that has brought the competitiveness out of me like no other game before it I want to win so flipping badly that I've put over 1000 hours into it (including my PS4 time) trying to improve. I've never quite felt like I want to be the best this badly in my life. I literally haven't been able to stay away from this game for more than a week or two since the day I first played it.To sum up the positives I'll say this this game never gets old you'll never feel like you have mastered it and it never stops being fun. It is extremely well polished continually supported by the developers with regular updates and has an eSports scene that is growing exponentially. This is overall my favourite game of all time and I honestly don't think I could ever quit playing it as long as there are still people to play with. I will mention a few negatives as well no game is perfect. Rocket league has introduced a crate system in order for the developers to earn more money to funnel into the eSports scene. Luckily the crates only offer cosmetic items so there is no pay to win here however these crate systems prey on certain personality types which I really dislike. Depending on where you live you might run into drastic server issues. Personally I've never experienced this (living in New Zealand Oceanic servers have been fine) however I've heard several reports of problems with the asian servers middle eastern servers and south american servers. Since I don't live in those areas I can't give any more details but it is sad to see a great game like this not able to be enjoyed to its fullest by our friends in other areas of the world.I would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a beginner or veteren gamer. The developers are very responsive to most things and regularly update the game. This game still has a very high playerbase and it isn't looking like that is going to change any time soon. If you aren't sure check out rocket league on twitch or youtube and if you enjoy watching it you'll definitely enjoy playing it!,Rocket League®

2017-12-21,0,0,950,False,Recommended,This is by far by favourite most played game. At first I can see why it can be seen as boring because I was terrible and I dind't play ranked. However once I became good and started playing ranked I loved the game even more. Now I am in champ 1 and even when I'm not playing ranked it's fun to freestyle with my friends. Really good game I suggest it's a must have game on your steam account.,Rocket League®

2017-12-21,0,0,127,False,Recommended,This is probably the best game to come to me other than Forza Horizon 3. I love games with racing or just cars in general and this game takes a whole new way with it. Rocket League is now probably my favorite game &lt 3. But I think they should add 2 cars. 1. Some kind of Bugatti car. 2. I think there should be a Lamborghini Veneno car added into the game that you can get from crates. Otherwise I hope everyone plays this game! Merry Christmas everyone!,Rocket League®
2017-12-21,0,0,259,False,Recommended,You wouldn't expect a game with such a simple premise to be so enjoyable. Who would've thought that adding rockets and the ability to do flips and tricks to car soccer would make it so much better.10/10 would get molested (figuratively of course) by people who I swear have trancended this reality and uploaded their conciousness onto Psyonix's servers to become rocket league gods and achieve immortality by becoming one with their cars.,Rocket League®
2017-12-21,0,0,6,False,Recommended,honestly the first two series of characters featured on total drama were memorable and funny but the rest and just rehashes of the other characters. You could watch the intro for total drama island and figure out each characters personality. In the most resent seasons you can t tell Like oh this guy plays video games and oh this guys has blonde hair. You can t tell anything because the show has already peaked. And this new babies show I m not even sure how it s going to work. It better be an au because if not it destroyed the total drama timeline. If it did happen in canon then how did none of the characters (other than biologically related characters of course) not know each other before the show even started? This obviously would cause stress for the theorists such as myself and this new show is just going to make more plot holes than ever,Rocket League®

2017-11-11,0,0,285,False,Not Recommended,This game is very fun when the matchmaking is fair. Everything other than 1v1 is really unfair.

I think this is a fun chill game but i would not recommend playing competitive if you are going to play seriously.,Rocket League®

2018-04-03,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Rocket league is those kind of games that are relatively easy to pick up but have a great learning curve leading to interesting situations depending on the level of mastery.I own this game both on Steam and on Switch and on both it runs wells. The PC version is of course excellent whereas the Switch one despite being an amazing port will have some issues sometimes regarding busy environments that can become messy and a bit washed out in the distance (we are talking difference between rock solid 60FPS 1440p to eventually fluctuating 60FPS 720p). Most people probably wound't notice anyway.The game runs flawlessly and has great matchmaking and is constantly updated with experimental game modes or seasonal events.The only negative point that I would put was the addition of the loot crates for cosmetic items in addition of cosmetic expansion I bought them all because I wanted to support Psyonix .All in all it makes a great party game and I would recommend it 10 times over.,Rocket League®

Saves are satisfying shots are sufficiently difficult to master yet easy enough to learn and rockets add a whole element of verticality that can put you a cut above the competition.There are a few odd choices by the devs (Adding non standard shaped maps to the competitive rotation?) and an occasional bit of connection lag or matchmaking weirdness but overall the game is solid and worth getting your hands on.,Rocket League®

Graphics are up to date and so far I had very rare server problems. There is no need to pay money unless you want to to get a fancier or different car which is not neede cause all cars or (almost) the same. Otherwise it would be unfair. The game is somewhat based on your skill lvl which will improve during playing the game. It can be hard in the beginning to hit the ball the way you want to but just keep practising and you will improve. Matchmaking is based on your skill lvl. Have fun!,Rocket League®

2017-07-13,0,0,469,False,Recommended,Rocket League is such a gem of a game.When one of my friends first showed me Rocket League I thought it was a cool idea but never expected to get into it. I tried a game and I was immediately hooked. Something about the blend of soccer/futbol and rocket cars just works so well together.Psyonix has done a great job really mastering the formula on this one. Aesthetic skins car models rocket trails and so much more. They keep adding new items and game modes that really allow the game to feel fresh when you think you've played it all.The skill cap for this game is INCREDIBLY high thankfully there are workshop maps to help you work on your game.I wish there was a way to actually party with my console peasant friends but I'm not going to deduct any points for that.10/10,Rocket League®

2017-06-25,0,0,167,False,Recommended,"Soccer + Driving Soccar Rocket League best well known for it's seamless blend of the driving and football genres and over 150 'Best of 2015' Awards is a game that continues to amaze the gaming community with it's outragous and innovative ideas. The long awaited physics based sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars (or SARPBC for short) contains hundreds of hours of gameplay with an all new Season Mode new to fans of the game's predecesor and addictive 8 player online action.Players in Rocket League drive their own custom built Battle Car of which over 10 billion possible car combinations are available. The diversity of the cars are the driving force of the game's populairity as it appeals to people of all ages. Content and Updates/DLC Rocket League is well known for it's plethora of free updates and the occasional paid DLC. Free update come between 1 2 months consistenly. It can be as big as a whole new arena and new cars for example the 'Aquadome Update' in October 2016 or even something as small as the 'Fate of the Furiorus Update' in April 2017 which simply added a single new Battle Car. Regardless of content Rocket League updates have always recieved praise from the community. There has never been a bad updateAnother big factor on how Rocket League stands above all other competition is what is contained in their paid DLC. All paid content do not affect the gameplay it's that simple.If you were to purchase DLC for the game it would be cosmetics for your Battle Car. Sometimes it's wheels sometimes decals even occasionally an Import Battle Car. If somebody who came straight out of the game faced somebody with a paid car nobody would have the advantage or disadvantage. The only thing that comes in play is raw skill. Thoughts and Opnions If you would take a minute and browse my Steam account you would find that I've played Rocket League for over a whopping 130 hours. This says alot as I have been personally known to pick up titles and not hesitate to drop them if they don't appeal to me or my standards of game. Apart from a few select other games Rocket League is one of the only games I've spent more than 100 hours in.What makes Rocket League so amazing is it's (almost) perfect potrayal of what a real Soccar League would be like in the form of it's presentation. An example of this is when you score a goal a cinematic replay would exadgerate and glorify your shot as if it was straight out of a sports game.In conclusion taking into consideration all of my previously mentioned points I give Rocket League a 9.6/10 with the title of ""Immersive and Intense"".Visit the official Rocket League Website at https //www.rocketleague.com",Rocket League®

2017-01-23,0,0,21,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is the most moreish multiplayer game since Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. Psyonix's vehicular soccer simulation adeptly illustrates the idea that simple concepts can succeed when expertly executed. Rocket League is a good idea that's been expertly executed. While you may roll your eyes at the idea of a vehicular adaptation of America's least favourite sport this is a title that's hard to put down once you give it a try. There's much delight in discovering and learning advanced finesse moves and tactics in the game. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo or jumping into the air (being a wizard) to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just one more match"". Rocket League is a great goofy easy to learn and difficult to master game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds random people will do as well as some of them are friendly but you will run into people who are making you feel contempt if you're having a bad day.

Most people don't have $1 000 PCs to run Rocket League and if they had 1 000 bucks to spare they could just buy it for a console and get a few more games as well.

The thing is as a mac user its hard to play the game. my friend told a few months ago that RL was out for mac and the mac version was in beta so a few months later i got it. the game was good but i was highly disappointed because of the word we all hate. LAG. My internet speed is good and i had 0 ping and here i was barely able to hit the ball or even move accurately because of this unbearable lag. I reccomend the game but if your a mac user like me wait until the next patch or 2.,Rocket League®

2017-01-11,0,0,62,False,Recommended,Rocket League is fun easy to pick up and PG (so it's fun regardless of age).Pros Easy to pick up. Lots of players are online. So it's not hard to find a game in matchmaking. Although it's against bots there is a single player aspect to the game. Private matches allow for friend vs. friend games. There is a competitive side to the game (Both in normal and competitive matches). Although there are a few explosions it is a fairly PG game which makes it fun for the whole family.Cons It is hard to master. It may take some time to get used to. It seems to be designed around a controller. This could be a problem for those who prefer keyboard and mouse. There isn't a good reporting system. (This is up to date as of ths review but may change later.) There are quiet a few DLCs to buy. Also there are in game crates that require keys to open. These keys cost real money to buy.Final Thoughts For the base game $19.99 is a good price (especially if you can get it on sale). I got my money's worth out of it and then some.,Rocket League®

I'm not big on racing or sports games and yet Rocket League smashes the two genres together in a way that I cannot get enough of.

2017-01-18,0,0,1118,False,Recommended,This game is amazing I love pretty much everything about it the game plays very well the pysics are great most of the players are good too the community on this game is pretty much as good as it gets (Especially because the people on console can't yell at you in chat but PC players can.) the one thing that I do not like is the forfeit button I've basically stopped playing competitive because of this. Players love to forfeit the second the enemy scores on you and then if you don't accept then they just start throwing and just turtling upside down till the game is over I think there shouldn't be a forfeit button and the people who want to quit need to just leave and if they leave the need to get a hour competitive cool down for abandoning the match (and I mean an hour just to start I don't like how CSGO does that 30 minute cool down I don't think it's long enough.) and if the same person leaves a match 2 times in a row then give them 2 hours if they leave a 3rd time then 4 hours and so on and every week the player doesn't leave the cool down should go down a tier let's say that they just got a 4 hour cool down and then they don't leave for a week then it should go down to 2 hours if they leave and if they don't leave for another week after that then an hour E.T.C. I've had players try to forfeit and start to throw on me too many times (and I do report them and have the enemy team report them for unsportsmanlike conduct every time this happens but I'm not sure if anything has happened to them yet),Rocket League®

2017-06-14,0,0,7,False,Recommended,So Im gonna sum this up in this sentence for you lazy people. If you like Black Ops 3 and want your character to be a car while playing Soccer Hockey or basketball... Get this game.. I compared this to Black ops 3 because wall running. I love this game and Black ops 3 but enough of BO3 because this is ROCKET LEAGUE! So In this game you are a car playing soccer. You can chose your map car ball and even boost trails. You can ride the wall get power ups (if that gamemode is set) play soccer and drive at the same time! The double jump feature is amazing as well as the boost. I HIGHLY recommend this game because it is so much fun. They do have car DLC's if you wish to get but the game is still amazing without them. I would give this game a solid 9.5/10.

It is so funny how a year ago me and my teammates could have a lagspike and be frustrated but now every second is just a stutter or jump. I almost can't even play because it makes me so angry that I miss due to some awful cchange in my car's position due to server lag. Wether I have 30 ping or 100 ping it is all the same!

2016-01-06,0,0,622,False,Not Recommended,If there was a netural tecommendation option thats what I would have slected Overall it is a very good game and I would recommend it However in the last update whenever you want to leave a match you are automaticaly banned for 15 minutes. I underestand why they did this but it makes no sence. For example I was with two trolls on my team who just shot at our own goal and wouldn't vote to abandon. Why should I be punished for leaving the game when there are people not playing correctly? It just doesn't make sence. If you like the game and have a team then this game is for you however if you like to play alone sometimes find another game because there are too many people who don't play correctly or know how to play to make it worth the time EDIT After 300+ hours there is something that makes this game unplayable for a few week every few months. The rank reset at the begining of each season. Its unnessary and frankly is a waist of time for everyone and ruins match making. For referance I finished in the highest plat rank div 4. First game in new season is all players that finished in gold then the next was all diamon plus. There was a rank system that was sorted and worked why take it away it just doesnt make any since. Every game is one side for a few weeks it just isnt any fun.TLDR Casual players will like it if you play comp get ready to take a few weeks off every season until all the rank BS gets sorted out.,Rocket League®

Great to play alone or with friends. All of the content that has been added to the game for free has really amped up the value. Regardless the microtransactions and DLC are in my opinion competitively priced. Since buying the game near launch I have bought all of the DLC cars as well as 2 sets of 20 key's for in game loot boxes officially spending more than the price of the game itself.Live it. Love it.

2015-11-11,0,0,1078,False,Recommended,My review of this game has changed multiple times from recommended to not and now backWho is kidding who this game is crazy fun. After 2 years we know the devs aren't going to fix issues that have persisted(if you want to see an AI controlled car hump a goalpost this is the game for you......and if you like dealing with salty people you have found a home.........also if you like connection issues that make games look more like an acid trip than a fluid game this is way cheaper than acid). Instead they prefer to put their time and energy into figuring out how to gouge more money out of people(having to buy keys to unlock your reward for playing and a neverending supply of new cars if you want to spend more). In spite of all the issues I keep playing and enjoying myself more often than not so I feel I must recommend the game....with reservations,Rocket League®
2017-07-23,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,Excellent game heres why the negative review PerformanceIts not bad since its not a demanding game but relativley speaking this game has gotten worse as time has gone by. I have a 960m which at the time of purchase in December could run 60fps highest settings with medium AA. Now after 2 games it will tank to 35 and fluctuate 15 fps up and down from there. The only way to solve this is to restart the game where it will be 60fps for the first 2 games and then... i am not sure this is exclusive to mobile chips but for those planning to play on laptop you might want to wait for a patch or two.If you are not in this category pick this right up. It is super fun to play by yourself or with a party. Matchmaking is pretty good for the most part you will always find a game with similarly skilled opponents and cross network play is a plus. Community is good so you dont need to worry about trolls. Ai replaces dropped players and new players replace AI all in one game. Fast paced and tense theres nothing like the rush of adrenaline you get when scoring on a great play or making a good save. Cars and soccer has never been so fun. If you havent seen by now there are many reviews with players clocking in 1000 hours this is a easy to play hard to master title so car soccer wont get boring. Theres also basketball hockey and some other game modes to try out all ive found are easy and great fun to jump in. The game is fair with simple controls and a great visual style that is easy to max out on a lot of older desktop gpus.I will update my review when i am able to enjoy what ive just described!,Rocket League®

Welcome to another game with a crate system _ I personally despise them it took me around 7 months to save up enough crates to trade for Pink Voltaics (I refuse to spend money on crates)The community on twitch are toxicI'd say 40% of players in game are toxic and blame other players for their own shortcomingsThe Esports scene is cheesy being too serious at times then ridiculously absurd at other times (too many memes gets way too annoying) I think many people above the age of 16 will agree with me on that I had to stop watching the espotsBuy the game it is amazing.

Not the type of game I'm usually into but it is just incredibly well done.It is easy to understand and your friends will be able to pick it up in 5 minutes. Very good for a quick couple rounds just for fun. It's one of the few (and best) games with full controller support and local splitscreen I really think this game proves that these features are valuable on the PC platform!On the other hand it's also very hard to master. The mechanics of making the car do exactly what you want is really tricky and the results can be extremely impressive. There is a talented competitive online scene and anyone looking to sink hundreds of hours into this game can definitely stay entertained (or addicted). Highly recommended I think this will become a classic.,Rocket League®

2016-09-06,0,0,679,False,Not Recommended,"Community is brutal matchmaking is worse. The game is addicting I'll give them that but otherwise it's difficult to enjoy in competitive modes. I've made it as high as platinum and still found myself regularly matched with (e.g.) low to mid silver ranked players while matched against 2 platinums and a gold. The opposite does happen too of course but considering the entire ranking system is based on winning or losing streaks this sort of matchmaking can get really frustrating and is frankly innaccurate. The result is that you find yourself playing with and against players who aren't a good match for your skill level and they collectively have more ability to impact your rank than you do (either positively or negatively). This simply takes away from the fun of the game since blowouts are far more common than close matches and are less exciting whether you are winning or losing. It'd be nice if they had some sort of secondary contributor to your rank for example Track stats separately from games where you are ranked within 1 division of every other player and use those results in tandem with the overall win loss ratio in order to determine rank. Or at the very least implement a system where you don't rank down if you had the most points on your team (or worse on both). Some sort of balance for the more than occasional bad matchup with poor teammates/strong opponents would improve this game drastically. Sadly this sort of advice constantly goes unheard and more developer focus is put into new decals wheels and crate items than into gameplay or community management. Which brings me to back to my first point the community is toxic plain and simple. Yes you can turn off chat and I often do. However that can interfere with gameplay if you want to strategize and leaves you basically hoping/assuming that your teammates have the same gameplan as you and will cycle/position themselves accordingly. Communication is key in team based games and when the community is so poor you feel the need to disable chat gameplay is affected. The worst players are always the worse offenders naturally but the inability to leave matches leaves you stuck in games with these people for 5 minutes at a time (I'm not suggesting you should be able to leave on demand although the option to do so when down by 5+ goals wouldn't hurt anyone). That doesn't sound so bad right it's only 5 minutes after all? Well try getting matched with the same toxic player for 4 or 5 consecutive competitive matches despite reporting their toxicity in every match (and having the other players do the same) and still being matched with them over and over. This has happened to me despite leaving the queue searching for a game cancelling and searching again. This is nonsense there are 10k people in my playlists but they can't match me with someone who I haven't reported multiple times? Why? This happens far more often than it should. Which would be somewhat acceptable except that this same toxic player can just as easily spend those 4 or 5 consecutive matches reporting you for nothing and having you banned for 24 hours the next time you try and log on. You didn't ask to be matched with the player 5 times you did your best to avoid it and you stay patient and turn off chat and do what you can yet he still has the ability to report you and I suppose Psyonix doesn't bother monitoring the matches when they see 5+ reports on the same player (may they correct me if I'm wrong).Despite all this the gameplay is actually great easy to pickup but difficult to master and the game does give you a lot of ability to improve on your own game with multiple game modes and a plethora of user created training modules. The gameplay would earn an easy 5 stars if it weren't regularly hindered by poor connectivity issues and server problems. I've had 7 consecutive games fail to start because one or more players could not connect in time. While this extreme situation only happened to me once it's not uncommon whatsoever to experience 3 consecutive failed matchups. Some of the maps have a lot of issues for a lot of players and some of the crate items banners dlcs etc. also cause performance issues for a lot of players. It's not unusual to play for an hour of unhindered performance only to see your FPS drop to high 20s low 30s without explanation for the next hour (when typically running 60FPS steady with virtually no faltering). Overall for the price you really can't hate the game. But after over 600 hours of gameplay I can't honestly recommend its purchase as wholeheartedly as I once did. I find the more you play it the more it's flaws begin to outweigh it's strong points and the more frustrating it becomes to deal with the seemingly constantly increasing number of issues with the games performance and with its community. The new ban system seemed great but can easily be abused by the very people it's supposed to be filtering out and as such ultimately fails in achieving any goal other than reducing the amount of outright vulgarity these troll type players tend to engage in which is positive for the younger members of the community (this is more or a less a childrens game after all) but doesn't succeed in reducing the amount of toxicity that still exists within the game as a whole. Even non competitive games are commonly plagued by toxic players sometimes more so because they feel entitled to behave in such a way since other players can just leave and trolls would rather win against bots than lose against other players. Every gaming community has issues with toxic players but Rocket League almost seems to incentivize them whether intentionally or not. It's easy to say ""just ignore it "" but after almost 650 hours of gameplay each one arguably worse than the last my response is simply ""why even play if there's more to ignore than there is to enjoy?"".",Rocket League®

2017-06-26,0,0,42,False,Recommended,Ah car soccer (or football if you are 'murica challenged) so addicting yet something keeps holding me back from completely giving my thumbs up for this game yet.The biggest (in order of wow this sucks to holy this is trash) issues I have with the game are as follows 1. The customization in this game whilst pretty extensive as a whole is barely accessible unless you plan on taking part in every gamer's favorite new gaming trend M I C R O T R A N S A C T I O N S there isn't really any other way to get any really cool customizeables that make your car a fireball that spews out lightning and wears only the finest in designer hats with spinning dollar sign rims that spew out Tron effects (you know the one where they draw lines wherever they drive those cool motorcyles).2. The framerates in this game are a little iffy. I turned down a couple of settings and now the game runs perfect for me but I can totally see this being an issue on older cheaper machines.3. The sheer scale and scope of the mechanics in this game are daunting as . This is my biggest issue with car soccer/football by a longshot. This game is a commitment if you want to get good at it and it's really frustrating trying to play with other people when most of them are better than you are and then even still when you see that those people are only silvers and there are so many other even better players who have hundreds of hours in the game and even some of them haven't mastered the movement and tricks in this game 100% of the time. It's scary just thinking about the sheer gap between a beginning player such as myself and someone who is playing this game on an actual competitive roster. Other games don't really have skill gaps like this granted other games don't have the same requirements of gamesense and reflexes that car soccball has.All in all this game is still fun and I love the art design some of the maps go with (Wasteland is a particular favorite because what's not to love about playing foot car whilst mad max fallout post apocylyptic future t is happening) (oh neo tokyo is cool too because cyberpunk). I still don't really know if I want to recommend this game yet though just because of the monumental task that is building skill in this game. Maybe if I get moderately good at this game in under 100 hrs I will go ahead and recommend it but for now I am just gonna keep this review neutral.(EDIT right steam makes you say yes or no to recommending well I will say no for now but I'll get back to ya if I change my mind)EDIT 2 Yeah it's still pretty fun buy it,Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,127,False,Recommended,"Football (or .. ""Soccer"" ugh) + Cars Awesome Combination!Pretty basic game concept shoot the ball into the enemies goal and prevent that they do the same to you.It works is easy to learn but hard to master and is overall fun! Fitting background music in the menus and soundeffects ingame. Nothing more I have to say.",Rocket League®
2016-11-24,0,0,521,False,Recommended,So after 400 hours or so of playing Rocket League it's safe to say that it's pretty damn awesome. It's an easy to pickup REALLY hard to master type of deal. Not really anything I can see that others haven't said a thousand times by now. Just got pick up it you will not regret it in the slightest!Just be warned that the community is toxic AF. (as the kids would say) It's no CS GO just yet but damn. It's become habit for me to mute everyone but my teammates at the start of a game never thought that I would develop that kind of habit but here we are.,Rocket League®

2017-10-21,0,0,126,False,Recommended,If you don't know what this game is about it is basically soccer/football with cars. The goal of the game is to score as many points in the 5 minute time limit as possible. The gamemodes are duel (1v1) doubles (2v2) standard (3v3 with parties) solo standard (3v3 with no parties) chaos (4v4) hoops (2v2 basketball) snow day (3v3 hockey) dropshot (3v3 with goal on the floor) rumble (3v3 with powerups) and rocket labs (3v3 used to test new maps). Now onto the review this game takes physics and throws it right out the window and it works great. The ball bounces everywhere and is constantly changing directions to cause randomization in gameplay. Rocket League has a lot to do with patience you need to know when it is smart to boost towards the ball or when to stay near your goal as a defender. It is extremely fun to play with friends however playing solo is fun as well. The game has very good graphics and I am quite happy with how much detail went into the game. The game also features a growing eSports circuit that has developer support to allow it to be spread towards the casual player. Rocket League also has a lot of customization features that allow you to make your car unique.Overall the game is incredibly fun to play with friends and I highly recommend it to anyone that loves both sports and cars. I personally purchased the game in the summer of 2015 and I got to see the game grow and change into what we know it as today. I definitely think I made a good purchase and I am happy Psyonix made such a good and enjoyable game. I give Rocket League a 92/100.,Rocket League®

2017-11-09,0,0,32,False,Recommended,"I have put so many hours into this game and every time I see myself play I think ""hmmm... I suck so much today..."" But when I look at how I played when I was a couple of levels lower (I'm level 75) for example level 30 I think to myself that although I may think I suck at champion rank I would be amazing in the gold ranks... It's such an amazing game cus you don't see yourself getting better you can only see yourself getting better when you look at your replays. Pros All physics based so every mistake made by the player Every car has the same stats exept for the hitbox which makes every car good for a different thing without changing any other stats like speed jump height etc. Many different modes and a Steam workshop. Teamplay especially in the more skilled teams is so beautiful to look at.Cons Lots of toxic players (especially on the NA servers (I'd recommend EU or Australian servers unless you have very high pings in these servers) Matchmaking is bad I mostly get placed in matches against people that are way better than me and then my teammate tells me I'm bad but I can't do anything about it because I've been put in a match with players that are better than me. Again... Teamplay some people even in the Champion ranks can't even rotate propperly or when I'm in the field waiting for a pass with tons of space and my teammate just goes in all by himself and most of the time doesn't score...",Rocket League®

2016-12-18,0,0,639,False,Recommended,"You can tell quite well that this game is based off of a version of football(soccer) playing using small cars to push a big ball around and into the goal. There are seasonal gamemodes that shake things up as well as a ""Rocket Labs"" gamemode that turns the game into something completely different. There is a competitive mode that is ranked and places you against players with similar skill levels this works out pretty well due to the very high skill ceiling this game has in comparison to other sports games. Game can become repetitive if played repeatedly.",Rocket League®

2016-12-18,0,0,304,False,Recommended,Friends of mine and I bought the 4 Pack version of this game so that we could all play together. This game is absolutely brilliant and it quivkly replaced games like Left 4 Dead 2 and Dirt 3 for some simple multiplayer games between us. The soundtrack is amazing and fits the game well. The graphics are not very demanding but still very pleasing.Generally a great video game.HOWEVEROut of what is a 19 99 game I expected no microstransactions. Sure they are only for cosmetic things and sure they don't affect the gameplay. But I still find it a hit under the belt to pay a 10nth of the price of the entire full game for a nicely rendered model of a DeLorean.Also do yourself a service and get a controller to play this game. It is playable without but playing with a controller is much more enjoyable.,Rocket League®

There's absolutely no advantage gained by purchasing the DLCs and the trading options makes it so that one can simply trade crates for the stuff one craves to pimp the rides up. What surprises me the most is the fact that I completely suck at this game despite over 600 hrs of playtime and yet I love it.

2016-11-23,0,0,319,False,Recommended,"The Steam Awards make this a perfect time to review Rocket League my personal nomination for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award and it fits perfectly for Rocket League specially because a single match lasts for (about) 5 minutes. Matches can be so fun or intense that 5 minutes isn't long enough you'll always end wanting more there isn't a game in which I said ""just one more"" as much as this one.The game has good graphics and good optimization although details outside the field could take away some performance from old computers very few bugs give the player seamless entertainment.Controls are intuitive but hard to master making this a great game for both casual and competitive players.Even just a few sound effects enhance your gameplay with their quality some even have nice touches like in ""Hoops"" mode.Overall Rocket League is a great game for almost everyone looking for something new to play don't let balls and goals fool you you don't need to be a sports fan to enjoy it and don't think this is a silly or shallow game just because your favorite youtuber played it for a few hours this game has a cool depth in its mechanics. And honestly at this price? there's no reason for you not to buy!",Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,380,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Awesome game very team based randoms are harder then playing with people in friends list though unless you have mad skillz. All cars are very customizable along with goal explosions that look beast what more can you ask for from a game that is a mix between soccer and rocket cars. I had my doubts at first because I'm not a sports fan to start off with but this is hard not to get into. I never had plans on even getting this game to play honestly if I didn't win a Chivalry Mideval Warfare Challenge I won I would have never possibly heard or even played it. I have never been a Major sports fan I mean I do enjoy going outside and playing soccer and other sports with friends at school but watching a screen and playing a sports game that people have teams that people can go outside and do and also people actually pummel each other to death because it's their team that does nothing for them is absolutely rediculous for people to do in my opinion that's why I never been a fan of sports outside of the X Games which has been one things since I was little and always loved watching. But as I was saying Rocket League is a game that is for all ages and ranked seperates the age gapes quite nicely until you play randoms and find yourself having 1 if not 2 team mates that would make you want to play wack a mole with your keyboard cause they have absolutely no business in the match your in but when your playing with friends that you personally know or over the internet that is when the game shines it's brightest and is fun. The game is Pure Communication base and skill on who can pass the best aerial the best(which takes tons of practice) and who can control the ball on the ground and in the air along with fakes and mind games there is so many skills you need to nail or get moderately good at such as shadow defense aerials dribbling fakes bullets pinches wave dashes and so much more I highly recommend this game even if you are not a sports fan at all it's a e sports game that is well recognized and for good reasons with over 40M people who play it worldwide. It's a very simulation like game if Soccer was played with jetpacked cars.,Rocket League®

The possibilities in this easy to get into hard to master title are absolutely endless. The Dev team is really commited to this game they are open to their community and responsible to them.A rare thing these days...For example when i started playing this game there was basically just casual and ranked play with a couple of maps. The amount of playable cars was less than half what it is today the tutorials were basic and dev driven.Now THOUGH! hOLY There are a (million)#exaggerating cars! You can play there take on other classic games like hockey and basketball there is a community driven tutorial outlet now a game based economy trading.

However with all the expienced players in this community there is so much to learn.When the original version of the game came out ""battle cars"" it did fail... Didn't turn out too great thus dying very quickly. However when Phyonix saw that the original game failed they never gave up. They continued to work on the same concept which was rocket league. Thay listened to the community and even realised the game for PSplus when it first came out. Very risky move but came out with a high reward.

2016-04-26,0,0,75,False,Recommended,Rocket Leauge is a surprisingly simple game with an ocean of depth to it. It's easy to pick up and learn how to play yet spending a lot of time with it and learning the game tropes controls and stratagies makes it have an incredibly high skill celieng. It's simplicity leads to the game having next to no bugs and the games netcode is supurb with little to no disconects or crashes for me in 24+ hours of gameplay. This may be an unpopular opinion but I feel that E sports were created for games like this. This is a tactical game that anyone can watch and understand without having to be into video games. Unlike LoL or Dota it is something that resembles an actually flesh and blood sport. I am extremely please to see this game doing so well and hope for the best for its future. After playing this I really plan on getting into the pro scene. It's soccer on steroids and man is it a blast.Rating 95/100,Rocket League®

2017-12-08,0,0,598,False,Recommended,This game is easy to get frustrated at however the more you play and more skills you get as you continue to play the better handle on the ball you will have and the easier it will be to play with other people you don't know. When I started playing this game I completely sucked at it but my friends who had hundreds of hours at a time just said if I wanted to play and get better I would just have to play and hit around the ball in training mode as much as I can in order to get a good feel for the ball control as well as the car I am using.The artsyle is nice and I appreciate the particle effects of certain boosts and animated decals for specific cars.Ranked can be frustrating but its not a terrible system and playing with your friends is always fun.Overall if you have some friends who own the game or want to buy the game get a group of people and give it a try. There are various game modes offered so if you are just looking for a fun game and nothing that is serious all of the time give this a try.,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,1222,False,Recommended,Rocket Powered Soccars! If you're not into this game after playing it you're doing it wrong. Seriously great game for playing with friends. If you buy this don't rage quit because you're not good EVERYONE is bad at first. Other than its predecessor there is no other game like this. So it's nothing like playing another FPS you can't just pick it up and be good. There are loads of things you can learn to do and many little hidden secrets about the physics of the game but you can learn them all(there are plenty of videos and tutorials online). From wall shots to arials to the much more difficult air dribbling and freestyle. All this said strategy trumps all arial all you want if you're not focused on team play and acting like a dog only focused on the ball you will lose. Seriously learn to focus on teammates and understand what rotating is.It feels simple to begin with but after a while you realize there's so much more you're capable of. First you learn to actually hit the damn ball and after enough time you're flying through the air like mavrick shooting down that ball straight into the goal.,Rocket League®

Did I slowly get into it and then treat it like a winner for game of the year? Maybe I dont remember. Although the game is extremely simple its beautiful!

2016-02-06,0,0,926,False,Recommended,First ImpressionsGreat game but I hate how the corners of the map are rounded off like so the ball can go upward... if it was a flat platform with a rounded wall i would be fine with it Feb 6 2016After 400 hours ImpressionThere are many pros and cons about this game but i would say many more pros than cons my initial impression of the game was when i bought the game 2 years ago and knew nothing about mechanics and how this game would rise to the top the esports and become one of the most competetive games my generation.Characteristics Takes hundreds of hours to just get out of gold Aerials will destroy you so learn them fast Rotating is key don't be that guy. Most of the community is great but there still are toxic players. Solo queing is the devil find a friend and grind the ranks. Don't get mad although this game is competitive it's still a game have fun.Last but not least Crates they are a sole money grab that i myself i have put money into the chances of getting a import or exotic are actually not hard to come by compared to CSGO but all in all crates will ruin your bank acct bc who doesn't want a nice pair of painted Dracos.

2016-10-14,0,0,1070,False,Recommended,I absolutely recommend rocket league. It is an incredible well done competitive fun game that typically groups you against players of your skill level however if I could rate Psyonix separate from Rocket League I would probably give them a C or a D.They are simply lucky they made such an amazing game that transcends all the garbage that has gone along with it.1) Loot crates are a stupid waste of time and in general is a loathsome business practice in games. I don't mind a game that has loot crates that at least utilize the Steam marketplace to let you bypass the garbage crate system to just buy what you want.2) The early RLCS tournaments were embarrassing. Consistently using the same tournament source watching it crash for an entire day for both of the first two tournaments is a joke.3) While servers are mostly stable they could definitely use some work and updating. Instead Psyonix puts tons of resources on useless new maps and game modes that a very small percent of their userbase cares about.4) It took them over a year to listen to their players and finally remove non standard maps from the ranked circuit despite negative feedback early and often.5) Finally the single biggest issue I have with Psyonix is the completely worthless reporting system. All online games have their fair share of idiots and children who have no issue ruining the game experience for others. Rocket League has a reporting system that does absolutely nothing. No Follow up I've never seen or heard of any discipline handed out as a result of a reporting. Far too often a simple honest mistake in game leads to someone getting offended and flipping their car on their hood for the rest of the match. (I had this happen in a 0 0 game today I could MAYBE understand if it were a blowout).In summary I love this game. I strongly recommend it. I just wish Psyonix took more pride in their work and was more interested in cleaning it up.,Rocket League®

If you want to play this game i would strongly recommend getting the game but its fun for most people. The competitive side of the game has a grey area. Matchmaking doesnt always help your cause when it comes to ranking. You may get setuo against a way higher level player and have teamates that dont do much to help you or your other teamates out. especially if you do solo standard. Since i have played the game the challenge level is not to bad. I scored 3 goals in my first play through of this game and have made many videos on this game.

2015-10-09,0,0,65,False,Recommended,Having just got a PC capable of running high end games I did not expect it to be Rocket League that filled all my spare time. The glorious colour pallette and instant playability belies a complex and rewarding game. Sure if you join late like me there is a learning curve to be somewhat able to compete with those playing from day one but a little training and perseverence will soon have you saving shots like czech dominating the midfield like Gerrard and scoring bicicle kicks that Pele would be proud of. The solo play leaves a little to be desired both your teammates and opposition AI will make silly errors and there is really only a league to play in and then you are done. Good for a little practice but it wont chew up your time like online play will. Like I said i'm late to the party but I think everyone will be dancing and drinking for a while yet.Update With all the new additions to cars toppers and stadiums this game is still the best multiplayer experience around... just with a fancier hat and a basketball.

It's a nice game to fill in little gaps at work or just kill some time in general without having to worry about leaving in the middle of a match. Great company that actually cares about its players. They are constantly updating the game and adding more and more content. Its great that the developers are still creating new game modes and expanding the content in the game without changing the balance or giving paying players an advantage.,Rocket League®

2016-11-08,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,I really like this game I really do but there's just one thing that just makes me never want to play this game and its the servers. This is the only game with servers with huge lag spikes. My ping is normally around everyone else's in game (roughly 30 40 ping) which is normal but on occassions my ping goes slightly high (anywhere from 50 75 or even a whopping 45 ping) and then my game has a stroke or a seizure of some kind and I get a massive lag spike and I can't tell whats going on cause everything and everyone is teleporting. I don't know why this and ONLY THIS game does this. I can play any other online game and I get no lag spikes but with this game it just lag spikes every 5 15 seconds and I can't play well when I go for the ball and magically phase through it. Until they can fix their servers from having a heart attack every time I jump a tiny bit in ping its just not fun and pretty much unplayable really.,Rocket League®

The matches are short enough that if you get bored you can play a match or two and be over it in 10 mins. I really love this game. I HIGHLY recomend it.,Rocket League®

2018-01-28,0,0,600,False,Recommended,I know my hours are low on here I just made the jump from console to PC earlier this month. However that being said this game has some of the most addicting gameplay I've ever experienced in any genre. There are so many different aspects to improve upon and master that there is literally not a single pro (to date) that is considered a master of all things. That's pretty amazing if you think about it. The other thing that makes this game so much fun (and somethimes frustrating) is that you will never have a match that was exactly like the previous. Add in the immense amount of technical difficulty that sometimes ends up in a gorgeous double touch/ ceiling shot/air dribble/ team pass/ insane save and you have the perfect heart stopping face palming FeelsBadMan ing gameplay that makes me come back every single day. I would reccomend this to anyone that wants to see where their skill ceiling is and enjoys that one shining moment where you absolutely crush your opponent's hopes and dreams. Also watch SquishyMuffinz Johnny_boi and SunlessKhan to truly start to learn some of the true glory you can achieve. GLHF!,Rocket League®

2018-03-05,0,0,858,False,Recommended,After almost 550 hours I feel like i can give this game it's review.It's ubelievably good.Rocket League is the kind of game you can start up for the first time with your mates and laugh yourselves silly trying to get the damn ball into the net. But once you adjust the settings and mess around in free play and against the bots and play a couple of games online you'll soon realise this game can take years to get really good at heck I play this game all the damn time and i'm nowhere near as good as a lot of people.The best thing about it is that the premise is always the same it's just football with cars that can jump and fly and that never changes but if you are dedicated enough to attempt to master it it wil always be fun.Pros +Incredibly simple concept+Physics are really well thought out and customisable in private matches +Cars are extremely customisable meaning you will nearly always have a unique design+There is no way to pay to get an advantage over other players any cosmetic items from crates/DLC's are purely that cosmetic. (Cars have slightly different stats but none are faster/objectively better in any way)+Varying and imaginative game modes+Steam Workshop support (Although i don't think Macs handle this mine doesn't load community maps)+Very reasonable price+You cannot complete this game only let it take over your life (still a plus)+Ability to turn off in game chat when players are toxic+Training packs the ones that come with the game are extremely useful but the addition of custom training sequences mean you can practise the same shot as many times as it takes to get it. Cons Some maps don't play as well on older systems Sometimes run into toxic players May just be me but custom maps from the workshop don't work on Mac If you're in the U.S there are no central servers only East or West meaning 100+Ping may be regular if you live central.Overall just get this game if you were thinking of spending 15 on dinner tonight don't bother just starve and play this all night you'll thank me in the morning.,Rocket League®

Probably have more logged hours into this game than 10 times i have any other game. It's nonstop fun! I wish PSN recorded how many hours you play a game.

2017-11-24,0,0,618,False,Recommended,Rocket league is hands down one of the best games ever made. Its genius is in its simplicity. The rules are simple you have a car and there a ball. All you have to do to win is get the ball into the opponents net. That's it. And that simplicity helps make it one of the most addicting competitive games ive ever play. Im an avid fan of 1v1 which is in my opinion the best game mode in the game. You and your opponents have the same field the same rules and the same physics. You both get one controller and a choice of car. The rest is up to you. In for example CSGO there are alot of things that might drastically alter your chances of success. For example the gun you have the map you're on and the randomness element of where your bullets land. There is none of that in rocket league. You both have the exact same setup of a controller and car. And all what matters is the skill you have vs your opponents skill. And i think that is what makes rocket league such a brilliant game.Another big plus is how short every round is. Because you only spend roughly 5 minutes in every game you dont need a lot of commitments to play the game. I often find myself starting the game up as i get home playing a few rounds then go on to doing something else. And ive been doing this routine almost every game for two years now and i cant see myself stopping anytime soon.Id rate rocket league 10/10 a true masterpiece,Rocket League®

OLD review The game itself is really good playing it feels very nice.HOWEVER it tends to go through good and bad phases you find yourself loving the game and hating it the next month..Saying this the game is now in that bad state. The community has become extremely toxic from what was relatively fine a few months back. Your teammates will leave refuse to cooperate or derank on purpose. The ranks this season are very unbalanced while there are a bunch of rranks for the top 10% rest of the players get often matched up with players of very different skillset and seeing that although you are in the better half of players playing the game and having a rank just above the begginers doesnt add very much to it. At this moment i do not reccomnd buying the game unless you are playing ONLY with friends.

It's great as a filler game between other longer games (say DOTA) or as a longer binge with friends. I picked it up on sale for myself and later bought another license for retail price. If that doesn't say enough I've also purchased some of the DLCs as I do want to support these guys. That for those that know me is a huge endorsement alone.,Rocket League®

2016-11-27,0,0,1233,False,Recommended,First of all I would recommend this game a lot I have a considerable amount of hours on this game and despite this I feel like I can always hop on the game and have a good time with my friends. Although it can get repetitive at times I always feel that I am having a good time and I dont get bored of it easily. It is a great game to play in a big group of people whether there is four friends or even more and you create a private match and have fun together as a bigger group. My main improvement for this game would be the competitive side since I have played this game a lot I find myself needing a challenge and I wish that the competitive mode was more refined and the matchmaking in competitive was fair and that the ranking system made more sense as sometimes I find myself winning three games in a row and not going up a division. I like the inclusion of crates although keys areexpensive it allows you try out new things and keeps the game fresh.Overall this is a good game and if you enjoy playing a nice fun game with your friends then this is one to do so...,Rocket League®

Rumble is fun and adds a whole new set of rules to the game however that being said I'm very disappointed with the addition of micro transactions. They tend to ruin any game that implements them. Sure lots of people will shell out money but now theres no way to actually earn things with out having to buy the ability to use them. These crates you earn have an item inside that you MUST buy to use. I find this to be rediculous if you earn something from playing shouldnt you be able to use that with out having to pay? Apparantly not. At $1.49 the keys for the crates might not seem expensive but these ""possible contents"" are there to entice you to buy them ""look at this new body for this car you already have and check out this really cool decal"" but its random everytime. It is also entirely possible to get duplicates from crates so it's basically a gamble. I myself have only come across three crates got the same decal that wasnt even listed for a car I dont even like. I'd gladly pay for a bundle of cars or a bundle of decals but I will not pay to get the same item over and over. I know a lot of people would be much happier spending money on cars and decals if they knew EXACTLY what they would get. Sorry for the rant but I honestly think the crates/key system is stupid and should be removed.",Rocket League®

2017-09-01,0,0,148,False,Recommended,"I wanna keep it brief but its kinda hard to as there is so much with this game yet its so simple.Let me give you a brief description on what this game is.Its like soccer but with cars and speed boosts along the map. Watch a couple videos. It's pretty self explanatory. Customization You can customize your car to your liking. You can get a hat and an intenna for your car to customize it. Whether it be a common uncommon rare and other valued hats/intennas from playing games online. Change the paint of your car the body of your car the design of the paint on your car the wheels etc. There are crates you can recieve after finishing games to open them you DO have to purchase keys. Kinda like the whole CS GO scene. Gameplay RIght off the bat I recommend doing the trainings. A lot of people usually skip it but this game is all about practice and learning new tricks to score goals against your opponent. Also another tip is to look up professional rocket league players either on youtube or twitch and see how they play and learn their movements with the car. Leveling up in this game takes a while but that is only due to the fact that when you do level up it shows other opponents that you are really dedicated to the game and spend a decent amount of time playing it.Competitive Yes there is a competitive scene. The competitive style is like the Overwatch style. There are seasons for the competitive play as well as divisions Bronze Silver Gold Plat ect. What can I say its fun competitive intense funny you'll get heated af but its a fun ride. NOTE From what I have acknowledged over the course of playing this game using a controller is 10x better. Yes you can use a controller from your PS4/Xbox and plug it into your computer. Controllers give you more options to manuever the car around the playing field. Overall Consensis Definitley a ""chill with friends"" kinda game Very competitive among friends You get inspired to do better as you see others doing so well Playing the gamemode ""Rumble"" will create tons of laughs Beware of being too toxic as you actually do get banned Enjoy!Rating 10/10",Rocket League®

Still after seeing all the hype online I decided to try it and it's as fun as it looks like. The concept is really enjoyable but it can be hard to control the cars with practice you'll improve the skills thou.The only problem is with the multiplayer at least playing outside the US where sometimes a &gt 130 ping would take all the fun and your skill won't matter it will be laggy.,Rocket League®

Even after soon to be 200 hours of game play I am mediocre at best but that doesn't take away from the fun I have while playing this game. The fascinating thing about it is that the enjoyment happens right from the start and doesn't seem to end (well a streak of loses might infuriate you for a while but you'll get back even more determined). The learning curve was a very gradual thing to me and I am sure others are going to learn a lot faster some of the more advanced stuff than I have. The ranking system is decent now although I am one of those who thinks that it did not need to be changed in the first place anyway but whatever...

2016-11-25,0,0,1673,False,Recommended,"Tl dr Recommended Rating 95/100 First things first I am writing this review in order to support the game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" Award and let's be honest many of us (including me) have done this until we realise that the sun has risen. xDThe Review Part Playing this game since it was first released I can definitely say that I haven't gotten bored a single time since there is always something new to try and/or learn. Moreover it has taught me to expect the unexpected.The physics of the game is pretty good and understandable. What I mean is that you are able to predict the trajectory of the ball for most of the times although there are a few peculiarities. In addition the battlecars are designed in a way that have different behaviors that suit the different needs of the players still with respect to the overall physics pack.Finally there are quite a few maps available to play some of them with unique design which make the game richer in content. Speaking of content new things come out regularly enriching the game.The only drawback of the game (and possibly of most multiplayer games) is the sometimes not best matchmaking.Concluding as many reviewers have cited before me ""Easy game to pickup extremely hard to master"" but definitely a very fun and possibly addicting experience whether one is a casual player or a hardcore gamer.I would recommend this game to others but an advance warning as mentioned above don't expect to have a nice time as a beginner but don't get disheartened by that. It'll take a good amount of time until you can figure out how and when to do certain things (a.k.a. ""learn the game"").",Rocket League®
2016-11-25,0,0,439,False,Recommended,Easily one of the most addicting games I've ever played! It's pretty easy to pick up and be okay at but it takes a lot of practice to get really good at it. Devs are continuously adding new arenas and game modes and there always seems to be a decent amount of people playing.Their DLC is usually pretty decent and it's a nice way to help keep the servers up. Crate system kinda sucks but when you've got people literally spending thousands of dollars on a couple digital items I don't see it going away any time soon.Highly recommend this game to everyone!,Rocket League®

I have been trying to play throughout the day and i will constistently desync and warp 100+ feet in any direction or even just 3 (thus missing the ball and often being scored on). In a game where timing and spacial reasoning are so important this needs to be resolved so that people in the Midwest or really anywhere that's not the ""video game hubs"" of the US can enjoy this amazing game.This review will change when I see this problem resolved.",Rocket League®
2015-11-12,0,0,15,False,Recommended,"What a riot I tell you! So simple and easy to use the crowds are even bobbing blobs lol. Sheer simple clean fun! I was almost getting bored of it then I got into a one on one dual. Then I got tired of that and played on some funky arenas. Then when I was having lots of fun I entered a multiplayer mashup where the ball for one round was HUGE and then the next round the ball was normal but it went into slow motion often. You really need a controller for this game and with it it's quite basic but still with a tad of a learning curve. There are quick keys for saying things replays and a good multiplayer set up system. However once I was on a team that was getting badly beaten and they all left and it was me against three pros! I stayed for the challenge because I'm just that cool but obviously lost the round. It was fun though! You don't die well you get blown up sometimes but you quickly respawn right where you were and it's just for some competitive fun. You can drive along the walls also. There is nobody trying to kill you destroy your car or anything like that. Everyone just wants to get the ball in the net. What really does it for me is that it's just like being out on a field playing soccer with your friends but with rocket powered cars! Soccer and need for speed combined just without the cops! Also the car customization is fun you can either make your ride bad simple or goofy as can be. Although the graphics are rather good if on full settings it's really basic and simple yet well made. They did everything right without making it complicated. Sometimes I get baffled by games where you have to learn sooo much. I like that sometimes but it's nice to have a game where you just have fun like you did (or do) in school on lunch break in the field.It's also a 2.5ish GB download so not much space or download time required. It's also linked to the ps4 versions of the game so if you have friends with a ps4 you can play with themI'll be fair and list the cons. Let me think here. a rather small number of arenas that I have noticed compared to what you would expect from a 2015 game Nothing much to learn except getting used to the physics and menuevering your car around and getting the ball to go where you want to go to me this is kind of a pro or a con depending on your preferance No real campaign or story I found AI kind of boring to play against. I only really enjoyed the multiplayer apparently not available for xbox most people and maybe they aren't on PC don't type their comments they just use the quick keys to say things like ""OMG"" or ""nice shot"" etc. which actually makes it a lot more positiveNeutral comments not really a way to vent if you are angry whereas powning noobs in battlefield is basic ranking system. You are either rookie semi pro pro etc and can also choose not to show your rankingI don't know what to say other than that. If you like playing sports and/or driving rocket propelled cars and have or will get a controller you should really get this game.

Bought it same day. 10/10 Should've bought it sooner.If anything I think it would pay off to have a single player demo download of the game that can only play 1 map 1 car with bots.

2017-07-30,0,0,77,False,Recommended,"GREAT GAME OVERALL. i got the game on sale for about 10 dollars and it was well worth the price. The game design is sooo good. it's one of the ""easy to play hard to master"" games which i love. I strongly recommend playing the game with a controller because imo the mouse and keyboard controls are too clunky for me. Another cool factor is the customization and detail you can put into your cars. However i find the dlc's lately to be lackluster. I don't need anymore cars to buy for $1.99 or $3.99. Besides that there is the in game play. The graphics are beautiful but if your pc isn't too good you can still lower the setting to make the game run better yet still look great. I prefer you play with friends to have the best experience because the single player can get very boring. Props to the game creators for adding small cool things like split screen cross platform play different servers across the world etc.. WORTH YOUR MONEY",Rocket League®

2017-07-31,0,0,727,False,Recommended,I've been playing this game for some time now and prior to my pc RL experience i put several hundred hours into the PS4 version. This game is excellent. Being a Season 3 Grand Champ I've pretty much come across everything that this game has to offer. The gameplay is smooth and consistent wired connection results in 0 lag spikes and always low low ping. A few complaints though.. 1) disliking maps does not guarantee that you won't get them in a game and sometimes I join one of my disliked maps 2 3 times in a row! It isn't too big of a deal but I thought the point of disliking a map was that you didn't want to play it? 2) The AI.. they can't go up walls they barely play defense and are just basically prospect elite players. It's nearly impossible to win with an AI on your team and I thought that with over 200 000 players online someone would join my team and help me out but nope! Even with that many players online I still go full games with an AI teammate. 3) It takes a ridiculous amount of time to join games sometimes I mean with so many players online you'd think that you'd join a game in under a minute right? I sit in free play for a good 3 5 minutes sometimes only to join a game where there's AI present. I love this game but Psyo really has to fix these issues which are hurting the game badly besides that this game excels in every aspect especially under the addiction category.,Rocket League®

2017-11-23,0,0,608,False,Recommended,Rocket League technically is very well made. Whether or not you will enjoy it and to what extent you would enjoy it comes down to you. I cannot convince you to love this game like I do but I can convince you to give it a go.Rocket League is the kind of game that you must try in order to understand what it's all about.I repeat you must try this game even if it is only for a couple games. The feeling of driving jumping boosting flying and hopefully also hitting the ball just comes as something so unique in today's gaming scene it should not be overlooked not even by its most cynical of critics.Rocket League is one of the most fun games in recent memory. Pure fun and enjoyment. I could never ask it for more than that. Very much a bargain even at full price let alone 50% off as it is at the time of writing this review. Go on! Get stuck in!

2017-11-23,0,0,892,False,Recommended,"Overall this game is a must have whether you are looking for a competitive or a fun game. It's easy to learn the basics fun from the beginning. But if you want to take it to the next level you can practice difficult mechanincs and can perform flashy plays but it requires much time to ""git gud"". The big con is the community. As it grew it got more and more toxic. I recommend only using quick chat and disabling voice chat. Another con is the ridiculous loot boxes which rarely drop anything that you actually want mostly just useless crap.

2017-08-01,0,0,138,False,Recommended,Working with your team to control the giant ball on offense and defense can be quite a challenge but the fast and fluid absurdity of Rocket League fuses into one hell of a good time despite servers that rarely work perfectly. The main mode puts two teams of three in visually diverse but performance identical vehicles (though 1v1 2v2 and 4v4 variants exist) as they race up and down the field chasing the league s oversized equivalent of a soccer ball. The good thing is you don t need to know anything about driving games or soccer to play. The rules are simple drive really fast around bright glossy neon colored arenas and do fancy tricks while trying to smash an endlessly ricocheting ball into a deceptively tight space. Simple right? Well it's actually quite challenging and only once you've mastered the physics of Rocket League you will be able to perform some of the best and most amazing tricks in the Game. If you get good enough you can also be entered into the RLCS which is a place where only the best of the best are allowed and if you're lucky enough to win you can win lots of money!

Psyonix s Rocket League the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars finds dumb fun in pulling turbocharge assisted front flips in an ice cream truck and the white knuckle strategy in working with your team to control the giant ball on offense and defense.

2016-10-08,0,0,485,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a soccer game with small cars but i bet you already knew that so heres so good and bad things about it.Good things Its fun to play with friends.Competitive can be fun sometimesCool cars with lots of customizations.fun game modes (Basket ball Hockey Soccer and now the famous rumble)Bad things or things they could consider change Joining in a game where the opponents is ahead with 10 0.A penality in normal games to if a player leave to many games.The microtransactions between the cars to you can buy is both good and bad cause in the start they would add more than one car to each pack now they just stick with one and to get 2 cars as you did before now cost 5 97 where before it would cost 3 99 + new maps included.Some players that are to competitve and start raging over mistakes (i know this isn't Rocket League in general but overall all games)But i recommend buying the game if you got some to play with (atleast 1 friend so you can play 2v2 or 2 friends so you can play 3v3 since that will get you away from the more leaving players and yes theres ALOT of players leaving the game when the oponnents score the first goal and it says 1 0),Rocket League®

The competative levels are great and well matched most of the time. The cars are great although i think the hitboxes need to be alittle smaller to where it is about the same size as the car and not larger than it but this is a rant on their banning system. In the past 2 weeks ive been banned 3 times. Two of them are from saying the ""F word "" multiple times in 1 game and then the third time i got banned was for telling an opposing player to stop telling his teamate that he was trash and to stop calling him bad names because his teamate after all was doing way better than him. i did not curse. I did not use any verbal terms that could hurt ones feelings i didnt even come close to saying stupid or butthead. BUT LORD HELP ME IM THE ONE TO GET BANNED FOR 72 F***ING HOURS FOR NOT EVEN SAYING ANYTHING BAD.

2017-11-24,0,0,85,False,Recommended,Rocket League is that rare middle ground between beautifully hilarious and spirit crushing. When you lose sometimes you'll feel robbed. When you win you'll often feel on top of the world.Let's not split hairs the game is both stunning to look at and extremely polished. On these grounds alone it's worth your money. However it's also one of the only sport based games I've ever truly loved. The mastering of striking the ball correctly passing accurately to your team mates and making do or die saves are all disciplines that can take a very very long time to master. But you'll love every second.This game comes highly recommended. The community is mostly lovely (or not toxic I suppose) and there's plenty of customisation to keep you busy when you're not smashing in those top corner screamers.,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,1230,False,Recommended,One of my personal favorites. The physics are good (generally) the visuals are exactly as good as they need to be. The gameplay is phenomenal. You don't have to commit to an hour long gameplay session but you will often find yourself spending that much time and more in a single sitting.There is somewhat of a steep learning curve but as you advance through the ranks you'll always find new moves to learn new tactics to employ and become all around better at controlling your little rocket car.Extremely frustrating and at times enormously satisfing at others. No other game gets my heart racing like a close fast paced game of rocket league. Buy it now!,Rocket League®

I really don't understand why as Semi Pro im getting matched against Legend's in quick play. It really makes it not a very enjoyable experience for either me or my friends (Around the same rank and level) when we go in a getting absolutely destroyed by someone that is either Platinum or Diamond ranked. The toxcicity is also really bad getting matched against these players. Run into so many people talking crazy because we literally can't do anything to stop them.

2017-11-24,0,0,339,False,Recommended,Pros Only $20! CROSS PLATFORM!! Extremely addictingCons As of right now (11/24/2017) microphones seem to not work on the game. Can only face others on different platformRocket League is an amazing game. Watching someone play the game makes it look fairly simple but if you get in a game yourself you have more of a feel for the endless possible angles and airdrags you could perform.(if you know how to airdrag )) I started playing the game on pc a long time ago (can't remember when) but then my pc broke and i had to play on console. But even though I was on console I could still play with my pc friends. Being able to play with people on different platforms is an amazing thing to have on a game. More games should do this!! Although cross platform is great and all I hope they create their own friend system or something so that you could create a party with them. As of right now in order to play with a friend on a different console you can only create a private match and tell them the name and password and vs them. I've also noticed that you can only do one platform cross. What I mean is that you can play on pc with ps4 people and then thats it. You can't play with pc Ps4 and Xbox all in the same lobby. It's a small thing but just thought it should be said. I've spent countless hours playing this game and I can assure that if you purchase this game you will too.I give this game a SOLID 9 5 / 10Thanks for reading this c,Rocket League®

Rocket league is a game that you can pickup for the first time and be terrible at but have that feeling that if you fixed a few things or made a few different moves you could have done much much better. It is a fast paced game where The idea of the game is simple The controls are exceptional! (For real the cars all react to your controls exactly how you think they should.) The skill cap is insanely high Every single time the ball goes in the air you feel like it is possible to make an insane goal off of itRocket league is the type of game that I can pickup for a few games and put back down or I can just delve deep into an 8 hour session and keep trying to rank up and fix my mistakes I had last game. Psyonix (The developer) knows how to run this game. They are constantly pushing out new updates patches and content most of which is free!They allow you to customize your vehicles so no two are the same. Or you and some friends can team up create the exact same cars then be a three man wrecking crew of flying vans!Psyonix really thought of everything with Rocket league and they keep adding more and more great content! All in all Rocket league is a great game cannot recommend it enough and is totally worth even up to a price of $60!

Atleast in 95% of the games from prospect 1 to challenger elite you will have at least 1 trash player in your team(most likely two tho). Rising star(where I'm at) is a tiny bit better but still get like 60% chance to get scrubs. Of course this depends on what time of day you play on mornings work best in my timezone( UTC +3). If you're thinking ""oh wow this guy is butthurt"" then yes yes I am. Their reckless playstyle(hitting the ball randomly and not knowing how to pass the ball) forces me to play defensive which prevents me from making great passes. It also gets me lots of flame ""stop sitting in goal"" welp I'm not given many chances to attack and their lack of defensive abilities leaves me no choice.

2015-07-16,0,0,438,False,Recommended,"Psyonix's 'Rocket League' created in the unreal engine has offered an experience unlike any other. The gameplay is simplistic yet can be utilized with a wide variety of skill and technique. A player can have fun and be good at the game within 20 minutes of picking the game up but cannot truly master some of the techniques until he has clocked hundreds of hours into the game. Because of the gameplay of Rocket League it is unusual that a game will end in a severe blowout or that one team will seriously outperform the other as it is difficult to be very good or very bad at the game. The AI while generally not as tactic wise as a player tends to perform at a level similar to most players and therefore being with an AI in no terms means a certain defeat. The games are short just 5 minutes long which is plenty of time for about 3 4 goals to be scored in total so both teams are always still in the competition a game is rarely over until the last 10 seconds or so. The games are short enough so that if the teams DO end up somewhat stacked the less skilled team will not have to endure a slaughter for an extended time which we often find in many FPS games in which a winner can clearly be determined after about half of a match. Also it is unnecessary for a player to have a great deal of soccer knowledge or experience as the gameplay is while similar in some regards quite different in most. The game features 3 play modes ""Online"" ""Exhibition"" and ""Season"". All play modes offer the options of playing 1v1 referred to as ""Duel"" 2v2 or ""Doubles"" 3v3 which is ""Standard"" and 4v4 called ""Chaos"". Exhibitions are exactly what you would expect them to be you can quickly set up and play a game strictly with AIs. A ""Season"" allows you to set up and play other AI teams in an attempt to make the playoffs and continue on to win the tournament. Unfortunately the only number of other teams that can participate is 9 for a total of 10 teams competiting. You can play either a 9 18 27 or 36 week season so each team plays every other team an even number of times. From there either 4 or 6 teams make the playoffs which are single elimination. ""Online"" allows you to play with other players from around the globe which you may do with a party of your friends or solo. You may also play private games with strictly your friends and AIs. Matchmaking is quick and easy it allows you to select what servers you wish to use hit go and you get into a match generally within 30 seconds. The only downsides I see to this game as of now is the lack of play modes. The season idea is excellent but it would be nice if it was expandable to allow more teams and more customizability. Another idea would be multiplayer tournaments in which 8 teams maybe more could play a single elimination tournament online. If a player were to quit out of his team he could recieve a temporary tournament play suspension. I feel that this would be an excellent addition that would allow especially for party play more competition into the game.Overall I give Rocket League a 9.5/10.",Rocket League®

2017-12-26,0,0,213,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of my favorite games. It has lots of great elements that make it very unique. First of all I don't think I've ever heard of a game where you have to use cars to play soccer before Rocket League. (Besides the original) The customization on the cars themselves is awesome too! You can change everything from rims to the sound your car makes! There are also plenty of different maps and the developers are always adding new content. The game itself seems simple at first but once you get to playing it more you learn that there's much more beneath the surface. Overall it's a fun game to play by yourself or with friends.,Rocket League®

The matchmaking system is one of the best of any game I've played allowing for players with a smaller skillset to still enjoy themselves rather than just getting stomped on by more experienced players.

2016-11-24,0,0,318,False,Not Recommended,"I am giving this game a negative review only in protest of newly added Rocket Pass. I will be solely discussing it. If a lot of cosmetics and options to spend your irl money dont push you away I very recommend this game it has enough interesting mechanics and unique experiences for its price tag. Rocket Pass wasnt the best decision for this game. It is one of those questionable chuncks of content that makes you wonder what devs want more this game to be better or this game be better at making money. Yeah it is just cosmetics but it is in your face with every level you gain with every new free battlepass rank you get you keep thinking ""Damn Rocket Pass huh?"". And maybe in games like Fortnite that idea fits. They are selling the game for free why wouldnt they add battle pass? But I think Rocket League is making enough money from sales and keys as of now and I cant see much purpose for this pass other than to get more money. Whether that money goes to devs or to developing of RL esports scene it doesnt really matter as it just a way to get another pile of cash from fanbase. The same can be arguebly said about crates as they are a usual drop after matches but there is an option to hide it which makes it atleast tolerable.As of now Rocket League is a fun game with a lot of content problems the only thing it continuesly adds are new crates and other ways to make money. I hope the game takes a turn to the better. New arenas are being added but not at very fast rate same with new gamemodes and other free game related content. Those are the things I look forward to into this game not cosmetics we've had enough of those for the next eternity.",Rocket League®

2016-12-24,0,0,1254,False,Recommended,After reading all these negative reviews I feel like I have to give my own opinion about the game. When it first came out a few years ago I would never have thought that a video game could give me so many hours of entertainment and enjoyment but also so much frustration and headaches. I think it is the game that feels most like a real sport to me because the controls are really amazing and given that you put in the hours for practice you can really control everything about your car. It is a very mechanically precise game and it is also very competitive. You can literally play this game for hundreds of hours and still learn new mechanics or skills. Rocket League is also a team game (although there's also a 1v1 mode). If you are solo queueing it's kind of a gamble because there are many toxic players out there that will try to ruin your day if you let them. On the other hand I have also played with people who were very supportive and nice (even though we were losing) especially in the higher ranks (champ 1 and upwards) seem to be a little less toxic. Still playing with friends beats playing with randoms everytime so if you get frustrated easily by teammates convince a friend to play with you. I think Rocket League is probably not for everyone but for me it hit the jackpot. I have never put so many hours into a game. I absolutely love it and would recommend everyone to at least try it to see if you like it but it is also a game with some problems. I'll try to list some of the things that are discussed the most Basically since launch there have been problems with the servers which sometimes are laggy and inconsistent. I would say every 10th game will be on a bad server although it is not as bad as it was anymore. There are bugs especially when a new update rolls out but most of them get fixed in a couple of days. There are loot crates which require keys to be opened (keys cost real money) which is probably where the developers make 99% of their revenue. I honestly don't understand why they get so much for it it's just skins/cosmetics and it has absolutely no effect on the game. There is no pay to win the game is 100% skill based and very well balanced (there are different cars with slightly different stats but the differences are absolutely minimal). Somehow the devs need to make money and as long as it's completely optional I don't see how the crates would ruin the game for anyone. If you don't like them don't buy them. Honestly I think the developers did a great job with this game and they also listen to the community when implementing new features. There are regular content updates and new game modes added to the game for free. I have spent like 12 on this game and got more than 1.000 hours of enjoyment out of it so I really think it was money well spent and would recommend everyone to at least try it once.,Rocket League®

2015-11-04,0,0,675,False,Not Recommended,EDIT AT BOTTOM Love this game. Everything about this game. But recently I have been getting the well known and still not fixed Error 71. So I am now unable to play this amazing game. Not sure why the developer refuses to address this issue.Edit I am not sure if enough people complained about the Error 71 or what but the game is once again playable. YAY! Now I only have two real complaints about this amazing game.First is that in the comunity playoffs ONLY team wins and losses count. All the games with random people the games you win or lose count. Second is for all of the players out there that do more then hit the ball into the goal like blocking rebounding passing and defending you get little to no points. Your actions don't really matter... other then your team has to win. Don't get me wrong I still LOVE playing this game and will play it as long as I can. I just wish players were encouraged to do more then hit the ball in the goal. EDIT Nov. 16 2016 After an update or two this game has become pretty much unplayable for a chunk of the playerbase. Rubber banding and lag that do not appear in any other online game have killed this game. The publisher blamed most of this on a large playerbase but everyone started reporting the issues after an update not after a playerbase change. After many many players contacted the publisher aswell as posted about this on multiple forums nothing has been done. Loved this game but would not suggest it to anyone right now. EDIT July 30 2017 I still love love love this game. Unfortunately there is the Rocket League community. The horrible toxic salty community. For a multiplayer game the community makes or breaks it and this time it is broken beyond repair.,Rocket League®

The only thing which I want to say out loud is the perks DLC packs goodies like decals goal effects wheels cars should be AWARDED on certain level. The creators provide crates but I need to buy Keys (1key $1.5 right now) . There should be a reasonable gameplay to get the keys without purchasing.

2016-11-24,0,0,1747,False,Recommended,I don't know how to start this review with anything other than this is a must buy! Even if you do not like sports the game itself is still a blast to play and Psyonix does a great job of keeping the game up and running to best of its ability at all times!In short the game is a (standard mode) 3v3 car soccer sports game. This is as simple as I can make it. If you like relatively competitive and relatively easy to follow gameplay this is the game for you. Its essentially soccer light with cars that can boost and fly. Its a classic example of Easy to Learn but Hard to Master. However all along the way if you have drive to compete you will not put the game down! Even if you don't compete there are plenty of game modes that suit the need to just hop in have some fun and hop out!To me this game is considered a must buy if not for the greatness of the product to support the company that makes it!,Rocket League®

The controls are easy to pick up and it's simple to get into the game. That simplicity belies a nuanced and exquisite balance between rocket car and ball.

2018-08-11,0,0,47,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Disclaimer I recieved this game as a gift from a friend. However I will review it as if I spent my own money on it. Also I won't be talking about the ranking system in this review. Since most games with a competitive ranking system have the same flaws it would be pointless to name them and add them as a negative.Rocket League is a game about cars and soccer. Yep. An oversized soccer ball being batted around by a bunch of rocket propelled super cars blowing each other up to try to score a goal... It sounds chaotic but it is nonetheless an extremely fun title.First off let's talk about how easy it is to get into this game. At first I thought the idea was absolutely stupid. But then once I started playing it actually grew on me. From the initial competition to get the first touch to the inevitable goal explosion once someone pulls off a nutty aerial to the feeling of seeing the ""Epic Save!"" notification the game stays interesting throughout matches. It's really easy to get hooked.People will tell you that you need a controller to play this game. While it may be somewhat easier in the long run this is simply not true. There are some great RL players out there that use mouse &amp keyboard. And personally since my only wired controller broke I've been feeling quite comfortable using mouse &amp keyboard. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't! If they do tell them they're wrong and proceed to blow them up with your boost!There are plenty of gamemodes to play in Rocket League. You can play hockey soccer basketball even a version of Spleef. Whatever you want Rocket League has.Of course the game doesn't come without its flaws. The physics seem wonky at times especially when you're dashing mid air into the ball. Sometimes it will go the complete wrong direction when you're trying to hit it....Wow. I just realized I can't think of any more flaws. (other than the ranking system which as I said earlier won't be included here.)Overall this game is great. If you like cars soccer and explosions this game is perfect for you. Just don't get into competitive... ) I give Rocket League a 9/10. Highly recommended.",Rocket League®

2016-04-27,0,0,270,False,Recommended,Love the game! I got it this saturday during the free weekend. I saw that it was free in my steam news feed and thought that this was a better time than any to try out the game to see what it was like so I could see if I would like to keep playing and buy it or if I didn't think that it would be worth the money. Some of my friends had the game as well so I played with them for an hour or two. Then thinking that i liked Rocket League I spent some money on getting the game. Soon later I got 2 DLC packs the Back to the Future Car pack and the Chaos Run DLC pack. The next day I was having even more fun on it than the day before so I bought 2 more DLC packs giving me a total of 4 DLC packs. The DLC packs I bought were the Batman Vs. Superman Car pack and the Supersonic Fury DLC pack.Overall I love the game and am hooked. I have played it every day since and have already racked up quite a fair amount of hours. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes high speed games cars and just having fun. It is definatly worth the money.,Rocket League®

It was approximately an hour and in that time I queued for 6 games of competitive rocket league.First game no one said anything. We won.Second game my teammate spammed ""What a save!"" whenever the opponents or I missed the ball then rage quit after I returned the favor. Somehow won.Third game teammate was afk from the start. He left. Lost.Fourth game both were smurfs deranking. They scored five goals super quickly and then forfeited. Reported them.Fifth game there was so much server lag the entire match felt like it lasted a year. Lost.Sixth game both opponents and teammates were toxic as hell.The point is this game can absolutely INFURIATE you if you're not careful. I've played for 3 hours straight before and ended up exactly where I began because of AFKs leavers and generally incompotent people. I would set the game onto ""Team Quickchat Only"" for chat settings and try not to worry about rank too much.

I jumped in an out for a couple months and didn't put too much time into the game but then I started playing more playing better people and with better teammates. In less than 200 Hours I was playing on a level that I could definitely tell I'd improved since my first 50 or so hours.

2016-02-18,0,0,1761,False,Not Recommended,Game is great. The EULA is stupid. Also it is forced on you months after buying the product.When you have a great game with a dedicated fanbase you better exploit it by adding a gambling feature.All of the high quality skins and items are locked in crates which you can only open with real money keys. Crates are filled with mostly undesirable loot which means the average person will have to spend around 10 (insert your currency) or more to obtain a desired high quality item.They usually sell new cars which include multiple skins and unique tires for 2 (insert currency) now with the gambling crates they can on average sell just a tire or skin for about 10 (insert currency). Quite the rip off.But it is all cool because they say some of the proceeds of key sales goes to fund tournaments and such.1. The suckers won't even say how much. Could be as little as 1% for all we know.2. Tournaments and big prize pools are good advertisment. Of course they will spend some of the key profit on advertisment. Whoopdidoo.They make crates sound like a great thing for the community when in reality they are taking a big dump on their community. They dropped a restrictive EULA long after release released tons of exciting new garage items and hid ALL OF THEM behind a paywall about 5x as high as the one they previously used.P.S. Watched a 13 year old on twitch opening 40+ chests. Congratulations Psyonix on exploiting child gambling. You greedy fooooks.,Rocket League®

Getting better and better feels amazing an accomplishment dealt to you by rankings and what were thought to be impossible feats. This game should be viewed as both casual and hardcore and thankfully the game modes reflect that too. There's also the silly powerup mode that's worth a gander. I wouyyld recommend trying training and playing quite of casual play. Getting used to positioning and support team mates changes completely based off 1vs1 2vs2 and 3vs3 modes. The matches are fast and fun and the 5 mins never feels too long or too short. Some games can get your adreline going so having only 5 minute sessions is perfect for taking lots of quick breaks to avoid fatigue and frustration.,Rocket League®

2016-10-22,0,0,1416,False,Recommended,"IntroI've never seen such a decline in overall quality of a game. Every time I lauch this game I can't bring myself to play more than a few games before I get sick of it. If you asked me what I thought about this game 5 6 months ago I'd be ecstatic whilst explaining how much I loved it. I damn near hate this game now. There are so many problems the devs are too brain dead to fix and the game is so boring as well.Before I continue with this game I want you to know that I have played this game for about 2 and a half years from Ps4 to PC. I have over 1400 hours in total and have played/beaten grand champ and pro players alike. So in no way am I inexperienced. This review comes from a place of hope that the developers will fix the many problems in their game. I'm going to break this review down into catagories in which I think need the most attention. Than you for reading.Bans and SuspensionsThis is one that has affected me the most. I have over 4000 hours of ban time over all of my accounts. Yes I know I am at fault here. I broke their stated rules I accept that. My problem here is that the devs allow you to type profanity in the game chat but don't automatically censor these words. The devs don't just ban you for saying the words you have to be reported first. Players can choose to see the chat but can also get other players banned for simply speaking their mind using ""Extremely offensive"" text.Potential solutions Create a profanity filter than is on by default for new players. Reduce game bans to chat bans. Don't let players type swear words in chat in the first place.Server IssuesI don't think any other games has server issues as frequent as Rocket League. There is without fail an occurrence of D sync or rubber banding. This should not be the case in a game that so badly needs good servers. A ball has to be in the same place for every player on the field. If it's not then the players getting the issues are at a disadvantage. One example of a server issue is a thing the community likes to call ""Ghost hits."" This consists of a player going to hit the ball and seeming hitting the ball. But as you probably guessed the player didn't actually hit the ball. Everyone sees him hit the ball the ball goes in the direction of the ""hit"" for just a split second and snaps right back to where it was. This creates massive problems and has caused me and many others to lose when we shoudn't have. There is nothing more disappointing than playing a good game against other good players going into a long overtime and then losing to a ghost hit. At that point you are losing to the game not the players. Another example of a server issue is extreme lag off of kickoffs. The game will show you going for the ball then all of the sudden you're flying off in a random direction while you see the opponet slam the ball into your net. This is obviously more game breaking than a simpe ghost hit. It puts you out of the play entirely and there's nothing you can do to stop it from happening. You can't tell its going to happen it just does...randomly.Potential solutions Fix your broken servers for the love of god.Wow would you look at that. One simple easy solution...Bugs and GlitchesOh don't we all just love glitches. In any game glitches/bugs can be something to laugh at or something that makes you hate the game you play and wonder why you have it in the first place. I'm afraid that with Rocket League it's the latter. This game has too many bugs for me to mention. So I'll just talk about a select few.The first one that came to mind is when a wavedash will completely break. If you don't know what a wavedash is it's basically just landing on the ground and flipping into the ground to gain speed. Just from explaining what a wavedash is you can probably already guess what the bug is. When executing a wavedash the game will sometimes just put you through the ground and/or force you to front flip and lose all of your momentum. Extremely frustrating.The second and arguably the most infuriating is the boost pickup glitch. This one makes me mad beyond belief. As you can probably guess the boost will either not be picked up or someone else will get it that shouldn't have. It seems as if the distance to get the boost varies for no reason. To me it seems like RNG whether or not I get the boost. Another glitch with the boost is when you have 100 and the boost is still picked up. This isn't that big of a problem but still needs to be fixed. I have accidentally stolen boost from teammates as a result of this one.The third one to come to mind makes me wonder how it's even a thing. What I'm talking about is when you go to create a private match and it will change the server region for absolutely no reason. This is just annoying and I don't know how it's remained in the game for this long.Possible solutionsBug test your game?!?!?!I can't really give a solution to these cause I'm not a developer and I don't know what it takes to fix a glitch.OutroAt the end of the day I still recomend this game to newcomers it's not completely broken. Someone new could have a lot of fun making new experiences. But me? No I can't enjoy this game like I used to.I used to love this game but I just can't with all these big problems. Please fix your game Psyonix. Make me enjoy your game again. If I think of any more issues I will comeback and edit this review and add them accordingly. Thank you for taking the time to read this review (doubt anyone will get this far xd). Damien",Rocket League®

2015-08-03,0,0,824,False,Recommended,There are a plethora of of positive things to say about this title.Pros Gameplay is exhilerating and intense throughout There is nothing better than making a huge comeback and putting in that last second goal Cars handle really well and are highly customizable With that all the cars are statistically the same so no unfair advantage At first the game seems very simple but you realize its complexity the more you improve as a player Games are short (5 minutes long) and don't require many players for each match (probably won't get matched up with the same people when you que again),Rocket League®
2018-07-02,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Pros Online/Offline capability Can play with/without friends Competitive mode Tournements Great car customization Cool cosmetic items Shows server client communication in a user firendly way. Gives cosmetic items after a match most of the time.Cons Bad loot box system. Keys/decryptors are very hard to find. Can take up to 2 minutes to find a good online match.9/10,Rocket League®

2018-08-06,0,0,39,False,Recommended,I bought this when it was 12 and it has been the best under 20 game that I ever have bought. Very exciting game with marvelous graphics. Sound is incredible and real. Customising cars and trading pieces are one of the best things of this game. You can even play with your friends in private matches anytime. You can buy cars from 1.59 to 3.99 depending on which one. There are more than 20 cars to choose from which also gives you extra prizes when buying a car. There are also crates which you open with keys you have to buy where you can get very good prizes which are worth a lot more than 1 key so sometimes it is worth paying the 1 the key is worth. There are special events which have limited stuff to customise your car and a different crate each time. You can buy those things by getting the special currency the event has from playing matches. Depending on the event it will offer you also a decoder which is like a free key but you cannot trade that item. So be careful if you want to trade and you get a very good item. The limit of decoders you can get is 5 though. At least they're free. Overall this game is gorgeous and if you want a rather cheap game and you like football and/or cars this might become one of your favourite games where you can never get bored.P.S. the modes are 1v1 2v2 3v3 competitive where you can get ranks and 1v1 2v2 3v3 3v3 hoops (basketball) 3v3 dropshot (a type of dodgeball but its the ground and stuff you'll know when you play it) and 3v3 hockey. You can play these modes in a Steam party. What this is is that you can play with your friends (up to 3 friends in total 4 in a single party ) competitive modes and private matches.,Rocket League®

2018-07-28,0,0,778,False,Recommended,"I just want to start off by saying that Rocket League is BY FAR the best sports game ever released. Rocket League gives you 100 % control of your car so when you score its not because you bought a good player but because you lined up the car perfectly with the ball so that when you hit it it would fly past your opponent and into the goal. Much more satisfying in my opinion. However having to control literally every single minute movement of your car makes the game pretty difficult. When I first started I could barely hit the ball. You should expect to have a similar skill ability when you start. Maybe I was just garbage idk. After doing the tutorial and maybe a training pack or two you should be able to play the game.There are so many skills strategies and ""combos"" you can learn in this game that stem from such simple mechanics Driving Boosting Jumping and Dodging. In other games you ""unlock"" skills by leveling up but in Rocket League you learn new skills by watching YouTube tutorials doing training packs and playing workshop levels. Warning this takes a whole lotta time but is super rewarding when you style on your opponents with what you learned. However you should not worry about learning these skills when you are starting out. Just have fun and enjoy the game )The community can be a bit toxic sometimes so if any new players want somebody to play with add me (Not carrying in ranked sorry)Extra stuff I wanted to add 1. Dont listen to the people who have 200+ hours on the game and are negatively reviewing it if it was that bad they wouldnt have played it for that long.2. Price is amazing for the time you will spend on it3. Opening crates are a waste of money/keys. Buy keys and trade for the items you want. BEWARE OF SCAMMERS!4.

The goddam community can be phenominal to the enjoyment of this game. The banter. The jokes. Superb.CONS It's like riding the same old bike. Even when you have new games to play it's like ""meh i'll just play this some more because I'M AN ADDICT."" The goddam comunity can be toxic. I mean real vile you know. Don't get me wrong you can block and mute and report real easy which is a massive plus but dear lord some of the players are just not nice people.

You can always improve even if you do not play every day.,Rocket League®
2018-02-28,0,0,284,False,Recommended,This game is very simple. Just football... With cars!There's many features and new mechanics found out every year which keeps the game alive and interesting. The Aim is simple score and win.I've personally played this since 2015 when it first came to Xbox One then I played again on PS4... and now im on PC playing it. I purchased RL on PC a few months back but I now have a proper gaming RIG i can now properly play it.Is there any advantages for PC users? For sure the use of keyboard and mouse can potentially make someone better but controller is preferred mods through steam workshop and alpha console and how there isn't an fps lock which is always handy.Now is this a good game? Well... That's up to you to decide I personally think it's an amazing game with easy features throughout the concept is basic but yet it has so much replayability. To make it easier for the eye to read i'll do an overview of my positives and my negatives within' the game.Overview Positives * Great graphics for what game it is.*A Solid variety of cars to use* Ranking system is kind of an awkward one but I think it's really good* Training packs Mods workshop etc which can benefit you winning the game* Amazing crates to open every crate can have something really valuable and interesting helps you get more skins etc*Active trading commuity valuable items when getting them* Amazing animations on specific decals (heatwave etc)Cons * You will probably be placed with a toxic person every game. This game is filled with children and if you fail... Good luck honestly. I've never seen so much toxicity in a game and it just disgraces me. That being said the nice people are great to talk to so don't make that a negative for you!* Crate chances of getting something low is 1%.. For mystery decals that is i think it's pretty c r a p of them to do that because they already earn so much as it is. * Servers can definitely be a pain it will say you have 60ping but you'll have packet loss all a sudden ping loss eventhough it says 60 it's just a pain in the a s s.Every con is more of a nitpick because you can avoid every one if you're lucky I recommend playing with a friend and doing casual before doing competitive it will help boost your confidence before playing.,Rocket League®

2018-10-06,0,0,52,False,Recommended,With how simple this game is there's surprisingly a load of depth to it. The game has a steep learning curve making scoring and even dribbling a ball difficult when you first start playing. But once you can dribble then you can score and once you cana score then you can block and once you can block you can do aerial shots and the list of keeps on going. The game allows for newbies to have fun even to the most seasoned of players. There's always some new trick you can learn and there's so many stradegies that you and your friends can use to get an upper hand in the game. The car customization is pretty average nothing mind blowing but enough to give your car a distinct look to it. Even better is that the only DLC in this game is cosmetics so if any map is released alongside a DLC the map is always free to play on.With many different modes cosmetics and tricks to perform there is a surprising amount of depth found in this game that may not be apparent from the store page so give Rocket League a shot!,Rocket League®

I have no connection to Soccer Games and even find them to be boring and too complicated to get into and yet I still peel for RL. While RL remains easy to learn it takes up much time to master it.

2018-07-24,0,0,1101,False,Recommended,Rocket League is definitely my favorite game of all time. It combines rocket powered cars with soccer and Psyonix hit the combination right on the money. You will need to put in time (I have almost 1000 hours) to become a real contender and start hitting your favorite players' montage shots but even with a minimum amount of time (I'm about to play with my friend that has 30 hours) it is still one of the best experiences of my life (unless you play ranked with those scrubs ) $20 is easily the best purchase I have ever made for a game and I would happily (mostly) pay $60 to compare to FIFA games or other AAA games made by huge developers like EA.Updated BUY A CONTROLLER. Either PS4 or Xbox (offbrand controllers work fine) but trust me after 150 hours on KBM I switched and I only go back if I want to purposely play badly to have fun or if my controller dies or disconnects.Update 2 Even if you have a decent PC you can still run this game!! It may not look how you want but every other aspect is as good as any other computer can run it!!Thanks for reading!,Rocket League®

There is not much to tell about the quality of the game tho its awesome in every aspect gameplay graphics soundtracks and the content are all epic.

2017-11-23,0,0,1299,False,Not Recommended,One of my favourite games of all time and i would recommend this to people who dont intend to put much time into it. Trying to get good at this game is an absolute how. At higher ranks wins and losses make a huge difference and all to often the game wont be decided by who played the best but instead by which team got the troll/toxic player. The higher the ranks the more of these people there are (especially the really really toxic ones). You'd think that like in most other games these ppl would be banned or get some other penalty. Yeaah guess what Psyonix still makes money from these players and they can't see how this effects the other players at all apparently. Right now Diamond and Champion ranks (and probably GC too) are just a test of who has got the most patience who can sit through entire games of being flamed or having teammates ing you up on purpose without letting it affect your next game.If Psyonix would care just a bit about this issue i would be fully positive and i would probably play this game full time. Right now i can play 4 5 games in a row before i want to kill someone. Fun times.,Rocket League®

2018-07-13,0,0,1020,False,Recommended,720 hours in. Looking to put at least a few more in.This game is incredibly fun the game is purely skill based and game knowlede based. When you put enough time into the game you will get better and the good times will fly by. Yes this game is frustrating yes it might get toxic (any online ranked game is like this). but if you just always keep a level head and try to improve your own game it will get better and better. Think my only issue is casual is not good enough needs to be better for practice and non ranked play. interesting game modes are fun.Definitely recommend whether you play it as casual or not.,Rocket League®

Rocket League is a game you have to dedicate yourself to. Not really fun playing with randoms always a better time with friends good or bad. Def recommend this game.

2015-07-23,0,0,39,False,Recommended,Feel like this is to early to write a review but the 9 hours I have played it have been amazing and I feel comfortable writing one. First off if you don't have this game go ahead and get it because I'm just going to be writing about how amazing it is and you'll waste your time so just get it. Now Rocket League despite what a lot of people are saying this game is not fifa with cars in any way. This game is its own game there is no passing period. If you expect everyone to be in order and stick to actual soccer positions you will unterly fail because this game is chaos and the object is to get the ball into the other teams goal and keep the ball out of yours. There really is no teamwork but if you want to succeed you have to use it but most players I've played with did not use a mic did not set up other players and did not play as the goalie. So if you want a fifa experience don't play this. This is not fifa with cars it just isn't but what it is an extremely fast paced game where you use hot wheels type cars to score goals and to defend and you can do both with mutiple different acrobatics. Every movement in this game will make you feel like a bad whether its boosting all the way down the field after a power up or diving in front of a ball and flip kicking it out of the way you will love every second of the movement and the thousands of players playing it can promise that. The way you become the best at this game is to think around the chaos look for the openings and most importantly have fun because if you beat yourself up over one missed shot it will affect your game tremendously. So get this game and when you do have funEric,Rocket League®
2015-07-18,0,0,28,False,Recommended,EDIT The servers do seem more stable. I'm changing this to a positive. The game itself is great just be aware that the servers seem to have periods of instability. This is not rare it was just constant when I first started playing. Overall fantastic time has been had since they cleared up. Buy this game.ORIGINAL Please understand I love the concept. And the single player has given me glimpses of what it must be like against a bunch of humans.But currently searching for only matches in the region closest to me and landing a server with exactly 0 ping I still cannot play the game properly. It hitches rubberbands and is all around impossible to control my vehicle. I'm fighting with their servers not the enemy team.When the servers get it together I'll happily change this review.,Rocket League®

2018-07-22,0,0,627,False,Recommended,Was hesitant at first because I'm not much of a sports game person turns out to be the best money I've ever spent.Rocket League differs from the typical sports game by presenting a unique easy to learn format to the game You're a car. Put the ball in the goal.That said just when you've figured it out how to hit the ball in the air you've opened yourself to a realm of possibilities and strategies. With several game types stemming from a casual or ranked playlist you won't find yourself bored with this game at any point. Probably two key points on my end on whether you should buy it or not Do you have a reliable internet speed of 100+Mbps? This game needs it. I was roped into this game thanks to friends. Can you get others to play with you?The second isn't as big of a deal but I found this game to be much more enjoyable when in a group of friends. If not there are numerous communities that have an overwhelming amount of people that would love to play and meet someone new.You can also play this game alone in any of the playlists just hope that doesn't get too dry for you.I've got over 500 hours in and will be putting much much more. Thanks Psyonix for a fantastic game and Happy 3rd Birthday Rocket League!,Rocket League®
2018-07-22,0,0,70,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an indie success story and to have it in the Switch's library year one is terrific. Look at all the jaggies you like and mock the lower resolution the game runs at if you feel the need but this is Rocket League portable and it runs beautifully. Everything is here nothing has been missed and there are bonuses for Switch owners not only with exclusive Mario cars and hats but also the ability to take it anywhere. A feature that cannot be overlooked. Rocket League is a really deep game. Following the clichéd easy to learn hard to master approach holds Rocket League in good stead. You're going to want to put in the hours to be the best you can but the only thing that's really going to stop you is sleep. You're not going to put this one down. Vooks,Rocket League®

2017-03-13,0,0,440,False,Not Recommended,"The game used to be fun but it's getting really annoying when every update the developer does revolves around their crates&amp keys microtransations. They add boring skins over the standard map design in order to promote a new crate and get people to spend money on keys to open them. A ""Spring crate "" you're joking right?What's really annoying is that it would be really easy for them to show that they're not money hungry and obviously completely focused on getting players to throw money into their key system. For instance it takes a long time to go up a single level and it would be easy to at least reward people with a key this route. Also the failing joke that is tournaments failed because there is literally no incentive to play it compared to competitive.My friends and I put a lot of time into the game but it's getting dry every update when they add an unneccessary map with a new crate to buy. Meanwhile one friend can barely play because of ongoing server lagging that no money appears to be going into.",Rocket League®

You can also pull off some really cool saves or goals. It's easy to learn but hard to master. You need to keep playing it.GRAPHICS/OPTIMIZATION The graphics are nice and colorful and the optimization is brilliant.FINAL VERDICT It's a really fun and addicting game. I recommend it! 10/10BONUS There's a trick where you can hit goals much easier. Hold LT/W on your keyboard or controller then press the boost button and as soon as you reach the ball let go of LT or W.,Rocket League®

But there is one amazing thing about this game that makes it unique. The trading aspect. It is implemented right in the game and not made as a sub system and put in the Steam market. You have to trade in game which is really cool. I definetely recommend this game.,Rocket League®
2018-07-08,0,0,595,False,Recommended,The game is constantly updated and made better every time. Psyonix really knows what they are doing and they have made my favourite game of all time.

2018-07-08,0,0,231,False,Recommended,very very fun. Rocket league is a competitive game but i really enjoy the casual aspect. It is fun to just lay back and have fun with friends in this game or if you like to be competitive the competitive ladder is hard to climb but satisfying as you go up higher in the ranks and become better at the game.

2017-11-28,0,0,213,False,Recommended,Three words Best game ever.At first Rocket League was a little tough for me but the tutorials help so much to prepare you to play with others online. The difficulty is goldilocks like just right. Rocket League is challenging gripping and a game like no other. There are so many options for cars and unlike other games that charge you an arm and a leg for DLC Rocket League's cars are very cheap.Bottom line I'm extremely happy i purchased this game and I would recommend it to anyone.,Rocket League®
2016-05-17,0,0,99,False,Recommended,"Easy to pick up ridiculously hard to master. It is strangely both the perfect ""One game before I sleep"" and ""Just one more game after this"" game its short fast paced matches are very well suited for short periods of play but it also makes it very easy for you to catch the one more game syndrome. There's a reason why it's beginning to catch on as an E sport it's simple and easy to digest yet it's spectacularly enthralling and exciting to watch and paly. You don't have to understand any more than what you can see two teams of cars aim to score more than the other by knocking balls/pucks/what have you into the opposing goal. It all boils down to teamwork and mechanical skill and that's ing fun.Pros &gt Easy to pick up super high skill ceiling&gt Runs smoothly on basically everything&gt Customizable cars give you so much personality&gt ROCKET POWERED CARS PLAYING FOOTBALL&gt Very tight controls impeccable ball physics&gt Psyonix is a super lovable developer new game modes come and don't go for free and the DLCs are great (Masamune is life)Cons &gt 40 hours in and I still can't aerial&gt Air rolls are VERY hard to perform without a controller&gt Community can be toxic at times (quitters in ranked uncooperative teammates etc.)The game is pure fun. 10/10",Rocket League®

2015-07-27,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Very well made game with a lot of future promise in addition. In its current state RocketLeague is definitely worth $20. In the future I can even imagine it far outliving it's price tag. It has some slight lag here and there and the bots' AI is a little too strong. Overall the skiff gives this game a solid 9/10. Future updates could easily push this game to a 10/10.,Rocket League®

2018-07-08,0,0,1836,False,Recommended,Don't be fooled by this game's goofy look. It may seem like car soccer is a gameconcept fit for your 10 y/o brother (it surely is) but this game appeals to a much bigger audience than you may think. It's a game i personally picked up because a few of my friends did and i didn't expect too much from it. But man there are little games that match the satisfaction that you get from scoring a good goal. And i can happily say that after 1500 hours this hasn't changed one bit. )I don't even like regular soccer but this game just feels so refreshing even after all this time. Its different than any game I've ever played. There are no limitations but your own skill and along with like 2 dozen cars to choose from (all with a different feel to them) and endless customization of your car (which has increased drastically since i first started playing) this game gives you an unique amount of freedom in how you choose to play the game as a player. This physics based game has an extremely high skillceiling which will become more apparent the more you play. And that is what has kept me playing for so long. Before rocket league i played competative games like CS GO and league of legends and after around 4000 hours in those games and 1500 in this one I can definitely say that this game can be just as competative if you are willing to put in the hours to actively improve. With a growing youtube and reddit comunity and the game steadily growing as an e sport new players get to improve faster and faster and in no time you'll be amazed at the things you can pull off. So don't be afraid that you are too late to become a good rocket league player! There are plenty of guides all over the internet to help you to become a better player but lots of things are still undiscovered which allows you to develop your own playstyle.Ofcourse you don't have to play the game competatively to enjoy it. I've played over hundreds of hours casually with my friends and I've enjoyed almost every second of it because the game is so polished and it never feels tedious because of the intense 5 minute matches. (this may seem like a short time but its really not) I'd say just give this silly looking game a go without thinking anything of it and I think you will be pleasantly suprised about what it has to offer. ),Rocket League®

2018-07-18,0,0,571,False,Recommended,Honestly I don't know what to say. Rocket league is fantastic in everything that it tries to do (except when it doesn't but well get to that) and its a great game! Nowadays it is more for people who actually want to 'get gud' instead of CasUaLS. But still you can have some fun even if youre not serious about the game. I'll be doing an edit on this review once I hit 600 hours but its been great so far. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a skill based serious game but I also recommend if you are looking to play some games after a day of hard work or something of the like. Also the community is not too toxic and there is a very vibrant and dedicated esports community.The one thing i don't like is the extra money. There's no way to get a new car without spending money (except for events). There's no way to get a new item without randomness without getting into the rl trading community. You have to buy keys in order to get a normal tradeable decent item. And keys come at pretty decent price tho. The catch is you can't know exactly what you're getting as it does that random slot machine type to determine what item you get from using the key. Personally I think that if you pay enough money you should be able to get whatever item you want without the use of sites like aoeah.com.Items are a pretty small part of the game tho.,Rocket League®

The cosmetics are cool as hell which kind of makes up for the idea of microtransactions+/ ROCKET PASS. This one is a really heavy leaning negative for me. Why?

I love the fact they didnt try and change too much like a lot of other game developers. The only small gripe I have with the new version is that they added a sort of circle indicator on the ground to indicate where the ball is going to land whereas before there was just a shadow which made the game a little more challenging wich I actually prefer but over all i am extremely happy )Oh and one more thing... What happened to challenges?! that was one of the funnest things to do in the previous game and now there is only single matches (",Rocket League®

2015-07-12,0,0,47,False,Recommended,Excellent sequel to the PS3 indie game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. The game has smooth 4 player and a really good online mode. Getting into matches is quick and painless. There is separate matchmaking for 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4. Very good game probably the best local multiplayer game for the PC. There's a lot of depth around using a combination of boost and air flips to make the ball go where you want. There's a levelling system that unlocks cars with slightly different stats and a bunch of aesthetics for your car. There's a season mode if you're into that sort of thing. It has cross play with its PS4 build so this game's online community should survive long into the forseeable future. Highly recommended even at full price especially if you would like to use your PC as a local multiplayer machine.,Rocket League®

2018-07-08,0,0,354,False,Recommended,Overview Rocket League is a whiff of fresh air in the competitive gaming scene. It is one of the only games that do not focus on RTS or FPS styles of gameplay and still manages to strike gold in the competitive genre of games. This I think is one of the most impressive features of this game not to mention its very smooth + rewarding gameplay.Personally this is a game that I have never really played very often instead I tend to play it on and off. Since the gameplay is quite repetitive I tend to get bored of playing it but due to how well it runs I always end up coming back. I have played it with friends and strived for high ranks which usually leads to some very intense moments and a lot of screaming but at the end of the day you can always chill out and due a few solo casual games which atleast lets off some steam. Pros Physics engine is very smooth Cars behave naturally Runs smoothly have tested on multiple low end computers and still runs to a justifiable degree Very easy to learn Very hard to master (a lot to learn) Fun party game Controller support Slipscrean support Cross platform support Wide range of car design options Great lootbox system (only provides cosmetics/things that don't affect gameplay*) Many gamemodes Great workshop supportCons Occasional bad servers cause a bad time Graphics are not the best Items are not intergrated with the steam market Repetitive gameplayConclusion One of the funnest games I have ever played. It works practically for everyone younger audiences older audiences casual gamers competitive gamers and especially people who are not fans of the FPS genre. This game is a must buy for anyone who has ever wanted to play football with rocket power cars (practically everyone right?). The only downside is with the gamemodes not being to different from eachother the gameplay can become repetitive but stays very consistant which is important for these type of skill based games. There are ofcourse many fun modes and the tutorials due a good job of teaching you mechanics such as aerials and defending. And if these practice drills are not enough the workshop also provides several more of these drills that you can practice. Such as dribbling and dodging obstacles.,Rocket League®

The option menu is very good and in depth.It has tons of features cross platform with PS4 tutorial ranked car customisation and even a single player experience but the online is what this game is all about. Rocket League has a high learning curve and it's really hard to master. The community is great and I expect this game to last really long.It has no microtransactions which is really great for the competitive aspect of the game. And you unlock everything just by playing. If you are interested I think you should really buy it. You won't regret I'm sure. ),Rocket League®

2016-11-26,0,0,553,False,Recommended,Having 200+ hours on this game I have realized that I like this game a lot. It passes time very quickly and has a quick game of 5 minutes (versus other games like Call of Duty have games up to 15 minutes). The game is pretty easy to pick up (it's really just soccer with cars XD). I think that this is THE BEST party game on the market. I played it with my friends online and on split screen when I do so I have a great time! One of my Skype friends completely sucks at the game and I like to laugh with him when he does soemthing stupid (it happens quite often). For some odd reason I've tried playing Rocket League on my friend's Xbox (he has it on there) and the way the game is played on Xbox versus PC is completely different.Overall I think this game is probably my favorite game out to date. Since I'm using an old PC I can actually play it at low settings at 60fps (I'm building a PC for Christmas). It's a very well optimised game which is good for players like me. From playing Call of Duty for a few years I'm glad to see that there's a game with a crate/supply drop system that isn't pay to win or pay for a slim chance to win (I'm aware of CS GO I just like Rocket League a whole lot more). I really do like the in game trading system (COD doesn't have that).If you're a new PC gamer I'd say that this is probably one of the easiest games to play and pick up quickly (excluding point and click games).,Rocket League®

Competitive games like csgo take a long time to play but Rocket League competitive matches take 5 minutes to play.

There is cross platform play so there is the possibility of facing PC users however due to PSN and Steam friends being different you cannot lobby with them (This game is pretty damn fun. While you can glide all around the arena the controls still feel super tight and when you get those sick goals it feels so damn good. I played probably 12 hours of this solo so far and i was about to hit the point of ""I feel kind of bored of this game"" then I got a group of 4 to play and the fun just grew exponentially. You get to do the Chaos mode of 4v4 or do 2v2's where you get to banter at each other. This supports up to 4v4 private matches so if you got a lot of friends who have it it's great. The AI ranges fromScoring on self &gt Kind of Useless &gt You just got lucky/God TierThis has been out for a little over a week and they've already started doing MLG (?) Tournaments. It's amazing.

The game works perfectly with no lag at all and I can even play the game on high quality with at least 5 other games installed on my laptop. The game is well made but it is slightly annoying that you have to pay extra for membership to access certain parts of the game (then again that's capitalism). The game has awesome mechanics but a tip that you adjust the controls before playing. I'm not quite sure what purchasing the membership does exactly and honestly I'm not sure how to find out but I'm sure I can still play the game without it.

I will say that it is somewhat on the small side with singleplayer content but there are so many people playing you're bound to get an online match.

The car control is very satisfying.Basic ruleset but suprisingly this game is not as basic as one might think. To be good at the higher levels you need to have very good cordination and strategy. This game gains alot if you have a controller but is also playable with keyboard. Game runs pretty well altough i've had some issues with laggy servers nothing too bad though. The game has quite lackluster singleplayer with some pretty stupid bots but the real meat of the game is in its multiplayer and it's very good! This would be a good eSport imo.

2018-09-11,0,0,515,False,Recommended,So I love this game but to be fair it's not for everyone. I've purchased four copies at the time of writing this review and the friends I have bought this for barely play anymore. However it's the only game I really play because it cannot truly get repetitive. It's an e sport plain and simple. The more you love this game the more you strive to become better. The better you get the more satisfaction you feel. I won't lie there's a lot of toxicity that even I have had a hand in. However it's mostly in the lower ranks. It's very easy to get upset when you've put in hundreds of hours and you feel like you are losing because of anything other than yourself but it only serves to show how fragile the ego is once you've risen above that mentality.This is also a game you want to supplement with watching plenty of youtube videos and spending hours practicing by yourself. Keep that in mind. It's a sport not just a game.,Rocket League®

2018-09-05,0,0,284,False,Recommended,"For everyone who doesn't want to read the whole text It's a great game and I definitely recommend it but don't expect to be a professional after playing for several hours. The basics are easy to learn but after this the learning curve get steeper. This doesn't make the game less good though it's a lot of fun and every match feels like a new and fresh experience.Okay so I have this game for a while now and for some reason I'm writing a review about it right now.It's a pretty fun game but like most games it does have it's pros and cons.It's definitely easy to pick it up but in my opinion it does have a pretty steep learning curve. For example you'll learn quickly how to control your car on the ground and also how to aim when hitting a ball but after that things become a lot harder and take more time to learn.Since this game is multiplayer only (I don't count playing with bots or practice mode) you might not like this game if you get frustrated about teammates easily. Furthermore there are not really a lot of cons.Some people do complain about the ranking systems since it really feels like you barely rank up when winning several matches but derank after losing just one match. I never really had this issue so I don't really have anything to say about it but don't be surprised if this also happens to you you're not the only one.Now about the pros it's easy to pick up and really fun to play every game feels like a new and fresh experience and there are several different gamemodes which you can try if you're getting bored with regular matches. (you probably won't)You might think you would get bored after some games but just like a lot of people have with mobas every match feels differently since different people have different playstyles and your playstyle will have to adapt to that.The game is fluent there haven't been any frustrating bugs as far as I know and even if there is a small bug it's mostly not a problem for the game.In my experience you barely have toxic players as long as you don't completely mess up for your team. This however does depend on how good you are because on lower ranks you'll find more toxic players than on higher ranks obviously.The cooperation between Rocket League and Monstercat is also quite nice because you can listen to ""normal"" music instead of random boring menu music.Furthermore I don't think I have anything else to say I can only say that it's a great game which you should definitely try out.10/10 Monsieur Lenny",Rocket League®

2018-09-02,0,0,2166,False,Recommended,Gameplay 11/10New Ban System 0/10Warning !!! 9/1/18 New Banning system is Terrible if you are a decent player in this game and try to help and play with not so good players this system is going to force you to waste alot of your valueable time.. 9/10 times you will be matchmade with terrible players. granted they are probably 5 years old but their low skill levels (ramming you fighting you for ball sitting in own net when making pass plays all around terrible) is very upsetting and your only true option now is to abandon match. before you both could agree to forfeit but this option rarely exists. I've many times attempted to talk with the player trying to get them to make pass plays or reposition themselves for making plays which 99% of the time instantly results in saltyness thus isn't even worth attemtping (esp now because any tilted word will get you autobanned). Now my only option is to abandon match and doing so will result in very very very very very very unessisarily long compounded time bans. You may think why not play the game out? When you have a job and only an hour to play i dont want to be ing match made with noobs trashing my experience over and over and over for 45 mins of my ing time!!! 24 hour ban for abandoning a match is god damn insane. Rocket League if your going to keep up with this system and expect experienced players to keep playing this game you need to make a 2 v 1 and 3 v 1(2) mode. (sorry your bots are trash too and are more of a burden having them than not) pretty much goes for 9/10 of the people you match make me with. soo either that or fix your damn matchmaking system. seriously. this game is fantastic when your matched at a relatively close skill level it sadly only happens 1% of the time.,Rocket League®

The game's matchmaking mechanics make it so that XP levels are not factored in. It only goes by your rank in competitive. EX A player with over 1000 hours is bored or not good enough for a Champ rank in competitve He goes up and down the rank tree to play against everyone below him with his impossible to combat skills for new and unexperienced players.

If you win it's because you earned it and if you lose it's because you deserve it. The skill ceiling is so high I'm 1600 hours in and am still only halfway to the top. So if you like a challenge this is the perfect game. And somehow... it's also one of the most fun games i've played. Nothing feels better than belting that soccer ball into the goal.

It's extremely easy to just pick up and play while still being extremely difficult to master. The customization is also brilliant with plenty of flags antennae wheels and decals to choose from matching your accessories with your friends to make it apparent you are a team when you play online! The single player is also a lot of fun and good practice as well as the various training drills which help you get your head around some of the more 'advanced' manouvers and tactics. But it's the multiplayer that really drives this game it's competitive and addicting...and you will constantly find yourself thinking 'just one more game' one game turns to ten and ten turns to fifty next thing you know it's 4am and the sun's coming up!

So I'll keep it short and sweet Good game fun to play.If you want to play Rocket League I highly suggest that you take into consideration that this is a stupidly graphics based game. If you dont have a good computer save your money for a new computer or different game.Pros Playing with friends in any scenario can be a blast.Opening crates is fun (If your luck never seems to run out).Fun game to play alone or in a group.Lots of customization options.Cons Stupidly compedetive (I have never advanced to Gold 1 (Tier 2 Stage 1) during the considerable time that I have played this game).If you impulse buy you will learn to hate this game.Overly time consuming for loot/crate drops.Definelty not family friendly as this game's community is a flaming lot of trash talkers (Yes there is a team only/off option for chat but chat is essential for communication between teammates).All in all 6/10 from me.From my friends Probably around 8/10No serious ""You need this game"" reccomendation just watch someone play it on YouTube and see for yourself.Would reccomend to compedetive friends that dont mind a hard time and negative mouth breathers.Edit Forgot to add I have repeatively deleted and re installed this game thanks to it's rage inducing tendancies.",Rocket League®

(Semi serious... semi JK) &gt _&gt But for real.. Holy crap. I waited so long to buy this game because I didn't think I'd enjoy it. Was I ever wrong. Took me over 100 games.. But i'm starting to do fancy stuff and making some incredible plays/getting incredible goals like the good players. Umm.. Don't jump into ranked like I did right away... You're going to lose. A lot. I dropped down to the lowest rank you can get. I'm just starting to climb out.Think i'm Bronze 2 Division 2. I'm more addicted to this than I was in late season 1/early season 2 of League Of Legends. It's that good. O Make sure you have a controller though... Keyboard controls are AWFUL!!! &lt 3 &lt 3 GET THIS GAME! So I can beat your bronze butt. Meow. 3 EDIT Getting close to 400 hours.

Makes the game a lot of fun matches are relatively quick and controlling a huge soccer ball with a rocket ppowered car that can jump and flip is much harder than you think. Only complaint is how easy it is to leave matches and get a replacement AI which lets face it aren't the sharpest tools in the shed.

I feel that for new players it can be frustrating but once you put the time into it and make your way up the ranks learning new ways to use your car it becomes a fast paced and incredibly fun game to play even if it's just you wanting to play a few games or in a group of friends. Would reccomend for anyone that likes football and wants a game that they can learn and get better at over time. Like I started in Season 4 (Currently Season 8 at this moment) and was Bronze in S5 I got up to Silver S6 I was Gold but then I really tried to get better and by the end of Season 7 I got up to Diamond 3. So once you take time to learn and get better you really start to see a difference in your rank.,Rocket League®

What's not to love?This is a fantastic game easy to pick up difficult to master awesome fun to play and with a great dev team that's pretty highly active. Graphics are scalable to suit most systems from your gran's old laptop to your l33t liquid cooled gaming ultra rig. DLC is cosmetic only so you're never paywalled out of a game.At least to begin with you may want to steer clear of the loot box system that powers the more exotic cosmetic content and the Ranked ladder which can be pretty toxic in the lower tiers.Also definitely use a gamepad for this one (you'll thank yourself later).I bought this in a Steam sale I'm 107 hours in and have never looked back. It's great to pick up for 30 minutes or so and get some casual matches in or if you want to master the (fairly steep) learning curve and test your mettle in Ranked. If Psyonix work out how to add VR support without making people chunder then this might become my all time favourite.,Rocket League®
2018-03-03,0,0,113,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rocket league is a fun easy to play yet hard to master arcade car &amp football game.The fact cars jump race and chase a giant football with rocket powered engines goes beyond me.A briliant excution of action and fun in a neat package.The game provides you with hours of fun with different gamemodes too.Tired off football? We give you hockeypucks tired of that? Basketball is also a thing. No problem.The game has a HUGE community it blasts all over the internet. And if you ever been browing games without ever encountering Rocket League you are missing something big.Choose over 20 battlecars and costumize them to your liking. Change the color of your car boost change the wheels change the boost trail put on a silly hat on your car and add a nice flag. You are 100% free to make your dream battlecar and use it in matches against other players both local and online.The only reason to dislike this game is the game reward system. After every match you get a random reward. including lootboxes. Yes. LOOTBOXES! But stay with me. All items in game are cosmetic. No item in game makes your car fly higher or drivr faster. Every battlecar in game is just that. A battlecar with a different bodystyle no faster than any other just the outside.Lootboxes however arent for the take. They require a seperate purchase of ''Keys'' you buy with real life currency to open them and than its not certain you get the item you desire. It is all random. Than again it is all cosmetic. So it is all optional as the game itself provides free cosmetic items by default. Just less fancier that is.My biggest dislike for rocket league isnt the game itself but the trading community. This is somwhat of a choise itself as well yet cosmetic items are bound to be pushed in your face sometime. And if you want that one certain item in game you either be lucky to get it in a lootbox or trade about 22keys for 1 item. Ridiculous.All things asside Rocket league is a great solid game with great potenial. And a must have title for anyone who enjoys a good time. A solid recommandation,Rocket League®

2015-08-16,0,0,82,False,Recommended,This game is not just for fans of football it can appeal to almost anyone. There are a good bunch of vehicles to choose from and while they don't seem to change or have any advantages or disadvantages over each other it's good being able to customise the vehicle to your liking.There are a number of different decals and pain jobs that you can pick from and fun antenna for the top of your car including country flags and more silly things such as a police siren.The gameplay is chaotic (and thats a good thing). The standard game pits 3 against 3 and depending on the skill of the players in the game the ball may be flying about in random directions or you can have sky duels using the jump and boost technique to get some serious height.I find 1v1 games to be a bit disappointing because with only 2 people on the pitch the ball tends to just roll about while the players get into position to hit the ball whereas in a more crowded game you can pass the ball to teammates. To put it into context it would be similar if you played fifa 1 on 1 with no other players.To finalize this game is definately worth the money you will be able to find countless hours of fun from what is a very simple concept.,Rocket League®

If you begin playing with a friend or two the experience will be more pleasant so if you're playing solo try to find a few friendly players you can party up with and explore the game with the help of another person.This game has taken up a lot of my life and it'll continue doing so.

2018-07-01,0,0,237,False,Recommended,Incredible competitive game with tons of players online (today u saw up to 175000). Probably the most competitive game at the moment with a growing community. May be demotivating at first when you start to play because you WILL be really bad. But after you get some hours in you start to notice improvement which is REALLY satisfying. Tons of skins and items to build your car the way you want and tons of cars to chose from. 10/10 would recommend this game to any players looking for a competitive game that you will love!,Rocket League®
2018-07-01,0,0,1381,False,Recommended,I have been on and off for video games my whole life. I'm 32 now. About 7 months ago a friend introduced me to RL. I had no idea the rabbit hole I was going to fall into. This game will draw you in with its easy to pick up and play mechanics and interesting concept and game modes. But after a while you realize that there is more to it. You notice with every block goal demo and attempt at aerials you want to... And NEED to improve. You will begin dedicating time and effort to improve and see and feel the results of your work. This is both a casual and in depth game all at once. I highly recommend this game and I love it.

2018-07-06,0,0,381,False,Not Recommended,"ive given this game a nice review but i had to put a thumbs down for one specific reason... SOLO QUEUESplease dont act like solo queues are stable...because ik for a fact they arent. This game is relatable to League of Legends where you are teamed with bad players irreguardless but you get ALOT more bad players than good ones. This is the cycle that ive been dealing with and im TIRED of the community telling me im a ing variable into winning the game. Ive tried offense ive tried defense and a balance between those but i get teamed with some of the iest players who either blame me for how ""bad"" i am or just cant defend the ball when im 3 seconds off defense getting some BOOST. I dont like how the community just brushes it off as nothing and then tells u to improve when you are already improved i went from being stuck in gold 2 to GOLD 1 and yet i can play with my diamond 1 or 2 friends while having the same skill set as theirs (or close to). At least ATTEMPT to make solo queues more efficient when teaming with someone because ive had plenty of more lose streaks than win streaks in this game. Now lets talk about another thing your adding... ROCKET PASS (or in my terms...a complete band wagon of the fucin event pass from battle royals)i as a player can admit to liking more items but as someone who knows the feeling of buying items they will get old to you rather quickly because...its an item theres nothing interesting to it other than cosmetic purposes. I'd far rather have more content and gamemodes than some event pass. ANOTHER NOTE.Im not trying to be some dush when i say this but please fix your ing game when it registers ball hits before going on to selling in game content. Its not healthy to leave some things unignored and while this may be a very little problem it could definently be a big problem for someone else (such as losing because a ball did not register the hit or block).For now i cannot garentee ill put a reccomendation to any new players or for anyone who likes to solo queue and doesnt have many friends who plays this game.if i had the opportunity id easily take a refund from this game because its more of rage and annoyance than actual fun. plus it takes an hour to download not putting up with this game any longer.Edit oh yeah FIX YOUR ING RANKED WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE. Some guy left my game right away and i instantly lost. weve all had that moment and then we get demoted because of it. im tired of it needs to be less harsh if someone leaves. the person that leavs should get the loss",Rocket League®

Balls are ROLLING ALONG THE GROUND FLIPPED INTO GO FLYING AND THEN SOMEHOW FLY BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE AND CONTINUE ROLLING YET SOMEHOW THE PERSON WHO FLIPPED INTO THE BALL HAS VANISHED THROUGH THE BALL AND CONTINUED DOWN THE FIELD.

This game has brought me 1000+ hours of entertainment and I feel obligated to put this out there for anyone thats on the verge of buying or on the verge of quitting shortly after buying.If its the latter yes you suck. You are bad and so is 90% of the playerbase. Look at competitive play on RLCS or other pro streams and try to preform at their level. you cant. If its the former all I can say is to wait for a sale or free weekend and get a couple hours in. For the amount of hours of fun waiting to be had with this game I believe full retail is more than worth it but also understand the hesiation to buy at full price.The skill ceiling in this game im convinced does not exist. Here's a short list in order of phases to go through as you learn to play. how to drive how to hit the ball dashing jumping controlled direction of shots start trying aerials(400 hours later) finally decent at aerials we forgot something THE WALLS(200 hours later) walls are no big deal now(one RLCS ceiling shot/flip reset later) alright the ceiling is the limitfor now....This is unorganized and all over the place but my overall point is that everyone is terribe for a very long time before getting good so please stick with it and waste more of your life on this masterpiece.,Rocket League®

2016-01-21,0,0,1889,False,Not Recommended,First of all i wanna say that this game is a MASTERPIECE and an INSANELY ADDICTIVE game that will keep you busy for a long time.There is only one big problem The community it's H O R R I B L E.Almost every match you will encounter either a player that leaves after ONE goal conceded and you will play the rest of the match with bots in your team because the ones that join after see the scoreboard and do the same or a player or team that keeps on cursing everyone.There are also people that keep TROLLING ( without a reason ) or just stay AFK for crates even from the start of the game.Lastly there are those people that literally ABUSE the demolish feature ( sometimes you will see a team of 3 focusing on exploding you ).As a player who just wants to have fun i find really annoying getting exploded each 20 seconds by a bunch of players that find demolishing more fun than actually playing the game.The reporting system for people that curse in chat it's working fine and i'll also want to see some penalties being added ( report options ) for those that stay AFK leave the game early even in casual troll teammates or those that ABUSE the demolish feature.PSYONIX fix that please don't let that fun game be dominated by toxic players !,Rocket League®

It is a fun game but I cannot focus because i'm scared the ghoul will come out when I least expect it and startle me. My depth perception is a little messed up because i have to look at the game between my index finger and my ring finger this is not ideal. I play the game one handed so I have decided the best way is with the ""Powar Wheele"" A steering wheel I bought for NASCAR Racing 2003 Season back in the day. It works well enough but I can't jump and people keep calling me a ""real degenerate"". This one guy told me to ""take a hike"" and I was so upset I stopped playing for a week. I come back and I tell the first person I see to ""take a hike"" and he started crying and left. I realized that I was projecting anger onto the sweet innocents of Rocket League over this one bad apple. I'm still waiting on the ghoul and if it doesnt show up soon I may stop playing because my heart and mind cannot take it.

2018-02-24,0,0,445,False,Recommended,This game is one of the best for both both the casual and hardcore gamer. Even if you're not a fan of sports this reinterpretation of soccer leads to incredibly fun gameplay. You can play with up to three friends in matchmaking or up to a total of 8 players in a private match for chaotic fun. Or if you're so inclined you can play in the competitive queue where your skill level is tracked and everyone is playing to win. All in all this game has something for everyone from the most determined tow in to those who just want to make cool looking or wacky cars and hit balls or blow up other cars with them.,Rocket League®

But then that's when the fun actually begins mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering 1% of what you can do in this game. You'll end up playing more and more and more until you realize you've just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again. Yes this game is higly addictive.,Rocket League®

2018-04-07,0,0,661,False,Recommended,In 2015 a friend recommended a free PS Plus game called Rocket League. I sighed because I hate football and cars don't interest me a great deal other than for transport. After my first couple of matches I was sold. The game looks great runs great the skill ceiling keeps going up with each new season no hackers and really good gameplay. Even though I recommend this game there are 2 things I dislike about it and have also been adressed in other reviews1st point the community can be toxic at times spamming quick chat purposely ramming you leaving a match after 1 goal etc.2nd point it seems that after every update the servers get worse than at the launch of the game.Even with these (rather small) flaws I always keep coming back to it because there is simply no game like this.

2017-12-27,0,0,170,False,Not Recommended,Love this game but the toxicity level of people in this game is horrendous. I usually start out playing kicking and having a great time. Even end up getting teamed with some people that actual know how to pass to each other and play as a team. But then some dumbasses come along and start spewing boat loads of toxicity and it ruins it everytime. Worst part is when they are on your team and them telling you that you suck when they screw up.I always start happy and leave PO'd everytime I play this game. They really need to do something about it.,Rocket League®
2017-05-17,0,0,238,False,Recommended,Rocket League's reputation speaks for itself at this point. The idea didn't immediately appeal to me but once you (with a controller) feel the handling of the car the physics of the ball and how thrust/air control works you just want to get better at it constantly and learn more. The community can be toxic and there can be some really selfish players but all in all I can whole heartedly recommend Rocket League and praise the developers for the immense value of their product.,Rocket League®

2016-11-27,0,0,1343,False,Recommended,Remote controlled rocket cars playing soccer... It's super simple and the hardest game you'll ever play! This really is the first game ever to give a real sense of what a game of soccer is actaully like out on the field. FIFA eat your heart out this is infinitely better than any other soccer game ever made to date! In the beginning you'll see the ball chasing school yard insanity and it will define you for a moment. And then you will play against a great team and get completely annihilated. There's always a better player and a better team! And you will always have reality to send you back to the training grounds. (they work extremely well at preparing you for higher level play)It's highly competitive and extremely addictive! You will find yourself studying techniques and strategies on youtube in no time. At about the 100 hour mark you will realize that you're not completely useless anymore.

There is a lot to do you might think this game will become boring after 20 hours but no it keeps going cause you can get a lot better flying and doing freestyles is something not everyone can do. Playing with friends or playing alone still this game is fun. For me this game is something I can play with my friends even if we dont have a lot of time and just talk for a bit cause its pretty sit down and relax game. Problem is that my friend says 1 more game while me and my other friends are waiting for him so we go out but in the end he ends up playing not 1 but 10 games.Playing too much gets me sick of this game but after a few days I can play it again.

2017-11-24,0,0,40,False,Recommended,Rocket League is the game that brought me close to the friends I have now. It has taught me that through hardwork and dedication you can truly be good at something.While there are many unskilled players the excitement and adrenaline behind hitting the ball on goal is worth the extra few minutes explaining how to use the controls to someone. The new players tend to catch on quickly and find themselves enjoying the game after an assist upon goal.I feel that this game will bring friends and families closer and create that competitive bond that spices up relations. Among those I've played with this game is what has provided a way to escape the stresses of life and fully envelope oneself into something so enjoyable.Pros 2 player Split ScreenOnline Multiplayer (2 to 8)Customizable CarsMany GamemodesPro LeagueCross playFrequent UpdatesEasy to grasp controlsOriginal ConceptCons Lootcrates that require in app purchase keysYou cannot party up with console playersIn game microphone quality is rather poorRarity of itemsToxic players in ranked (via text chat)Overall I really enjoy this game.

2017-05-09,0,0,1526,False,Recommended,Great game! The graphics are absolutely incredible. Also I love the fact that Rocket League has crates and keys that is where all the trading comes in. There are five seconds for the trade to actually accept and the other players get the items. I honestly love that feature because if you do not want to trade your item then you can quickly decline the trade. Another thing that makes this game a fun game is because it is so easy to invite your friends to your party and find a game. If there were someone to be back and forth about buying this game I hope this review helped you out.,Rocket League®

2017-06-27,0,0,8,False,Recommended,Plays gameSomehow managed to give the other team a pointRepeatedly does thisCan't figure out the mechanics and controls for my life. Many people say that Rocket League would be so much better with a controller. Perhaps that's the problem as I for the life of me can't even 'git gud.' Granted I just started. I first picked up Rocket League when we had the free day and man was I so glad to buy this game now. It's truly fun nothing to take serious but also embarrassing for me as being a noob. I'm going to play this game a whole lot more when I get the time. Providing that I don't spend all my time on Overwatch. It's a great game to play with friends. Highly recommend it. It might be just me but the community is nice too... just like this game. So glad I bought this. Unfortunately can't play all the times.Edit So I've been playing Rocket League more often and one thing I tend to notice is that a lot of players tend to be afk or not moving not even interested in playing the game. At first I thought the players were bot but I've come to find that is seems to be common and with some players ruining this game for those interested in playing I can see how this might turn one off. Be aware of these players and unfortunately a lot of my matches been like that so bad luck for me I suppose? This game doesn't seem to be 'alive' to me although there are many players who DO PLAY IT. I also played competitve for the first time and every time it seems like I am winning I am not awarded a win? Be well aware that this was placements though so I have no idea whether it's the same aftert hat or not but I find that to be unfair. To my knowledge (and correct me if I am wrong) the opposite player does not get punished besides a lost. Sooo what's the point of playing? The only comp mode I played though was 1v1. If it's different for any other I have no idea. I still would recommend it if you can get the game on sale. It's still a fun game you can put lots of hours into.,Rocket League®

It's an issue that is very common among players (literally just google ""Rocket League Lag"") and it doesn't seem like Psyonix is doing anything to fix it. I'm not even talking about Lag due to the connection but rather frame drops in offline mode too. I know it isn't my computer because I've been playing this game for years as well as other games and this issue has only been occuring since about a year ago.

I love football I played Fifa and Pes for many years but recently my computer doesn't meet the specs to play the games so I turned to Rocked Leauge.I still enjoy playing it but the community is horrendous lately the updates where lackluster the matchmaking seems kind of funky (or I just suck I guess).So I'm uninstalling the game from my old and dying laptop and I guess farewell Psyonix. Maybe all those years ago you shouldn't tried again when the concept failed if you're just going to milk the customers.,Rocket League®

2016-09-04,0,0,1847,False,Recommended,"In many ways from a design standpoint this is a perfect game and definitely the best ""sports"" game I can think of. The concept is simple enough to be explained and understood in a few seconds but the skill ceiling is basically infinite. Just like in real sport a different balance of skills will impact matches in very distinct ways.The UI is clean and generally good (and set to get better with the Rumble update) the game runs well the DLC policy thus far has been good (free maps/modes and no P2W). I'd like to see the Replay Manager improved (browsing replays is very ineffecient) but the game is under very active development so I'm sure that will be forthcoming. The only real flaw that exists which is no fault of the game is that new players may have a difficult time finding matches where they don't get blown out. This is due to the game having been out for over a year and the vast majority of online players at any given time having much more experience than someone just stepping into the game. The learning curve isn't really steep but it is very long and most players are going to be further along. Catching up is mainly going to be a matter of time. The other issue is the new matching system which is effective in eliminating rank boosting hurts teams with a mix of experienced and new players so introducing friends to the game is a challenge. I hope this is addressed in some fashion soon.",Rocket League®

2018-06-19,0,0,317,False,Recommended,Extremely fun game that will satisfy both the casual and competitive player. Replayability is nearly infinite. The skill gap among players is enormous which provides a challenge and incentive to improve. Matchmaking is very good at ensuring you are playing among your skill level. As for toxicity it mostly exists in players leaving matches at the first sign of defeat or spamming messages in the quick chat. Neither of these issues are of much significance due to AI teammates and chat bans. This game never fails to improve my mood.,Rocket League®

2018-03-17,0,0,32,False,Recommended,I've been playing Rocket League for a while now playing in competitive and casual alike. RL (short for Rocket League) offers a lot. It rewards players for taking a risk or playing it safe making games very hectic and fast paced actionPros Worth the money spent DLC only adds aethetical/cosmetical things Controlling the cars feels fair but loose making an enjoyable ride The ball control rewards players for not always doing front flips to launch the ball rather going for a methodical play styleCons The physics can be janky at times leading to uninteded flips or going flying for no apparent reason Playing with a controller in my opinion is vastly superior to keyboard and give the controller player an advantage 4 player comp is a complete nightmare for me a lot of the times due to the space on the field being rather small for 8 players and makes your impact feel less like it matter unlike doublesThis is just a short review for people not looking to read 3 paragraphs so this means I probably missed a thing or two. So to the best possible look/review of the game I suggest you go play it and figure it out.,Rocket League®

Like in most other football games you just press ""X"" to tackle and take the ball under your control and you can pass the ball to other guy with pressing ""Y"" and that's pretty much it. In Rocket League you'll seriously have to take the ball with your car power and accuracy rather than just press buttons.And don't.. Just don't forget to train your positioning with team mates it is essential in order to win games.About 650h played (+about 100h on PS4 earlier) I could say I have now learned like the basics in the game. You can always and I mean ALWAYS train to be better in example juggling saving long shooting passing wall shots flying accuracy etc... You name it. The skill cap in this game is freaking unlimited which is cool. For me atleast it's cool. One thing worth mentioning devs with this game is just great. They listen to the community and they'll try adapt their updates with communitys wishes which is awesome. You don't see that much in nowadays games don't you?All in all it's a great game in a small package and it's unlimited fun alone or with your mates.5/5",Rocket League®

2017-09-05,0,0,270,False,Recommended,I've logged in many hours in this frikkin game. What can I say? Good controls addictive gameplay consistent little additions like maps and such. Sure you'll probably spend about $10+ trying to get one stupid aesthetic add on (every crate you must open with keys that cost $1 each but the reward is randomized and you can and will get repeats) but there's a nice level of customization to your car to begin with.If you like racing and soccer at the same time or the idea of doing them together tickles you buy this game.,Rocket League®
2018-06-26,0,0,27,False,Recommended,Quite fun pass the time game.

2016-02-21,0,0,2334,False,Recommended,I have played this game for over 2 000 hours and I can say with certainty that all the time up to this point has been vrey well spent. If you are looking for a fun game to break away from the shooter games I strongly suggest this. If you don't like games without guns stay away from this game. Here are some things to look out for if you don end up getting this game. Very frustrating at times. At times this game can be very stressful and frustrating. If you are someone who looks for instant success i reccommend a different game for you. Servers are kind of bad The servers are very lackluster at times and can get very annoying. The US servers in particular because I don't know how the EU servers are. Community can get iffy The community for the most part is relativley positive but there are those angry few who like to be mean for no reason.If none of this scares you off the game then i strongly suggest you give Rocket League a try. The RLCS/RLRS and other tournaments/esports conventions are very fun and exciting. I hope this review helps someone make a choice on Rocket League! Good Luck and Have Fun!,Rocket League®

2016-11-14,0,0,921,False,Recommended,Fantastic competitive game! Much better than CSGO ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN. This is one of the only games where as you play you learn the game and get better. Don't get discouraged if you feel like you'll never learn how to do an aerial just KEEP PLAYING! One of the best games you can get and it is NEVER boring. Looking at it (a game where you play soccer with cars) it doesn't look appealing until you play it. THEN you will understand the love that me and thousands of other players have for it. Buy it and have fun!,Rocket League®
2018-08-13,0,0,738,False,Recommended,One of the best sport oriented games I have ever played. There is plenty of content to unlock and enjoy without paying. No pay to win options. A learning curve that over time is achievable to be pretty good at the game and a steep one to be a master.,Rocket League®
2018-08-13,0,0,196,False,Recommended,Ok one of the most original concepts and a great esports title to play. Something you can learn pretty easy at first yet something it may take you years to master. It extremely satisfying outplaying your opponents with flicks stoppies and aerials. My favorite being the flicks cus its good to juggle the ball then go in with a nasty flick shot. But aside fomr the excellent gameplay the customization aspect is excellent though you'd have to shell out cash for the myraid crates you get that givesd you skins toppers wheels new cars etc. I've put about maybe (on console) $300 bucks into RL and gotten most vehicles in the game and decent wheels and skins(besides the Zephr crates stuff). My only complaint is I wish you can transfer your data over from console tol pc though I dont mind I love the game for what it is just wish that was possible. Other than that this is a fun game that racing fanatics and soccer fans will enjoy.,Rocket League®

2017-06-27,0,0,315,False,Recommended,One of the most addicting games I've ever played. Graphics are great gameplay is (somewhat) simple yet super fun. Playing casual mode is cool at first but once you get good competitive mode is what's epic. In casual you just play and either win or lose. But in competitive when you win or lose it affects your rank bronze 1 being the lowest and grand champion being the highest. You can play 1 on 1 all the up to 4 on 4. In casual there are other modes besides the default soccer mode Rumble Dropshot Hoops and Rocket Labs. In Rumble it is regular soccer but powerups added in. In Dropshot the goal is UNDER you and you have to break the floor (with the ball) to get to it. In Hoops the goal is (technically) ABOVE you like in basketball. In Rocket Labs the maps are shaped in very unique ways unlike the default soccer maps which are all rectangle shaped with curved edges.The main point is this game is lots of fun for pretty much anybody ESPECIALLY competitive players who will spend much more time on it to perfect their skills.,Rocket League®

Now that we're all a lot better its just a lot less fun.The developers are great the game is great but i'm not enjoying it as much as i was when i just started.If you want to have some fun with friends go ahead and buy it.If you want to ""git gud"" and climb the ranks go ahead and buy it.But keep in mind that you want to play the game to have fun.",Rocket League®

No buying boosters to unlock weapons faster no struggle to buy all the champions and unlock all the abilities. Like the old Halo days it's just your skill and development as a player. Toxicity is extremely low compared to other games there is even less at the high ranks. Finally hit Diamond 3 and I want to play more now than ever before. Cosmetics are optional but they do support the developers and give some players something to tinker with if you're into that (I care about this less than most).

2017-11-04,0,0,1893,False,Recommended,"Rocket League.I'm sure most of you have seen the pros play or watched videos about the game. However there is so much more.In the game you can fly through the air spewing whatever you choose as your boost whether it be flames portal gel dark matter or many many others. You can smack the ball downfield to your teammates or dribble the ball on the hood of your car which can be one of many through the defenders and into the net.Nothing is quite as satisfying as sending your car flying through the air doing three spins a backflip and tapping the ball with your nose to send it flying past all the defenders left astonished on the ground into the net. Or if you prefer you can get a little more physical and set up a pass for your teammate before smacking the opponents cars out of the way leaving a much easier shot for your teammate.You can even chat with your teammates to form plans and plays to help get past really tough defenses. However be careful chatting here because Psyonix seems to ban for just about anything and they don't shed any light on what they banned you for other than ""You have been banned for 24 hours for verbal harassment.""If you open a ticket in order to inquire further they likely stonewall your questions with bot responses much in the same way they did with me.However the game itself is amazing. Extraordinarily fun especially with friends and if you get good enough you could even attend championships for chances at Scholarships for school in game rewards Steam wallet balance and cold hard cash.All in all this game is definitely worth the $19.99 Steam lists it as. Even more so when one of the many glorious Steam sales drops the price further. My only complaint to Psyonix about this one is that they really need to step up their customer support because it is sorely lacking.",Rocket League®

2017-03-22,0,0,123,False,Not Recommended,This game is very well made great mechanics and concepts it's great fun when your playing with your friends and can be very fun to play by yourself as well however the community is incredibly toxic and it is likely that you won't find a game without somebody saying your at the game (whether you actually are or not they'll still tell you that you are) or telling you that your family should die from cancer. Usually my competative games end with some 8 12 year old screaming at me through their poor quality microphone or you'll get an adult who claims to be good at the game and spends most of the match trying to roast you to make himself look cool when in actual fact he makes himself sound like a prepubesant teenager that has had a 12 inch baguette shoved up their and is currently on their period.So yeah if your into this kinda game go ahead and buy it I guess.But personally I can't recommend this game.

I started playing Rocket League at the Xbox release it was a blast from the first match. I was pretty casual till about may of last year which is around when I started playing just about every day. Rocket League delivers the feeling of ""fun"" more consistently than any game I've ever played. I've put in 700 800 hours on Xbox before my love for the game finally drove me to build a PC and switch over. Now a month later I already have 150 hours on Steam. It's still pretty much the only game I play nearly 1000 hours total now and no sign of boredom yet.

2018-03-25,0,0,1,False,Recommended,Notice that although I recommend this game this game is not my cup of tea for now. 8/10 (w/o my personnal factor) This game is obviously good. It can brings you fun if you are a competitive player which I used to be. You can clearly see the gap between a good player and a bad player(a.k.a. you at the starting point). The graphics are top notch. The controls are decent even for keyboard and mouse(didn't try controller but I guess it will be much better). The matchmaking are pretty messed up but that's okay for me I can see it as a challenge for a competitive player. I don't know how toxic the community is since I prefer to disable all chat for any multiplayer games unless I play with friends.But as it goes on I realise in order to be good as they do I need to play and improve. I need to invest time to make myself better. But I do not have the leisure time to do so. So I will see myself maintaining in the bad shape of the community. I won't find the real fun as I am trying to climb through these obstacles or any word that suits this situation. I would like to quote one of the Dunkey video This is the new league of legends. But I do not have the time to start all over again. It is a great game. But I will pass for now.,Rocket League®

2018-03-06,0,0,377,False,Recommended,"This game was first introduced to me by a buddy of mine at work one day. He tells me the concept ""Just imagine playing soccer but with cars!"" In my head I think this is probably the stupidest idea I've heard. How would that even work or make sense? He says ""I'll buy the game for you. If you don't like you dont have to pay me back."" So with nothing to lose I give it a shot.Probably one of the best games I have ever played. On the surface it's such a simple concept. You spend your first game just completly missing the ball at every chance you get and getting rekted your first game. Over time you start to learn the mechanics a little more. Knowing how to hit the ball dribble and even make that clutch save. Eventually you're doing aerials off the wall into the upper 90 of the goal. The learning curve for this game is so satisfying. You constantly learn new things and get better over the course of the game. There is a competitve mode for once you hit that skill cap you feel like is good enough (hint wait as long as possible before playing competitve). There are so many game modes for you to choose from though (Solo Duo Standard (3) Chaos (4) Hoops (Basketball game) Hockey).The community is really great. 100% the least toxic community I have apart of (CSGO LoL Overwatch WoW H1Z1 PuBG CoD).You get rewards for free by just playing the game. You also can get crates that you unlock by purchasing keys. If you buy 5 keys it's $4.99 $1 per key. A lot cheaper than most games for that kind of content. I don't feel robbed when I open these crates either.This game is so underrated for what it is. The developers are CONSTANTLY pushing out new FREE CONTENT as well as payed content. None of the payed content gives an advantage in any way also. I don't think I could recommend a better game than this for anyone.",Rocket League®

2018-02-15,0,0,358,False,Recommended,I like the game it is fun for both beginners and pros.Multiplayer is very good all my friends play on Xbox whereas I play on PC the cross play feature means we can play together in private matches. I like doing single player seasons offline and multiplayer competitive 1v1s online.My only problem is at the start of this new season there are too many smurfers and I am stuck in the bronze rank.,Rocket League®
2018-02-15,0,0,649,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a wonderful team based competitive game very much skill driven with a very high skill ceiling easy to play very hard to master. Its delivered in bite size 5 minute matches which are just right. As to what the game actually is just take 10 minutes to watch some youtube videos and you'll see pretty much all there is to see.As with any competitive game the downsides are salt and poor sportsmanship from other players. People will frequently quit games or stop trying if it looks like your team is losing or if they're just unable to deal with perceived poor performance from team mates. So as usual its best played with friends that way you can at least count on your own team to not be,Rocket League®

2016-02-09,0,0,1180,False,Recommended,One of the best games I've ever played It's got depth strategy teamwork and skill. It's the kind of game that you can have fun with without a ton of skill and also has a good competitive scene (though I mute the other teams voice). Also muting people's quick communication in game is easy as well.,Rocket League®

2016-02-09,0,0,1164,False,Recommended,This is a very well made game!For starts it is great for all levels of players casuals to very competative players. This game is very easy to pick up and get the hang of but it has a very high potential with a high skill cap.When I started playing I started off on keyboard and mouse and enjoyed the game but I'd highly recommend getting a controller. (I've tried them all and I'd highly recommend PS4 DualShock) The DLC is awesome (and cheap!) The cars have soo many different awesome ways you can customize them to your own taste!TLDR Awesome game well worth every cent! Buy it!,Rocket League®

And the fun part is playing with friends and trying to score against your friends and winning. The game is astonishing and quite fun to try and go for achievements but sadly the community is all about trading these days and there's no support for middle east servers im getting 350 400 ping each and every game in middle east servers and getting 120 150 in eu servers.

2018-03-13,0,0,1346,False,Recommended,The game is good and well made. A lot of replayability and easy to pick up and play for a single match or hours on end.You may encounter toxic players a bad server lag and smurfs but that is with all games.Be careful what you type in chat bans seem easy to get as I'm now on my second 24 hour.Don't buy crates. Trade keys for items you really want.Everyone uses octane or dominus/old batmobile for freestyling.Good mechanics and a very satisfying game.Sucks you have to buy DLC to get all achievments.The game isn't pay to win however there is microtransactions (keys and crates luckily only cosmetic apart from different hitboxes and performance from cars but nothing game breaking)Worth full price.Controller is better however keyboard is just harder not having the 360 thumbsticks.Not a massive learning curve.

You can't party up and take on random people. Very few people are getting this for the single player campaign which gets old very fast. It's all about the multiplayer battles.,Rocket League®
2016-12-09,0,0,260,False,Recommended,This game is phenomenal. I wish I had bought it sooner I have only been able to put it down because I had finals otherwise I'd probably be playing this game. The skill floor is really low and there really is no skill ceiling you can get amazingly good at this game. If you're unsure about this game get it. If it's on sale get it. Everything that costs you more than the price of the title is just for cosmetics new cars and such. The prices are very fair in my opinion you don't feel the need to buy everything there's already a lot of good looking stock cars for variety and one or two premium cars has satisfied me thoroughly.,Rocket League®

Theres a good few modes to choose from with my favourite being simply Standard 3v3. Theres something for everyone and the workshop always allows for you try something new. It would be nice to see more modes added but I did see that Psyonix are releasing a new modes for the summer. The customisation available for cars is fun to mess around with and work towards getting an item. You can get the occasional player which tries to ruin the game for you but you can simply disable the chat if you so wish.

2018-03-13,0,0,321,False,Recommended,Awesome game and super fun to play. That being said matchmaking has gotten progressively worse over the last half year. You keep getting thrown into losing games and it is really frustrating. Even if you accept the fact that you are going to lose and can reserve a lobby you can wait 5+ minutes in it and not find any players. Then you are forced to leave that lobby and re queue only to be thrown back into another losing game. I'm guessing it is because they want to queue people into games to keep them fair and not have AI but it really sucks. I don't get the system I guess but it has turned me away from this game. If you have time to burn losing hopeless games and then waiting in lobby this is for you. Game 9/10 Matchmaking 3/10,Rocket League®

2017-10-30,0,0,658,False,Recommended,good game to play with friends and great concept unfortunately psyonix decided with all the money kids spend on this game they would put it towards making new cases for people to spend more money rather than to fix any servers. I have fiber interenet and live on the east coast this being said ill connect to an east coast server and have 120+ ping. This basically makes the game unplayable at a competetive level. Just sad to see another company sell out and care more about lining their pockets rather than improve the game. That being said i recommend getting the game just know going into it that it is by no means a perfect game despite the money that is poured into the development company on a daily basis.,Rocket League®

2017-09-10,0,0,508,False,Recommended,This game is very addicting so much fun! I don't really recommend it for couch co op or something like that because of all the lag that goes on the more local players you add I guess it depends on your pc! I feel this is a great skill based game (despite all the players online claiming everything is luck). What exactly can you do to cheat in this? Nothing which is why you've got no excuses why you couldn't get that ball! Great fun in casual play and really intense in competitive. Do watch out for players way higher than you in rank the Psyonix matchmaking system isn't flawless!,Rocket League®

2017-05-01,0,0,577,False,Recommended,I would give this game 5 stars out of 10. It should be a really great game but the developer has messed up in some key areas.Primarily the main problem is that it's impossible to play a complete game without someone leaving (either your team or theirs). You will inevitably end up with a bot that will do nothing. Therefore the only way to really level up in the game is to do so offline in Exhibition mode and you don't receive the same number of points offline.If you do decide to play offline you'll experience some of the worst AI. The bot will always approach the ball as you do and if you do nothing so does the bot. Additionally your bot teammate either blocks your shots or just simply doesn't do anything. Long story short don't bother with this game unless play online in a party with someone you know who won't leave your party.,Rocket League®

2018-07-04,0,0,625,False,Recommended,I think it's a great game but the only thing is that things get repetitive after you've learned how to do ariels trickshots and other complex things because you get to a level were you are just slowly getting better at small things.

2018-04-27,0,0,496,False,Recommended,Long story short It's worth the moneyI have a solid 250 hours in the game at the time I posted this review but i have to say...this is one of the pest games out there....especially considering the lower price tag. There is a casual mode for everyone and a competitive mode for those who take their gameplay seriously with different rankings to show how you match up against the world. As Psyonix promotes in their advertisements and videos there are PLENTY of combinations you can make with the vehicles and other items you have but they don't make the game P2W in fact there is no P2W factor in this game overall. Its a simple game at first you drive forward do some flips easy to learn but then as you move up the leagues you need to learn better timing and new skills such as air dribbles and ceiling shots in order to keep doing better. It seems like you would get bored relatively quickly just driving into a ball forever but with the variety of game modes and team sizes you can do you'll always have a challenge and keep on playing. One tip If you get a LOT of crates find someone who likes crates and you may be able to trade them in for an item or two (nothing super special though)...unless you want to buy keys and open them and hope for a good item knock yourself out.,Rocket League®

Little BG Story I was thrown into the darkest pit forcing myself to climb out of. As my friend watched constantly throwing rocks at me sometimes bringing other randoms along as they all chuck rocks at me. It was dark all I could do was climb and hope that I dont go down with the rain of rocks. I saw a light I thought finally I am getting out of this alive but I was wrong it was just Richard and he was very angry. D lol Someone will understand this.Pros FunFast Pace when up in the ranksFunny learning curveKeyboard friendlyEasy to play harder to masterCons Sometimes you get those people who wont FF even when the game is done causing others to afk.Forced to watch a lot of replays its the worst when you have to have the other team score 1 point and your team is up 5+If unlucky you will play with super toxic players might ruin your dayI spent 1000 hours on the ground because I was too afraid to do aerials and fail.

2018-03-05,0,0,609,False,Recommended,Rocket League is really simple to play casually but has a high skill cap and can get as difficult as you make it. It has a good trade/custom system and frequent updates to it's content. The ranked mode is pretty well acclamated too. Players eep finding new ways to completely change the way this game is played. It might seem like and RC Car Soccer and it can be if you want it to. But it has the skill scaling you want in a game to be fun challenging and competitive simultaneously,Rocket League®

2016-12-28,0,0,232,False,Not Recommended,Due to a great lot of technical flaws I cannot possibly recommend this game.First the servers are bad and have always been. The game has a package loss symbol which blinks almost all the time independent on your internet connection. Sometimes the game has a visible delay of several hundred miliseconds (even though the ingame ping might be displayed as being below 30ms). Two players can hit the ball and the ball itself then seems to just change direction midair.Second the physics engine seems like a workaround that was introduced once and has never been changed. For example if you jump from a wall while not being in either a 0 or 90 degree angle you can be pulled back to the wall immediately. Also what bothers me a lot gravity is different for the car and for the ball. Cars drop faster than the ball does destroying all intuitivity.Third the camera is just objectively bad. You have exactly two options 1 you look forwards (and backwards upon button click) which causes motion sickness due to quick steering maneuvers. 2 you look at the ball. If you choose this camera option aiming becomes impossible due to the camera swirling around as soon as you get close to the ball. As far as I know (and I may be wrong here) the developers have ruled out camera changes or a free cam (which I would greatly appreciate even while playing via gamepad).There are more minor flaws but these are my three main issues.My impression is that the developers know that most people just accept these issues and therefore they don't change anything regarding this. It is a pity that I can't recommend the game because it itself is a fun concept and there are nice features to it.,Rocket League®
2018-07-19,0,0,53,False,Recommended,To be honest its worth the moneyWell atleast if you put more effort into this gameFor someone that gets kind of triggered easily i wouldnt recommend this gameIt has loads of minigames worth a try and to be honest has pretty good graphicsIt also works for potato pc pMostly its football related but it includes minigames that also represent basketball (love that minigame) hockey (canadian dream) and other funny and enjoyable minigames (Rocket Labs Dropshot and others)If you re a begginer i would recommend 3v3 or 2v2 but there is also 1v1 and 4v4.Most enjoyable is if you have a friend over/friends that play the game too (can be played splitscreen on xbox and probably ps4 too)Overall epic game worth the money and try,Rocket League®

2017-11-27,0,0,1863,False,Recommended,Best described as car soccer Rocket League is an exciting unique arcade game for everyone. Although it may seem quite repetitive the game will last you for endless hours no matter if you are on the grind for Grand Champ or just in it for fun the multiplayer consistant updates and vast choice in cosmetics will no doubt keep you hooked. The graphics and framerate are manageable at 60fps on high with a decent computer and still playable even with my 8 year old Dell XPS 8300 so no problems there.I highly suggest purchasing this game if you are looking to expand your range of trading as it is an excellent opprotunity for profit once you have gained an understanding for the market.,Rocket League®

2016-11-30,0,0,113,False,Not Recommended,"Servers have constant errors and the ball STILL doesn't follow the rules of physics. This game feels like it's more RNG than skill based especially when two or more cars hit the ball at the same time. That is if the ball registers your hits in the first place and doesn't lag out due to the crappy server quality. 1v1 is tolerable but if there are more players than that the ball starts to do whatthe ever and twitch around.You'd think the devs would code something liek that properly but no the ball does what it wants when it wants and doesn't give a what you try to make it do.Also the amount of DLCs is abysmal which serve no actual purpose other than being a quick money grab and being a flashy new toy for kids who suck them up. It's especially apparent when you're required to buy DLCs if you want to ""complete"" this game as in if you're looking to complete all the achievements.",Rocket League®

2018-03-01,0,0,1070,False,Not Recommended,Same thing over and over. Sure it has it's moments but it lacks a lot of structure in terms of ranking system and content. The developers focus mainly on releasing skins and whatnot rather than perfecting the game still existing bugs like the ball goes thru the car so in some cases you may have saved the ball but thanks to the bug it went thru the car! The servers are really crap. It doesn't matter if you a have gigabyte connection their servers will often disconnect you and and at times you will suffer a penalty for 5 mins saying you left the game but in reality you got Disconnected by the server going down.The ranking system.. It's pathetic how a rookie can get to diamond without knowing the basics I've encountered so many of them it's ridiculous. They really should not allow higher elo players boosting new players should be like league of legends where you can only queue with players who are one division above or one division below your rank. So a silver can play with a gold ranked and bronze ranked and a plat player can play with a gold ranked and diamond ranked. It will be a bigger discrepancy in that regard at least.I can't recommend the game due to lack of content and devs not fixing the game enough. Their main focus as pointed out is to earn money by releasing new cases and skins. Seems to be their main focus. The community is like any other game people are really sensitive and report you for anything. If it's meant to be competitive then let the trashtalk be allowed to some extent without getting flagged for it. If they can talk smack to you then you should be able to return that favor no?,Rocket League®

Skiping this game is best thing you can actually do .EDIT3 This time im done with this game and crap community and crap system of report was 2v2 we were winning one from other team (enemy) rage quit 2v1 i score again and my mate (whoever the idiot kid was that i got with in team that match) he started to score own goal and to help other kid to win i didnt do anything to either of them i didnt curse etc he just did that without saying anything he started bump me and score own goal this game is a ing game due to this community full of stupid kids who all they can do is report without a reason flame from second 1 blame others for losing and so on.I'm done playing this game and i hope nobody else will pay for this game and waste time on it skip the game and go play something else before you will end up mad and off from a game which should be fun (games are made for fun ).I haven't seen a worse community in a game like in this toxic and full of kids one..!,Rocket League®

2018-02-23,0,0,177,False,Recommended,After two years playing this game (I bought it in December 2015) I can definitly say that this is a really fun game. Personally I don't really like football (Or Soccer if your from the United States) but Rocket League puts a fresh spin on the sport by taking it and making it fun by throwing in RC cars that can fly in the air as well as boost pads on the pitch.From playing this game Rocket League is a very fast paced game where matchs usually last for five mins (You can change this in the settings for offline matchs) of flying high in the air chasing the ball grabbing boost pads while crashing into everyone. It has 10 built in battle cars with additionl cars as paid DLC and from the crates. Each with their own customisable options such as paint jobs antennas wheels and boost trails with 24 stadiums that feature their own environments.Rocket League is a game worth coming back to again and again with lots or replay value to it that never ends thanks to the game's fun mechanics of car's flying around the stadiums at 200mph an hour.The only thing I personally dislike about this game is the anti aliasing. Biggest example is the goal post where up close it looks fine but far away it looks horrible and annoying. There are ways to fix this but for me it was ruining my FPS and I got my kicked in a lot of matchs because of it. Either its the game or I may need a new graphics card.Please note there are Microtransactions in this game however I don't consider that much of a biggie because it's more for cosmetic items which don't give you an advantage over anyone in the game. Apart from making your cars look more pretty.Overall though a fantastic game where it makes Football (Soccer) a hell of a lot better then the sport in real life where the biggest difference is that its more faster and entertaining.PROS AND CONSPROSVery fast gameplayAlot of fun mechanics to itMakes normal football look boringAlot of customisble options for your carsCONSBad anti Aliasing (It could be my graphics card though)Final Score 9.8/10I also did a video on this.

2018-02-23,0,0,1072,False,Recommended,Psyonix... Please fix your servers.. I've lost count of how many times I got disconnected from the match and the issue was exclusively on the server's side. The most infuriating part is getting banned because of it.The game is amazing but sometimes the servers are complete crap.,Rocket League®

2016-04-25,0,0,13,False,Recommended,rocket league is one of those unique origional games that you just dont know why people havent thought of it before now. 9/10 would hit a giant soccer ball again with tiny rocket cars.on another note this game is begging for a race mode maybe even mario kart style with tiny weapons mounted to the cars.. or just a racing mode &gt .&gt that would work,Rocket League®
2016-12-27,0,0,5,False,Recommended,A very Unique Game Indeed I'd reccommend this to everyone! What I did so far was put it on low quality and High Performance and BAM 95 FPS ON A LAPTOP!!! I'd reccommend this to my dogs if they were tall enough bipedal and were intellegent Best game on steam i've played in a year! (I had gmod on a different account about a year ago),Rocket League®

2016-03-05,0,0,9,False,Recommended,This is by far and away one of the best games that I've played in my lifetime mainly because it's a really unique concept that so far as I've seen has not been tapped into before.More than that the gaqmeplay itself kind of puts me in mind of the 'Car Football' challenges seen on a couple of episodes of the earlier series' of Top Gear UK as well as their 'Car Rugby' challenge that they did in Series 19 except we aren't playing with such cars as the Toyta Aygo the Volkswagen Fox the Kia Sportage or the Kia Cee'd.But and getting back to the game itself overall I'd say that Rocket League is a brilliant game and I highly reccommend that one does buy it.,Rocket League®

2018-04-23,0,0,79,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an awesome game to play by yourself or with friends. Once you get good it can be very fun but just having fun without skill is great too. I would reccomend finding someone to play with like an internet friend or real life friend because the teamwork aspect is great but I play by myself sometimes and it's just as fun!,Rocket League®

2018-02-22,0,0,388,False,Recommended,Coming up on 150 hours played and I can confidently say I will play much more. This game is extremely addicting especially if you like soccer and cars (like me). The other game modes featured are also very addicting which makes it easy to spend a lot of time in the game. Graphics are great music is great and it has no bugs that I have found. The best part is it is just $20 and it is $20 well spent.,Rocket League®
2017-05-07,0,0,506,False,Recommended,This is 100% the best game on the market. Completely worth every penny. I can't even describe the awesomeness without you seeing for yourself.,Rocket League®
2018-02-22,0,0,1399,False,Recommended,Worth every penny if you want to waste so much time of your life on it! A few hours learning how to move properly. 200 more hours to learn how to hit a ball. 200 more hours to fly. 200 more hours to learn how to hit a ball in the right direction. 200 more hours to learn how to fly and hit the ball in the right direction. Great game for hours of addicting and frustrating game play. One. More. Game!,Rocket League®
2018-02-22,0,0,307,False,Recommended,i liked the game I give it a recommendationat first you will struggle to control the ball but you will master it after doing a little bit of training.

2018-02-22,0,0,173,False,Recommended,One of my favorite games easy to get in to but hard to master. Different modes you can play in for a bunch of variation. Fun when playing online multiplayer but also fun playing on split screen with friends.,Rocket League®
2018-02-22,0,0,29,False,Recommended,this is a good game I wouldn't do unless you have a lot of steam firends and try and get a xbox controller it makes it much easier to play,Rocket League®
2018-03-07,0,0,171,False,Recommended,145 hours and I am still dreadful. This is one of the few games that feels like an actual sport and it has been fascinating to see how the way the game is played has evolved over the years. I doubt there are many left who have never played it but it is hands down one of the best video games ever.,Rocket League®

I love this game a lot but sadly its been dying recently and I hope I can trade my stuff over from xbox to pc when they bring out cross platform parties but I recommend this game a lot.,Rocket League®
