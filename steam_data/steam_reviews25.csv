2017-12-18,0,0,194,True,Not Recommended,a great game broke numerous records released as a standalone in a niche market and was a nominee for GOTY all sounds good right? well kinda. for starters the game runs horribly. you need to sell your arm and your leg to afford a rig to play this game. (and they are putting this on console???????????) there are numerous guides to fix this but even with all the graphical changes you still need a decent rig to run it. secondly the game is 20% skill 80% RNG. no matter how much you pray to RNJesus you'll still probably get killed by someone sitting in a bush 400 meters away while you run across an open field with your level 2 helmet and your m16 with no optics. On a more serious note bullets hardly register 8/10 times you'll end up missing your shot even tho you pointed right at him. and getting good loot is literally 100% up to RNJesus. thirdly the gameplay is C Tier at most. 90% of your time is running around 5% is getting loot and 5% is fighting with others. too much running around trying to get yourself the best loot possible only to die by someone you can't ing see. in conclusion I know this game is in Early Access but there are a thousand bugs and glitches that need to be fixed before fully releasing this game. (which if i'm not mistaking are planning on doing it soon???) I hope they iron out the clunkiness before even considering releasing it. This is a good game but I can't reccomend it right now. 6/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-31,0,0,503,False,Not Recommended,Game was always buggy/laggy which is to be expected in EA however it was still enjoyable and fun. In recent weeks the cheaters are OUT OF CONTROL. 9 of my last 12 games have had people using wall hacks aimbots speed hacks etc... Instant long range head shots wiping an entire squad pop up in the kill feed constantly. I play primarily TPP Squad and Duos on NA servers but I've experienced it in FPP as well. If you're on the fence about this game do yourself a favor and DON'T TOUCH IT until the dev's find a way to deal with the cheating.Edit Original review Oct 31 2017. Update April 19 2018.This game is absolute garbage now. Somehow it gets worse with each new patch. Latency issues every game. Gunplay is terrible. Cheaters still EVERYWHERE. Even free to play FPS games like Heroes and Generals have infinitely better control and responsiveness. Selling out and making crates and keys to drive your dying revenue was a terrible change and completely killed this game. Uninstalled.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-07,0,0,192,False,Recommended,Sadly the PUBG Team focused early on to milk the profit while their game was peeking as much as possible with keys and skins instead of keep fixing the game and keep improving it.

2018-02-11,0,0,233,False,Not Recommended,Might as well be considered a simulator at this point. Except the simulator is broken in some way for everyone everywhere. It's a friggin' great game in it's ability to transport you to an emotional high intensity environment. Alternatively you can choose to play slower and experience a different aspect to this game. They all converge into one at the end.This game has a way in which it makes you rage inside. Increases your anxiety levels inside and outside of the game as well. That's the case for me at least. Then it also has another power in which is creates layers of gratitude camaraderie distrust and perhaps more than a few broken peripherals for others.I can't honestly say this is a great game because it really is bare bones. What people say is correct. Certain aspects of this game were not conceived with much foresight. Your strategy is wholly dependent on so many holes in my opinion that are contradictory to what the intention is. It's just broken and so friggin' popular that it sucks even more because of it. Can't forget to mention their adding more things to buy at every opportunity but should honestly have the resources to fix the game at this point. If the pasta isn't quite al dente you sure as hell better be cooking it longer at that point.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-28,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,The game is very fun when you are able to play it and I mean when you are ABLE to. The game has an extremely frustrating and game breaking bug for many people myself included that causes you to be stuck looking at a seemingly infinite loading screen despite loading into a lobby and being able to hear everything going on. Only about once out of every ten games are playable because you load in before the plane comes. However from my experience playing it on xbox I can say that it is a good game it just needs this bug fixed fast. I have tried seemingly everything I could find online on how to fix this glitch to no avail and it seems this pattern isn't going to end anytime soon. As it stands I am going to continue playing Fortnite or anything else over this game because I can play those games every time I get on them rather than having to luck out and praying I load in before the plane.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-28,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,Clunky controls and horrible optimization.Feels like a ARMA 3 mod and not a multi million dollar game with several years of development,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-06,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,"First off I don't write a lot of reviews but I will for this game.The game its self is a great idea and its fun.1. CHEATERS!!!!!! This game is literally plagued with cheaters. They ban 42 000 accounts every day on average and are above 1.5 million bans already let that sink in! That's crazy!A friend and I played for 7 hours and almost every game we ran across a some dude cheating shooting through walls head shotting us from a mile out super jumping wall hacking and more its pointless to play thing expiting to win a match since it plagued with thousands and thousands of cheaters.Almost all the tumbs down on steam are from the same thing CHEATERS!.2. Reagion lockThe servers need to be region locked! I didn't know I had to learn every language in the world to play on a North American server.... With almost all the cheaters being foreigners ""out side the USA mainly china"" region locking the servers would help a lot and make is eaiser for them.I think releasing this on Xbox right now was stupid because they have way more work to do on PC they didn't even fix the main platform it was released on yet...... Now they have two communites yelling at them instead of one.I feel this game will sink and the fad will end because the DEV's are morons3. The gameThe game is great its a good idea even though its a rip off of an ARMA mod but that's besides the point. The graphics are good. Poly count could be reduced better optimization would be a plus shouldn't take a GTX 1070 with an i7 7700k to get 60+ FPS on 1080p with decent settings.I had to put a GTX 1080TI in my i7 7700k test bench to run it at 1440p 144hz with G SYNC.4. RecommendationWould I recommend this game? In its current state no I wouldn't If they fixed the massive cheater outbreak then yes I would but with 42 000 people getting banned everyday I cannot recommend this tittle at all. It is fun when you're in a game without a cheater its intense but unfortunately that doesnt happen very offten.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-15,0,0,506,False,Not Recommended,Made the BR genre big but now it is lagging behind as it fails to add enough new content.Also its still very poor performance.And that you can get loot a game that you payed for that requires you to pay extra to open is stupid.

Every update is a joke servers are lagging FPS is dropping people kill you behind walls because of desyncs the worse your connection is the better you gonna perform at this game because you're gonna lag on other's people screens and still are able to hit them while they can't. i have a 1080 Ti and Intel 8700K and still have FPS drops every game Desyncs and Crashes(can't reconnect to the game).

2018-07-18,1,1,1101,False,Not Recommended,i really like the concept and the game tbh but it is pretty much unplayable sometimes. Like the lag and desync make this game horrible. Examples you land on the ground around enemies then the guns wont render but the enemies guns do though and they just kill you becuase of the bugs in pubg and another example is you have to hit people twice as many times as they hit you for them to die usually becuase of the lag then when your running away if the other person is lagging you will be punished for it as well for example is that i was running i went inside a building a guy was shooting behind where i was running and he still hit me 30 feet behind me and killed me all becuase he was lagging. overall it is fun but prepaired to get tilted.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-08,0,0,79,True,Recommended,Its an early access game so manage your expectations for this game. That aside I have played H1Z1 King of the Kill and this game is the exact same premise. Drop in find equipment survive. Where it differs is in the exectution. There is more of a variety of weapons and attachments. Hit boxes and spray patterns seem to be a little more under control. There are still weapons that you need to get otherwise your pretty much screwed just like H1Z1 KOTK. All in all though at least this game added a little variety to their maps like rain or sunset or mid day. This game is like a next level KOTK and I love it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-09,0,0,95,False,Recommended,Many compare this game to Fortnite however in my opinion they are 2 very different games. Yes Battle Royale concept is there however PUBG is much less forgiving than Fortnite. Positioning in this game is key in Fortnite you can just build your way out of trouble. The feeling of being top 20 is very intense in this game very good late game. However the mid game in PUBG is basically running/driving simulator. Half of your games you will chase the circle/ look for people but find none. The problem is that majority of the people in a game are COD fanboys who drop to hotspot areas such as Hacienda and in the first 5 minutes of the game half the players are dead. This makes the player density quiet low in the mid game and can get boring unless. To get some action you have to drop in the same hotdrops as everyone else so the problem repeats. PUBG should fix this.Sound is absolute garbage in this game. VERY loud vehicles guns and bombs. I have to set my volume to low in order to avoid hearing loss. It's that bad. However that makes footsteps almost impossible to hear. They should fix that.VERY buggy UNOPTIMISEd piece of crap. 1 year old bugs still arent fixed. PLENTY of Chinese hackers. Developers do nothing to ban them. Overall i think this game is very much worth the price however developers seem to be incompetent to fix their game. GREAT concept and fun but poor execution.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now no matter how to update plug in assistance is still very rampant. The plug in assistant mode is to open the steam after running in the background. The general plug in assistant will be identified as a virus or malicious plug in by the computer housekeeper and 360. So I wonder if you can set up an automatic detection system to automatically detect the plug in assistant running in the background after each step is opened.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-20,0,0,107,True,Not Recommended,They say the M16 is one of the most accurate guns in the game combine it with an 8X scope and it's practically unusable. Zeroing in and out between 400 100 meters and the accuracy is so sporadic it's impossible to judge distance. I recently lined up a player who wasn't moving for 1+ minutes around 300 meters away and every single shot in my 30 round mag missed the target (left or right of where the scope was zeroed).There does seem to be a problem with aiming for the most part of this game it's nice the guns all act differently but the recoil of some of the weapons is out of this world.Armour is another thing that seems to be an issue with this game. In theory wearing a level 3 helmet means that you can take a headshot without dying. I don't think this is true at all. I've died multiple times with one headshot whilst wearing a level 3 helmet. Similar problems with body armour I can pummel someone that's wearing a level 1 set and take near a whole mag to kill them but someone can hit me 2/ 3 times with a standard rifle whilst wearing level 3 military armour and I'm dead immediately. Could be down to the constant lag this game suffers from as well who knows...Good idea for a game but at the moment it's still poorly executed. A lot needs to improve before it's fully released.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-14,0,0,217,False,Not Recommended,This is a very fun battle royale game. Simply put there is more emphasis on positioning and playing the circle more than actual aim. While this can be advatageous to players that take advantage of it the game itself can cause a player playing tactically to die. For example a player could be hiding in tall grass playing the circle but die because the grass has not rendered for another player further away making what you think is a conceiled position into you becoming a sitting duck for the picking. While some combat situations can be very entertaining the net code of the game is very subpar. Dying around corners becomes a recurring theme headshots or body shots for that manner not registering causing you to die. While this game is very enjoyable core gameplay is not up to par with other battle royale games which hurts the game severly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-25,0,0,819,False,Not Recommended,This game resembles a man born healthy and then had a stroke mid way through life. PUBG was a great game when I started playing it shortly after it came out. It was an amazing game and i spent hundreds of hours playing. Mid way through the game's life is when the stroke happened. I don't know if they just decided they didn't care about the game anymore or what but they ruined the game in my opinion. It is extremely unfun to play the game I used to look forward to playing every day. Movements feel clunky frames are not good for the graphics the servers are laggy the gunplay is very unsatisifying and it all around was simply much better before they tried to change things hastefully. For many many months you could not even choose if you wanted to play on the original forest map or the new desert map. This game was extremely promising but it killed itself. They also showed how low the PUBG Corporation is when they sued Fortnite they simply were jelous that Fortnite was doing so much better then they were while being free and a completely different game. Overall I would strongly recomend NOT getting this game in it's current state. Maybe in the future they can restore this game to its formal glory but I believe the damage was done and it might be too late to save this game with such great potential.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-17,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,The game was improved after 3 YEARS but few features are still bad.PROS + The most unique and serious battle royale concept + Large amount of playerbase + Gunplay is pretty dynamic and tactical. Winning gunfights is very satisfying + Gameplay is fun generally. You want play one more round often + Finally after bigger update I even can play on ultra graphic settings. Previous I played low medium settings. Performance and tick rate was improved a lot too...CONS ...but still you can experience crashing laggy moments/fps drops during early game because textures are still loading and broken hit reg by lags sometimes people can die by shooting surface or wall. Anticheat is cheap and dissapointing. Encountering cheaters isn't rarely. I saw many no recoil scripts or wallhacks even few aimbots too Developer of the game is just greedy. Yes they made bigger update and fixed many problems but microtransactions are more important over fixing the game Absurdly microtransactions and cashgrabing things. Paying real money for keys for lootboxes event passes(early access to new map/content and more stupid missions to get XP and clothing) increasing levels and...even changing name?!NEUTRAL + Graphic is just ugly bugged and cheap. In comparison to other game released in 2018 it's so ugly(look Hunt Showdown for example) but it helps a lot for performance. Blackout have a lot better graphic but works terrible.

This game looks so fun but its actually a piece of I am getting fed up with this game and the hype around it...The concept alone makes for lots of frustration 1 player or 1 squad out of 100 players will be victorious. Everyone else will waste up to 30 minutes of looting and running around trying to be careful and getting some kills just to die at some point and start over. What do you get from that? Battlepoints that dont do If you are happy with virtual jeans or an ugly baseballcap that randomly comes out of expensive lootboxes then go for it. At least you can sell those stupid crates to some other poor idiot or scamwebsite. There is no progress whatsoever no usefull rewards no beautiful graphics no interesting mechanics or smooth gameplay. Its just another mediocre egoshooter with a survivalgames mode slapped onto it.The graphics are mediocre the performance is bad the charactermovement feels sloppy slow the vaulting only works standing right in front of a wall touching it with your jumping feels like gravity is low. I mean who jumps as slow as that? Does this game want to be realistic or fun to play? Inventory management can take far to much time due to impractical mechanics. Driving cars or motorcycles is a pain especially on Miramar but without them you will die to the zone. There is so much random stuff to this game the loot the zones sliding to death on a hill and doing one hit kill frontflips on a motorcycle.. its more about luck than anything else. The maps are pretty mediocre aswell the houses are empty mostly the same ugly and dont make any sense. The zone forces you to move and people just camp ignoring the fact that they are gonna die there just so they can kill you. Solo doesn't allow any tactical gameplay as everyone wants to be a Rambo. After the latest updates it started crashing after almost every match leading to further crashes trying to start it again. Even the crash report window crashes. IAll of that would be somewhat ok considering the development time but I just dont get why people hype this game so much. I doubt its because it is fun. Its more like a peer pressure I think. ""Everyone plays it so it must be fun"". It costs 30 which could be worse but on the other hand most of my games had cost less and provided much more content and fun.And no fortnite and all the other out of nowhere battleroyale games aren't better either.Battleroyale is an awful concept. 99% of losers trying to be ""the very best like no one ever was"".Even ""Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy"" was less frustrating.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PUBG is in itself a very big name now since it is a fun and tactical game which requires a lot of teamwork and positioning other than the basic requirements like good aim reflexes callouts etc. On the pros 1. Makes you a better FPS player in general ik all games that require aim do but PUBG isnt as fast paced like csgo ow or as slow as an FPS mmorpg also you get multiple chances at any enemy and in squad you dont instantly die.2. If you are just relaxing then its fun af just land somewhere non crowdy do stupid stuff and get caught off guard then die. I mean its better than getting run over by a 5 man squad in a rush in r6 when you are trying to chill out 3. The graphics in its early access state it had poor unoptimized buggy and laggy gameplay but post its launch PUBG Corp has reworked the textures many times and now they are highly demanding and also pretty.4. Big Community so you can usually find a match within a minute heck my squad doesn't even like the 10 seconds it takes to find a match sometimes since its apparently ""too long"".5. Great Hitboxes. If someone yells ""I hit a headshot"" its either that he didnt or the server gave up on him there.6. + a lot more but i think its better if you find it out yourself since the ""surprise"" element always makes the first impression of a game worth remembering.Cons 1. Laggy af server atleast in SEA server the pings are inconsistent though they removed the server selection option recently i remember even earlier I used to get like 60ms to straight up 150ms pings ingame . During the plane jump you can literally see the huge desync as the plane warps back and forth when a lot of people jump together 2. Terrible Hitreg the hitboxes are excellent but sometimes even made shots dont register and your enemy walks as if he didnt get hit that is due to the incapable servers.3. Alt+Tab while searching for a match and you never return to it. Basically if you alt+tab or change windows while its searching for a match you aren't automatically connected to a match if its found your entire squad will be inside (whoever didnt alt tab) but not you. And if you dont return to the game window by the time the preparation timer hits 0 you can not connect back. I think this is an intentional feature but even so they should notify if a match is found with blinking icon in taskbar.4. Crashes a lot usually while connecting to a match.5. And the funny anti cheat it asks you if you want to enable it lmao.6. The terrain is buggy at times specially rocks sometimes I have got stuck in crevices inbetween rocks and my player model just stuck without being able to move aim crouch or even jump.That's i think it for the negative part but the game in its whole is fun and so are the chicken dinners on victory. Have Fun with your squad )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

D Sync is a big issue with this game. One that has never fully been fixed. With certain updates i have found the issue to be rare. But this most recent update has made it too much.

2018-04-26,0,0,307,False,Recommended,Be prepared to die. Unlike other FPSs You are constantly at risk of being shot from both close quarters combat and long range combat from multiple angles requireing a unique sort of hyper vigilence. The ever present sense of dread has made PUBG a streaming success but can make grinding the game extremely frustrating expecially if you're used to respawning in deathmatch or objective style FPS games. That said when you do get a win it makes it all the more sweet. Play with friends for the best experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-28,0,0,160,False,Recommended,So i doubt anyone who can change this will see this or care to respond but the most upsetting thing about this game right now through my eyes which I hope you don't take offense to is that i'm in the North American region and the majority of the people that I can speak to through game chat are from one of several Asian countries. This causes a problem because most of the majority don't speak English (I understand that Spanish and French are also North American languages). Sometimes I even find that the game has switched me over to the Asian region which irritates me because i have chosen the North American region several times and it still switches back everytime I restart the game. If someone does see this I enjoy playing this and fully recommend that anyone who has both the money and the power buys this. I understand that it has only just come out of Early Access and perhaps in the future this might have some fix if even possible. Thank you for your time anyone and everone who has read this and again I don't mean for this to be taken as a demand for some patch but more as me hoping you might consider what I've said.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The challenge to make it into the top 10 is a great proving ground but that sweet sweet chicken dinner is ever the true prize. I absolutely adore this game.I cannot recommend anyone to purchase it however in its current state. Cheating is omnipresent. The inclusion of a death cam while wonderful just proves how broken the playing field is. At the time of writing 6 of my last 8 deaths were due to obvious cheating.Additionally the sudden influx of pay to open loot chests is disheartening. I am sitting on around 10 unopened chests each costing 2.50 USD to open. These total almost the cost of the base game at time of purchase. This is greedy and shameful.To the developers I'd like to purchase keys at a reasonable price and I'd like to change this to a postive review after better anti cheating measures are put in place.

DUH IT'S EARLY ACCESS MORONS C'MON and still it's the most played game of 2017 for a reason.About the price I'm perfectly fine with it people wants it to be cheap just because it's an independent company I preferr to pay 39.99 for the must fun game in years to an independent or new company than 79.99 for a AAA game from XXX big company that I will only play for a few hours shame on you people should support other people trying to create great things and PUBG is a great game.50% of people complaning is because they thought they could play this game like it's call of duty or BF wich clearly isn't it's a totally different experience from any other shooter I have ever played (I have not played them all if you try to be a smartass) and the other 50% bought it waiting for a finished game that clearly says EARLY ACCESS.Don't think about it hop into PUBG play at least 10 matches I think the initial learning curve is about that 10 15 matches searching for youtube tutorials is a must I have seen 2 or 3 10 minutes long thats it.

A ton of hackers still and holes in the desert map when 1.0 has been out for what two months now? That's ridiculous. And don't even get me started with lag. I don't know what it could possibly be but it's not like my computer is a complete potato with a GTX 970 an Intel i5 4690 at 3.5 Gigahertz and 8 gigs of ram and my interent isn't terrible at 100 mbps yet whenever I get remotely close to anyone in the game that isn't from America *Cough Cough please region lock China Cough Cough why are they even playing on North America servers Cough Cough* my game might as well crash because I will freeze consistantly for a solid 30 seconds and then once it unfreezes I find that I am dead. Don't even get me started about how long it takes for me to load into the matches either though that is mainly a problem with my Seagate HDD than enything else. But don't get me wrong though I do like the game. Before 1.0 I had almost none of the problems that I have mentioned above exception to loading into the match that was still a stupid amount of time and that was when I was still running on a 20 mbps internet. I enjoy the game and I have put many hours into it but I have founf it really unenjoyable lately because of the hackers no region lock and the unbelievable amount of lag.

It's a lovely game when it delivers. I live on the side of the fence with players who never have a smooth game experience. From rubberbanding to full out disconnection you would believe it if someone said they were using 56k to play.Now this boils the game down to usually one of two experiences overall. The game works you play it regularly and it provides as much joy as the amount of effort you put into it.Or you get 1/10 games where your death didn't feel like it was based on technical issues.Popular players generally sit on the luck side of gameplay . However if you watch a PUBG streamer for long even they fall prey to this poorly optimized game.It's truly a sad thing as well. This concept for a game is magnificent. Truly there has been nothing like it before. Had the developers stayed the course and not let the dollar signs misdirect them this would be a game hailed as the next genre of FPS gaming. Instead what you get is an upset and toxic community hit or miss copycats and ridiculous moments like the pan lawsuit.PUBG should've been a step forward for the next generation. A new Counter Strike centered around intense strategy and precision skill. Instead we got a jumbled mess that has split the gaming community into a faceted wasteland for the time being.That all being said at least it's not Fallout 76.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-15,4,1,153,False,Not Recommended,Still as sh*tty as ever. They haven't even fixed what's wrong with the game the crappy movement autistic aiming and little sweaty kids pixel peeking you from halfway across the map but you don't even have a clue where they are because the sound literally just rapes your ears instead of giving you an idea of where they're at. You try to pick things up and you're literally SPAMMING the interact button but nothing happens so you're forced to drag it into your inventory which is a pain in the at the start of the game if you landed beside a dumb little squeeker who manages to pick up the Micro Uzi before you. AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE MELEE. I CAN'T STAND WHEN THOSE DUMB LITTLE CHASE YOU AROUND THE MAP AT THE START TRYING TO PUNCH YOU OUT AND YOU LITERALLY CAN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK ANYTHING UP WITHOUT HAVING TO DRAG AND DROP. See how it's all connected? Instead of fixing the autistic controls and all that jazz they're adding in more cruddy maps and updating the menu that literally plays a new song every time I play the game. Not to mention the cases who thought it'd be a good idea to release lootboxes into a game where you can barely even tell whether you're fighting a man or a woman as you can rarely see who's shooting at you? And if you do manage to spot them you probably won't even be able to make out more than a few details because your settings are turned down to very low otherwise you'll suffer immense frame rate drops and lag because you need a beast PC to run this poorly optimized game. I see a lot of people complaining about hackers but really I've never run into one. The game is legit just GARBAGE and if I'm honest I don't think it'll ever be good. For all you kids who are about to go into the comments and say about how it's supposed to be realistic this game is far from it. Hell I think I'd rather 1v1 someone in real life than in this game I'd probably have a better chance of being able to spot them shoot at them and run away if need be without accidentally jumping past my cover or some crap. This game is just AWFUL and it's not a surprise that way less people are playing it now. It's just so goddamn boring and autistic. Sad part is they could have fixed it all SOOOOO easily when it first came out. But they just kept rushing to fix the minor bugs and focused too much on advertising the game so they could make more money rather than actually making it fun and easy to play without camping on the edge of zone with a Kar98k and an 8x scope. I'd rather play Minecraft hunger games than this waste of money. I'd rather play FORTNITE than this game and I hate that game too.

This game used to be good.The problem is they haven't bothered to fix the fundamental issues and I can't really recommend this over the competition anymore. At this point I play it sometimes because I already own it that's it. Instead of fixing issues they spend time releasing new maps making pointless events and trying to run tournaments on a game that just isn't an e sport. They got blinded by greed and lost sight of what this game was supposed to be.Look the game itself is alright. The problem is that the competition caught up and the competition is free. PUBG would rather litigate the competition than actually make a better game. That's a problem.If you own this game you don't need to read this review.

2017-08-13,0,0,101,False,Not Recommended,bluehole just stop mucking around please FIX PUBG was so promising and it fell apart.REVIEW UPDATE (changed to negative) While the performace of the game has increased considerably since early access and desnyc problems are encountered much less often Bluehole (or rather PUBG Corp.) have really started taking a dump on the game's community. I find selling a 10 event pass for a game I already paid 30 for completely unacceptable. I would understand this situation if the game were cheaper (like CS GO) or if the proceeds from the event pass went on to fund PUBG e sports (even though I believe the game not to be a very good e sport) I'd support the idea. But so far it seems a complete copy of features from competing games and a you to the players because the rewards from the events are negligible.Furthermore they still haven't fulfilled some of their promises they made at the start of 2018 namely we still have not received limb penetration and there is still no firing range. Considering the fact that the mobile version already has received a firing range makes me wonder if the PUBG dev team consists of 95% artists. The need for firing range is immense beacuse gunfights are sparse and PUBG firing mechanics are difficult to master. At this point if you really want to learn to shoot your only option is to land in a highly populated area or just play a lot.Sanhok is pretty good though.btw I also got permabanned twice for nothing (they said it was cheating though) but I got unbanned but they really only acknowledged and gave reimbursements out for the very last case of false positives which kinda made me salty /shruganyway bluehole pls start listening to the community tnxORIGINAL REVIEW The game is suffering some optimization issues as is the case with most early access survival games. Right now I am hovering around 60fps with i7 6700k &amp GTX 1060 1440p and Very Low everything except Ultra textures and Low view distance.The recently introduced first person only mode is extremely fun and much more challenging as the third person mode because you can not look behind cover without exposing yourself which in my opinion makes the game much more fair.Playing solo is not really my cup of tea but if playing with friends the game can be a blast team vs. team firefights are much more engaging stupid can happen for a cheap laugh and the teamwork is highly rewarding.I really hope the game gets optimized better further down the line I understand that it is not an easy task however it's an important one. While I haven't experienced them myself yet there are several game breaking bugs in the game too like buildings not loading in.As for the microtransactions yes the developer broke their promise but they really don't bother me because it's purely cosmetic so idgaf._also don't use vehicles' horn or you might get banned for stream sniping lol_,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-17,4294967295,2,200,True,Recommended,"Hello soldier This game is made by the same guy who did the Battle Royale mod for Arma 2 and 3 (to my knowledge). In its current state (early access) it is a WONDERFUL middle ground between Arma 3 BR realism and H1Z1 arcade. The game isn't too arcade y but isn't slow either. Truthfully I've never played H1Z1 but have many friends that I've watched play it. After two hours I could see myself enjoying this more than Arma 3 BR and Ark Survival of the fittest.I find this game to be very accessible and easy to understand right away from the gameplay mechanics to the ui and etc. It reminds me of editing in Sony Vegas compared to Premiere Pro Vegas can do all the same stuff (almost) but is WAY more accessible and easy to understand to someone starting out. An example would be the tiers of weapons and gear is including the title of the weapons. ""Oh this backpack is lv.3 I should clearly upgrade from my lv.1"".I see people complaining about bugs and optimization (for an early access game btw). I Personally in 7 hours have only had ONE issue fps drops 1 in 7 games to 15fps for 3 seconds when I first deploy out of the plane. Then back up to 60+ right away. I'm NOT saying bugs and optimization issues don't exist I just havent really encountered any. BUT you have to realize....this game runs on the ARMA 3 engine. Have you ever played Arma2 or 3? THAT CRAP AIN'T OPTIMIZED (as much as I love those games). I get WAY better fps in this game compared to BR in Arma 3.This Dev has never given me any reason not to trust them and I'm pretty picky about my purchases of early access games and pre orders (insert unending list of bad devs with pre order rewards and unfinished EA titles).Short Version This game is great solo or with friends. Bugs and optimization issues exist just not for everyone like myself. I don't think its right to down vote a game in early access when they're releasing patches regularly and tbh it deserves a recommendation even in its current state. Its much faster paced than Arma 3 BR but not nearly as realistic. Its slower than H1Z1 but way more realistic. Its a beautiful middleground between the two. They valued FUN over realism. They promote INTELLECT and STRATEGY in this game.Driving mechanics are on point too.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've uninstalled this game was worth my money cause of the hours I've put into the game but if you are willing to put hours apon hours apon hours into a game to get 1 golden game where you can enjoy the content with a friend then its worth it for you otherwise turn yourself around and go get something you can get better value for money like a ball in a cup.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-23,0,0,707,True,Recommended,Heartbeats per second is inversely proportional to number of players.The BEST Serious Battle Royale Experience.GameplayThe gameplay is fun engaging but sometimes boring if you drop onto less common spots. My style? I mostly land in a high risk high reward spot like School and Prison. Either I die or I get a ton of high tier loot. I go for drops as well. Game's never boring for me. Optimization &amp GraphicsTo be honest it's not as bad as people say. My main rig with an i3 6100 RX 480 8GB 16GB 2133MHz DDR4 RAM plays the game smoothly (70+FPS) on 1080p Full HD Ultra Textures Ultra AA 120% Resolution Scale Rest at lowest.If you think that's high end by any standards my brother's PC Build with an i5 2500K (No OC) 8GB 1333MHz RAM GTX 1050 Ti 4GB runs the game at a solid 50 60 FPS on the same settings but with 105% Resolution Scale and on Full HD Downscaled to 900p (The monitor is 900p). Onto the Graphics. They're not very good considering the game's performance. But on Medium Post Processing Shadows and other settings turned a bit up the game does look decent. But those settings give me a CPU Bottleneck hence I put them on lowest.After adjusting settings in Radeon Settings (+20 Contrast 15 Brightness +50 Saturation) the game looks way better than vanilla. ReShade doesn't work properly for me and this is a great alternative. I have done the same on my brother's PC through NVIDIA Control Panel.Anti Cheating System and Reporting SystemI have over 300hrs on this game and have encountered very low cheaters. If you do get a cheater/hacker in your game he will be banned. Just record the game and post the video on forums if you'd like to speed up that process. Oh and it uses BattleEye which does Hardware ID Ban this means if they buy PUBG again on a new account they'll instantly get banned again even if they do not have their cheats on.The development team is active in banning players and they will respond to you on the forums if you get team killed intentionally. Make sure you have adequate proof I record all my games using Radeon ReLive.ConclusionIn conclusion For an early access game PUBG is very decent. I have high hopes for this game and believe it won't end up like DayZ or those other games which never got out of Early Access. Comparision to Fortnite? Fortnite's way more casual &amp random than PUBG. Just play whatever you prefer.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-20,0,0,253,True,Recommended,"One of my favourite games of recent. For those of you who have only tried a couple games I highly recommend playing Duo or Squad with people you actually know. Solo can be fun once you get more skilled at the game but early on it's going to feel impossible to win. As I have found I played my first couple games on Solo when I first got the game and I'd do really well until the player count is sub 30 which is when I start getting steamrolled. It's a safe assumption that the less people alive there are the better the players that you encounter will be. Once I started playing with some friends not only did the game feel easier but it became more fun as well. In my eyes there are four stages of the game. The first stage is when you have just barely landed seen a few people but not much else. At this point you wouldn't care if you died because you don't have much.The second stage is after you've landed you've got a bit of gear a shotgun or so but even if you died you still wouldn't care that much (70 80 left)The third stage is when you're pretty kitted out. High level backpack vest helmet etc. and a few good guns. At this point you wouldn't be angry if you died but kind of disappointed. (30 40 left)The final stage is after you've gotten a care package or two you've got the max weapons and gear and you'd be pretty if you died at this point (1 10 left) Unless of course you're like me and you get no matter when you die.In the almost 3(1/2) playtime I've played this for I've never gotten myself a chicken dinner but I've come in fourth twice and tenth once. (Unless you count duo in which I came second thrice). I know I didn't really ""review"" the game but after all of that I'd like to say I absolutely love this game and highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys Battle Royale games like H1Z1 KOTH.Just think of this game as Hunger Games... with guns... and 100 people.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But if reported repeatedly... then that's another issue.Gameplaywise this is a fun game.. very fun and exciting game. Best enjoyed and less rewarding (with BP) when played with friends. Either you like to run to hide or to go outfrond in a shooting outbreak this game has to offer all flavours without defining one as the absolute approach. It also redefines early access. Everything is working /responding fine appart maybe from the graphics tuning that has still some work to be done.I certainly recomend this game since it combines good features from different titles. It is a tactical sim some times without being too tiring and it is an arcade shooter some other. Try it feel it and I assure you that after some games you will have some nice action scenes to describe to your friends back home.

It takes ages to update and none of them are performance upgrades or FPS optimization they add new weapons car horns maps and the game continues to be laggy. They're suing another great title just because they added a battle royale mode to their game.

The game gets it right in so many ways it feels realistic challenging and every time you jump out of the airplane you know that this game is not gonna be anything like the previous 200+. These are the main reasons why I have been palying the game but sadly I find myself spending less and less time in it.This is mainly due to the game being horribly optimized and completly buggy it can truely make you lose the feeling for the game.. Just small things like doors that doesn't open when you really need it or a gun that you can't pick up in the middle of a hot gun fight. I could go on about buggs servers being laggy ect. But another more critical concern is that the performance in the game has been dropping significant in recent pathces I own a GTX 1060 6 gb the so called perfect card for PUBG and when i startet playing there were no trouble staying around the 100+ fps and now I dip below 60 in gunfights. It makes it very fustrating to love this game and I don't see myself keep loving it if the developers does'nt fix the main issues of this game I am not a programmer and I don't know how to fix it but I will surely not recommend anyone to buy this game until it is fixed.

2017-09-30,0,0,688,False,Not Recommended,wow.........a great game sabatoged by greed. STILL hackers in many games blatant hacks.

2017-06-06,1,2,272,True,Not Recommended,I can't give this game a recommendation anymore. Theres a few things wrong with it and everything wrong is mainly on the developers side. 1. CheatersTheres tons of cheaters in this game they'll beeline right at you and insta kill you with the weakest of guns or even just teleport right besides you. PUBG team is doing nothing about the cheating situation. They've banned less than .1% of the games population off of cheating when its clearly well above that. (A ban wave that recently came through banned over 40% of the games population off over 800 000 players in the spam of 10/20 27/17. Players just repurchased the game and are now rage hacking and arn't getting banned once again.) They are allowing blatant livestreamers the ability to cheat and its dead obvious that the developers are supporting this behavior. 2. Catering to LiveStreamers by caving to every whim. Its DISGUSTING how bad PUBG caters to livestreamers. If a Livestreamer thinks you stream sniped them Ban (No evidence needed). Once you're a popular livestreamer they give you whatever you want You can cheat freely call others cheaters/ Stream snipers and get them banned with no evidence. 3. Making Rules that only cater to livestreamersRead their own site all the rules they made cater to live streamers. Rules such as.No Stream SnipingNo TeamKilling (Only reportable by Live Stream Video)No Swearing (To protect livestream footage)No Bad Names (To protect Livestream footage)No Following/Stalking players (To protect livestreamers)No Impersonating (To protect livesteamers)No Sharing Information (To Protect livestreamers ID's)No Spamming VOIP (So livestreams are less noisey)No Cheating (To protect livestreamers from cheaters unless the livestreamer is the cheater)No Teaming (Dont gang up on livestreamers or they'll ban everyone involved)No Abusing Exploits (To protect streamers but also they allow streamers to glitch and exploit)4. Censoring the ForumsRemoving posts that critize the same ask for something to be done about the cheaters pointing out livestreamers are cheating pointing out huge flaws in the rules or anything that allows players to discuss or be involved in updating the game. This game is purely catered to livestreamers and they dont want to hear anything from the community unless you stream.5. Micro TransationsLike this game is now Free 2 play Where we have to buy our loot crates with real life money all of a sudden and pay 2.50$ to open each one up. Like WTF!!!! I paid for the game now you're making me pay EVEN more money to unlock content that I had to GRIND MY BUTT OFF FOR!!!MAKE THE GAME FREE TO PLAY THEN IF YOU WANT THAT!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,1,2,550,False,Not Recommended,"I'd really like to love this game but the dev's don't allow it. The game feels worse than it was in early access. Don't get me wrong... they did a ""good"" job with the optimization and performance issues even tho' there are still a lot out there like random places with huge laggs whenever you walk across them. I'm talking about hit reg and server performance. Don't you hate those kind of situations when you are getting shot at you quickly hide behind a wall and get killed there eventho' the guy that was shooting at you shouldn't be able to hit you there? It's called desynchronisation. For that guy the game shows you are still running to that wall to hide when he finnished you off. It usually happens in every other game once or twice but in PUBG It's so common you'll be surprised if it's not the reason of your death. The hit reg is just dumb. Don't trust any blood that you see when you hit your enemy It could be a big lie. Also an example If you headshot someone with a kar98 who's wearing a level 2 helmet ( which should be a kill according to PUBG gamewiki Level 2 112.50 damage ) just doesn't work sometimes.Game updates feel like a pacifier to our mouth just to not cry yet some still do which is absolutely okay and understandable. If I'd like you to not buy this game I would write a huge paragraph here about the bugs that this game has.TL DR Gameplay feels really bad. Server issues lack of hit reg are a common thing. Optimization is still a problem yet it's better than it was a few months ago. Updates are mostly really minor eventho' there are a lot to fix.

No not exactly. To put it more accurately the game has gone from being a turd to polished turd.Let me lay it out for you if you don t know about the game already.One game you will drop out of the plane into the military base only for the blue death circle to follow you at every closing never touching you while you sit on top of a hill and snipe the unfortunate players that have to cross an open field to survive. The next game you will drop in a large school before everyone else luckily but alas there are no guns on the area of the roof you landed at you are forced to look inside the school. After two rooms and no weapons you get shot by someone who just recently found a shotgun and had the time to load a single shell.Hey if you're one to follow trends this game is for you. But this software is not exactly a game it's more of a gambling simulation. Sure you can become very good a putting the coin in pulling the lever and collecting your prize but that's all you're really improving at in the end the mechanisms that involve gambling (in this case not for money instead your time). Not to mention that the game recently came out of early access and still crashes rather often there is no way to opt into a region lock and the netcode goes from 2hz to 20hz within a frame during the early stages of play . Not to say that these problems will be inevitably fixed just a little side note.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Dislikes They had this 3rd person view problem. But recently updates have resolved the issue. The new option to go into a 1st person view only server. This creates an experience as real to Battle Royal as one can currently be. I guess some genuine dislikes are that the optimizations setting had to be manually entered. I was running around asking for launch codes. Like that chineese spy in blond wig spy on American dad. You know what I m talking about. I have to run everything in administrator mode to get it to launch.

Lag at the beginning of rounds that makes it difficult to pick up a gun and be ready to fight another issue that doesn't affect fortniteOverall terrible performance on every level of PC where frames are never stable the game is always choppy and lag spikes all the time. Issues that don't affect FortniteThe skins on the event pass are laughably terrible compared to the fortnite cosmetics. Fortnite had a 100 tier battle pass with unique cosmetics that fit the theme of the game PUBG responds with an equally priced cartoonish event pass with terrible and ugly cosmetics that arent even on theme with pubg as a hardcore tactical military game. Banning your most popular streamer for screwing around with hackers who clearly weren't stopped by your anti cheat auto ban mechanics you bragged about developing a while back. You claim your game went 1.0 at Christmas and 7 months later it still is broken and feels much further behind in development than fortnite.

2017-03-24,0,0,374,True,Recommended,"Now I understand a lot of people are not happy with the optimization in its current form. In my opionon this game needs work on the optimization but that is just part of the process of a early access game. I have had so much fun so far that I needed to write this. I have NOT won a single game nor even come close xD But thats what makes it so fun! The fact that every time you play it is almost always different in every way. I enjoy this game because it brings the best of KOTK and Arma KOTH and mashes them up and brings us one of the best BR style games I have played. I just believe that having the right updates as fast as possible i.e the optimizations will need to happen soon ish as it does become tiresome playing on low medium graphics when I know that I should be able to run on High ultra settings. (Edit) So it seems a boat load of players are getting banned for ""stream sniping"" now while 60% of the time that might be true I have noticed people saying that they have killed a streamer without realising only to find out they have been banned because of the streamers notoriety and they ""feel"" someone was stream sniping. Until this issue is solved somehow I do feel people are going to steer away from PUBG and there does need to be a decent system in place for this.I however have encountered a streamer and appear to be quite lucky with not getting banned for stream sniping/at least accused of it. This game needs optimization and it needs it ASAP this game in its current state with DSYNC and general FPS state (I have a high tier PC) it won't last or be able to compete with other games that come out.Please sort some things out.

2017-03-25,0,0,78,True,Recommended,Pros 1. Combat It's intense Arma/Dayz ish in its tone...which I happen to like as someone who has a good amount of time in Dayz Standalone. Although it's snappier than those games mentioned above which is a huge plus. Weapon variants range from melee to handguns shotguns assault rifles to sniper rifles...with grenades as an extra. Armor can be found as well and looting up takes anywhere from 5 10 minutes depending on first dropping in luck with the area you and or your team chooses to start in. Oh and vehicles which can be used as another weapon in itself or a quick way to get somewhere is a fun thing to experience. Playing as solo or duos with another or squad with up to 5...plenty of options there. The heart adrenaline rush of Arma and Dayz style combat is there to be found in this game here.2. Developer The guy behind this game has experience in this game style as his past with Arma and H1Z1 has been talked about in forums and reddit threads I have come across. Also I can tell this game is going to outpace the competition. Already feels like a more complete game in early alpha than compared to those that have been out for years. They are already talking about optimization passes early on tells me they have their priorities in line before adding more stuff that should be added later. Neutral 1. Optimization The developer has already stated that optimization passes would start soon 5 weeks or so. The game doesn't run bad for me on (HIGH) preset 1440p with (shadows on medium) (AA on medium) (textures on medium) 4gb of vram here as I have an R9 Fury feel free to bump that up if you have more than 4gb of vram. That being said the game currently uses more vram than is needed and the developer is aware of this meaning those with 4gb or less will get better performance going forward. I get a snappy and smooth 40 50 fps average with my setup on the setting I listed above. I have an R7 1700 3.7ghz with a R9 Fury for example. That being said the game looks fine if you ran it all on medium. For those chasing higher fps averages this is a viable option. People that have weaker rigs will cry upgrade I guess if you play a lot of early access games...Cons 1. I knew what to expect going in it's early access. Price could be $5 bucks cheaper however. I am having fun an absolute blast to be honest...so the money I spent eh whatever. It's going to be subjective to people when it comes to spending on early access titles. To each their own...Score 8/10 for me this early on!FROM THE DEVELOPER Players Today is a very special day for me! For the last four years ever since I launched my first Battle Royale game mode using the DayZ mod on Arma 2 I have worked hard to try deliver an intense dynamic and fun experience. Through its various iterations in the ARMA series H1Z1 and now in my own standalone game you all have shown me tremendous support and for that I want to say a sincere thank you. I now want to run through a timeline for optimization of our game. A lot of you have been asking about how and when we will optimize the game so hopefully this post will give you a better idea of our plans over the coming months.One important thing to note. Client optimization takes time and will not be solved in one single patch. We will be working hard over the next 6 months to ensure all players enjoy smooth gameplay with no lag or FPS drops.Initial Performance Improvements Key Objectives To reduce the overload on the CPU and make sure that the GPU performs to its full capabilityExpected Results Frame rates will be stable even when in high density areas Get higher frame rates across all graphic optionsETA Apr. 14th (Expected to take roughly 5 weeks),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-25,0,0,307,True,Recommended,Wow one of the best early access games I've tried so far. This is very good refreshing compared to H1Z1. Although there are some framerate issues here and there at some spots of the map I'm sure future patch will enhance the game so much more. I feel like there is a lack of ambiant audio though you can stand outside in the middle of the woods and it'll be total silence. It takes away from the immersion and makes it too easy to detect sneaking enemies. The sounds that are there though are really well done you can really feel the gunshot reverbs every bullet you fire. Hopefully with time additional audio post processing fx will make this game more immersive. Gameplay wise it is very well thought out. I don't really like the original control scheme though luckily there is key rebind options. The hit reg seems really well done even at extreme ranges. Only game breaking aspect I would say are the melee weapons there is a good variety of them but with the game's netcode at the moment it is impossible to hit a moving enemy.All in all a great investment. Hopefully the devs are active with the community and they keep on updating the game regularily.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not that there needs to be a complete tutorial/training module but it would be nice have some aspects of the game explained. Like I said right now it's early access.

2017-10-24,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,Imagine this.. You've looted dozens of houses you've killed a couple other players trekked across half the map and made it to the top twenty top ten whatever. You've got the best weapons plenty of ammo and lots of health. You're in good cover. You've spent the last half hour preparing for this moment. All of a sudden you hear a bang and.. you're dead. That is this game in a nutshell.I've been playing FPS games for many years. Consistently in or around top 10 when playing PUBG. Not boasting just saying I m not new to the genre.The game just gets old very fast. There is very little back and forth crossfire. For the most part it's running around looting catching someone off guard and shooting them then someone does the same to you. It's not like other game types infiltration capture the flag etc. You don't have that fun of trading shots back and forth with the other team.The occasional win is nice. But after the 100th time being shot in the back and instantly killed from some player you never saw its boring. We want action. We want to fight against our enemy. We don t want to walk into a room and instantly be killed by someone hiding in the corner with a shotgun.Trying to be realistic the game loses its fun . It may be more realistic to die in a one or two shots but it's not as fun.Also the recoil on the guns is absurd. As having shot and own many of the guns in the game the recoil is not that ridiculous in real life. Especially in crouched or prone. It seems as though the game exaggerates the recoil to incentivize collecting accessories for the gun which lower the recoil. In real life adding some random attachment to your gun does not make that much of a difference.Every once in awhile you get a good match. Plenty of crossfire. Trading shots back and forth. Maybe pull off a win. But most of the time it's being shot in the back or killed by some random person you never saw. It just isn t as fun as so many other FPS out there.The game itself runs fine. Graphics are good the sound is good everything is pretty good. Of course there are some bugs but that is to be expected in early access. The game is fine its just not fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-22,0,0,112,False,Not Recommended,I will focus mainly on the negative side of things. It is important to know everything that is wrong with the game and where it looks like it's headed before you spend $30 on what is certainly not living up to the hype.The PUBG phenomenon has declined into utter chaos. It's an excellent example of why you should avoid picking up Early Access games even when they are hyped to sanctitude by streamers and probably even your friends. I could elaborate on how great PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds once was but ultimately the objective of a good Steam review is to inform you of the game in its current state. Since release the developers have added cosmetic microtransactions. For some people this may be an issue but one must note that realistically there is no advantage especially when some of these items will make you stand out like a sore thumb. The PUBG map is best described as a combination of forests prairies and towns which range from suburban to very small rural outposts. Make no mistake ghillie suits are a rare in match drop that are only obtainable through capturing an airdrop. The gameplay is clunky and unsatisfactory to say the least. Oftentimes in CQC it comes down to who has the itchiest trigger finger and remembered to set their gun to burst/automatic. The combat is reminiscient of DayZ standalone/Arma2. Parachute control is horrendous.tl dr Right now the game is going through a very rocky stage. I hate to suggest it but I'm growing more and more concerned because PUBG is shaping up to be an extravagent cash grab. I have my reservations about the game and I will not be surprised if PUBG crashes and burns with Bluehole never to be heard from again. I'd recommend staving off the urge to pick this up for now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-20,0,0,177,True,Recommended,I feel like this game get's more hate then it deserves. I've seen countless negative reviews regarding the paid cosmetics and how the developer said they wouldn't add them and they did. No I don't think they shoul have broken their promise. But if you don't want to pay for cosmetics DON'T BUY THEM. Nobody is forcing you to purchase them and there is still free cosmetics earned through playing the game. It isn't a huge deal and this game doesn't deserve hundreds of negative reviews because of it. Another common issue is bugs and lag. While I have had a few bugs (Usually in vehicles such as hitting something invisible) most have been minor and I've seen very few. for the most part my game is smooth with no bugs and only the vary rare fram drop. I have an i7 4790k and a GTX 970 so my computer is not top of the line but no slouch either. But my friend has the same experience as I with an i5 and GTX 950 so it isn't that bad. This is also an early access game. Hate bugs? Wait until full release. I've really enjoyed this game so far and I plan on many more hours in it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-18,0,0,454,True,Recommended,UPDATE Don't listen to people downvoting for microtransactions they are purely cosmetic it hasn't hindered them working on the game at all and the money goes towards improving the community around the game through tournament pools.Nothing gets your heart pounding like this game.

It won't be for everyone but if you enjoy the process of looting and the quick thinking at everystep it will quickly become one of your favorite games of all time.Devs are doing a great job of listening to the community and updating frequently. The first person needs a bit of work but the devs are creating first person only servers which has been largely demanded by the community.

2017-05-16,0,0,368,True,Recommended,DID DAYZ SEEM LIKE AN APPEALING GAME TO YOU?! Until you actually played it ran around in the woods for 4 goddamn hours only to find a fire axe a hat and then die of dehydration? The following day did you try again only to get killed in 20 minutes by buggy zombies that teleport through walls and punch you from 10 meters away? A month later were you determined to have a good time join a less populated server finally get a gun and some decent gear and excitedly run toward a town to find better stuff only to get sniped while running across a field by some dude half a kilometer away?Well boy do I have the game for you. Its called Playerunknown's Battlegrounds and the entire game boils down the fun parts of Dayz into little bite sized nuggets of fun. 100 players are dropped on an island from a plane scavenge for weapons and gear and then are forced into a perpetually shrinking safe zone until one person remains alive. Its basically Battle Royale the videogame only not as as other games that follow a similar formula. Weapons are abundant and since the safe zone is constantly shrinking and you have to fear being killed by the gas that damages you outside of the safe zone each match forces you into confrontations with other players. Another consequence of the shrinking safe zone is that matches don't tend to drag on for a painful length of time. The longest game I played was my first game where I came in 2nd place and the match lasted around 45 minutes. A usual match for me puts me somewhere in the top 40 or 30 players and lasts around 20 minutes. Then I'm back in the lobby queued up for another game in which I will again play terribly.Essentially this game is all of the fun parts of this current trend of difficult survival/scavenging shooty games without any of the tedium and frustration that plagues the genre and I can't get enough of it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Annoying door mechanics movement feels strange because it has acceleration and gun mechanics are good.(*unlike Fortnite where if you use a rifle your bullets will NOT go to the center dot even if you haven't fired yet. This pleases the people who aren't good at shooters*)NET CODE NEEDS WORK. My god I hope they get it right by full release but I doubt it. My PC runs it steady 60 FPS so it's not the problem. Try opening a door then have fun waiting half a second for it to open after keypress. Have fun as loot loads in slowly for first 30 seconds and watch as someone else finds a gun and takes you out in the early 1v1.Sound mechanics are cool bullet sounds and rifle sounds are heard at different times depending on distance. Grenades make me poop myself. 10/10 would poop again from loud grenade. Plane sound still too loud when in the plane. Buggy(vehicle) sound too loud when riding it. Spoopy 10/10 fog levels yes. Rain is fun too. When being sniped in the sun I wish deeply for fog to come but weather doesn't change mid game which is fine by me.Mainly I am pleased by the gun mechanics which is my biggest issue with shooters if they get it wrong.

2017-08-19,0,0,365,True,Not Recommended,This game is inherently flawed. I have some room to talk on this matter due to my 200+ hours in the game. Yes it is fun at times but no I will not recommend this game to anyone in its current state. First I would like to question Blueholes motives on having a 300k tournament whilst the game is still far from being complete. Instead of their focus being on the tournament and adding new cosmetic items it should be on actually finishing and polishing their game. I can tell you that in its current state this game is not tournament ready. It frustrates me that Bluehole can't seem to fix problems that the game has had for months now or they fix an issue and a few patches later the same issue comes back. Hit registration d sync and servers flat out failing should be their biggest concern at the moment.At times yes this game is fun. Those fun moments usually come at the end of a game 20mins into the game. 20mins of running from the circle and scavaging for loot with your squad in places that only have enough loot for one person. What I'm trying to say is this game is no where ready for the competitive scene and I doubt it will be for a long time. Not recommending this game because I want the money people spend on the game to go into its development not a 300k tournament.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,UPDATE If I could downvote more than once I would. I should not be having these problems but evidently I do. This game somehow manages to eat ALL my ram. 8 out of 10 games are useless because it takes 2 3 minutes for the textures to load rendering the core gameplay of the game mute. I don't know if I am just unlucky but this game is insanely unoptimized. Literally unplayable. As I write in my review below I have absolutely no problems running most AAA games (E.g Witcher 3 Dying Light Batman Arkham City Dishonored 2) on max and 60+ fps. I know these are singleplayer games. But they still do not use 6+ gb of ram when running which this game should never do. First of all I very rarely if ever write reviews. So this review speaks volumes about my opinion of this game. Second of all this review is not regarding the microtransactions.The game itself is amazing nothing less. Strategizing and choosing between agression or stealth attacking your enemy is a very satisfying situation to be in. The adrenaline rush gets insane when you get top #20 and even more so top #10 and #5. Gameplay is fun and different. With that being said the game is only fun the few times I don't run into technical issues. At the time of writing I believe I have about 10 11 hours logged in this game. But I can safely say that at least half that time has been spent not playing. I don't know if I am just one of the unlucky few but I seem to run into technical issues quite a lot. I do have a decently powerful rig that is able to run most AAA titels on high settings without trouble. But this game I am not. It feels like 7 out of 10 games the textures of the buildings wont load basically making it unplayable. Other times the game just crashes mid game or goes unresponsive and the screen just freezes. I have searched high and low on the internet for potential fixes but nothing actually helps. I am not aware of how many people face the same issues as I do. But at the high rate I have to deal with these issues I simply cannot recommend this game. I too am aware it is 'just' an early access but I feel like the very least demand for early access is that it is at least playable at some level. Don't get me wrong the game is fun when it works. But this has not been my experience. Hopefully it will change in time. But for now I seem to use more time looking at the game and closing it from my task bar than actually playing the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-10,0,0,118,True,Not Recommended,Early Access games are like a box of chocolates You never know what you're going to get. In this particular case the developer promised that no microtransactions would exist prior to the game exiting early access. This promise was broken. The core game still has a lot of problems from network latency frame rate drops animation problems assets not loading problems with the voice chat client and is still lacking many of the features the developer has said they plan to include. Despite the numerous bugs glitches and other problems that exist the developer decided to devote resources to implement microtransactions. While a developer does deserve to get paid for their work and I don't have a problem with microtransactions in theory the fact that the developer has chosen to prioritize breaking their promise over fixing bugs flaws and glitches with the game should be and is a red flag.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you've not bought this game and live on the philosophy that I do were I value my games on 1 per 1 hour of game play then this game is going to be an amazing value for money. This game is on a good path and is an exceptional early access title that I'm very sure has a great forthcoming future,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-05,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,"(DISCLAIMER! I DO NOT HATE ASIANS) Hello This is Shirskiy. I play a ton of steam games and mass over 8000 hours of gameplay on all of my games combined so far And I have to say this. PUBG is a very good game It's challenging Fun Better than it's inferior competitors H1Z1 and Fortnite And the game is an overall 10/10! Except for one damn thing. Chinese players are hopping from Asian servers to US and Oceania Servers (US Servers being USA Mexico Canada and upper central American And Oceania being Australia New Zealand and Indonesia). Chinese players that come to these servers are abusing the high ping and often times I die by someone I just downed because the ping is so bad. China is across the world from the USA which makes ping super hard. I think China should be Region Locked. This is also because 99% of the Hacks for PUBG are coming from Chinese websites. I will now list the Pros and ConsPROS The game is very competitive It's very successful and rarely glitches or crashes This game takes bullet drop and range into account The weapons are for the most part realistic They have realistic grenades and throwablesCONS Don't plan on playing this with a GTX 960 or below on ultra settings If you do There goes your CPU Small Variety of guns Chinese Hackers and Ping Abusers Brandon Greene (Creator of PUBG) Is calling everyone who calls for a region lock ""Xenophobic"" (So Basically a snowflake owner) Unrealistic Vehicles Small Variety of Vehicles A pan isn't bulletproof... Randomly banning people who kill streamers for ""Steam Sniping"" These people are just trying to play the game. Randomly banning people who counter teamkill to save their own life (Really Brandon?) Poor Server Policy (Most Chinese players go from Asian servers to American servers because their own servers are poorly moderated and kept) Lack of responsability Causing Steam to shift from a mostly english site to a mostly chinese site Microtransactions even though they made a large sum of cash on the people who purchased the base game as is.So Overall it gets a negative review until it fixes a few of their issues One being serverlocking asian players. I can't understand what Kim over here is saying because I'm not Chinese. #ServerLockChina",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-07,0,0,185,True,Recommended,"This is the first ""Battle Royale"" game that I've ever played and I was instantly hooked on it.The premise for those of you who don't know is 100 players get loaded onto a plane parachute out over a 64 square km island gear up with guns armour and healing items and fight to the death. The play area gradually reduces over the course of the match forcing players closer and closer together until a final showdown happens. Sounds daunting at first and there is a bit of a learning curve getting familiar with all the guns upgrades and locations while simultaneously fighting for your life but after a long Saturday morning session after buying the game I was well on my way to getting to grips with the game.Solo mode is great if you want to be independent and ensures you're never outnumbered in a firefight. It also seems to be a better way of earning in game currency than the multiplayer options so if you want to grind for those cosmetics solo is the way to go!However the game really shines in duo or squad mode where you can team up into a squad of 2 (duo) or 3/4 (squad) and take on the quest for the chicken dinner together! There is an option to get matched with strangers and the in game chat is okay but having been team killed by some randoms I've matched with I wouldn't recommend it. (NB This can be easily turned off by unchecking the auto match option when you mouse over the ready button.)I have only owned this game for a couple of weeks but I have had unforgettable experiences playing with friends (both good and bad). The first time I won my whole squad getting blown up when a bomb dropped on the vehicle we were in cross mapping unsuspecting opponents with a 15x scope...With the promise of many exciting new updates and currently (July 2017) a new map being teased it's a great time to see what all the fuss is about and buy this game!PS Keep a defibrillator handy because this game will make your heart stop.

2017-11-22,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Literally the worst Battle Royale game I have ever played (well until I played Fortnite). Even that game Last Man Standing is better. Despite this game's popularity it's really wack. My first problem with this game is how poorly optimized it is even on my GTX 970 I have to turn everything to the lowest settings to simply run this game without immense performance problems. Secondly the servers are crap. Most of the time when I try to connect to the game it won't let me in. The game also has the habit to put NA servers as the default even though I always press EU servers. The cosmetics are also just another filthy cash grab. I'd say get this game on sale but they don't do sales since everyone buys their horrible piece of junk. Another thing that is completely bugged is the *you died from falling* message. Sometimes I get out of my car lose health and then after a few seconds I die from falling. The developers are so incompetent that when you die and you press leave match they give you a *Are you sure you want to leave* message of course I want to leave something I can't do anything in anymore. So here I am playing another and suddenly my character only moves his head now I luckily knew this was a problem with alt because I've played Arma and H1Z1 but anyone who doesn't know this is going to go mad. Healing also takes a billion years so much so that it is almost impossible to kill a group of people in a short period of time. If there is any game that is good for BR it is Arma 3 despite Battle Royale not being an official game mode it is still better. My final criticism is the gameplay itself people have way too much health and the healing in this game is horrible because it takes way too long. This way the game is punishing people for actually getting into action.Update It also happens to crash a ton.Final update (game released now) The game is even more broken now guns don't spawn instantly so people who do see the guns get an advantage because the game is broken. There are also tons of hackers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-11,0,0,61,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a great game but has a few cons(keep in mind that this is for the current version of the game (4/11/2017) many cons may be fixed by the time you read this review)Pros Gun play seems mostly balanced except for the AWM which is understandable because it is a high risk high reward item you have to get it from the supply drops. It is insanely fast to get into a game when i click play im in a game within seconds no long queues. Gameplay is not too fast like h1z1 but it can get intense towards the end. You spawn into an airplane and can choose where to parachute unlike h1z1 where you have no choice.Cons Spectator audio is messed up (this may seem like a minor issue but is confusing while spectating for example the spectator might hear shots from his left but the shots are actually on the right or vice versa) Sometimes you might die unfairly (behind cover or whatever) but it is early access and im sure they will fix this in the near future. Sometimes supply drops land in the water which is accessable via boat or swimming but if you want to change weapons you cant because whatever you drop sinks to the bottom.Other than these the game is great. It's fun and intense. It's like Arma 3 Battle Royale and H1Z1 had a Baby but it's more polished and better graphics.Overall I Recommend Feller,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's like....Bad. Really bad. Okay we got a new map new weapons cars and all that sort of t but that doesn't fix the major problems such as servers and bugs in the game which really the gameplay up. The hitbox is like....Not how it should work. Same as the map choosing system. They've promised to add the capability to choose which map you want to play but they haven't ing added it! Same as adding night gameplay. Jesus I just really get the feeling that the developers care more about financial profit rather than their players which really have issues playing their game.

2017-05-25,0,0,259,True,Recommended,I would like to change review due to some recent updates.FOV you get used to it and won't notice after around 20+ hours in game.Moving you're basically swimming in butter (that can be a problem sometimes when you should move fast back to the corner but your character keeps going towards the other guy's firing line)aiming...they tried to make it some sort of 'Arma like'...and you get used to it but still 3'rd person is kinda tough to see if you're actually hitting someone or it was just the obsticle )Optimization that's something! you have more or less decent PC but you can't play on low (30 55 fps for shooting game really?) FIX they seem to be working on this issue because now I can see textures loading faster yes but sometimes FPS still runs down from 45 50 to 10 20 (on low settings!) bad for shooter gamedon't see why so many people rate this game so good...now I know CRATES!!!P.S. don't see why people are so mad about boxes and keys...these clothes are just rags they don't give you any advantage + you can find most of these in game so don't brag about 'it gives me advantage nobosy sees me in the bushes' The game is fun playting single is a challange but coop changes gameplay entirely,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In fact these problems aren't even prioritized for fixing. In fact Blueballs Entertainment just released a big ol batch of crates that give you skins. Wow! I already forgot about this games issues! If you enjoy choppy gunfights people teleporting around corners camping just inside the safe zone to pick off people who cant's sprint 100mph to get ahead of the forcefield and of course a forcefield that rules over all servers with an iron fist bringing terror and agony to countless helpless players who dare play on its server then this is the game for you! 10/10 you'll be rage quitting every time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-27,0,0,1208,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is what H1Z1 could have been and even better. This game hasn't been out for too long now but players love it. Why? Because this is a GOOD game. H1Z1 had players so hyped up and was a huge let down. This game makes up for that. For the time it has been out it is mindblowing. The devs actually listen to community feedback and give generous updates to the players never messing up the game in any way I love it. This game is a blast to play. Solo or with friends. The feeling of satisfaction when you're the last man standing is inexplicable. Pros &gt Amazing game &gt Wide range of weaponry &gt Good shooting mechanics &gt Aesthetically Pleasing &gt The dev actually cares P &gt Good fluid driving mechanics &gt Realistic &gt Quick matching &gt Vast worldThis game is just going to keep getting better and better.Cons There aren't a lot of cons when it comes to this game but there are a few which will surely be fixed. &gt Few bugs here and there. (Not going to mention b/c by the time you read this they will be fixed which I love.) &gt Heavy requirements spec wise. &gt Needs more servers. Region wise isn't working too well considering I live in India and Asia is my only option. &gt No option/method to check my latency in game. &gt Pathetic optimization.In conclusion if your PC isn't a potato buy it! You won't regret it. If H1Z1 scarred you this will heal you.Edit #1 Server issues now fixed.

Chinese Hackers that BlueHole doesn't care about.3. Horribly unreliable and unoptimized game and servers. Crashes and frame drops are frequent even on a decent rig with excellent configuration.4.

Solo play can feel unfair at times because you might not know where you are getting sniped from.The concept is neat and the devs have done a good job in providing updates.

2018-01-07,0,0,610,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG a game from humble beginnings which has exceeded all expectations it's topped the sales charts dethroned Dota as the most played game on Steam it's swept across the internet like an African bush fire engulfing us all in an inferno of twitch streamer kill streak montages gameplay videos and memes. A game which has caused more of a stir than the death of the beloved noble beast Harambe may god rest is gentle soul. Be that as it may something is still bugging me. At first I kinda liked it but after a few hours I was totally bored I kept returning to PUBG not due to any desire to continue playing it but because of it's immense success.The constant nagging from freinds who swear it's the best thing since sliced bread and that it's the only game woirth playing right now luring me into a duos or a squad which usually turns into a game of ""how many times do we have to sit in a lobby after one of us dies at the start before we actually get into a real game"" After that ritual if we havn't rage quit we usually agree on the sensible option which is ""hide like little babies in buildings preying for good gear and a favourable circle"" If all goes well you'll be rewarded by making it to the top 10 where you will get to enjoy an exhilarating gun fight with the worlds laggiest combat the glitchiest most buggiest hit registration and the most unreliable aiming mechanics in a game ever. Not that any of that really makes a difference since nine times out of ten you won't even see your enemies as they scope you with a fifteen times silenced sniper rifle from across the map. All of this leaves me asking one question. Why does everyone like this game? Laggy Buggy Crapppy mechanics RNG on a level which makes winning the lotto seem like a matter of skill and even if they some how fixed all of that which they probably never will The biggest problem with the game it's main flaw the thing that makes it an incredibly tedious chore is the gameplay. The gameplay is just horrible it is as exciting as watching your grandpa take a nap in front of a golf tournament on tv on a Sunday afternoon after lunch with the only highlights being the occasional fart and some snoring! Who wants to play a game which lasts 40 minutes only to have 2 or 3 seconds of action 99 percent of your time is spent looting looking for gear searching for items scavenging for upgrades scouring the map for collectibles foraging for equipment and jogging Oh Jesus put your trainers on chaps because there's lots and lots of ing jogging. Endlessly jogging in some toxic blue electrified force field thingy. But wait what if we spice things up a bit make the looting a bit more interesting. Perhaps by adding some magical items to the game looting would become more of an adventure and the game would take on a bit of an RPG kind of flavour. Yeah that would be brilliant hmm let's see what about a magical imperishable crown of undeniable awesomeness granting the wearer immortality charming good looks and a 12 inch oh yeah I forgot they already have a lvl 3 helmet in this game that does all of that let's checkMakes you indestructible check!Makes you look like a bad check!Gives you a massive fat to everyone on the server with harder than an African American inmate serving 20 to life yep check!WAIT WUT!? I thought this was a competitive hardcore first person shooter?! Magical crown of awesomeness? WTF!?! So yeah magic items are actually a thing in this poor excuse of a competitive first person shooter/ 3rd person shooter for noobs/ not really a shooter more of an RPG/ survival game. All that's really missing are the zombies or wait hang on are we the players meant to be the zombies? The mindless creatures roving around the country side aimlessly scrounging for fragments of what might have been a fun game but isn't because it's broken in every way imaginable?To wrap up Player Unknown's Battlegrounds sounded like a cool idea but in practice turned out to be more of a disappointment. Nothing new here folks just more early access pre alpha beta still in development low budget crap. A game that still can't decide if it wants to be a hardcore competitive shooter or a half baked Fallout DayZ H1Z1 blended with the hunger games with a side order of jogging simulator and sprinkled with magic power ups.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not only that they're adding new features and optimizing old ones. So far I'm enjoying the game a lot. Playing games where you die near instantly because of either poor decision or bad luck and then wiping the floor with your squad backing the final player into a corner and killing them with only your pans. (That last part actually happened!) No matter what I'm always coming back to play. Note I've been noticing hackers on streams or watching videos online but I haven't encountered a single one in person. As well performance issues are always up or down and optimizations do need to be made. But with every patch there always seems to be something done to help with that.I recommend this game the negativity surrounding it I feel is pre mature at best.

It's extremely fun.... but.... our team finished with 0 points because our own teammates friendly fire killed us the entire game both of whom yelled in a foreign language the entire time. It's honestly a great concept completely ruined by cheating and unsportsmanlike behavior. It's pathetic that it is consistently players from Asia but just read all of the other reviews.

The only reason it is any bit as successful as it is has been from Bluehole. The main factor they brought to the table has been their minimally average understanding of what mechanics can make a game enjoyable. The issue with this game is the fact that 90% of it's total active players are from China where a copy can be bought for the equivalent of roughly $13 USD. All they need to do to completely ruin a few hundred matches is select ""NA"" on a sliding menu on the bottom of the their title screen and the game does literally nothing to detour this behaviour. They destroy the latency of matches. They use the disposable level cheap copies they are offered by using cheating software to ruin matches for other players for weeks on end&gt recieve a ban&gt buy a new copy&gt and repeat that cycle countless times.Region lock China.Ban PC hardware that hackers use and stop repeatedly shilling out this game to hackers at the expense of honest players so you can rake in more cash.

I was permissive thinking They ll fix this on release but I ve always been very careful not to call PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS a good game.There are certain elements that could have made it great I d waited a long time for a mainstream Battle Royale style game the post soviet aesthetic of a decaying island was an interesting arena to fight 99 other people on and there s no denying this game was fun with friends.Soon other games imposed on the Battle Royale gameplay notably Fortnite. I saw this as an opportunity for BlueHole games to recognise what people wanted from a Battle Royale game and to fix a lot of problems pervasive in their only major western release.Instead I ve been treated to lootcrates no region locking in game advertising and the cherry ontop of the cake pay passes. I might have overlooked ONE of these issues for a free game but for a Early Access full price Beta..?

2018-07-27,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,Ugly atrocious graphics mediocre gameplay poor optimization generic setting terrible controls...This game is a total disgrace and what's even worse is instead of actually improving the major problems of the game like the god awful optimization and the fact that the game is on Unreal Engine 4 but looks roughly equivalent to ArmA 2 the developers instead chose to release somehow even WORSE console ports and attempt to sue the competition out of existence (The competition that by the way also produces the engine that PUBG Corp. is using!). But nope that wasn't scummy enough they have to throw in some greedy microtransactions and then copy their competitor's idea of a season pass type thing too. If it weren't for the occasional moments of high tension and the fact that so many streamers played it when it was new it would probably be pretty forgettable and rightfully so. The game *had* potential but it lost any hope of that around the time the developers lost their minds and instead wanted to just milk it as much money as they could rather than improve upon it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-27,0,0,367,False,Not Recommended,This game is one of the best games I have ever played. Honestly. Probably the most fun I have had gaming in the last 5 years. Unfortunately in the last few months it's gone downhill. The game it itself is still great but sometimes it seems impossible to actually find a game. Too many times I've spent 10 minutes waiting for a game just to exit out because it isn't worth the wait. This is a game where you can die in the first minute not a problem when queue times were instant but that is a big problem with 10+ minute queues. I wish I could recommend this game because it's so much god damn fun. But at this stage I find it's nearly unplayable.

2018-06-16,1,2,151,False,Not Recommended,BAD GAMEDESIGN / WASTE OF TIMEPUBG and other Battle Royal games are the worst type of game you can play. And here is why Comparison PUBG with other games/genresWhen you for example play a beat em up and you and your opponent are at a similar level the chance of winning is 50/50 %.Now when you play PUBG (or other battle royale) and all player are kinda the same level your chance of winning is only 1%. And specificly in PUBG there is so much luck/randomness involved so your chance of winning is probably less than 1% (Except you played it more than +1000h) This is very unrewarding. And when you finally win... its not that big of a deal. Everyone else is already dead and nobody knows you even won because they already startet a new game. Very statsifying... NOT. other flaws of PUBG Ton of glitches long waiting times. Seriously half of my playtime is waiting for other players (friends) to be ready Lobby waiting time jump from the plane wasting time maybe dying early and waiting 20min for your friends to finally die.

But the developers are clearly patching mistakes made by lazy updates. It's a cycle that the player base pays for. (In bandwidth which isn't free)Once again I leave with the same message. Developers should pay steam a fine for more than one update a week. So developers should fix the game properly then update it. Not do it with constant patches. Valve needs to protect users data(bandwidth) from these lazy developers. Not only that what about the constent wreking of my HDD. I basically have to leave my PC alone and wait for these updates to finish allocating space and after downloading finish updating.I get that I'm being quite extreme But I do feel strongly about this.

2017-06-05,0,0,216,True,Recommended,After buying and playing this game on release I feel it's finally time to voice my opinion about this game!This games has many pro's but also many cons which it I will get into in a moment but first I would like to state my PC specs Intel i7 6700k OC'd to 4.6GHzGTX 1080 OC'd to 2000MHz16GB DDR4 RAM 3200MHz All games running from my 1TB Samsung 960 Pro NVME SSD.This is no way bragging but it will help when understanding performance when later discussed.First let's start with the Pro's VERY VERY ADDICTING! This game has the ability to entice you to play it for hours and hours even if you don't win a game getting kills in this game is very rewarding and get get really intense at times which certainly gets the blood pumping.Great Dev Team!Bluehole and PlayerUnknown are the people behind this game if you didn't already know player unknown is the genius that made me buy Arma he is the person that created the battle royale mod which has since led to games such as H1Z1 having very good success. There a weekly and monthly updates which are always released on time and you can find very descriptive details about them on the website. The weekly updates try to improve server performance and game stability where as the monthly updates add new items optimisation and lot's more. Good Gunplay!This game has very satisfying gunplay it isn't quite as realistic as Arma 3 or DayZ but the weapons all have there fair share of bullet velocity bullet drop off and recoil. This enhances the game as it requires people to think carefully about which gun they wish to carry and also doesn't allow people to spray down enemies at a distance due to the recoil. Good customization!If customisation appeals to you then player unknown is quite good for that. You can choose exactly how your character looks on first launch of the game and as you play you earn point that will allow you to open crates an customise further with more clothing options. Customisation is also good once the game has started as there many attachments that can be added to weapons to enhance the way the weapon shoots and feels. Cons!!Performance! Remember those specs listed above should be able to run a game with ease at 1080p right? It's does with this game until I look at a town and due to the amount of LOD's the game is trying to load FPS can certainly take a hit and spikes making the game unplayable. Although my game is on the max visual settings even turning the options down doesn't improve the FPS drops and this is very irritating considering the spec of my PC.Server LAG!!As to be expected with early access titles the servers are not great. It doesn't help that this game sold loads of copies. The server performance is definitely sub par. The servers sometimes lag and and make my game stutter this is also with a fast internet speed and low ping. There are also some questionable decisions with what runs client side and what runs server side. Bullet travel is server side but building are rendered client side this essentially allows cheater to remove the building from there game and shoot people through them as they cannot see the buildings! WTF!!! The servers also sometimes jsut refuse to connect and this can be very frustrating when trying to kill some mother f**kers!Driving!Vehicles are a great tool in this game and can be very effective. There are both land and sea vehicles and this is great BUT the land vehicles can be a tad problematic. If you like driving a slower route and following the road then the vehicles will behave nicely however if you tend to take the off road route then expect to be flipping those vehicles quite regularly. The handling is very twitchy and not very stable when travelling across terrain even when driving slowly. Conclusion!Overall do I recommend this game? F**K YH!! This is by far the best battle royale style game i have played in a while and is very stable for it's age. If the errors and bugs are ironed out over the coming months and server performance improved then this will be one of the best games of 2017 period! I definitely recommend buying and sticking with the developers as it's looking very promising!I hope this review helped out in someway or another!Thanks for reading!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Its been a while since I felt as much pleasure and accomplishment as the day I earned my first chicken dinner. Are their bugs? Sure. A lot of them make the game kind of charming in a quirky sort of way and usually result in a good laugh. Over all I'd absolutely LOVE to give this game a thumbs up because my friends and I have put in a ton of hours and for only $30. EXCEPT for the RIDICULOUS amount of hacking that goes on. I've been playing Counter Strike for 18 years and I've encountered MORE hackers in PUBG in 2 months than I have in nearly 2 decades of CS. I'd conservatively estimate that 80% of my games end with obvious hacking. Blue Hole has taken the indefensable approach of releasing more loot crates because that will certainly disinsentivise hackers. BH has made efforts they've released patches to address security flaws that were exploited. And those were effective for all of 7 days. The last 72 hours something has changed and the hackers are back with a vengeance. I'm done. The only thing that will bring me back at this point is getting rid of the market altogether which would disinsentivize the hackers. Or region lock the geographical locations whose job prospects and economy are so poor as to make hacking a video game a viable job. Until you do one or the other the game is nothing short of utter garbage and I can not recommend it. STAY AWAY from this cheat fest.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-14,0,0,131,True,Not Recommended,This game is terribly managed by Bluehole. The company that created this game cares more about updating cosmetic items than actually fixing the mechanics of the game. Everyone knows this and it's really pathetic that despite an onslaught of negative reviews the company continues to do absolutely nothing about the game's inherent problems. Hit boxes are erroneous. The parachute mechanics are broken. Shot gun physics are terrible. Network connection is shoddy. Players from other continents plague North American servers and cause severe network lag issues. Frames drop frequently especially during combat. Graphics are way behind the current standard. Vehicle physics are extremely shoddy. Swimming physics are complete Bluehole continuously patches things that don't matter (like nerfing the AKM or adding guns that are useless like the mini 14 and tommy). The company does not listen to its players and seems to only care about numbers and hype more than fixing the game's actual problems. Nintendo in 1989 was doing a better job in releasing quality games than Bluehole is in 2017. This game is the most over hyped game in the history of games. I hope to see a studio with actual talent produce a battle royale game soon that over shadows this broken piece of software that a high school programming student could eclipse. I'll never get my $30 or my time back. I hope this game sinks and fails as soon as possible and is forgotten forever. I hope that history sheds light on this game as an example of over hyped inflated BS. Thanks a lot Bluehole. Get a grip.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The updates were frequent with weekly updates and a larger update at the end of each month. Sadly they decided to rush ""out of early access"" and ever since then the game has been terribly managed and it basically plays and runs the same as it did a year ago. Now they are suing Epic Games because they are getting desparate whilst also creating a $10 event pass that is very similar to Fortnite's battle pass. It would be relatively okay however the difference is that Fortnite is a FREE game and this game isnt it's $30.

2018-01-15,0,0,467,False,Recommended,WELL. GET READY FOR A REVIEW FROM SOMEONE WHO JUST GOT HACK KILLED.Where do i begin. After playing countless hours through all stages of the game I have come to bring friends family and even enemies to play this game. Either for team mates or target practice. I have stood by this game and not judged or said a damn word publically about the horrible state of the game because for me the fun was worth it that adrenaline hit when your in the final 10 final 5 and even in the last one on one I have never experienced before to that degree. Oh my god when you win? you feel like your on the top of the world. You JUST KILLED 99 MOTHER****ERS AND CAME OUT ON TOP! Safe to say this game is extremely enjoyable and deserves its place on the best sellers list and on the lips of every twelve year old who wants mum to buy the next big thing in gaming. I understand how the studio feels I understand the immense pressure that has been placed upon them when all of a sudden their pet project glorified half broken mod blew up and became what it is today. Since then the community (including me) have been begging for more content more this more that fix this and fix that. So what have the developers done? Done an EA and put microtransactions for cosmetics (which is like every other bloody game these days so they get a pass for that) they add new guns new locations fixed the map fixed the guns and how they fire even added a NEW MAP OMFG GUYS. But wait oh its another map where it can be exploited by those who have an easy time going through the coding and finding ways to exploit the game. BUT GUYS BUY THESE KEYS YOU MIGHT GET A COOOOOOAAAAAT.This game has lost its focus what was an incredible experience has now been ruined by hackers cheaters and the barely held together structure of the game itself. YES I understand that a game this complex with 10 000 000 000 players (over exaggeration) is not the easiest thing to fix. But for the love of **** the development studio would have made millions upon milllions upon millions of dollars how hard is it to hire more people SPECIFICALLY to combat cheaters and another team to target the games optimisation? Hire twenty people for each team to fix this now stale and aggravating experience that I used to crave playing the second I finished a 12 hour day at work. HELD BACK RANT OVER It's a good game if you haven't played it yet buy it. You might just be paying for the game to be fixed for everyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But in those 9 hours I've experienced things in this particular battleground game that I haven't ever even come close to in King of the Kill or The Culling.Now it's early access. There are bugs memory leaks lag but the gunplay is solid. The best I've seen in this type of game yet.But that's not even what I want to say in this review aside from the fact that the devs seem to be really on top of things.This game is extremely DYNAMIC. And when I say dynamic I mean...In one game with a friend as a duo I was forced to make a split second decision while we were both stuck in the blue field of death and on the brink of both of us dying. I had to decide if I was going to die right there trying to help her up or bust 10 feet in front of me for the safe zone. Albeit I got blasted in the face by a shotgun about five minutes later but WOW lol I felt kinda like a jerk after that.In another game the final battleground area was being constricted to a completely open field. If you've played this for more than three seconds you know that open fields are probably the worst place to be. So I'm crawling through the grass like a snake only getting up every once in a little bit to get to the next safe zone. I come up to the FINAL area and some dude is rushing a shed 50 feet in front of me. The wood of the door blasts out and someone inside murders this dude right there. He's DEAD. So I'm crawling through the grass like ""I'm gonna get there and I'm gonna shoot that guy and win this!"" There's 4 of us left. But out of completely nowhere this woman in a trench coat literally steps on me and then she STOPS. And we get stuck in a three second stand off where we BOTH die right next to each other lolAnd then I had this OTHER game where I'm watching a house cause I thought I saw someone in a window. Sure enough some dude runs past one of the openings inside the house. I'm open to rush this place and put this guy down so I can loot what I need. But THEN a yellow car comes out of NOWHERE and this guy goes in and takes this guy out just like I was planning. ARGH. Although sitting there in the grass like the snake I am I notice he's taking longer than I expect. So I'm checking the windows and moving real slow. I hear him screwing around inside the house still so I STEAL HIS CAR.This is such a good game! Oh my god.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-06,0,0,70,True,Recommended,At the time I am writing this review I have only played 3 hours so keep that in mind. TL DR at the end.First let's start out with some pros and cons.Pros Very well balanced everyone gets weapons and nobody is truly left unarmed. Great hitboxes and damage multipliers If you get hit in the head you are dead. Love it! Fluent controls controls feel very responsive and when you die you don't really blame the game you blame it on yourself. Cheap for what you get. Considering this game will forever be $29.99 I think this is almost stealing! For the content that is in the game and the replayability I say it is well worth it.Cons Not very optimized. My computer's specs aren't anything special but I can only get 50fps on very low graphics and 1280x720. Could be better optimized. Sounds seem to break every once in a while but that could be me. They seem to scratch at certain points. Punches are overpowered in their current state. Usually I can get punched in the head twice and be dead. Blood sprays are very exaggerated but I understand why. It's so you can see if you hit them I get that the devs don't want to put a generic hitmarker but the splatter could be a little less dramatic. Vehicles are a tad wonky to drive. Making a slight turn could send your car flipping and tumbling down a hill effectively killing you. No random/procedural map generation. I hope this becomes a thing later on. The same map can make for a bland experience.Overall Rating9/10TL DR This game is everything that H1Z1 and DayZ could ever dream to be. I truly think that this game is the best survival arena game out there. It makes everything that was bad about survival arena games good. It needs some optimization and gameplay balancing but it makes for a very fun experience. I could see myself playing this game for days. It is worth every penny.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have 400 hours total on this game and I did like it a lot but right now the way it is I just can't give it a good review. I don't like fortnite either I really hated it because it was copying pubg but even now I'd rather play fortnite than this and fortnite sucks. The server issues and cheating issues are really bad and with them suing fortnite and the event pass being a thing it's evident they're just trying to make as much money as they can before pubg dies. The hitreg is more broken than rainbow six siege at this point in this shroud clip herehttps //youtu.be/z38B0rSpPWE?t 2m53sThe amount of times I've been in a fight with someone hit them in the head 3 or 4 times and they shrugged it off like it was a foot shot is just horrible. With a game that focuses hugely on gunplay aim and strategy this is really bad. and it's not ping problems either it's the actual servers.I just don't enjoy this game anymore and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone anymore.

Another big problem is getting crates that you have to pay keys to open it REALLY? I already paid for the game why do i need to pay more just to gamble my chances of losing even more money. Sure I can sell them but at the same time I like to open the crates that I work hard for just to get to that point.Finally it really needs to add other mini games like more zombie servers or something to spice things up sure its got a few zombie servers but that either gets really full or it locked.

2017-10-01,0,0,53,True,Not Recommended,Not recomended for one reason optimization. running an AMD system seems like a handicap. Having played games like battlefield 1 COD even mmo with large draw distances etc at 1080 with high textures and getting crisp clean looking environment where enemies were at least obvious when moving. For a game that was designed to be a large game world it is very unpolished as far as making it playable for mid tier pc's.Having said that the game is fun. Just needs some tweaks to make it work for those of us running AMD hardware and not pro streaming pc's with multiple 1080Ti's. Once this happens I wouldn't hesitate to recomend as it is always a blast from the starting island to the initial drop in it's current state however be warned people that the quality you see on youtube may not follow through with your pc.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-09,0,0,593,False,Recommended,About time i posted a review i have played over 300 hours of Pubg and have to admit i love this game everyone saying the game need to be optimized well it all depends on your spec and gfx card i use to play this game with 80fps on low/med settings with a gtx 770 without minor issues i have since upgraded to a gtx 1070ti and i am running at 144fps without issues yes the game could do with a bit more optimizing and hopfully they will work on that.The main issue on this game is the amount of cheaters that lock on head shot you with guns without even scopes for far now i know you are hard at work trying to make this game good and adding more guns and maps but maybe focus a little more on the cheaters if you don't start getting rid of them your game will die over time.Also my next issue is the items we have in our inventorys not allowing us to trade them to mates the items are ours to do as we wish as we have paid for them with our own money a revert back to allowing us to trade would be great inless you are going teh same way as CSGO is then you will lose over 150k players in a few weeks.Apart from the above and a few things needing to be fixed i do recommend this game its fun and team based game with mates and i love it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-02,0,0,128,False,Not Recommended,Bought this game super excited to play. Got into the game noticed immediate frame stuttering. Play about 20 30 minutes and game crashed. thought okay no big deal wont happen again. Nope as i started to play longer the more it happened. for no apparrent reason. Flash grenades litteraly break the game and cause frames to drop significantly tried lowering graphic settings and somehow the gmae performed worse than before. This game also somehow was able to use 100% of my video memory. I have a EVGA 1070 SC 8GB card. It seems that a game that was originally made for PC is the worst on PC. I love the gameplay of PUBG but the constant crashing and frame stuttering is a deal breaker and a game breaker and makes it unbearable to play.

2017-06-18,0,0,46,True,Not Recommended,Fun yes but unless you have a high end and i mean high end system you will likely find the game unplayable even on the lowest possible settings. Crashes are common audio stuttering making audio worse than if it was playing through a fan and consistant FPS below 15fps is common place as in every match. Some report getting mostly 60 fps on lowest settings with very top end systems but fps drops are still very common. This game is not even remotely worth the asking price at this time but it does has a ton of potential. Now they are bringing this to console so do not exspect half as much work to be done on fixing the PC issues as much of their staff will almost certainly be working on that for for some time. Even a company with money takes time to exspand their staff for such a task. If you have performance issues with Arma 3 you will almost certainly have preformance issues with this game. I recomend waiting until it gets better but keep an eye on it for sure. 4/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-23,1,2,380,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be fun back when it was in early access but now it's just like any other bad game. Here are some examples on why this game failed and why it will probably never change.1. To many hackers in this game it was so bad to the point were 9/10 games you play you will get killed by hackers even after them fixing the situation people always find a new way to hack.2. This is one is related to the first reason it has no region lock most of the hackers you encounter are mostly all coming from china legit everyone wants it but of course they won't add it to the game.3. removed all weather from the first map and gave us a map that is plain terrible it saddens me kowing that they took the weather changed that we loved and gave us a dessert map that wasn't even that good in the first place.4. This reason will also be connected to the third reason which is no map selection it came to a point where 8/10 games are all dessert maps and when there was a glitch to remove the dessert map and only play the first one you fixed the bug like your life depended on it instead of focusing on hackers. 5. TOOOO MANY UPDATES you have no idea how many times you have to update this game literally every single day you have to update the game I know updates are good because they're fixing the game but most of them just fix things on the maps they don't fix the hacker situation or add things that the game really needs to be good useless updates that is just taking space on my memory.Yeah this game has a lot of unique things that are really good but when the devs just get monet hungry and start adding skins for weapons and more crates when they haven't even fixed the main issues that are ruining the game then no matter how many good things the game has or as much potential the game has it will eventually fail and that's exactly what happened to this game.

The games shows its full potential good updates a well support.I'll give it now 6/10. Cause its not fully developed still have many bugs recently hacks cheats that prevents everybody from playing. A lot of new updates are coming soon. So i hope it will get better get out of EA and Beta.I will review it back after the game comes out. ) OKAY The game is out. Im about 50 more hours with new map and stuff.After everything out after all that hacking cheating ban the game now is fully playable but!!1) If you've new to this kind of Survival Top 1 Battle Royale game this game is good to get for like 50 100 hours of gameplay. After that you will find its kinda boring (The hours may depends on if you have friends to play with or not).2) If you want to try this kind of game. I will recommend you to try Fortnite for free 1st. Then come back if you like this kind of Battle Royale. (It has a huge difference in graphics).3) After the game is out.

Resulting in running around and hiding for 25 minutes with the occasional kill or getting killed. Really unrewarding either way. It can feel rewarding when you win a round but after playing many games you start to notice its big portion of luck wether the white circle will close into a location in your favor.The 2nd way of playing is just going in Rambo style find the buy areas and try and get kills. Again not very fun diving into a busy area not getting lucky with gun spawns gettting shot because someone found an AKM or another asssault rifle whilst you found a pan.The game is pretty overpriced at 29.99 as well. Sure you can get some hours of it. But looking at a value proposistion. You get 1 (arguebly poorly designed) map (more are on the way) a couple of guns copy/paste a terrible physics engine.

2017-05-12,0,0,563,True,Recommended,Player Unknown s Battle Grounds is a First/Third person shooter with survival and king of the Kill style game play. Despite still being in early ALPHA development this game often plays like a finished product and has been the fastest growing game on the Steam market for 3 consecutive weeks recently boasting over 2 Million copies sold. Player s biggest complaints with the game seem to be a demand for MORE content and server stability. The future is bright however as game developers have outlined both weekly and monthly updates promising optimization content and variety. So far this timeline has been adhered to well. Set in a sand box style arena the map is a 10k x 10k Russian island where players will loot/find an assortment of weapons vehicles medical equipment explosives and cosmetics all designed to help each player be the last remaining survivor. Tempo of the game is controlled in part by 'resupply' containers dropped by C 130 aircraft which contain high value gear. Players are forced into smaller and smaller areas by 'the blue wall' or 'poison gas' which slowly confines toward an undetermined location on the map. Max players on a server at any time are set to 100 while game mode options are Solo Doubles or Squad (4) at a time. The game has an open Steam market where some rare 'Player Unknown' items sell for $100s of dollars. Solid performance in game earns the player Battle Points which can be turned in for cosmetic items none of which provide an advantage in game beyond looking cool. Recently Blue Hole the game studio which is developing PUBG hosted a Twitch Tournament for Gamers Outreach and raised over $100 000 which Blue Hole matched for a combined donation of over $200 000. The PUBG Twitch community continues to flourish with over 2 000 streamers playing PUBG daily. Final words PUBG provides players with a heart pounding experience which promises each game to play out in a unique ending. For $30 dollars on the Steam market with the monstrous following and professionalism so far displayed by Blue Hole I highly recommend picking up this title when you can.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But it was alot fun to play andsince it was early acces it didnt bother me too much.Where the Dev's are going to take this game tho kinda pisses me off.Brendan (Player Unknown) back then said that they will focus on Pc only.It's no big deal for me that they release an Xbox verison but ever since theysaid that they are going to publish it on Xbox the game suddenly received nolange huge Updates. Inbefore there was always a huge Update every week withtons of bug fixes and optimisation and Since the Xbox announcement thoabsolutly nothing. And they're going even further. Brendon confirmed that they defently want to make this game crossplay at some point. I am sorry but this is a ing joke. Theres simply NO way on earth to make this game crossplay able.On end will always have a huge disadvantage. Rather it be the Xbox for playing with controlleror the Computer because controllers will have aim assist. Brendan actually already said that he likesthe way that Destiny managed the aim assist. Its not only aim assist but ""magnetic bullets"" . Means thataslong as your bullet is close enough to the body it will just hit the body anyways.Also I don't see ANY point in making this game a full release this year. I am pretty sure that NOBODYwould have any problems with it beeing a bit longer early acces until everything is finally fixed. Buttrying hard to make it this year just seems pointless. I am not willing to pay for a game that's running with 16hz Tickrate servers desync of hell thousands bugs a kinda still bad sound engine.

2018-03-06,0,0,522,False,Recommended,"This game has two modes.Fun and irritating. One thing I lack in terms of skill for this game is turning off the part of my brain that says ""Rush them now"". It worked very well in other games like CSGO / Battlefield 3 / 4 (combined 4 KDR in Battlefield) but it doesn't work in PUBG. I am literally for the first time an average player. And that's fun. It's challenging. Playing against a pool of 3 million players at any given time is going to be a challenge.But for the love of god region lock China. I can't even play in North American servers any more. It's that bad. Chinese players as some of you know have made up about 99% of the total bans according to Battleye. This is not just alarming it's screaming for a solution. The only solution is to region lock. If Bluehole were to region lock China it would off one country but make it easier for the rest of the planet to play under the impression that there's a level playing field.

2017-12-25,0,0,59,False,Not Recommended,tldr It's a great game when you can look past the poor optimization the hackers and the awful servers. The game is meant to run at 60 fps on a GTX 1060 but in my experience rarely reaches that point and fluctuates constantly. Besides this the game rewards those who play on lower settings by making it easier to spot enemies as it gets rid of most of the foliage. In a game as competitive as this it seems odd that a player with a capable PC would be punished for wanting their game to look good.The hackers though not a big issue are still quite common. I usually only play the game for 2 3 hours at a time and more often than not I run into one during that time. The amount has died down but could certainly be taken care of better.The servers are probably my biggest issue with the game. I live in NA and am met with lag in at least 2 of the matches I play in the few hours I spend on the game despite playing on NA servers. Though it's mostly short bursts of 5 10 seconds of desync they tend to come back sometimes every 5 or so minutes while other times it returns every 30 ish seconds.The regional servers are also a big issue. Despite having servers for various regions players aren't locked to whichever region they live in. Though I can't speak for the rest NA servers overflow with people from other regions Asia being the most common. This wouldn't be such an issue for me but they take advantage of the heavy desync caused by this which makes it next to impossible to kill them. It's gotten to the point where most of my matches are half full of people from other servers many times exceeding this. Playing against others abusing desync and using it to their advantage ruins the game and makes for a very irritating experience.With the newest update 1.0 a vaulting system was added in. The system helped to change the game dramatically and did a pretty good job in my opinion but could certainly be reworked. The system was meant to feel seamless allowing you to get over obstacles quickly without them slowing you down a ton. Instead vaulting feels clunky often starting with a brief pause before you climb over something and then another brief pause after. These pauses make the system more annoying than it is helpful.To sum it up the game's great but its underlying issues prevent it from shining and reaching its full potential. Though I recommend avoiding this game for now that may change in the future should they optimize the game improve their anti cheat and fix the servers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Cons I will explain.PROS1.Play with friends2.Trying to win the gameCONS1.THE PACE OF THE GAMESo u can spend about 30 minutes of the game running around finding good loot then u die without getting close to winning. It's just a really slow paced game.2.WHERE AM I BEING SHOT AT FROMOk when someone is shooting at you. It's REALLY hard to tell where they are. Yes if u can hear it with surrond sound headphones you'll get a picture of where they are. But then u have to figure out if their behind a tree or a rock ect.3.PLAYER COMMUNITYSo the players on this game are ""TOXIC."" People like to use cheap tactics and u get a lot of salty screamers shouting on the mic.4.GETS BORING.When u play so many games but end up dying every single time not getting close to the end. ITS NOT WORTH IT.5.1V1OK So during a 1v1. The circle is smaller then my asian Its so small that u cant legit puch the enemy to deathSo I reccomend that you play this game to have fun. if you play it competively your just gonna get and write a review with so many cons like me D",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I really couldn't tell you how this the most played game on Steam. It boggles my mind. It's just the default Unreal FPS example project but with a circle that closes in on you. I really don't know how they could have screwed it up this badly. Even the menu is broken everytime we play. Everyone ready's up one guy is not ready. He ready's up then all of us unready somehow. Someone is in a lobby with singles even though it shows them in our lobby.Don't even get near the vehicles. Hit a crack in the ground? Prepare to somehow break the laws of physics and flip over or go flying hundreds of feet in the air. I mean we have vehicles in so many games and they all work fine. There are vehicle assets that you can buy in Unreal. I really don't know why they are exclusively bad to this game. The maps are great and there is a good variety of weapons and gameplay styles.

2018-01-29,2,2,105,False,Not Recommended,This game has some of the worst game devs and customer service I have ever seen... The game has very laggy servers (at least for NA) that are almost impossible to play on. I have been killed many times through indestructible walls and/or objects and some of the times it isn't always the server. The amount of cheaters in this game is unbelievable... about half of the games I've played of PUBG has been filled with cheaters (I know that this is an issue for most games but it is very very prominent in this game. Also region locking servers to IP's would make the amount of cheaters on NA servers decrease).These cheats ranging from aimlock speedhacks or the most seen... no recoil scripts. On top of all this the game still has lots of bugs that should have been fixed a long time ago... For example taking 75% of your players health on parachuting in (when you don't even fall from a high distance) or like I said earlier dying through walls that can't even be shot through. Listen... although this game can be enjoyable at sometimes it really is lacking or in need of the crucial pieces of the puzzle to make a great game GREAT.

You aim it at the window and it bouncess off of the top portion of the frame not following the drawn trajectory at all. windows sometimes don't break when you throw nades into them no that's not a 'feature'. zone favours 3 major spots in game spots which if you don't reach them early in the game you won't get there at all that's a promise. the menu.. have never seen anything so badly made in my life. I'm really surprised that no matter what I click I have to pray it doesn't pop an error and it ing does most of the time it'll get me ""connection closed"" or ""matchmaking failed"". lag spikes.. there's just so many of them in the least wanted times. shooting recoil aiming.. this game doesn't follow any rules of 'skill' it follows mainly rule of who saw who first (which in 99% of times is the guy with a sniper rifle). parachutes.. landing with them near any structures is painful just fly too close to a builiding and you'll fall from little to no height and lose 70% of your health not to mention that you can get stuck for eternity. third person.. just don't play in third person.. really.PROS vehicles they are quite fine playing with friends is funI do not recommend this game in the current state even if it's 'WIP' they still would rather add fog and skins (more ways for them to earn money) rather than improving the game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-24,0,0,273,True,Not Recommended,"For a game that can so satisfying to play it really is disappointing for it to be so fundamentally poorly designed and inconsistent. Every Patch that supposedly brings about fixes makes the game seemingly operate worse mostly in the under the hood stuff that my brain can't think of a word for it. But sometimes it comes in game form too I don't know why the crossbow was added back into the game regular firearms give little feedback on missed shots and damage as it is but the crossbow? May as well only pick it up just so your enemies realize they wasted their ammo killing you. At least firearms give you a puff of dirt or a puff of blood not that it's much better when it feels like you unload a 7 10 shots into a dude and watch his organs apparently liquify into a red mist and watch him run gaily off into the distance. Meanwhile you can be decked out in some hot new military grade and get blasted away with what seems to be a single round. And that is where the greatest fault of this game is besides it general optimization and performance is that the lag makes every gunfight feel like joke. Hard enough to factor in bullet drop and movement into a shot but factoring in random lag feels like an unnecessary task. It makes it impossible to tell if you really outclassed someone with your marksmanship or tactical skills when to them they emptied a gallon of 12 gauge into you and it did diddly. And with this newest patch adding in the nice feature of pausing the game and telling you ""Network Lag Detected"" not if it is yours or the host or what and leaving you a sitting duck for your enemies or just ending the game session altogether. All of this brings down a somewhat fun island battle royale but the constant feeling of getting cheated when you lay into someone and it breezes over them like a spring wind and then get steamrolled with a single bullet harkens back to trash like CoD.

2017-09-16,0,0,192,True,Recommended,I only have invested two hours at the time of writing this review but having said that I have tried the base mechanics and have a general understanding of the game. Even though the graphics are a little old for it's time it is clear that they possess a certain charm to them which is reminiscent to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series. The frame rate is excellent and runs very smoothly which helps gunfights and player actions commence seemlessly and naturally. The looting system is well designed with higher tier gear on the Hostile NPC's and 'civilian grade' guns located in the world. The quest system isn't particually my cup of tea but those who enjoy RPG's might take a shining to this. The AI in the world is well balanced and poses a REAL threat unlike some other survival games dayz *cough*. The only complaint so far is that the temperature and illness system needs to be nerfed as it is almost impossible to traverse at night without freezing up and dying. TL DR Cheap survival game with fun pvp gameplay and interesting pve interactions.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-29,0,0,590,True,Recommended,I have played this game for over 300 hours now so I feel like I can actually write a decent review for this game. This game is a must play to start off. Early access must be kept in mind for the entirety of this review even though this is an extremely positive one.Most games I get bored of pretty quickly and don't have enough replay value for me to keep coming back to them. This is the game that cures all. Countless hours have been spent parachuting into the battleground looting countless numbers of buildings and either killing other players or getting killed. Although I have 30 chicken dinners I have over 500 rounds played between solo duos and squad. The constant weekly/monthly updates makes me excited to see new features and how the game has improved. I started off playing before the first monthly update and after two major updates this game has improved tremendously. Sure there are games where I load in and all the buildings look like claymation the game crashes and network lag ensues. This game brings me back no matter what. I've met new friends playing this game and it has made me more happy than frustrated. Thumbs up!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've been playing squad matches all day today and matched with 1 just 1 other player who spoke English. This is on the North American server. How can I possibly work with teammates if they all speak a different language? There needs to be some sort of limitation as this is entirely turning me off to the game.

2017-08-07,0,0,413,True,Recommended,Although it's still in early access this game is one of the best games I've played in terms of pure fun.It understands exactly what it wants to do and it perfects it from the strategic decisions that you have to make every second whether it's where you land or how you approach an area where you think there are other people to the straight action and tension you have every match you'll rarely be disappointed and if you are then you're disappointed with your poor performance. The devs are also very open about their vision and what's important to them which makes it feel like you always have an outlet for your questions and problems.

2017-12-16,0,0,58,True,Recommended,So far I've played the game 43.2 hours and I have to say while it can be boring at times it's only if you use my previous tactic of sitting in a building for an hour and not actually playing the game properly. I've yet to come across a hacker to my knowledge (except for one questionable death in the PTR). The game is very entertaining in my opinion.However there are some issues with the game 1. The game's optimisation is awful I recommend you play with very low everything except textures which I have at medium.2. The game as it is can be a bit boring but it is in early access and is being updated frequently. I currently mainly play on the PTR due to the climbing mechanic and new map which makes the game much better.3. The point rewards system is unbalanced between solos duos and squads.Overall though PUBG is a great game that has a lot of potential.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-01,0,0,437,False,Not Recommended,I still love/hate this game and I can't recommend it. What a waste. They could have easily learned from the mistakes of H1Z1. They could have listened to the players.The idea of Battle Royale has been such a blast in gaming. I saw the rise and fall of H1Z1 and I can plainly see the same mistakes causing the same problems all over again.People have been asking for ping lock for months now they finally implemented some half measure and you still get people with 300+ ping able to shoot you around a corner. Still broken.People have been asking for better anti cheat since this game started. Ever play DayZ? The same garbage anti cheat BattleEye that does not work there also does not work on PUBG. People with ESP can see you through walls shoot you through walls with iron sights at 400m while you are driving a motorcycle because they have auto aim. I stopped counting the amount of times I ran into cheaters long ago.People have been asking for better optimization and bug fixes. They've been working on it but come on they released this out of Early Access and we still have same bugs for months. How many squad games have I played in which myself or one of my squad members get stuck on a load screen and have to reboot their game? And really after generating a billion in revenue you would think this company would do more to listen.We still only have 2 maps We still only have the 1 game mode zombie mode is pointless as it is so I cannot count more than just the battle royale. The only content being added are cosmetic skins for micro transactions. They keep adding skins and creating a market for the skins and their crates and this draws in many players who only play to try and generate profit! They will either idle their games or they cheat to get quick points to purchase crates. Even if/when they eventually get banned they have already generated enough to buy another copy of the game on another account. It is really disheartening. I really enjoyed this game and at times I still do. I just know it could have been so much better and with all the financial support it has received I believe it should have been. TL DR I've had a lot of fun in this game but I can no longer recommend it. Hopefully things might change sometime soon but if it doesn't you should probably save your money because this is going to end up a sinking ship just like H1Z1.5/10Follow our curator page here https //store.steampowered.com/curator/6716139 Nox Noctis Gentis Obscurum,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now with the annoucement of an ""Event Pass"" I must finally uninstall. They charge $30 dollars for the game. The only progression system is locked behind a gambling based paywall and now they peddle a $10 pass available for a ""limited time"" for a CHANCE at exclusive items.

2017-06-26,1,2,140,True,Recommended,Overall this game is heaps of fun when playing with friends. It's a great battle royale game and has an easy learning curve once you get the mechanics settled in.However you can definitely walk upon a numerous amount of flaws from the game usually expected from a early access title. The optimization is a little bitter as the performance doesn't necessarily bode well and is accompanied with some major frame drops when entering the lobby. FPS can be seen to be lost in many occasions with particular graphics cards unless properly configured to lower/lowest settings in which help boost the frames The hit registration can feel disheartening at times as well as most times just leave you wondering how or what. The spectating can also use some work as most players can be seen to be aiming or firing in unusual spots when they are really pointing elsewhere. The vehicles can be better done as well due to its lack of proper movement. Especially with entering vehicles the game can be better helped with fixing the delay or lack of input when trying to enter one. But just as I had stated this game is fun. It's addictive and deserves the amount of gaming time I give it. The developers sincerely care about this game and are working hard to make sure it stays as one of the great games on steam. Every flaw I had put up above is actively being solved and is giving most players no worries. Everything from optimization to damage output is being looked on and solved.Overall this early access game has given me its full attention and I recommend it to any person willing to rage every now and then just as with most competitive games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are good games and there are bad games... some where you have NO GEAR and manage survive for 40 minutes just sitting and running or the games where you have all the gear and you are clearing a house and get ambushed and killed in 1 shot. So there is a lot of ecitement and not very much continued enjoyment. It is more like waiting in a 30 minute line for a rollercoaster that only lasts 2 minutes.

2017-09-14,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,I can see why people enjoy this game but it's not my cup of tea.. and here's why.I have around three hours of experience in this game which is enough to make a review.The game's literal goal is to not get killed. This means you can win by camping or killing everyone else.But here's the fun part the play area gets decreased over time. the players outside of the play area will receive damage over time this means they have to rush inside the play area otherwise they'll die.The concept is pretty simple but why does it have such a large playerbase?I think because it's a great game to play with friends. It's fun to team up and plan strategies to eliminate the enemies.Also the game's world is very big which makes it pretty cool. This means no game is the same because you will be playing on different locations.So why am i not recommending this game?I think the concept of the game is pretty cool. But i cannot stand the game mechanics.The aiming is terrible and so is the way you shoot your guns. It's all very clunky maybe because i am used to playing CS and Quake and stuff but still..Another thing that is really annoying is the way parachutes work in this game once you are close to the ground with the parachute you will slow down so extremely much everyone will know where you have landed. (Please take some notes from the Just cause series).Also i think the game is way overpriced. $30 is nowhere near the value of this game $15 would be more reasonable.Conclusion Wait for it to go on sale it's not worth $30.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-14,0,0,338,True,Recommended,Very nice game but frustrating at the same time.There are a lot of corner campers 3rd person peekers and sudden deaths in this game you can have this crazy game where you get 8 kills with amazing headshots but then get one shotted by a shotgun who is lying down in the grass making no sound and no movement. On the other hand getting that first chicken dinner is an amazing feeling and the action and looting is really what makes this game great. The combat system is pretty good as well and nerve racking at the same time. Early game situations can be very funny due to the panic everybody has looting as fast as possible and fighting everybody. Don't go to school if you don't want to die. ) 29 99 is a pretty damn good price if you ask me for a game that's played by over a million people every day.Go get it if you don't have it. I have played about 80 hrs right now and my aim is still potato.Also notice that this game is still in early access and already so much has been added to the game like a new city new guns etc. This game is going to be great and have new game modes as well. Also very little bugs encountered so far.You do have to have a (semi) high end PC 'cause the FPS can go crazy even on High ends especially in early game also connection can be pretty bad some games. That's a down sider but sure they'll fix it in the future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,304,True,Not Recommended,"I would rather vote to repeal net neutrality than to play one more round of this garbage.At best this game is like chewing gum. Great and fresh in the beginning but quickly becomes stale uninteresting and completely pointless. At worst it's a poorly optimized buggy hacker infested dumpster fire run by people that would rather sell a 5% share of their company to a company that DEVELOPS HACKS FOR THEIR GAME than to actually put in a working anti cheat. The best way I've seen someone describe this is ""95% running through a field 3% looking at bushes that look like people 2% actually fighting"" The basic formula of the game is simple and interesting but it fundamentally fails in executing almost every single aspect of simple game design. Allow me to break it down into the 7 deadly sins of battlegrounds. 1. Movement on foot is slow and feels like you're waist deep in water. Driving the various vehicles in the game even without the bugs that instantly kill you is mostly frustrating. Bikes take a lot of practice to not immediately flip over and kill you just by touching the slightest pebble. Most other vehicles save for the buggy either spin out or flip over so easily you'd be better off walking sometimes. 2. The shooting is complete and total garbage. What happens when you attempt to make a realistic shooter in an engine that was designed to make fast paced arena shooters? Guns that have no weight or satisfying punch to them (save the AWM M24 and M249). Just aiming in general is awkward as it in keeping tradition with the moving feels like I'm underwater or swimming in jello. Half the time the game can't decide if it wants to do call of duty hitscanning or battlefield/arma ""your bullets go out of where your gun is pointing not where you're aiming"". Which makes quick reaction based flick shots near impossible. 3. The graphics are just plain ugly and uninteresting. Maybe the game looks better on higher settings but...4. The optimization makes Dayz blush in how ridiculously pathetic it is. It has definitely gotten better over time going from ""completely unplayable"" to ""begrudgingly playable"". This is on a rig that runs literally every game except for large MMOs on complete ultra 120 fps+ (battlefield 1 battlefront 2 doom just cause 3 etc) I get above 60 fps so infrequently on this game that it's confusing when it happens. 5. The servers are ing pathetic. I can't begin to recall just how many firefights I've lost simply because my bullets don't register as hitting when I'm actively watching them leave my gun and enter the guy 5 feet in front of me (sometimes with blood splatters just for the added ""yeah you buddy""). Dropping into populated centers like school military and po i acts more of a lottery on who can stop lagging and pick up the gun first. It's very VERY common to be smashing f on a gun with your character doing the animation of picking it up multiple times just for someone else to come over and pick it up and shoot you. And if that doesn't happen expect to see groups of three people all huddled around one gun frantically spamming f hoping they stop lagging first.6. The community is a disaster. I've only seen people this arrogant stupid and toxic in the likes of Dota 2 and LoL. Look in the forums and you'll see thousands of people shouting off the exact same lines. ""Lol get good I win 9/10 games I play"" ""the game is early access you can't criticize it"" ""not everyone that kills you is a hacker"" And speaking of hackers...7. This game has more hackers than a lady of the night has genital warts. They are EVERY WHERE. From speed hackers to aimbotters to people that kill half the server ""by punch"" if you can think of a way that this game can be hacked there's people doing it. There are numerous other smaller issues (sound design being plain awful generic menu music bad map design) but they pale in comparison to everything else.

All that aside though the game itself is an amazing game there is nothing that compares to pubg in my opinion. As far as the bugs go i feel they have made a fair amount of progress. Sure everynow and then ill have to shoot someone 10+ times to get a kill but that is very rare and stuff like that happens in almost every fps game.

So after you get some loot and then maybe win some fights suddently during the next fight the game will crash and it will lead to death so after almost 15 minutes looting fighting surviving you eventually die because what? Because the game crashed. Also people are getting banned because they randomly kill a streamer without knowing who he is (have not experienced it my self) or even if you honk H O N K! So the devs decide to ban the people that get in the way of the streamers just beacuse specific streamers are whinning about stream sniping and t when someone kills em(they dont want to be embaressed ofc).Anyway after all this dont buy the game not now you will just keep getting mad every single moment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game has a huge hype and a big sale rate to back it up.But believe the hype ! Worth the price tag ? Just perhaps .EASILY a very addicting game and the first one to make me like ""survival/ battle royale"" concept as Im sure you already know of .It's pure fun ! You can go solo/duo/squads.Still in Early Access ( &amp hopefully not forever) so it IS buggy and still has a lot of room for improvements.Also many developers has their eyes on this concept now that PUBG has popularized it.So the devs of this game need to add features and keep it updated to keep its appeal .Which hopefully they do because we &lt 3 the game !!!There is Fortnite but that ha s adifferent approach .Some improvements I would suggest are more added features like customizations (more complex character edits etc) weapons... More stuff to keep it exciting like more interesting maps &amp weapons places... Definitely needs better optimization as well. Also I think some elements of the combat mechanism could be improved. Like melee attacks are kind of awkward and not as smooth. Simple stuff like pressing a single button to immediately hack away with a melee weapon or one button to throw grenades/bombs ... As oppose to assigning it to a slot and activating it via the attack button. Maybe even more modes I would honestly want one where it is more focused on survival with th eneed of food consumption animal attacks etc. Ain't that fun ? xDPROS ______ Good &amp realistic graphics (which makes it more intense and sort of immersive) Pure fun gameplay Big population easy &amp quick matchmakingCONS ______ Still Buggy laggy &amp not optimized well Need more customization items and features Need Improved combat mechanism A small thing but better menu/ UI &gt a premium lookThat's all I can think of for now",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-28,0,0,68,True,Recommended,I find this game very addicting at times. Sometimes I play too much and I go do something else but then I always come back to it! After getting a beta key from a friend and then finally paying up a couple weeks after release I don't regret it.Since I've been playing the game has gotten a lot more optimized new vehicles and weapons already the spectator sound issue has somewhat been fixed and a couple more things. However there are plenty of things still wrong with this game First I think the sound system needs improvement. It's SO much better than the beta (because now gun sounds actually sound distant because they are distant not sound distant when they are fairly close) but just listening for where shots come from is screwed up. For example if I hear shots that sound like they are coming from my left I go look towards the left but when I look left where I thought it came from (while shots are still going) it still sounds more to my left nearly directly behind where I was looking at first. I can tell you that it isn't my headphones or my hearing because all my friends have this problem too. Secondly the supressed shots have gotten better but still need work. If you are out of a certain distance you are unable to hear where the shots are coming from (I am used to ArmA where there are bullet snaps as they go by you). This gives anyone with a supressor plenty of time to finish of a kill or even mess with you.Getting out of the sound problems the hit registering still needs some work. It's worse than Battlefield 4 on release because I will be hidden behind cover and then seconds later (YES SOMETIMES SECONDS) I will have taken damage from someone else. So far from what I've witnessed it's people with bad internet connections that have this advantage. I personally have really good internet speeds but it seems that people who I see rubberbanding around are the ones who are able to hit me while I'm behind cover. Sometimes when you kill someone you still take a few bullets right after their face falls to the ground but the dev's thought of this and made it where their bullets don't do any damage which is nice but this is a big problem if they aren't dead yet.Enough with the negatives let me talk about the positives! Killing people in this game is more satisfying than any other Battle Royale type game ever! I think that matches go by pretty fast actually. People say the game is too slow and it might be to some people but personally the matches are around the same length of time as King of the Kill but much faster than ArmA 3 Battle Royale. Obviously duo's make matches more lengthy and squad matches can last even more longer than duo's but it's so worth it. If you die after looting for 15 minutes you still might rage quit but you probably won't uninstall. DayZ on the other hand even though it isn't a Battle Royale game it's a whole other story... The super unrealistic blood splatter is so satisfying to see while hearing the amazing gun sounds they have in this game. The mechanics for holding you breath are so fantastic and remind me of the game Squad but better. There are plenty more positives it's just too long to list.Some people say this game is skill based some people say this game is luck based. The truth is it's both. You can be unlucky in this game in plenty of ways that can be frusterating and you can be extremely lucky by having potato aim and ending up in the top ten because of where you started but realistically it's always a combination of both. An example? You might have the worst possible position known to man in the last minutes of battle but are able to react fast enough to kill whoever might kill you first. If you can't then practice. This game isn't like ArmA 2 where whoever peaks first dies it's whoever knows the map guns and the games advantages and disadvantages that will thrive. TL DR This game is very fun. It's very satisfying to kill people and your heartbeat rises as the number of people remaining shrinks. This game isn't skill based or luck based it's a combination of both. There are some problems that need fixing but aren't always game breaking. This game can be frusterating at times but is overall a fantastic gaming experience. I was initally waiting on purchasing this game during the Steam summer sale to save that extra couple dollars or so but I eventually gave in and it's been worth every penny!P.S. Lets all pray that the Dev's don't everything up like The Culling. Remember that game? Yeah... Yeeeah....... Yeeeeeeeaahhhh........,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-03,0,0,79,True,Recommended,Written after 35+ hours After having tried and hated The Culling I was pretty sceptical about the hype on PUBG. The BR type of game just sounded like an even bigger reason to rage quit and go bananas over a random bullet ripping you a second one compared to die quick/respawn quick games.And actually I was not so wrong about the rage part. Getting your face blown away by surprise in some dirty bathroom by a guy with a shotgun who heard you and set up an ambush is not a pleasant experience for you nor for your keyboard or even neighbours depending on how much of a frustrated person you are. That being said I still absolutely love the experience and the adrenaline rushes that come in different flavors Paradropping on your target praying to Jesus our Lord &amp Savior that no one else would drop with you seeing that 5 other guys are doing exactly the same thing running as fast as you can setting the houses upside down looking for whatever could be used as a weapon hearing a door opening downstairs rushing the intruder with a frying pan smashing his nose in enjoy the sweet taste of a small victory. OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD Minding your own business in an attic as a proud owner of a slightly rusty 1911 scavenging for an energy drink or two when you hear a jeep pulling over.

OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD No idea how this happened but you're in the top 10 and now eating grass in a very narrrow zone most likely surrounded by meanies. You litteraly feel your heart accelerate and can see your aim shake through your 8x scope. You're drooling and can't help but throw your headset in the air when the screen fades to finally display your triumph. You made it. You f!cking made it.

2017-09-05,0,0,616,True,Not Recommended,EDIT Also updating my review to mention the RIDICULOUS SERVER issues this game has. I can't connect with my friends i can't access the main menu. Servers are busy servers are not responding servers are offline Connection closed reconnect connection closed again. This is just ridiculous.Alright so this game is pretty much a phenomenon by now thanks to all the streamer/youtuber and media hype. Truth is its actually a really good game idea and PUBG is definitely the best iteration of the idea. There's a really good game to be had when everything is working fine.However things are not working fine most of the time. The game has ridiculous hitbox issues extreme lag issues and weird graphical bugs. To give you a few examples about the graphical bugs a few times i've spawned and there were no buildings rendered making me able to see other players inside them and run them over with cars even though they were inside buildings! Other times i spawned and all the buildings were rendered as distant lod making them completely unusable.Trust me when i say that these are not hardware related issues as i have a quite powerful pc.Patches are infrequent and long awaited promised features and bug fixes are nowhere to be seen. However the developers have plenty of time instead to implement paid lootboxes and a steam marketplace with ridiculously expensive ingame cosmetic items even though they promised that the game would never contain such things!!Listen i get it. They're taking the opportunity to make as much money from this game since it was such an unexpected hit and has completely blown up and sold over ten million copies. I don't hold it against them that they're trying to make as much money as possible however they should first deliver everything that they promised fix all the bugs and then make 400$ ingame coats that add nothing gameplay wise.Final conclusion its a fun game but Its riddled with bugs maybe they'll fix maybe not.

2017-07-28,0,0,578,False,Not Recommended,Addendum as of 11th June 2018 almost a year from this first posting.Since the history of this game it has had bad press due to poor representation from it's developers it's had poor management poor focus and absolute poor quality in what could of turned into a fun game which changed completely the moment they added in crates and pushed for full release. This game was fun even with those bugs back in the Early Access because we'd assume these would be fixed and the company cared to refine and define the genre fast forward and we've still have a low quality product as we had then with just some extra content. The issues is poor networking poor processing/coding. This game would be bearable if it was fluid but the actions of the devs themselves are a laughing stock this product has a stain that can not be shaken and as for it's future it is not bright. Companies that act like this ( suing under false pretences using absurd reasoning rather than using rational reasons shows them as petty and petulant corporation company what ever they wish to call themselves ) Should not be supported in my opinion look at their history to see what I mean. This game is bare bones minimal to what it can offer. Fortnite and the others that have come after it you may not like it but they bring ingenuity and quality.So if you haven't yet decided whether you want this game or not I have to slap a big NO on this product save your money buy and enjoy something that will be less frustrating and that supports a deserved developer. Early access review.I have enjoyed the game with over 380 hours to date. The problem lies upon the Company itself and their behaviour.1. The face and name of the title Playerunknown had stated that no micro transactions would be in the game during early access. Whether he has the power or not the fact that this man is the face of the company for PUGB and clearly stated that such would not happen only for the company to do so. A lie is a lie no matter how you spin it.2.The attitude from the company to the players this isn't just a PR team problem it's the company as a whole. The fact they're allowing people to continue to publicly speak where they say the resolution to being greifed is to not use Auto matching. As if it's your fault for wanting to just play a game with random people. Other incidents involving banning of players who defend themselves against those who wish to teamkill and ruin your experience and to latest date banned because streamers cry stream sniping. Apparently it's always our fault and not theirs.Overall I can't condone business practices like this nor should anyone else. This isn't about cosmetics this is about abhorrent behaviour from a company that basically do what they wish and seem to not care how it comes across.Update PU apologised for said behaviour with crates.however to note he didn't do this through his personal twitter account after a week of twitter and discord comments defending the crate fiasco and not showing any signs of apologetic behaviour only to place his apology in a patch notes as opposed to his personal twitter after being lambasted by the community and more importantly from known figures in the gaming industry such as TotalBiscuit. This was a corporate apology at best and feels non sincere. There was also no mention of mistakes and apologies for their banning policy or PR. If they had simply come out sooner and used their mediums such as twitter that they used to defend this as opposed to wait for a patch after a week and acknowledged their PR disaster I would of removed my negative review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-04,1,2,268,False,Not Recommended,"Pubg is a fun game when it first came out i had alot of fun with my friends playing this game i was playing this game when it came out maybe 2 or 3 months after it' early access launch so here's what i have to say about PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds after a year of it being in development and it's out of early access launch.I can describe this game as a Realistic Military kind of Battle Royale game everything moves slow and steady compare to other battle royale games that are ""Fast Pace"" like H1Z1 and Fornite but this game is getting alot of negative reviews recently so let me say why people don't like this game that much compare to before when Pubg clips would be on social media alot.So let's beginHACKERS Pubg is almost unplayable because of the amount of hackers in a game mostly some are from china causing people to ban china from the game or make a server region just for them.Battle Eye does do the job of banning hackers but even with Battle Eye banning thousands of hackers a day it can't keep up with the ridiculous amount of hackersOPTIMIZATION This is mostly spoken about in the community forums about how the game runs poorly on low end and even high end hardware because of poor optimization of Unreal Engine 4.Server performances are also in this since picking up an item especially dragging it to your inventory might take a couple tries because of the latency or dying because of lag.I know the optimization of the game has been slightly better compare to before after it's out of early access launch but well this game isn't really fully optimized yetCRASHES when i started playing the game again after months since launch mid game in a shotgun fight my game crashed and when i load up the lobby the game crashes. I don't know if it's only me but this is so annoying especially in an intense fight when it crashes on you randomlyREPETITIVE I gotta admit that it was so much fun getting a chicken dinner especially if it was your first time but i find it really boring winning since the coins they reward you for winning or dying after a game isn't worth it in my opinion i don't know if i'm that unlucky but i get jack from opening a crate or i get a crate that needs a key to be opened and if you expect to earn profit because of the in games items trust me you can't sell Pubg items anymore but even if you could old stuff is barely worth anything mostly gun skins or new clothes are mostly selling for a high price now.IS THIS GAME WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY?If you like this type of game then sure it's worth it if other battle royale games don't fit your style but i find it really boring to play this game since well you do the samething exact thing over and over again.I know there are new weapons cosmetics and maps coming soon but tbh with you all i see BlueHole doing is just adding new content instead of fixing a broken game and don't get me started how bad this game is on Xbox.PUBG was fun at first when it came out but now i find it really boring and repetitive nothing new just more skins weapons and maps coming",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-02,0,0,316,False,Not Recommended,(02/08/17)While the game is fun to play i cannot recommend it at this time because of server issues.For the first 5 minutes or so of the game you will have a tremendous amount of lagg.i cannot even begin to count the amount of time i was one of the first people to die because the moment i got shot at my game froze for about 1 second and then proceeded to lagg for a couple more seconds untill i was dead. Or the amount of times i died because someone could still shoot me due to server latency even though i was actually already behind hard cover. This game has very much potential but unless they fix the servers i cannot recommend it.Edit(17/03/18) Although the servers are now mostly stable the game still has quite some bugs. Also they got a new issue. The game is full of hackers. About 1 in 4 games you will be killed by a hacker using either aimbot recoil reduction wallhack or speedhack.

2017-04-20,0,0,198,True,Recommended,I'm unfamiliar with H1Z1 DayZ and some of the other games associated with the game so this a fresh experience for me. This is an outstanding battle royale/king of the hill style game that does a lot of things correctly. The devs are even supporting it with patches and updates on a weekly basis which is uncommon in the Early Access era. I would recommend this game in it's current state. HOWEVER the following aspects absolutely NEED to be improved for this game to grow as noted by the community NEEDS a general/text chat function NEEDS a killcam. You will have no idea how you die 99% of the time camera in close quarters is extremely clunky interferes with combat reward boxes have 0 value.

2017-10-20,1,2,394,False,Recommended,"So you purchase this game. The hype is on the skies. You enter the game go for a solo game. Haha you try to loot and when you get the pan you get killed by someone. You stop playing ""this game is crap"" you think. But then 5 minutes later you start again the game and go for another solo game. You take a more coward approach this time. You go on the side of the map. Wohoo you found a submachinegun. Then you discover that there's a blue area that doesn't look very offensive at the start. So this game becomes Marathon Running Simulator (there's even explosions like in Boston 2013). But unfortunately there's always a guy with a sniper rifle which kills you and he's not even in the same time zone as you with your 50meters range submachinegun. So you stop playing again. The next day oh what a bright day the sun shines outsides the birds are singing so you decide to stay inside and play another solo. You drop in the middle of Po i with other 10 men. So you start looting well a shotgun could always be worst like a frying pan... So you continue looting you hear steps someone is entering your house so you rush to hidde on the bathroom. You camp like a boss you're not even breathing the world record is like 20 minutes without breathing but you're as still as a greece sculpture. He opens the door you hit him once he tries to shoot back but your shotgun is too powerfull and you kill him on the second shot. Congratulations! Your first kill. Now you step outside to loot another house and you get killed. You stop playing you repeat the process. You even make it to the top 10 by playing hide and seek. Eventually after 50 games you learn how to become the hunter. You start getting an average of 2 3 kills per game and you feel like a boss. And finally after trying very hard Winner winner chicken dinner!Release EDIT Since there's a lot of hate recently I want to clarify a bit about this game. First of all the game is very playable and every gaming PC 500$+ should run it in mediums/highs. About the lag there's a bit of lag the first minute of the game but it rapidly gets good. On the EU server i haven't yet seen a hacker i think a lot of people is tilted because they are bad and now with the addition of the deathcam you can clearly see that they don't hack they are just better than you.

2017-07-24,0,0,106,True,Recommended,starter PUBG (Playerunknown's Battlegrounds) is an addicting Third person Every man for himself aspect. It has gripping gameplay. And makes you always stay on your toes with cutting edge combat systems (from ARMA). Gameplay So it has amazing gameplay. You a friend or a squad are dropped down onto a HUGE island. With three objectives. Loot Kill Win. Play competitively against 100 other players (who always seem to ing follow you no matter where you go).Like the title says. It's a battle royale and it's done well. Unlike its counter part H1Z1 Still a good game but too arcadey and un realistic for my tastes. Graphics even though it's in early access and has only been out a couple of months I still have to touch on this. The game is poorly optimized. Favouring the people with better computers who have the advantage of good graphics and decent frames. Even running the game on low with a 960 or 970 would limit your framerate to 40 50. Which is alot to some. But in this game the eye is quicker than the hand in most cases. Meaning frames are everything. To benifit gameplay I'd reccomend going on low graphics for the maximum framrate capability. Weaponry Exept for the frying pan I love the weapons they provide. They have a WIDE veriety of pistols rifles shotguns SMGs ETC.But they all are realistic to an extent. Even though it was modded from arma. The only thing they kept was the balistics. Which are bang on. They make the fights more about skill over luck and spam. The range a shotgun can travel is realistic so is the spread of it. The rifles have a semi realistic drop off point. But i think personally the weather system should effect the bullet drop/speed. But that's just preference. Conclusion It's an outstanding game with amazing balistics addicting gameplay and alot of fun in general but poorly optimized. Leaving an advantage to the people who can afford better PCs + Not many bugs+ Good gameplay+ Action Packed Fun+ Adrenaline feeling+ Amazing with friends+ Many guns to keep on going+ Beautiful graphics+ Not long waiting queue for online matches Some performance and loading issues but not many Teamkillers and lone wolf duos often happen a lot.

That should warranty it some value to save itself here. there was no option for middle ground review.Here's why short and sweet why I don't recommend the game in it's current state as of 4/6/2017 It runs like on every system that it is tried on. There's no help. There's no way to get a decent fps no way to deal with the breaking lag. I will say this in it's defense What it does do it does well. The game plays on very low settings. The matches are fun when you can play a good one with little lag. The shooting is clean and clear. Weapons work. However one of the downsides once you pick up a weapon melee is no longer an option. If you have a gun with 0 bullets you are basically useless.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PUBG is extremely fun especially with companions to aid you in your endeavor of total dominance and survival. It has a pre lobby with snakes and people singing which depicts a realistic depiction of mental illness and that China remains number one. A team led by Sebastian 'forsen' Fors won beating Michael ""shroud"" Grzesiek in the last invitaional of the game which as one of the best pros to be identified. Forsen was quoted after the tournament telling Shroud to ""just win"" which is extremely inspirational.

2018-01-02,0,0,793,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is great. Even with all the bugs/glitches/desync problems the game is super fun and thsoe can generally be overlooked. Each update I notice great improvements in those areas and the design and additions to the game so far have been great.Over time however the game has been so over run with hackers that it is nearly unplayable. I unfortunatly believe I will quit playing PUBG soon becasue it is to disheartining. In the past month I dont think I have played a single night without being killed by hackers at least two of the games. Ive had several nights where I died to hackers 4 5 games in a row. It really has become completely rediculious and its a shame.Some people are blaming the Chinese for the huge influx of hacking. Im not sure this is the case its just numbers. The Chinese have spilled over into all other servers. Most of the NA server games are around 70 80% Chinese players so the likelyhood of the hackers in the server being Chinese are obviously going to be higher most of the players in the server are Chinese so that makes sense.The bottom line is with a game that has this many players that also has created a market for hackers through selling and trading crates and crate items I doubt there is really any way to get rid of the problem other than killing the market they are feeding off of. As long as an envirnment exists where hackers can make more money than the cost of perchasing another copy of the game by the time they are banned this plague will continue to exist and it will breed anotehr group of hackers that are resentfull and will hack because they are being hacked constantly. If and when this environment no longer exists I believe the number of hackers will deminish slowely until its at a normal percentage. Like locusts they will move on to the next cash grab game.Until something is done about the rampant hacking I cannot recommend this game. If nothing is ever done about it I do believe the game has already seen its best days and will bleed players and die over the next several months. Theres still hope but action must be taken. Ill be back if and when the game becomes enjoyable again.Save your money! Depending on how long it takes BlueHole to take action the game may be much cheaper then.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So if you had fun playing H1Z1 but couldn't stand the ""polish"" of H1Z1 please consider picking up PUBG. Solo/Duo(haven't played any 4 player matches yet but I'm assuming they're just as fast) are always full of lobbies as soon as you click play you're in. There are exceptions sometimes though at 4 A.M. Est. I had to wait upwards of 4 seconds to get into a full 100 person lobby. Seriously though this game is a ton of fun. It's not greatly optimized for lower end gpu/cpu(and even some high gpu/cpus takes a little settings tweaking) but outside that the game runs like smooth butter.

2017-08-01,2,2,792,True,Recommended,"A tribute to PUBG or How I met Arielle It all starts one day a Weasel does what a Weasel does. Climbing mountains enjoying the view and the sunny weather. Eventually the Weasel found a motorbike and thought 'Hell why not let's try it and enjoy the sun and the wind on your fur'.So he took the bike running downwards the mountain as fast as he could to meet other humas so they feed him with chickens when suddendly a ramp appears. The Weasel cried happy tears ""Look at me I am a flying Weasel"" before he hit a branch.The motorbike flipped towards the ground the Weasel hit his head softly but obviously hard enough because the next thing he remembered was cold wet water on his fur. Picture 1 He found himself trapped in water below the island. He tried so hard to reach the surface and he seems to reach it because he can breath but it's probably just a surface below the surface. He yells at humans but they are just passing by not recognizing the wet ball of fur. Picture 2 The zone is coming... the chickens are running... Ursula is sucking my soul out...

Only way to win a round is if you've sucked RNGesus' every Wednesday night. Each update is completely useless just adds extra nobody asked for (like new guns and... well that's it) and a ton of filesize along with it of course. Game's almost fully out and not optimized AT ALL. Community sucks it's full of 10 year old that will mic spam in the start area or when you kill them on the field. Camping HEAVEN. If you're not lucky enough for that RNG circle to spawn right on top of you then you're going to get killed by a guy hiding in a house or behind a wall inside of the circle. It takes about 40 secs to enter a game then sometimes 3 extra mins at the starting area then about 40 ing seconds of skydiving (which is honestly the most fun part of the game) and then you get killed 2 mins into the game after landing of course if the terrain and loot load on time. Sometimes it's different tho sometimes you can fight and loot and travel and survive all kinds of and then after 20 minutes of surviving you just get instantly killed by someone who you haven't even seen yet. Most likely a camper and who tf wants that?It seemed fun at the beggining but I've played this game with at LEAST 20 DIFFERENT people and every SINGLE ONE OF THEM gave up on it and uninstalled it. No idea why people like this so much it's not worth the money at all.

I love that they have added the death cam so you can watch how you die and this only further confirms my suspicious. Sure there are plenty of times when I see myself get killed legitimately but since they've added the new desert map the cheating has become a lot worse. Several times I have watched enemies in the death cam kill me through a hack unknown to me. Basically they just aim downwards through the ground and all their bullets hit regardless if I am behind several walls in a different room etc. Sad that the devs arent doing anything about this and people continue to play with these hacks.

The game claims to be not as slow as other ""Battle Royale"" games buy constantly reducing the battlefield during play Well in reality this idea has no effect Everyone is constantly camping in buildings the ""zones"" are big enough to just stay in one room for 3/4 of the whole round without being forced to walk outside. So the best way to win is to simply sit there camp and kill those few poor fellows who run around. The only time you are forced to move and fight for survival are the last 5 Mins when the battlefield has become really small. However 30 EUR is way to much money for me for a game where I camp around 30min and only play for 10min.Looting buildings? Collecting weapons? Exploring the area? All sounds cool but if you wanna win this gameyou should do none of these things. So wheres the fun in here then? Well there is none!2. Yes the game is early access however there are serious server issues that makes it impossible to connect and play.

2017-05-22,0,0,1146,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. I know that my playtime is still not a lot but here comes my Quick review.Even though it is an EA title. #1 GraphicsThis isnt a Next Gen eye catcher but the graphics suit this genre of games. FPS wise I am running 100+ FPS with everything on low and an average of 60 with everything on ultra. Nothing here to complain about here. #2 SoundsWeapon sounds are great with a few exceptions of the UMP and Vector that sometimes are extremely loud when shooting.Footsteps are pretty impressive and 95% of the times you are able to pinpoint where in the building your opponent is by the steps itself. There is a few exceptions though where the enemy is running around in the house next door and it still sounds like he is below you.Vehicles might need a sound rework since sometimes the it sounds like the are next to you even though they are not even close to you. #3 Gun Play/MovementGun play is sweet a bit like in the old Dayz Mod for Arma 2 Hit regestration can sometimes be a curse from the RNG gods but keep in mind it is still under developement. Movement cant be chunky at times especially the first 5 10 secs after landing with your chute. And some small walls are a pain to try and jump over #4 ControlsNothing to comment here keys are the standard WASD layout and easy to remember the medickit/firstaid keys is a must to rebind though. At least for me since I have ""small"" fingers ) #5 LatencyServers seem to run as smooth as you would espect there might be some chunky rubberbanding the first couple of secs after landing and hit reg is a bit RNG as stated in #3. But it seems to run smooth I have noticed that even though I am sitting in scandinavia the Difference between EU and US servers aint that big. #6 Learning CurveGame is pretty easy to get in to. The first 2 3 matches you are a little lost and hoard everything you see. But after that you will quickly understand what mods you need to pick up for the weapons that you use and leave everything else behinde so you have more space for Ammo and med kits. #7 OverallGame is great and if you have to get a ""Battle Royal"" game this should be it.Even though it is an Early Access title It runs pretty smooth compared to other EA titles. Playerunknown is the reason why we have H1Z1 King of the kill The Culling and tons of Battle Royal mods.So in other ways this is his jewel.If you like this type of game this would be something that you would enjoy. I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoy shooting stabbing driving over or blowing up other players.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-17,0,0,358,False,Recommended,EARLY ACCESS REVIEW (I'm bound to edit this review come full release at some point. Hahaha)This game is beyond amazing. Well made well rounded and well executed.I will say though this game is definitely Early Access. At this point at least.Servers are buggy as all hell the game is still notoriously difficult to run optimization isn't the best. Bugs glitches you name it it's here. But the game. Is. Fun. Fun to play with friends by yourself or even just watch someone play. It's entertainment at it's finest and it's by far my favorite game of 2017 and probably one I won't be putting down for a long long time. In the past three months I have logged more than 130 hours into this game and unlike other games (cough cough CSGO cough cough) I don't regret a moment of it.Overall? I give this game an 8.5/10.**POST RELEASE REVIEW**The game has changed and not in a good way.While I'm still going to give this game a positive review as I've stuck by this game's side since the beginning I do want to warn all new players. The game. Has. Changed.I played the test server some disliked the new map in the end and I was looking forward to the full release where the maps would be evenly distributed and you'd have a fifty fifty on which map you get.WRONG.Instead there is a 9/10 chance of getting the desert map where weapon spawns are lowered the new guns are absolutely garbage and there is absolutely NO COVER. A terribly made map that I wouldn't mind getting every once in a while along with the old map but now I'm stuck playing over and over again.The game has lost a lot of my interest while I'll still be playing faithfully it won't be nearly as often as I used to.Fix the game Bluehole please. You've done a wonderful job so far but this release has been a poor excuse to put your game on a console and to get another map out there. Please for the love of the community fix this game.

2017-12-16,0,0,39,True,Not Recommended,This isn't a clever or witty review that plays up the latest trends and memes the gaming community is playing up in this game this is just my experiences and caution against friends buying.I have played this game for over 30 hours now and had some great moments and some awful ones. In the end I cannot recommend a friend purchase this title for a few reasons... I wont go on about being banned for being near a streamer as it has not happened to me or anyone I know. However I am concerned about the developers actions in some of these questionable bans. I wont complain about having games ruined by hackers as I have had a few questionable deaths but the lack of feedback the game gives on deaths makes it impossible for me to be clear if it was a hacker or the result of the jank and erratic server performance/lag. However I am concerned about the rising reports and videos of the ease of hacking this game. I am not complaining about purchasable cosmetics providing better camouflage as the graphics in this game at any distance are poor at best. However I do find it concerning the developer broke a pledge to not sell cosmetics until after full release as there are many rough edges they should be fixing before making that cash grab. A significant amount of jank still in the game with movement driving physics server performance.Overall I think this game can be fun to play AT TIMES (when jank and lag and poor optimization do not cause problems) with friends and there is potential for a great game here but it is NOT a great game overall or even a good shooter at its core once the EA jank loses its charm you are left with a game with many issues that have been given a pass by many people due to EA or the novelty of silly physics or the simple steamroll the popular sentiment became for this game.Due to this my biggest disappointment is that the developer has raked in TON of funds and has not fixed any of the above issues despite having the resources to do soIts cool if you like the game this is not an attack on anyone and their gaming preferences just my feelings noted down for any friends (or anyone else) who cares to read.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Everything is RNG. Skill is only half the game whereas the other half is getting stupidly lucky. Weapon spawns are completely random now and you can jump into towns that will only have pistols or shotguns in every house and nothing else. To add to that bullets dont hit where you think they do and just because there was a blood spray that doesnt mean you hit him.The sound... Jesus... They might as well have just gone and ed everyone here. It sounds horrible and you literally have to spend hours upon hours tweaking your equalizer so you can actually f*cking hear ANYTHING over the sounds of cars and guns. Most people use 3rd party software to enhance their sound anyway and generally have an unfair advantage.The fact that you can change your graphics settings to low and it makes it easier to see people is pathetic. Why even bother with graphics in the first place then?Oh and theres so many hacks and sh*t for this now that you cant even tell who is cheating anymore (Hooray for Battleye).One of the worst and most overrated FPS games ever made.

2017-04-22,0,0,486,True,Recommended,"A good solid start for a Battle Royale game.Before i start i want to commend the modder Playerunknown for his previous works.Its developer Playerunknown Is undoubtedly skilled and committed to the development of this game. His previous experience included modding and making Battleroyale modes for Arma 3 and developing H1Z1 King of the Hill.For now i would rate this game 7/10 due to many things i'll explain in a bit. (as of Sat 22/4/17)Pros ""At its core our game will follow the system I created in Arma 3 Battle Royale. We intend to have a larger weapon selection an attachment system and other elements familiar to Arma Battle Royale players. We are also working on leaderboards with an ELO based ranking system in game replays of all rounds and other features that will help provide a great framework for competitive play.""If you have played Arma 3 Battleroyale before you'll know how good its system is. Battleground is combined effort of Arma 3 weapon attachment and base animation and H1Z1 loot leaderboard and other system.A map that can support up to 99+ Players and it should not necessarily cause lag (Connection Lag)""PUBG has a very different gameplay then H1Z1 and while neither are bad poeple like one or the other or both PUBG lacks the style H1Z1 has but at the same time H1Z1 lacks what PUBG has such as tactical gameplay waiting out things and so on.""PUBG empathize Tactical Gameplay Stealth and decision making rather than bold action battlefield mayhem and other chaotic ""gunning people without really thinking"" stuff. Its proven to be fun atleast for me.Community is alive and kicking and unlike DayZ. PUBG Dev do actually respond to your messages which is quite surprising for me.Frying pan + jumpGood animation (shooting reloading running crouching etc)Cons The performance can be quite for some older PC (and sometimes newer one too.) Im pretty sure that this would be improved (as they did improved it a bit after the last Wed 19/4/17 updates.)This is not vital but the clothes seems a bit boring (I dont expect much since this game is still on Early Access but adding new clothes would be great)Conclusion?Tactical. Thrilling. Battle royale. and totally worth your time.If you own an older PC it is reccomended to wait a little longer before buying.But if you cant wait for it then yes.

2017-08-20,0,0,167,True,Recommended,"SO this game has a lot of ups and downs...but really it just takes a good computer/processor to run it and then everything is fine...Personally...I only get about 50 frames on all low settings and I'm fine with it! The hitboxes and the inability to see where you get shot from half the time can get annoying sometimes...but it's all how you react and adapt to it. You start getting a sense of where people are or where they will be just by playing lots of matches and applying game sense. The driving is a gamble...whether in terms of how you are kinda an obvious target or where you might hit something that looks harmless and flip several times..once again it's all about learning and applying when it's the right time to move or hit the gas and what angles to take. For example just yesterday I hit a hill with a 3 seat motorcycle (the one with the sidecar) and didn't realize to stop hitting the gas when I got to the top and proceeded to fly for a good 5 seconds didn't crash but it was just a heart attack that I could've ruined my match if I didn't land right. Literally 10 seconds later I planned to drive it into the ocean...didn't realize there was a giant rock right in front of the cliff and was like ""HOLY IM GONNA EXPLODE"" just to actually land on the side of the rock with the bike and my friend and I were both able to get out and avoid any damage whatsoever. Overall I feel like this game is 1000 times better being with a friend or in a squad of people you know. Another game I was with a friend and we did a synchronized takedown on two people who were in a firefight with someone that was on another side of a town. It was thrilling and the fact that we were able to do that and loot their stuff and their vehicle without dying was already like we won the game in our eyes.Just don't take it too seriously...If you can't run it well it's half on the optimization half on your computer. Both can be fixed and obviously both will take time. So if you're just getting the game and you can't run it right now...there's a refund option for a reason. Just wait it out this is a great game and a lot of people enjoy it. If you ever want to try to play go ahead and add me as well. Peace.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A typical example of when selling way more copies then you would've ever dreamed of isn't enough. They need to get the last penny by adding paid loot. What's next paid dlc maps ? Started out nice but I don't like the way it's heading.EDIT 16/07/2018.By now they've added the paid map pass so it just keeps getting worse. The cool things like fog and rain have been removed while the only things added have been locked loot boxes and cosmetic items.

2018-01-08,2,2,1368,False,Not Recommended,"All you need to know is this the creator of this game knows of a way to eliminate 99 percent of cheaters and has made a conscious decision not to. He's on record that 99 percent of cheaters come out of China yet he will not implement region lock. In other words he's purposely letting cheaters play as frequently as they want because he's afraid his sales in China will go down if he doesn't. He claims his ""top priority"" is to eliminate cheating yet if this were true there's a very easy way to eliminate 99 percent of them...a way he refuses to consider. If this sounds like someone you want to give your money to have at it. All talk of eliminating cheaters is nothing more than marketing fluff. He needs prospective buyers to believe he actually cares about stopping cheaters so he blatantly lies about doing so. Please don't fall for this pathetic marketing gimmick. The facts are the facts he can eliminate 99 percent of cheaters and has already said he won't be doing so.Also the game is an un optimized mess with horrific servers. The game is no more optimized now than it was on day 1 and the servers are just as bad as well. The only thing that matters server performance and optimization are pure trash and haven't been improved in any significant way. In Summary 1. Un optimized2. Very poor server performance3. Cheaters a lot of them and the creator of the game refuses to do a thing about it",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-24,3,2,172,True,Recommended,Pubg.I feel like i mostly have positive things to say about this game. It's really fun and you notice how the creators of this game is focusing on a more realistic tone while its competators (H1Z1 and Fortnite) Focuses on a more arcady style. I really like the realistic tone of the game (Sure it's not really realistic with the blue field and such things but it's a way of solving the camper problem that exists in these kinds of games). I don't know why i like this game so much more than H1Z1 both are great games and they both has got a bright future up ahead if the creators of these games prioritize the things that needs to get fixed so they actually get fixed. The biggest Con of this game is that Bluehole doesn't really do this well.Sometimes it feels like they just prioritize money making instead of making the people that plays the game happy. And if you just look at blueholes twitter facebook or even the review here on steam you can see that people are upset about this game getting on becuase of all the money this company is making. They've been getting better at prioritizing i must say and it shows off that they actually do care. They've been trying to solve the cheating problem for a long time ( REGION LOCK CHINA GOD DAMMIT! ) they always update us on facebook about the progress they're making and this makes me comfortable and i feel like bluehole has finally got back on track with the making of this game.Well here comes some PROs and CONs... PROs The military gamestyle makes this game really intresting and fun in every battle. No Matter how much you've played this game the battles are always intense and sometimes really difficult even against the noobiest of noobs. Good Communication from bluehole. Beautiful graphics. Big playerbase you can find matches really fast. CONs Some hackers I haven't seen them alot but people complain about them all the time so it must be a problem. Prioritizing things wrong. *Network lag detected* It's not the best optimized game out there.In conclusion Pubg is a great military realistic BR experience and it's worth every dollar you pay for it. IMO it's greater than its competetors on the market. There are some flaws in this game but the good things makes these flaws seem like breadcrumbs in a nice fancy kitchen. As in current state i would rate this game a 8.5/10. There are things that can make this game even better but it's still really good.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,596,True,Recommended,Tired of seeing all the bad reviews for this game. We get it they never should have banned people for honking horns. The game has issues (what game doesn't) be it getting killed by a car glitch doors that you have to open twice before they work or other issues you might face. Honestly they happen rarely. If you do not have friends to play with like most of these other trolls you probably should not pick it up. This game is the most fun with one or more friends. The car crash glitches end up being just another laugh the grenade that hits the window bars and ends up at your friends feet is going to put a smile on your face even if he/she is for a few seconds. If the game feels slow stop dropping on the edge of the map and join the rest of us at school or other popular spot. The game is worth the price of admission. Most of the negative reviews have over 50 hours of play. Can you imagine paying less than 1 dollar an hour for entertainment. Spoiled brats. That being said. there are a ton of cheaters.

I got a beast rig and I still get delay when I'm moving shooting or when I'm shooting the akm it's not satisfying at all! The graphics look even more 'edgy' it hurts my eyes.

If you are not excited to play this game in its current state then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development. Learn moreWHAT THE DEVELOPERS HAVE TO SAY Why Early Access? Early Access is a great platform as it gives us the ability to get feedback from new players as well as our existing community on new and existing content. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is being developed with full transparency to our players and we will make adjustments and additions based directly on their comments. Feedback from two alphas and a closed beta test along with responses from a broader group will guide us in the creation and addition of new content and gameplay tuning. One of the ways we'll use Early Access is to test Custom Games by giving certain players the ability to create their own versions of Battle Royale. This includes the option of setting the number of teammates the type of weather looting limitations and various other game options. Our initial goal is to test this feature among a smaller group of players and if all goes well we'll gradually roll it out to everyone. We'll have more details on Custom Games once we begin implementing this feature. Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access? Update Jul. 6th 2017 Players Today I want to update everyone on PLAYERUKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS progress through Early Access. The amount of support and feedback we have received from our community has been incredible. I want to thank you all for your bug reports feedback and suggestions. As we continue to fix bugs improve gameplay and add new content it s important to for us to deliver you a fully realized and polished Battle Royale experience as we look towards launch.Over the past few months I have done a lot of interviews and in many of them I said we hoped to be out of Early Access six months after we first launched. I ve come to realize that restricting the window to a specific month could hinder us from delivering a fully featured game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met.So we have decided that we are going push the full launch back a bit from the initial six month timeframe but want to assure you that we are still planning a full release before the end of Q4 2017.We will continue to push weekly and monthly updates until full launch as we want to ensure that the game we release is the best version possible. This is why we re giving a launch window rather than an exact date. We hope this makes sense and appreciate your understanding.As always I want to thank you all for your continued support.See you in game PLAYERUNKNOWN We don't expect Early Access to last longer than six months. How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version? The full version will incorporate modding tools that will allow players to customize and play the game the way they want. We'll deliver a complete Battle Royale experience based on the feedback that we receive during Early Access with a focus on optimizing gunplay weapons and attachments animations vehicles the loot system and much more. In addition we plan to add even more content and new features that will be based on feedback from the community during Early Access. We are committed to full transparency with players and will provide frequent and regular updates to them. What is the current state of the Early Access version? The game is stable and we've implemented a lot of content and features based our community's feedback during the alpha and closed beta tests. For Early Access we are going to focus on implementing the modding tools and readying a fully polished battle royale experience. We have weapons and attachments animations and gunplay in the game and will concentrate on tuning each. We will use the additional feedback to help us with the implementation of new features as well. Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access? The game will remain to be at the current price even after Early Access. How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process? Transparency and constant communication with the community is crucial. We will invite certain players to test our Custom Games feature before we roll it out to the broader group. We'll be posting dev diaries updates and asking for feedback on Playbattlegrounds.com. PLAYERUNKNOWN along with our community and development teams will engage the community to discuss play mechanics new features and the overall experience to ensure they get the game that they want.

When unusual gameplay patterns are detected from an account that account will be temporarily suspended and investigated.Although we hope to bring about a safe and fair environment in PUBG as soon as possible our battle against cheaters will not end overnight. We will continue our research and development to establish a better system for combatting cheaters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-14,0,0,166,True,Recommended,This game is fantastic. It has great gun play beautiful graphics and a gigantic player base. I'm going to list a few pros and cons of this game.PROS It is incredibly fun. Playing this game by yourself or with friends is equally fun so you dont necessarily have to have a full squad to have a fun time. The graphics are very nice playing this game on ultra is about the equivelant to a good nut.The guns are ing awesome.huge player base.Cons The game isnt that well optimised. Make sure to have a beefy computer if you want to play this game at high settings with smooth fps.It is very frustrating so if you're easily angered be sure to calm yourself before playing lol.I've seen many people teaming and using the third person camera to gain the advantage when peeking corners. When people do this they are barely playing the game properly this problem isnt too bad but it gets annoying. At least there arent any hackers though.Overall I strongly recommend this game if you've got the hardware required and a calm mind you'll have a ton of fun.EDIT There are a ton of hackers now. .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-18,0,0,145,True,Not Recommended,I played Rust and Dayz. Both have similar mods but this game has 2 major problems 1. CHEATERS (reports for sure won't do anything about it) 2. There is NO CHAT in this game. So you might get killed by guys shooting throught floors or HS from kilometers away. Sadly after I bought the game I saw that it's Early Access (did again the same mistake like buying Rust or Dayz). Also way too expensive for what it offers (1 map low mechanics you barely jump over obstacles or have decent bike/car physics cheaters big latency and so on). If you press find match the cancel option doesn't work (of course you can quit the game but that's not the point).Dissapointed but fun game if you don't get a cheater or you don't die in first 30 seconds because someone landed on a weapon.Lastest update The game is unaplayable. So many CHEATERS and Blue hole is a Black hole actually where normal gaming stops. Also this game is unable to keep 2 options saved server and mode. Once searching for a game it's impossible to cancel it. I think they hired 1 programmer to do the job.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-19,0,0,267,True,Recommended,Where to start! This game is so fun to play!! Its fun in all types Solo Duos and Squads. Awesome 3rd and 1st person The only thing is that this game has a fair fews bugs and places where you can get stuck. But I mean what early access game doesnt have these problems.The one thing that really bugs me in this game is the vehicles you could ride a motorbike up the biggest cliff do backflips and survive but if you hit the smallest little little tiny bump on the ground you just fly 1000m metres of the bike and die straight away.I've also noticed a fair few invisible walls around the map you'll be driving your car then nek minut you hit a invisible wall and lose 1/4 of you hp.. A example is in the Military Base Hangers.Anyhow though these arent gamebreaking bugs and they will be fixed overtime you just have to remember this is a early access game!Have fun folks!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-04,0,0,146,True,Not Recommended,I honestly wanted to recommend this game as it is quite fun. But the recent update not only made the game completely unplayable for me as I can no longer even move or see anything move at all get no sounds so basically only get one frame for an entire game.While I have been able to find a workaround for this problem the performance issues still exist.The most recent update (currently still on Test Servers) implemented a new anti cheat system which is good but cripples peformance even more as people report frequently.Not only performance but server issues (probably connected to the net code) plague the game. It feels horribly sluggish. After pressing the button to pick something up it takes about a second to actually collect the items. Same with doors they do not immediately open and it takes a bit for them to actually open. It's not extremely bad but enough to feel strange sluggish and really annoying.There are synchronization issues with people killing after you made it to safety behind a rock or a wall.I will update my review again once they fixed pressing issues but for now I cannot stress enough how awefully optimized the game is. Do yourself a favour and don't buy at this point.It has huge potential but right now I recommend rather playing Fortnite BR since it's f2p.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Was in a game where I killed 2 campers in buildings opposite each other. They were shooting out the windows at each other so I went in and could tell they were upstairs by the sound of their footsteps. Killed one with the shotgun. Than went to the other building and killed the other camper with the shotgun. Again I could tell he was upstairs just by listening to the sound of his footsteps upstairs while he was moving around.After this encounter I got killed on my way out of town so I had a total of 3 kills that game which isn't even that good.

However there are a lot of issues with the game that I'd like to detail as well as explain why I'm struggling to give this game a positive rating.1) I run this game on an SSD and with most games by the time I load in I'm either dead or in a far flung corner of the map. I have also got a 1060 and 16gb of DDR4 RAM and I still get this issue.2) A lot of microstuttering on a regular basis makes the game unplayable3) This is an issue from the past but the way the game handled (and to a degree still does handle) financing via Microtransactions (MTX) is scummy. I bought the Sanhok pass and within a few hours all my rewards were removed because of some temporary timer t. What's more is that the market is massively restricted and almost nonexistant.4) In general the way the game performs on my high spec system is a joke. I constantly have sound issues as well as the aforementioned microstutter and general slow load times that put Fallout 4's Release version Elevators in a good light.Overall when the game runs properly the gameplay is fun and they are adding new content semi frequently. They really need a proper FixPUBG initiative where they don't just add new UI and they say ""we fixed the game lol""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-22,0,0,1861,True,Recommended,This game is defenetly on the top 10 games i have ever played alongside great games like battlefield 4 portal halflife 2 black ops 2 ori and the blind forest battlefield 2 Rainbow six siege hearthstone and dishonored.If you dont have a medium to high end pc setup you should probably not pick it up though if you care about getting above 60 fps because its really demanding. I have heard that people with pc's that are not top of the line have alot more crashes.With that said if you are going to start playing this game i highly recomend playing the first few matches in solo games just to get an idea of how the game works before starting playing with your m8s. Then when you are a little bit more familiar with the game mechanichs and starts to comunicating and working out strategies with friends taking down enemy teams and getting your first wins thats where the game really shines in my opinion.

2017-08-13,0,0,256,True,Not Recommended,I have played FREE games with better game mechanics and less bugs. They are not pushing out the needed updates in a timely fashion unlike other games in Alpha. There is no sway when standing people are able to pop around corners with perfect aim and the no or very little deviation on the bullet (These last three items make it really good for aim bots) Even with all the Bans they do (which is more and better than most other companies). Servers are hit and miss lag randomly comes and goes this also affects hit timing mechanics. I would recommend other games as this is too much of an arcade style and you will find most of the time you will be running from the circle than in actual combat. Please see Heroes and Generals (better gun and camo mechanics) SQUADS (better sim) ARMA (better sim/gun/camo),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,259,True,Not Recommended,"I can't recommend this game in the state it is in right now. It can be so much fun some of the times but I'm finding especially now that this game is becoming more frustrating rather than being enjoyable. Just like DayZ this again feels like another mod running off of Arma. Don't get me wrong for what this game is and has to offer it is something fun But (always the Buts!) as it is EA it's clucky horrible connectivity and server lag at times and unreliable aiming/shooting for a shooter. And for me personally just way too many features and controls that aims to add 'realism' to the game that instead just creates a way too complex control system that ends up becoming over encumbering and breaks any immersion into the 'realism' it's trying to achieve. After 80hrs of gameplay this is how Im feeling right now which is why I cannot recommend this game at the moment. I m just wondering if and when these problems will be getting fixed. And now that I'm seeing that the testing for micro transactions and its systems are seemingly now under development and coming into the game ahead of the game's development itself is kinda making me feel like this another game that is going to be in development for a time. It s making me lean towards thinking ""Hey well it s just another EA title on steam"" (I'm sure many of you know what I mean when I say that it sucks). All in all it can sometimes be fun when you can muster up the patience to deal with it s flaws (a bit better if you have a group friends with you). However I still just can't recommend the game seeing how it's functioning right now in it s current state. In my opinion it's just too much frustration for only a little enjoyment...",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The foundational concept was really strong and interesting but somehow the developers managed to be the most money hungry narrow minded failures possible and have just about completely killed the game. The amount of sheer money grubbing garbage in this game is incredible. Rather than fix any of the extremely obvious issues the game has they repeatedly add more and more pointless stuff aimed at squeezing more money out of the player base for no real return on the players' side. Collecting cosmetic items is the only real progression system in the game and you can only earn them through random reward crates. More often than not you'll receive a locked crate that requires a $2.50 key to open and the rest of the time you'll probably get a duplicate of something you already have.These are the greediest most ignorant game developers I've ever seen.

2017-07-27,0,0,39,True,Not Recommended,I'm leaving a negative review until all the bad buisness processes I'm hearing from BlueHole go away. These being Payed cosmetics in a non free to play game CSGO styled crate opening for said items Non contextual player banningNow these are small gripes but there have been one to many times where an indie developer has created a great game witha great idea and then kill their own buisness but greedy buisness moves. My favorite example is OVERKILL's Payday 2. They got greedy and implemented cosmetic and crate drops with keys. Also there were plenty of other stupid moves but I turned away unable to keep watching the fire. So there's OVERKILL and then there's an Indie Company liek CD Projekt Red who created the WItcher series. A very small franchise which turned into a major power house the last few years making one of the most exclaimed games of this century. How did they do it? They made a great game with a good price and made great DLC for fair prices. They didn't bleed their product out for to much money why? Because they want a future they are looking for the long term. If they continue making great games with this tactic that their fanbase will ador then they'll keep making money for the long term. Most Indie companies feel the high of money for the first time then fly off the handle and shoot themselves in the foot. I pray to god that Bluehole dosen't do that beause this game is fantastic right now. I love the adrenaline rush of playing it the smooth controls the animations the gun play etc. Great game. Yet I don't want to stop playing it like I stopped playing Payday 2 because I just couldn't handle the companies practices.At the end of the day it's majority vote here. If everyone wants crates etc (Which I hope to god they don't) then bluehole will provide. At the end of the day I'm just trying to do my part as a player of this community. If Bluehole start watching what they say as a professional company and start making smart and likeable buisness moves then I will stick to them like a devote christian like I do CD Projekt Red. If they change this game into a eldritch abomination the likes of which I can't even recognize then I will keep this negative review.

The movement is slippery feeling like you are always on ice and you are easily obstructed by things your character should be able to walk over. Getting into a game with friends or even by yourself is often a chore since they break the matchmaking UI every other patch. Only east coast servers in the US which seems a little cheap and scummy to do after making billions of dollars off us.

2017-11-23,0,0,160,True,Recommended,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is an exciting take on the battle royale genre. Having roots in modding this exact gamemode into other games such as military simulator Arma 3 PlayerUnknown took a larger step to create a full scale version of the mod an entire game. There are many other competitors in this genre but in my experience and that of many others they don't capture what PUBG manages to. PUBG gives a more exciting experience and room to improve on your own personal skill to be better than everyone else around you. The skill gap between playing everyday and working on your skill compared to the casual you get matched with is huge and rewarding. Being good at this game and successful in a match is extremely rewarding as a battle royale has to be to sustain a player base. PUBG has many flaws but is constantly being worked on. Having the dev. team split onto another game is probably the main reason updates aren't as constant as they used to be but they get rolled out nonetheless. The flaws in this game as of pre 1.0 update can often be game breaking stuttering and server lag hindering your ability to win fights and engagements and is ultimately the most frustrating part of the game. However most of that should be fixed soon with some handsome adjustments come 1.0. When this game first came out on Steam I described it as the ""best worst game to play"" and that still sort of holds true but will hopefully shake that reputation come some new updates. Regardless of the consistent flaws and agony involved this game is so much fun and so beautifully rewarding it's definitely worth $30.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Ban reason Unknown.First off i'd like to start with saying that I did enjoy the game while i could play it just that some glitches and bugs within the old ""Early Alpha"" build of the game really and i mean REALLY me off. But for the Build 1.0 have to say this...1. The Scenery Improved lighting and weather effects. Distance between buildings / areas / cities is clear. The flare from the sun is blinding.2. The weapons Starting with the pistols P92 Shoots .45 ACP 7 rounds in a mag still weaker than BB pellets. P1911 Shoots 9mm 15 rounds in a mag stronger than the .45 ACP.P18C weakest gun out of the 3 previously mentioned but has the Fully Auto option which is nice i guess.Old R8 Shoots 7.62 ammo 6 or 7 in a mag i really dont remember cause i didnt have the time to reload the gun.New R8 Shoots .45 ACP ammo 6 in a mag as strong as a pump shotgun from close range. As weak as a P92 from long range.Shotguns S686 5 gauges max you have time to reload one of them before someone will chase you with a fully loaded S12K or double barrel.Double Barrel 2 gauges max reload time is longer than you expect so you will probably stop reloading and swap to another gun thinking that youve reloaded it but no..S12K 5 gauges in a mag reload time is the fastest but the spread is also the biggest you can put a 4x scope on it and hit people from across the map but you will deal 1 10 dmg after the 20 metre mark.Sawed off 2 gauges max used this gun once shot a guy 6 times didnt die came at me with P92 and killed me. ARs M16A4 Probably the best AR for long range better than the Kar98 equal to the mini 14.M416 Shoots slower than the SCAR L and is weaker but has more attachments which is nice i guess.AKM Only used this for longe range cause the recoil on this gun is just bad...... You can have a flash hider on it and still flick to the sun after the first shot.SCAR L My favourite gun out of the 4 has medium high DMG output reloads fast recoil control is pretty OK with the first 15 shots. Groza Pretty much the bigger and stronger brother to the UMP.SRs Kar98 5 rounds of 7.62 ammo shots miss most of the time use M16A4 instead.Mk14 Fastest shooting Sniper Rifle Shots hit 97.whoknows% of the time does enough dmg to kill a rabbit from 10 metres.M24 Shoots like AWM reloads like kar98 bullet drop is very low or atleast you cant tell cause you cant see where the bullet goes. Hope for a hit and kill.AWM Aim at the neck area Kill confirmed from any distance.Other guns UMP No recoil dmg the same as P92.M249 No recoil for the first 10 shots then the recoil is of a SCAR L or M416. DMG output is incredible but not really effective at long range. Only use this when you dont have another AR.3. The community Best community ive ever played with before the game you have 60 seconds to talk to other people but you dont use that time to talk to other people oh nonono... You use that time to scream ""China numba wan"" ""Taiwan numba wan"" ""Follow me i'm a snake"" ""Hello"" ""How do i zoom in"" ""Is my microphone working.. testing 1 2 3"".But when you do meet someone that answers you instead of screams at you. You and the other guy will become the bestest of friends. unless you play duos and your teammate doesnt connect 90% of the times. Thank you for taking the time to read this review.

2017-12-12,1,2,387,True,Not Recommended,Overall this is a excellent game its kinda a honest FPS survival online multiplier game. So theres a lot fun playing with friends. But after playing this game for like more than half year I decide to not playing this anymore. The resaon is pretty simple CHEATERS. I dont why bluehole complany cant find a way to solve the hacker issues...maybe they are facing technical barriers but you cant play this game with cheaters all around. Gettin killed by one shot headshot...by a P92..okay and this is just part of it. Same thing like they know your position and punch you distance away so yea all of these and more..literally annoying and i hope the bluehole company realizes the destructive factors of the cheating behaviors..give them forever ban or something..indeed please eradicate the problem for real. So finally if you are looking for a fair fun online multiplier FPS game PUBG is definitely not your game unless you become a cheater then its a fair game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Feels like youre controlling a mentally handicapped character that takes half an hour to change directions or make any other move. The only other FPS I can recall with similar movement mechanics is BF BC2 but this is ten times worse. The gun mechanics on the other hand are fine as is steep learning curve rewards only dedicated players(although shotguns and pistols need a rework)Then comes the networking related problems. Shot someone in the chest with a shotgun from one meter away? Well get ed because you missed. Even if you had your crosshair dead on. Lagspikes desyncs etc. This game has it all. Even DICEs BF3 and BF4 launch was heaven compared to this crap which is supposedly ""ESPORTS ready""(lmao)Overall this pos isnt worth even 1$.ED Installed the game again to see if something has changed.

They came out with pay to open creates and now all the time you spend in game earning BP is pointless unless you wanna spend 2.50 for a key because you are most likley to get a create that requires a key and now they are joining every other game in doing a season pass. So now if you want any of the cool items then you have to go buy the pass then play so you can get the cool stuff. This game isnt even free to play unlike all the other games that do the same thing.

I don't mean to be racist when I say this but most if not all hackers I have seen in the game have been Chinese. Everybody knows this yet they refuse to land lock China. With that huge influx of Chinese people there comes another problem communication. I am assuming that most people reading this are not Chinese as it seems like every Chinese person in existence owns this game. At least half of my teammates in squads have been Chinese people who not only speak very little (they sometimes say things like ""China numba wun"" or ""you no good you bad"") if any English but they also just seem to micspam.

The base gameplay is solid but it's by no means original and the game has some flaws. It's not well optimized the gunplay and overall gameplay feels very clunky and unpolished and there's a notable crate bot problem right now to where on average 20 30 people every game are bots and instantly die (usually hiding in the ocean). While the developers are trying to fix the issues improvement has been slow and often not as much as it could be. There's also a separate issue to where the developers bend head over heels for streamers. Killing a streamer can get you banned even if you aren't stream sniping a streamer can just go to the devs say you were stream sniping and you're banned. Is the base game concept good? Of course it is it's not even the first game to do it as much as the uppity developers like to insist they are with their copyright claims of other games and the past games before it had plenty of issues too.

2018-10-06,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,PUGB The most boring BR game due to all the waitingIt's a game where you spend first 5 10 minutes to get into the game you loot for another 5 10 minutes and if you are blessed with RNG you can find loot but most of the time you probably have fists/pistol against enemy's rifle and you are forced to repeat the 10 15 minutes of no playing. And if you manage to get some decent loot you probably die because of the game's META another reason why this game is boring.Meta is to wait until someone with loot comes to you not you hunting for loot. Which means if you want to have a decent game you basically sit and wait for players to come into the blue zone and that means atleast another 10 minutes of camping which is really boring and makes the game more like a camping simulator than a fun BR game.Also one of my main problems with this game is like I said in the beginning all the waiting you have to do until you can even try and do something. If you die within like 2 3 minutes after landing which will happen like 90% of the time you have to repeat all the waiting first you search for a game which can take as long as couple of minutes and then you have to wait for players to connect AND even after that you have to wait 1 minute for the plane to start. AND then you have to wait until you reach the place where you want to land and by the time you land you already have spent 5 15 minutes without doing ANYTHING and then you just die instantly because of bad RNG. I just don't understand why they made the game such a waiting game if most of the time you die instantly after landingOnly good thing about this game is it's first person camera,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Community(its on the internet)/dev team are toxic. Its great mark on the history of gaming will be forcing players into a circle. WOW how do did you ever come up with such a great idea... only hundreds of stories/movies over the last few centuries. Worse 30$ game i've bought in years... actually only bad 25$+ game i've bought and i own hundreds. Brother forced me into buying this trash. I think people just think its skill based because you can 1 shot people that never see you. It has same flaw as other realistic shooters. You don't have shoot outs and show skill with your movement and aim. Its a game of who sees who first. Amazing shots in this game are long distance headshots on people behind rocks or in a window.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-14,0,0,446,False,Not Recommended,Where do I even begin with this? Hackers galore Inexcusable lag Anti cheat that is based on the hours you have and the amount of kills you have per game *(will explain later on)* and the lazyness of the devs. I started playing this game about 1 year ago and back then it was honestly one of the best games i had ever played especially seince it was the first battle royale game I had ever played. I'm a casual player who generally only plays this game with friends so most of my hours spent in this game have been in squads on the good ol' map back before hackers ruled the game. ( and no it wasn't a good player since I don't think even a good player could headshot you while you are prone in the upstairs of a house with a pistol.... Just sayin)Lag has always been an issue in PUBG since the very beginning especially in the beginning of the matches when you first land. Back about a year ago this was never really an issue as we knew it was in early access and just rolled with it since we knew it was (hopefully) going to be polished and profected in the future. Welp 1 year later and we are still haveing inexcusable lag in matches not just at the start but throughout the entire game its like their servers aren't meant to handle this many players playing their game. Now their anti cheat is good in thought but very impractical while in actual use. To get more than 6 kills in a game you need 200 hours to get 10 kills you need 500 hours and in order to get 20 kills you need to get 1000 hours in the game. So if you have a friend that just started playing and only has 98 hours are really good at fps games such as armam and get 7 kills they are banned within 24 hours This counts for event also such as the war event that is taking place currently. A firend of mine found out the hard way and now bought a 4th account just so we could play together still on weekends.Now in order for a game to be successful you need updates regularly and changing the speed of the playzone doesn't count either... The last update this game has had was when it was released fully back in December and that was the AUG. I admit new guns are fun at times but when the game is still struggling to run even on good pc's thats what they should focus on not by pleasing the youtubers and content creators with new guns to try to reel them back in to this pos game.I loved this game in the beginning but to all you who are thinking about getting it i'd suggest saving your money till the issues get fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Never trust an EA game. Lets start by talking about the servers. the servers has been the one problem me and my friends were so frustrated about. It has been abosulte garbage ever since the game came out. Now the game is on Xbox with weekly updates!!!!!!! and we are sitting here just wondering why the do they not care more about pc. We don't get weekly updates wtf??????Without pc there would have been no PUBG. but here we are the servers are still trash. Actually they are more trash now after 1.0. HOW the do you up the servers even more almost a year after the same problem. Bluehole(PUBG CORP now) is such a terrible company when it comes to servers. I am so discusted with this game. Don't even get me started with hackers because they will never go away. The devs dont care at all. They dont give a anymore. Yes i will still play the game. We all will but as soon as a bigger company makes an actually good battle royal this game will die and i will be so glad. So dont buy this game because it is a laggfest. So glad this game isn't GOTY.

2017-06-28,0,0,134,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. To start this review I would like to point out that this is an early access title and that there are bound to be issues bugs etc. My account would have you know that I've played the game for 4.2 hours. This isn't true as I've merely had the game opened for 4.2 hours but as far as the amount of time I've spent actually in matches probably doesn't even equate to 45 minutes total. The gameplay is pretty fun when you can get into a game. I have persistantly had a weird bug / glitch that prevents me from loading into matches and merely says that the game ""Lost connection to Host"" when I never connected int he first place. I sit watching a loading screen until I return to the main menu with an error message or on 5 special occasions I was able to load in and play the game. I've only played 5 matches total out of the dozens of times I've tried playing via the in game matchmaking system.I have tried and tried again to troubleshoot this issue using the Steam Support forums for the game and it turns out there are a ton of other people suffering from the same issue and theres nothing anyone was able to do as there is rarely a fix that can be performed on the user's end. Some people were able to fix the issue by disabling their firewall on their computer to play the game but for obvious reasons this is an issue.Overall the gameplay is pretty fun based on the experiences I've had in game even if they were brief. The gunplay is solid the mechanics are pretty good and it's a fun game ((WHEN IT WORKS.)) Basically The game is still in early access and I understand that there will be issues present and some are pretty major. When the game is online multiplayer only and you can't connect to matches theres just not much that can be done with it. At its current state I would reccomend waiting for them to better optimize the game and work out more kinks such as the one that I suffer with on my setup. It's not a bad game but it still needs a lot of work. I was fortunate to recieve this game through a gift copy from a friend but if you're spending your own money spend cautiously.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One guy was even able to spot me through the whole terrain thus killing me without a line of sight.Unless these stuffs are fixed this game is completely useless because you'll be running through the whole map for like 15 20mins and then will die in one shot completely ruining the competitive fun of it.And most importantly there s no way of you to check your ping or loss thus you don t even know if you re actually in a playable server or not until you teleport through the ing map or disconnect and never connect back in.Update Don't buy it still !!

I strongly advise you to play with (a) friend(s) and to have a mike to talk to. Gameplay You basically jump from a plane and decide where to land. Can loot weapons clothes and ammo.You can find motorbikes or cars through the road and can drive them.The game still has one map but they are adding a new one soon and supposedly leaving early access by December too.Recommended but be aware to have a fast hdd and some friends + mike.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-14,0,0,443,False,Not Recommended,While I have put lots of hours into this game and I have to admit that it was fun in the beginning exciting and a new experience. It was like the new smartphone you've bought and you can't get your hands off it.However after you put a decent amount of time into this game you realise how god awful it is. With a budget of 1.3 bil $ they are unable to optimize the game( I still have to play on the lowest settings for the game to be playable on a r9 390 and 6600k) code some actual half decent netcode fix the bugs that are everywhere. At this level of popularity the devs' incompetence is unacceptable. I will list some of the qualities this game from a company with a buget beyond 1 bil $ offers you Graphics that are worse than Half Life 2 in 2004. The game looks ok(ok by a stretch because it applies a horrible sharpening effect that god knows why it is there) on ultra but i dont think anyone with a reasonable pc can run it. Horrendous netcode that leaves you frustrated after most deaths.In the past 2 weeks I've killed and been killed behind walls. Fortnite is vastly superiour. Unstable game. Crashes every 3 matches fps drops hiccups stuttering bugs servers shutting down for no reason. Bugs that were previously fixed come up again after new updates. How is that possible i do not know. Anti consummer practices. Microtransactions that do not affect the gameplay but make no sense for the player(you are rewarded with BP after good performance but with those you get crates which are locked behind paid keys. Why? why give us progression if it is locked behind a paywall). Absolute incompetence from the development team. They nerfed the m16 when they stated they buffed it the game runs worse by every update released they remove map selection after we begged for it so much time releases a smaller map which runs worse by a large margin compared to the bigger ones(which are 4 times larger mind you).This state of the game that makes me sick is the reason why I cannot recommend it. I try to like it but it cant be done. A good idea executed more poorly than expected.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Wrong!Before I start to tell the bad things of this game I will tell about the good ones 1) The idea of forcing playes battle each others being the last survivor to win thats is cool.2) The graphics are very good.3) The variety of weapons and equipments.Thats all I thing about the good points.So if the game is so bad why keep so many players buying it like myself?Whell because they dont know about the things below or dont know how much it affects all the game.So I tried to rank the bad things starting from the worst 1)Theres no votekick/voteban option! There are not even an Players List like in most FPSs. That simple option could solve majority of hackers/cheaters issues alongside the item below 2) Theres no information about server configurations as wich files the server allow customization. Theres not even a Serverlist! You join spontaneus server wihout any trusted information!!3) The ""Third Person Perspective(TPP)"". That should be eliminated at all. Its ridiculous how people stay behind buildings using the corners to see others around without being noticed! This is a joke! There the game losses all the respect especially if want to be considered a serius shooter.4)No latency indicator!!! Serious? how can you hide it from the player? Have you ever played an online shooter? Do you have notion of how latency affects playability??5) Theres no Text Chat on the game!!!!!! Why not??????????????????????????????????6) Aiming behaviour. The bullets dont go where you shoot! In various occasions I shoot an stand target and nothing happens! Another times where I was clearly not aiming at the target the in enemy died! WTF?????????????? So you may say ""whell you must learn to shoot!"". Like from 10 meters with an SMG? No its not my aiming the problem i assure you. The rifles too its cool to se the bullet falling on long shoots but again its a weird behaviour. 7) BUGs! What the you did with the physics on this game? I exploded a bike 100% healthy by simple touching an guardrail. The parachutes landing is comic. Plz do fix some BUGs its the least you could do!8) The community Players! Most are deff or something angry and trow their s.h.i.t on you.9) The crates and itens market. Thats really annoying.

Instead of adding new guns how about you fix this POS so it's playable and doesn't drop frame rates? 2) Filled with hackers. Aim bots galore stream snipers and ESP's everywhere.

2018-09-11,0,0,939,False,Not Recommended,Here is my list of problems with PUBG.1. You can still get shot a full second or more after moving to cover without being visible.2. Updates take place during Prime Time hours and don't give a notice of maintenance in the menu screen.3. Patch notes are severely lacking and aren't even available most times.4. Death cam is so terrible you can't even tell who is cheating or using macros or commands.5. Most skins can't be sold on the market which gives no incentive to buy crates skins or any limited time items.6. You can get run over by a car without even touching it. Cars are fatal at slow speeds. Speeds that should injure you but not kill.7. Level 3 helmets should be removed or have a feature that the face shield can be destroyed. A sniper battle between someone with a Level 1 2 helmet vs. a Level 3 is too much of an advantage.8. Loot crates have such low chances of getting anything of value. You typically lose much more money than you gain. You get way too many duplicates of the same items.9. Melee weapons are useless. You should start out a melee weapon since they're so useless.I could go on but these are some of the glaring issues I have noticed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I think you will survive 7 days without pubg. On to its community the game's community isn't a lot toxic and there are not that many cheaters or hackers.

But now they announced to implement loot crates for 2.50$. They said this money will be used to fund a tournament at gamescom and the 350.000$ price pool. And some will go to charity.

The devs seem to be okay other than banning legit players but hopefully that will change as its had so much publicity. At its currant state the game would not run on your parents laptop setup which you get 100 fps in CS GO. i have a gtx 960m and i7 6700hq so not a bad setup and i only get 30 40 on LOWEST.

From start to finish its annoying shooting down from the plane should seem easy but half the time where it looks like youre going to land doesnt match up with where your actually going to land.In addition to this driving any vehicle is somewhat enjoyable but for some reasom there are invisible rocks that youll hit and lose HP plus it puts a full stop to your vehicle. The impact of the weather is also a huge problem you would think that if its foggy your would drop more reddots 2x 4x scopes..... nope there are the same drop no matter if its raining foggy or clear as day. I also feel like if you let the player choose between fog rain or shine that youll see that no one likes the first two.

The game is fun in concept however in actual execution it is a broken POS.Lag and latencey issues are terrible and un avoiadable. You can be shot at run several meters behind cover and then seconds later the hits will register and you lose health or die. Gun play is never consistant due to variences in server latency. Lag in the beginning of the game even makes it difficult to pick up critical items. Its very frusrating when this is always present and you don't really get to enjoy the game for what it is.Cheating is huge and it seems like the developers don't mind it. Get used to being killed by people with digits as a name who hip fire headshots at 200 meters.The game was much funner in the beginning of early access. Unfortuanly the developers are in a virtual urinating contest with fort nite so you will see more useless features added (the emoji system) rather then the real gameplay issues being addressed. This WAS the best battle royal. Thankfully battle royal games are the flavor of the week and another good one will be around soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-21,0,0,675,False,Not Recommended,The Game itself is actually great but there are alot of problems that come with it. Tickrate is still really bad Limb penetration is disgusting Every time they release an update it is packed with major bugs and updates are really f*cking big mostly 1GB for just adding crates Skins are worthless now Trading got blocked The developers are very slow considering the huge succes of the game it feels like im getting scammed They added useless emotes that no one really use. Overall dying game.If you are planning to buy the game i suggest think about it really hard cause it gets really boring and annoying after a few hours of playing and losing because of some broken game mechanics such as an enemy surviving a point blank shotgun round from the most powerful shotgun in the game disgusting early game lag and consistent server breakdowns.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Good news is only %90 percent of them using hack so you might be able to play against someone who s not hacking.

2017-12-21,0,0,360,False,Not Recommended,I do not reccommend the game in it's current state.1.0 launch has been about as smooth as sandpaper.You had a choice between disappointing some fans bynot launching this year when you said you would and disappointing all the fans by launching something that wasn't even close to being ready to leave Early Access.But hey at least you can sell some more keys soon right? Some small notes on the launch 100 people being dropped from the plane instantly IS NOT OKAY. The lag is gross. ( I have a brilliant connection it's not me ) How you managed to make it worse for performance than the test server I will never know but you managed it. Everything that's done client side is a joke i'm sure a lot can be done here to fix your netcode.As an aside I still believe this game has potential. You have a huge task ahead of you Bluehole. You have to make this game work before a real dev team comes in and does it properly.

2018-03-26,0,0,392,False,Not Recommended,You shouldnt buy this unless they fix the servers bugs and all bs in the game and make it actually work better. So maybe check again in like a year or two cause the update rate is slow af and when they release an update the game is unplayable for a week or 3 and the update consists of nothing that the player base wants and just some random and bug 'fixes' they adress what the bugs are and make them slightly less worse to deal with. Oh yeah almost forgot about the hackers. You will probably find around 30 people in each game that are hacking. It was announced that 30% of the playerbase is hacking and that consists only of the confirmed ones. So have fun with a buggy game that wont get updated a lot and you probably die 50% of the time because someone is aimbotting or just the server tickrate.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-05,0,0,320,True,Recommended,Before I bought this game I was initially toying between buying this or H1Z1 king of the kill. Let me just say thank god I invested in PUBG instead pay the extra 10 bucks for this it is worth it 100%. H1Z1 is multiple steps down compared to PUBG in every way and well I think it's pretty clear that everyone else sees that based on the ratings I'm looking at. Honestly for the amount of work that has gone into the making of this game the devs deserve more than your measly $30. Grab it while it's cheap cos this game is definitely going places. The devs behind H1Z1 clearly lost interest in their main game and switched to king of the kill pretty indefinitely. One good game beats 2 average games easily any day. So if you want an exhilerating heart pumping fight to the death survival experience then BUY THIS GAME NOW!

2017-08-24,0,0,50,True,Recommended,It can be a fun game and i think it's best enjoyed with a few friends that sometimes mess around but are also serious about the game. It can pump u with a lot of adrenaline and u can feel like a tactisian without putting 2000 hours in to arma to git gud at actually being a tactisian. So far i've been enjoying the game a lot and i've even put some money in clothes (i ing play dark souls i like my hero to have style ok) and even though i think the prices are a bit high and some clothes give a small advantage it adds something to grind for i guess...(yes that it's just microtransactions). I think the whole stream sniping and is ing ridiculous and should be removed from the game because it kills the fun for so many clueless people because of one dude simply dying in a battle royal game like what the ! I think also that the game is very much broken but for now it hasn't been annoying me too much. Should u give it a try? yes. Why?

People can easily run around and no scope you from hundreds of yards away yet with a scope when you shoot them (even in the head) they will turn around and kill you.2. Most of the people playing are Korean's who don't speak english so there's zero group chat to organize squads or they'll drop leaving you alone.3. The zombie mode is a glorified practice zone for anyone who makes it on the human team. I played got stuck as a zombie 5 of us zombies got wiped out by one guy who was one shotting us with a machette we didn't run faster didn't heal better couldn't use weapons didn't hit harder.

2018-04-19,0,0,387,False,Not Recommended,I as many of us joined this game in 2017 when it was still in early access. The game is now an official release although it didn't make a single step forward since EA weather effects are not even present now while they were back in 2017. I remember a MAJOR patch when they introduced the vaulting mechanic but was the only change I've seen this game go through. This really is at an alpha/beta development stage but since devs realized they could still milk the crowd without ever needing to finish the game progress has simply stopped. These problems I am about to list where already present 8 months ago desync and rubberbanding glitching and getting stuck dying/glitching on landing high ping advantage (whoever has the highest ping wins the fight see chinese) a rampant chinese hacker community that farms skins and crates servers busy (even if you change region) won't display online friends loot spawn is as stupid as ever lots of situations with 20+ players and only 2 guns to be found vegetation still disappear at a certain distance so that you can never be hidden if looked at from afar TL DR game is a joke and if you buy it then the joke's on you,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-29,0,0,165,True,Recommended,I'm sure everyone knows about this game so there's no point reviewing it.... but here goes anyway.This game is horribly optimized buggy laggy and just a bit of a mess technically. Despite that it's one of the best shooters I've played recently at least. It's incredibly tense and thrilling even though you spend most of the time avoiding gunfights. Playing cautiously is the way to win (I assume I haven't won a match yet) and it makes it unlike any other shooter I've played. High reaction times and aiming skill are less effective in PUBG and if you generally suck at other twitch based FPS/TPS games it doesn't mean you won't enjoy this.The crate/loot system in game at the moment is pretty good you can easily unlock aesthetic items just by playing although there is a key system for some crates. No pay to win elements at the moment. The fact that the developer said there will be no paid loot system in Early Access and then implemented one is pretty disconcerting and apparently the crates you can unlock by playing will be taken out when the game releases fully. Whether that will make me give the game a thumbs down is yet to be seen.At the moment though a definite thumbs up!If anyone is worried about whether their PC will cope with the game here are my somewhat awful specs Pentium G4560 3.5ghz Dual core8GB DDR4 RamGTX 1050ti 4gbI'm running off a 120gb SSD.I get approximately 30 50fps in the lobby and anywhere from 45 100fps in game with the odd stutter. This is at mostly very low settings with textures at ultra and AA at medium.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-16,1,2,399,False,Recommended,This game gets on my nerves nearly every single time I play it but there's a reason I always come back. The feeling of winning a game and the tension building up to it is unlike any other game that I've played and if you put the time in it isn't a hard game to get good at (This does take time thought). However there are obviously a lot of problems. 1.0 fixed some issues but the dev team are focusing far too much of their resources on cosmetics and cheating (by focusing far too much time on cheating I do not mean that spending time trying to get rid of it is pointless but they wouldn't have to work on it as much if they just region locked China). I don't think that the devs should just region lock China however. They should just make it so that you can only play on the closest 2 servers to you geographically and only if you can have a reasonable connection to them (under 100 ping). If the devs just fixed some annoying issues and sorted out cheating I would reccomend this game to everyone but at present I would only recommend it if you are willing to stick it out with this game and wait until many of its issues are fixed.7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-19,0,0,499,True,Recommended,This is a truly amazing game which offers a great experience both for solo players and while playing with friends. I by all means recommend the game even though it has some downsides to it.The thrill of being in top 10 in both solo duo and squad modes feels intense and fun every time it happens. It will challenge you and make your heart beat really hard. The feeling of getting a chicken dinner (be the last person alive and therefore win) is not to be underestimated. This might sound like I'm speaking from beyond the pink clouds but i do understand the fact that the game is having quite a few downsides.I do know most of these downsides are because of the fact that the game is still in it's early access but i decide to name them anyways since most players tend to forget that a game is early access and being developed on.For everyone with a budget pc this game is at this very moment not for you. The game is by no means optimized so either play it and get used to the fps which will eventually get better when they optimise or wait it out till it's off early access. (Or buy it and try it out for 1 hour and see if your pc can handle it). There have been quite a big drama about the streamers that Bluehole (the devs) nuture and care about since they were the reason the game became popular. That have now drifted away and isn't really of importance. It feels like the developers have understood the magnitude of their actions and learned from the bad experience.If you buy an early access game you must expect crashes poor optimization bugs and glitches. It's part of the game until fixed and that is why it is early access. This game is not finished yet. The developers are really great at listening to the community and are probably working their asses off trying to fulfill it all.One main problem is their timeline they have promised the game to be out on a specific time having sold very very many copies they should be further in the development process but sadly is not. Therefore i expect the date of final release to be pushed into the future. For me i do not care as long as they keep us updated and do what they promise.This game got the core gameplay down and that's why so many players love it. You can play it hours on end without getting bored especially with friends where it in my opinion really shines!I would most certainly recommend giving it a try especially with a price tag of 29 99 Euros which in my opinion is cheap for a game. (Well it would be cheap if this game was a final release but for now it is a decent pricetag for how early access the game is...)Hope i could help you in your decision making...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-25,0,0,2483,False,Recommended,"The Good This is one of the most interesting shooters I have played in the last 10 years. It combines the FPS experience fire team tactical based action with a survival/battle royale experience. The maps are enjoyable the War Mode is a nice change of pace and they are always adding new content. What I like most about this game is that there is no pay to win element at all. In the end you decide if you are going to run and gun ambush or sneak away and avoid contact with enemy players. The longer the game goes the more the tension builds and the feeling of a win is probably the best feeling of any game I have played in my entire gaming career (20+ years). The game also doesn't have the childish feel of some of its competitors. Its graphics are good (even on low which is used to increase frame rate) and the game feels realistic without being annoyingly realistic. The Bad The problem with this game is that it consistently has bugs and connection issues not to mention cheaters. Blue Hole needs to 1) Resolve the connection issues clean up bugs and continue to work on eliminating cheaters. *24/9/18 Despite the crying twitch streamers the connection issues have improved althought desync is still a problem. They have also added a nice feature to tell you when your report has resulted in a ban on a player that cheated""2) Advise the player base when server maintenance will occur in game and ahead of time. *24/9/18 This is being done at least same day*3) Remove the red zone it is useless and only causes frame rate drops. 4) Create a shooting range/practice area. Allow new players to get better with the weapons and existing players to try new guns. *24/9/18 This has been added and is excellent*5) Have the final zones be centered for all players to mitigate at least some of the RNG. 6) Allow players to select what map they want to play. *24/9/18 Partially fixed you can choose between the new and the old maps at least*7) Have more events but reduce the cost and make all content won permanent. *24/9/18 More events have been added with no cost other than time in game. Very nice*9) Add weather to all maps. Rain and fog on Erangel and a sandstorm on Miramar. *24/9/18 This has been added to great effect.*I would add two new ones as of 24/9/1810) Slightly increase loot on Erangel. I shouldn't be dropping with my squad in hot locations winning that location and coming out with one partially upgraded gun.11) Vary the final zones a bit more. On Sanhok the zone is consistently ending in the same predictable place.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Half fix bugs and making more problems trying to fix them. Forced post processing to fix a fog bug? Removing .ini editing to fix a crouch bug? Putting bars on apartment windows to fix window jumping bug in all buildings? Vehicle sounds are ridiculously loud. Can't look behind your character in first person. Went back on all their promises about development and in game cosmetics. Put ads in the chinese client. Proning in the field of grass and having perfect third person accuracy. The servers are so utterly bad it is almost like a roll of the dice who wins the gun fight. Hit reg is so bad 2 3 hits register at the same time with another 2 after you get behind cover.

How the hell is this possible? They presented Fix Pubg project where they openly released what and when they will fix. What happened? Nothing absolutely nothing. Wish i could refund this waste of time and money.25 minutes of running/driving/waiting and 0 15 minutes of actual gameplay. That's in most of the matches. Why should i play game where's the most of gameplay just stupid running or waiting. And that isn't biggest problem for me.The biggest problem is RNG... Is any game more RNG than this? I don't think so. I really don't understand how can someone play any game where is RNG more than skill. It destroys feeling of improvement in most of games. How can someone have fun in a game where your improvement is only small part of success. Matchmaking is even worse because there isn't anything like matchmaking at all. You will play against players with 2k hours and die everytime you meet them of course.

From gameplay looting looks 1000x smoother ballistics is improved driving is not so spastic and it lags so much less due to optimization. The addition of a new map which is set to release with 1.0 will give the game a fresh feel as it grows. New guns and vehicles are also something I look forward to with the 1.0 release.

(Sometimes there is a lot of screaming and russian swearing but thats okay.)After a few seconds you sit in a plane and fly over an island. You can look on a map and decide where you want to go. After you jumped out of the plane you have to land and find your equipment to protect your life and kill everybody else. You can play in 3rd or 1st person view. You can play super stealthy and sneaky or really agressive. Both will work. There are a lot of weapons and vehicles to use. The longer you play the smaler the circle of death gets. You can t stay in one play you have to move. If you play smart you can win your chicken dinner.Currently there is only one map but this will be updated.

We can only hope that they continue to develop in line with their vision and I'll enjoy the journey with them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-05,0,0,122,False,Recommended,PUBG is a very good game. I definitely recommend it however for lower end PCs I recommend to upgrade before playing or purchasing this game. The optimisation could use some work and there are still some glitches which will most likely be fixed in the near future. There is a solo option although I do recommend to play this with friends as it can get a little boring by yourself (you can matchmake with other random players but some troll don't play properly or don't speak your language so it is best to have friends. This game is completely skill based you can buy crates but they do not help you at all and are completely cosmetic. There are only 2 maps in the game right now (5th April 2018) but it is inevitable that more will be added. This game is very competitive and concentration is needed. If you re looking for a more chill and laid back game then I recommend Fortnite which is free. However I do believe PUBG is worth its price and it includes many more features such as modded servers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-05,0,0,40,False,Not Recommended,I legitimately hate this game. Do not buy it. Guns are not fun to use. It feels like you're shooting off brand nerf darts at your enemies. Not even in damage but in response from using the gun and scoring a hit on your enemies. Get ready to spend an hour wandering around waiting for something to happen only to die to a sniper that's nearly invisible. Poorly optimized. Even on my PC which is capable of running VR at a smooth framerate I sometimes experience huge lag spikes. An absolutely rediculous monetization model. Loot crates paid cosmetics and something reminiscient of Fortnite's Battle Pass all in a game you have to pay $30 to enter. This is absolutely stupid and shows how greedy its devs are.If you want a Battle Royale game that's fun there's many free to play alternatives that are better than this dumpster fire. The Darwin Project and Fortnite are much more polished and fair gaming experiences than PUBG. PUBG is not refined but it shows its dev team's hunger for cash. It is a complete waste of both time and money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-26,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,I can't believe I actually spent money on this. Not only is it horribly optomised buggy and very clunky but really boring. I get it I am new and will suck until I get the hang of combat. I typically drop in gear up kill a couple of people but die to an annonmyous sniper shot from far off. Not that there is anytnhing wrong with that I love picking people off myself. I just hate that the mechanics of the game force you to always be on the move due to the massive world sizes although while at the same time having such an open and airid world leave you open to just be picked off. It really isn't tactical just kind of a boner killer. Most deaths are not preventable just you desperately trying to reach the inner circle while some jerk off with a rifle picks you off from the edge of the circle. THAT'S ALL FINE! Maybe it's just me but what got me most was just what a blantant money grab the experience was. I'm so sick of buying my games in tiny pieces.As a community we can not let ourselves get walked over by money hungry devs shoving microtransactions down our throats.

2018-03-29,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,I'll try to keep this fairly concise..To start off don't get me wrong I really did enjoy this game and as a whole it's really not bad as far as entertainment goes.Graphics are good optimisation isn't bad to the point where it's unplayable and there's no p2w mechanics (thank god).And the feeling of being in the top 10 and constantly being wary of where your enemy is is always a great adrenaline rush no matter how many times you do it. Unfortunately I cannot recommend people to buy this at the current time. Save your money and go pick up Fortnite for free and maybe shell out $10 for the battle pass if you really like it and want to support it. Sure this game might have a more realistic feel to it but personally I couldn't care about realistic graphics if you just don't enjoy the game. And what really is my main gripe is that blueball entertainment is constantly pushing out insanely large updates. But is it bug fixes to a large amount of clipping and graphical glitches or the abhorrent audio (Let's not even talk about the servers)? No. It's freaking cosmetic updates that consist of outfits and other junk when the game is in dire need of patching to improve game quality. I could say a lot more but right now it just seems like the devs are giving minimal attention to what is really dragging this game down.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-21,0,0,72,False,Recommended,PUBG Where do I start.I've had a lot of fun playing it both alone and with friends.The gameplay can be very diffrent and you can often choose what kind of game you want to have If you want to have a lot of action you drop in a location where you often find enemies (Cities large complexes etc.) If you are one looking for more of a quiet game then you just try to drop at a more remote location.The various guns are quite skill based as they have unique spraypatterns and that rewards more experienced players over new ones. Saying this doesn't mean it's impossible to win a game just because someone is better experienced than yourself.The randomness of the game has two sides. It makes every game a bit diffrent and you can't always play the exact same way. If you find a sniper for example you probably want to get some distance from your enemies when engaging. And if you only find an SMG it's the opposite. This also makes the game a little unbalanced as some won't get barly any loot and some will be stacked after just a few minutes.Overall if you are fan of the BATTLE ROYALE genre this is probably one of the best ones out there right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-25,0,0,847,True,Recommended,At the time of writing I have 360 hours in game this game is addictive as hell and really inspires that just one more try mentality as a multiplayer game it doesn't have a set way to play it and therefore offers tonnes of replayability and is a pretty beautiful game. (Especially if you use reshade). My only issue is that I had to purchase an SSD to play the game as the game suffers from a memory leak currently where old hard drives that spin at less than 7400 RPM can't process the game files fast enough to implement the game effectively so if you are buying this game for now at least install it on an SSD9/10 Minor inconvenience withholds it from 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Explain to me how that effects someones stream or is harassment? Kill the person if they're doing that and if they're in your squad don't play with that person again (DUH). Also when you're constantly being thrown into random servers the odds of actually ""stream sniping"" someone is virtually impossible. This isn't like other games where you can find the server name and follow the streamer into it. Who the hell made this decision?Also the broken promise regarding microtransactions. That is pretty goddamn shady. That's bad enough but when there are so many glaring areas that need work ignoring all of that to add a feature you said you wouldn't add until release is a straight kick in the nuts to your supporters. Devs don't forget We made you successful and we can undo that by choosing not to buy anymore games from someone who isn't trustworthy and thinks prioritizing streaming to the point of BANNING legitimate players who may not even be aware the other person is streaming is INSANITY.

2018-09-03,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is popular because it's popular and it's not call of duty. This game does not feel polished. The graphics are dull and generic. The game was fun for several hours because of the high levels of tension with each match and the rewarding feeling of killing opponents and turning them into victims. However the gameplay is repetitive and promotes campy defensive behavior which is not a style of shooting game that I enjoy. Its even difficult to get good at the game because you spend so much time walking and looting and almost no time shooting. The shooting doesn't feel particularly good and doesn't provide good feedback on whether you are close to hitting an enemy especially at range. The game does not perform well either.

Still fun solo. 2 maps a grass land one and a desert based zone.This game is basically if you took games like DayZ H1Z1 or Rust and actually made the movement and control scheme feel 100x more natural. I feel one of the most powerful plus sides to this game is that everything feels fluid to do and not some clunky mess of buttons. This just makes it feel less like a chore to learn and more instinctual.Yes there is an issue with players from countries far away from your server region joining your server ping wise.I feel the new replay + report system will help with cleaning up any domestic or foreign cheaters found in your game.Warning Unless you have a powerful PC the game may not run perfectly though they have made massive optimizations around the beginning of 2018 which make it run a lot smoother.

Well the simple fact is this game was released way too soon even now after FULL release the main lobby barely works matchmaking can leave you wondering if it will ever work. The player controller and loot system is better in DayZ standalone (another game which has apparently entered the battle royale genre) I mean jumping through a window or over a wall can take upwards of 5 attempts GG bluehole (i think they miss spelled Butt Hole but maybe the chinese spellcheck screwed them over) I'm surrounded by 7 guys who all want me dead right now and you guys at bluehole think it's funny to not include auto equip attatchments so i stand there for 10 seconds while I attach an RDS to my AK so some sniffleing little can come knock me out with 1 punch? which btw is what the AWM will do to a guy wearing a T2 helm the most powerful gun in the game can only give someone a headache GG next time i'll shoot paracetamol at the guy to help rez him...

2018-07-23,0,0,124,False,Not Recommended,I struggle to understand why custom games are hosted on a PUBG server with a ten player starting requirement. Its dumb. In games such as CSGO when I want to host a private game with friends the server runs off my computer and friends can join the server that is created. It's a simple peer to peer system. Now I do appreciate that PUBG is more intensive for a sever to run but at least make hosting your own server and option for those who can run it. Also the 10 player requirrment is silly it should only be 2 players to begin. In my honest opinion custom games are great however the devs have once more managed to turn something that should be awsome into something that we all have to complain about because of uncalled for restrictions and stupid limitations to something that had the models of other games been acknowledged could have been excellent.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-30,0,0,1073,False,Recommended,200 HOUR REVIEWOver 300 matches played and I have won about 20 games total.Let's talk about hackers So in game there is a death cam feature that lets you see from the enemy's perspective that killed you. If your playing in a squad you will need to wait until everyone is dead in order to see your death cam. Furthermore you can always see the entire match play out using the absolutely awesome Replay System. It is really fun to watch replays.I have witnessed teammates accuse people of hacking around 25% of my games. I usually will watch the replay in order to learn what types of hacks exist. The bottom line is 99% of hacking accusations are false. Yes that guy put three head shots on you with a M4 at 200 meters. Yes he does miss shots sometimes but he is really that good. Deal with it.In 300 matches I have encountered TWO hackers.OK so now that we have that talk done let's talk about pros and cons.Pros Addictive Looks good and sounds good TONS of fun with a small group of friendsCons As a FPS it still needs some tweaking on the back end and a few major bugs persist.

The lag or whatever it may be is horrendous. One second you are grabing a gun and the next you are 5 away from it and with a bullet in your head. Hackers are everywhere. I have got one shoted with a pistol from miles away. You think you can get in cover? get shot throught cover several times. I dont recommend it. But if you guys still want to try it go ahead.After some time after release my opinion remains the same. The game gets several updates and patches more often compared to other games. It has a new integration which is good. It seems good for the community and the game. Although I know the bulky patches fix little or nothing. I keep having lag... and is not because of my internet.

2017-11-30,0,0,42,True,Not Recommended,Garbage game. Badly optimized super repetitive slow and boring gameplay. The game is also full of hackers and they're not doing anything about it. They also didn't keep on their promises Frequent updates (each month) out of early access in autumn (still in early access and we're in winter now) etc. They keep adding things that are not absolutely necessary to add immediatly (like a ton of new weapon...). Like seriously I'd prefer having an optimized game over useless content. (I say useless because it doesn't matter how many weapons they add to the game the gameplay is always going to be the same one SLOW AND BORING. Also 90% of the weapons they had are crate weapons...) Anyway don't waste your money buying this game. As soon as it gets out of early access I'm gonna charge it back...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-19,0,0,242,True,Recommended,Good game to play with friends I find it pretty boring when solo. Buy it if you have a good gaming PC if you have an average or low end PC don't go for it as it is less optimised and leads to crashes and Immense FPS lags even on gtx 1060 OC. Matchmaking is very fast so you don't have to wait for more than 5 seconds but in some servers shots don't eally register well. Conclusions Do not buy if you don't have a good PC. Fun with friends not much in solo ((Might be my personal experience)) Fast matchmaking! Barely have to wait so its game time! Servers not very well optimised ((But they are good enough to let you play in peace with few lags or delays)),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-20,0,0,145,True,Recommended,This is a great game with great psychics It has slight lag issues since my pc has a bad cpu but it otherwise runs great. In combat it stays decently steady frames. The weapon drops are very fair but it sometimes seems very hard to find even a pistol. The alternate bridge from the military base I think should have a better way to counteract bridge campers. Overall it stays at decent frames has fun mechanics and has many strategies to fight an enemy. I don't see why more people are still waiting to buy this game it predicted the future.

TAKE IT OUT TAKE IT OUT!!!THESE IDIOTS AT BLUEBALL ENTERTAINMENT!I'm gonna take a diarrhea I'll be right back That was a Dr. DisRespect funny moment if you didn't understand the reference.In all seriousness I do recommend this game wholeheartedly. It's by no means perfect. Far from it actually. There are many bugs and quirks some even game breaking but despite all that this game will be responsible for many hours of your life if you give it a chance.I purchased this game back in Christmas of 2017 when it left Early Access along with gifting it to my friend as a ""troll"" gift. PUBG has basically been the only game we've played since then. There is no other game that gets you as adrenaline pumped as being in a top 5 situation in the final circle in PUBG. It took me 60 hours to get my first chicken dinner. It was 2AM and me and my duo partner were literally screaming into the mic as we got the final kill for the chicken dinner. Every game is a different story with different circumstances. Every chicken dinner you win will be a new experience.The truly crowning achievement of PUBG is the gunplay and projectile based ballistics system. There is nothing as satisfying as getting that 500m+ Kar98 headshot kill for the first time. I've tried other battle royale games including the most recent Black Ops 4 and I always end up coming back to PUBG due to that tight gunplay. There's also no BR game out currently that's grounded in realism. H1Z1 and Fortnite feels too arcadey BO4 feels too futuristic and fast. PUBG hits that perfect balance betwen realism and survival in my opinion.Most of the big bugs have been fixed and I can say the terrible optimization claim is greatly exaggerated at this point. It's just become a meme status to say PUBG has terrible optimization (Assassin's Creed Unity anyone?).The three biggest issues have been largely fixed.1. Server tickrate All server tickrates have been upgraded from 20Hz to 60Hz.2. Framerate Framerates are quite stable from a variety of systems I've tested. I've tested on high end GTX 1080 Ti systems and mid tier GTX 1060 systems.3. Desynchronization The latest hotfix has fixed the big desync issues. That's not to say desync doesn't exist anymore. Due to the nature of multiplayer FPS games desync and peeker's advantage will always be a thing.The biggest issue that remains is matchmaking. As of now people in Australia and South America have issues finding servers to play on. NA EU and Asia do not have issues finding servers. If you aren't from the above mentioned 2 regions then you should have no issues jumping straight into a game.I give this game an 8/10. I want to rate it higher but due to bugs and need of more polish I can't out of principle. It has the potential to be 10/10 once all the issues are polished.

2017-12-26,0,0,129,False,Not Recommended,Yeah just because they slap a big 1.0 on this game and relaese it from early access doesnt compensate for The game's just as broken as it was in early access until you get into mid game. There is horrendeous rubber banding from the moment you hit the ground which makes early game pvp a game of pure luck i had so much respect for this game and that respect would have remained if they hadn't realease a game that is still broken under the impression that it is fixed simply because they made a new interface. On a side note they have mad incredible changes to performance which can not go unnoticed.Until this is fixed i would not recommend buying this game unless you spawn well away from anyone and waste 20 minutes playing seculeded simply to avoid the chance of dying from early game rubber banding.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,103,False,Not Recommended,"A good game with good mechanics but god please fix your rules of conduct they make you Brendan Greene look like an actual ing child. Saying like ""Ohhh you'll get banned if you cuss! You'll get banned if you friendly fire!"" will not help at all. I mean surely there are people that are s and friendly fire But guess what? That can simply be fixed with a switch of a button(meaning taking friendly fire out of the game)! If you were aiming for realism on this one then why would you say ""no friendly fire"" if you didn't want them to shoot each other in the first place yet they're able to anyway? Think about that. Now I'm gonna start with these ""rules of conduct"" and rant about them a little bit. Starting off regarding the vulgar language that can't be helped. It's guaranteed that people will be going around shouting ""niggger"" in your game and there is nothing you can do about it Is it wrong to some people? Yes. What can they do? They can simply mute voice chat outside of their party if needed(if that was a feature that is). As for making threats of real world violence and harassment and what not I completely understand but all of this stuff is put together like I'm playing on some god damn DarkRP server in Garry's Mod or something. Now this one's an obvious one reading ""Do not engage in request or offer illegal activities or materials "" like hell I'd do that! Greene makes it sound like he's making some PSA to children under the age of 12 to not break the law. Rule #7 ""Do not impersonate other individuals "" this can easily be fixed with a simple username system in which names cannot be used more than once(which seems to be in place already so I don't see the point of this). Rule #8 ""Do not spam be it in text or voip "" okay there is no actual text chat in PUBG at this very moment so I don't see the point of text spamming at all. As for VOIP once again that can't be helped so this rule entire is also pointless much like Rule #7. Rule #9 seems understandable which basically is ""don't cheat "" but that can easily be fixed with an anti cheat system rather than just putting up a line of text on a website saying ""don't cheat guys it's not cool kid behavior"". Rule #10 they have people of the community enforcing this one I guess which is basically just teaming with other parties is prohibited However one must go to the forums on the actual game website in order to do so and they must gather *video evidence* in order to submit a report. Rule 12 ""no stream sniping "" this also is an easy fix so it's pointless to put here. Most of the livestreams be it on Twitch or YouTube Gaming or Mixer have a little bit of delay so that isn't much of a big deal. Rule #14 seems more of like a stupid remark made by a 12 year old on the internet saying ""Do not share your account don't grant access to your account to anyone else and do not access anyone else's account even with permission "" everyone knows this Brendan so there's no need to actually post this absurd and make a giant list of rules that sound like a child's minecraft/DarkRP server or something like that. Also one more note Greene please stop getting into arguments with other people on Twitter it seriously ruins my respect even more for you and it makes you look more immature. This is simply just some harsh criticism that must be taken care of and I hope he acknowledges his mistakes and corrects them from then on. Overall I really like this game and I think it has great potential but I really do not like the people behind it because they make terrible decisions and I believe something should be done about that. Until things change in the future(which is unlikely at this point in time) I will leave my review as negative.EDIT I decided to throw in a Pros/Cons list just because I feel like itPROS Good BallisticsGood graphicsHigh Player activityCONS Terrible netcode ed up hitboxesHackers.

2017-08-02,0,0,334,True,Recommended,TLDR The game is in a good spot the microtransaction controversy it stupid. PUBG isn't perfect but the best battle royale on the market and even if pubg doesn't last forever you should jump on the bandwagon while you have the chance the game is freaking awesome right now. Since buying PUBG weeks ago i've been having non stop fun. With the latest patch people seem to have changed their views negatively but i feel that most of these people aren't reviewing the current game but what they fear it will become.The largest issue most people have is that the dev's went back on their word and implemented micro transactions before a full release. I understand why people could be put off by this. But i feel that most of these people are either younger children or lack the understand of how development of a game actually works. It cost money and lots of it especially if the devs are wanting to expand in the ways they have seem to let on. I think that if the dev's feel it's time to implement microtransaction's then i trust them as they haven't let us down yet and the game has already grown faster than most other games.now for the gameplay I've never been hooked to a game so fast in my life. I luckily fought my way to the top 10 in my first game i played and oh boy was that an adrenline rush. I was hooked from then on as i migrated to duo's and squads where i found exactly where i wanted to play. 4 man squads are some of the most fun i've had in an online game and it has been a true emotional rollercoster. I've had many hilarious moments with the friends i've made with just as many heart breaks due to a thrown game.(I don't have any friends that i play with i use the pubg discord to find groups so solo players can play squads too) I've yet to find any game breaking bugs in over 80 hours of play and i don't seem to have any hit registration problems ( I tend to stay on na servers where i live) and am starting to beleive that the people complaining honestly suck and are trying to blame the game.looting can be rng based but i've only really had problems when landing in a low loot population area. The reason you see so many people drop military and school is because this game is high risk high reward and that's where the best loot is. I see no problem with having loot scarcely located in the lower end loot spots and if you want a better chance at the gear you want then you should have to fight for it.end game is much more tactical than early/mid game and i feel that a large amount of people that say the circle is rng lack experience in the late game. If i play safe and sit on the edge's of the circle its bound to close on the opposite side of me some times. Most people who win position intelligently. Honestly the game is about 70% strategy 20% skill and 10% luck. from my experiences the game isn't perfect but it's obviously one of the best games out thats why the queue is instant lol. Don't let the addition of purely cosmetic microtransactions stop you from playing a game that has what so many other games lack Damn good gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Besides the hackers this game is basically one of the best games i've played and i would recommend it to any who would like to purchase a fun action packed game But be aware the game is still in early access and is working through many of the bugs and cheaters at a fast rate.Another opinion i'll have to add to the game is that because of OC having no players PUBG has decided to get rid of OC servers. In my opinion this is one of the reasons i have stopped playing the game as i dislike having around 200 ping everygame i play (gives me a massive disadvantage to other players) let alone still seing hackers until this day If you live in Oceania don't buy this game unless you are going to take it competitively and go into faceit games that are Oceania based.10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-01,0,0,83,True,Not Recommended,1. It's going to be the usual gambling with crates and paid keys (2 50$ each).I'm totally fine with microtransactions when you actually know what you get for your money. Selling a set of costume for 5 10 bucks or so would be completely acceptable. Slot machines are not.2. It's an Early Access game. It has many problems fixing those and then adding more content and game mechanics which has been promised before should be the priority.According to Steamspy the game sold around 5 350 000 copies so far that means after the 30% cut of Steam they made roughly 100 million dollars before taxes. They barely had to spend on any marketing either so my guess is that's enough revenue to get this thing actually finished without the need for a few more millions.3. They said they want that money to launch the first PUBG eSports event during Gamescom.As I've said before they have enough money so might as well fund this tournament by themselves. Even then we still haven't got our final product what we paid for.Competitive games tend to have a team composition with selected weapons and roles the gamemodes or the maps usually even out the chances for both participants and the outcome of a match comes down on pure skill and/or teamwork.Here from the very moment of your feet touching the ground RNG takes a HUGE part in the experience. It affects your loot it affects your positioning by the placement of the circle.When you can camp inside a 3 level building with an SKS and at least lvl2 armor on you for like 20 minutes while others have to run kilometers to be inside the playzone or even better drive there so everyone hears you and knows your position before you even realise there are others in the area than the chances are far from equal.I have no idea how it's going to work without altering the gamemode or the loot system. If they do than it's not really the same game anymore. If they don't than it's not competitive gaming but a little get together sponsored by the devs.Oh and of course the game is unfinished it has many problems yadayada. Altough i haven't mentioned many of them especially from a technical standpoint they are still there and should be taken care of before holding competitions with prize pools and such.4. The devs promised there will be no microtransactions until the game is finished.No comment on this this was a straight up lie.Now it feels like the Early Access warning has been just stamped on the store page and has no actual meaning anymore since the game is being treated now as a complete product or at least that's how it feels like so be aware.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-18,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,Well often I try to get 30 or 50 hours on most games more depending on what type of game it is. For PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS it didn't take me long on whether I enjoyed this game or not. I do enjoy my fair share of battle royale game The Culling (before the terrible patches) was enjoyable Arma 3 BR was awesome and H1Z1 BR was also great. This game tries to bring these set pieces to the next level and it horribly fails. The optimization in this game makes it unplayable at times. I understand that its a working process but my god this game is unplayable at times. The customization is actually really cool but if you don't get a viechle the game can turn out to be a running simulator. It kinda depends some landings you can have a fun instense gun fight (if the game doesn't break down) or you can be running around just looking for loot or someone to fight. Also for me it can get tiring pretty fast and for a BR game it actually is kinda predictable. Half of the time you get shot by some dude camping or you get a couple of kills and have your car tip over for no reason and kill you. Overall this game is 3/10. It is below average and I suggest to wait till the game is complete to play it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Being one of the last few survivers or even being place 1 can be a thrill as you can see I have played quite some hours myself. What so ever the performance is so horrible that PUBG is used as a BENCHMARK now a days. Half a year ago the performance was bad but the performance got even worse from patch to patch. If you dont have a mid highend gaming PC like an i7 7700k or coffelake i7 8700k CPU + a good GPU such as an NVIDIA 1060 and and better you wont be able to enjoy the game because it is literally unplayable. If you have a worse GPU as mentioned you will have to play on very low medium settings and still have lags and loading textures. When your game isn't bussy crashing and you are even able to play at all.Don't get me wrong it's not all bad about the game but unless they fix the performance it's not recommendable at all.EDIT 12.02.2018 YOU HAVE TO SPEND REAL MONEY TO OPEN THE LOOT CRATES YOU ALREADY BOUGHT WITH IN GAME MONEY....WOW WHAT A SCAM,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-31,0,0,117,False,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS Jest to gra akcji z wieloma elementami fantazji przykładem tego jest jazda motorem po prostej drodze (zazwyczaj wyjebie ciebie w powietrze w najmniej odpowiednim momencie a następnie zdechniesz). Przedstawię wam plusy oraz minusy tej gry (według mnie). PLUSY Gra jest ciężka do ogarnięcia system strzelania jest trudny. System loot'u przyjemnie przeszukuje się lokacje (chyba że jest to jebany mirramar). Leśna mapa ma wiele świetnych miejsc do trenowania swoich umiejętności np. Sosnóvkę szkołę bądź szpital. Jeśli masz kolegów do gry to warto kupić PUBG'a szybko ci się nie znudzi. Kooperacja jest to gra taktyczna a nie czysto skillowa jak np. H1Z1 musisz przemyśleć każdy swój atak chyba że ktoś nagle wybiega ci na ryj w budynku... Na squadach albo duo bez kooperacji nie wygrasz. Normalna społeczność (w większości) ciężko tutaj znaleźć tyle dzieci co na przykład w CS GO. Modyfikacje broni. Możliwość otworzenia skrzyni za darmo (wystarczy grać i zdobywać punkty). Gra w nią fenomenalny gracz ""Sokół"". MINUSY Nie możesz wybrać na jakiej mapie chcesz grać. Dodali spierdoloną mape ""mirramar"" której duża część graczy nie lubi a większość serwerów jest właśnie na niej. Skiny do broni niedługo stanie się jak CS (według mnie)... Spotkasz w niej dużo nieogarniętych polaczków np. Natec'a. CereS dokucza. Twórcy to rasiści czarni ludzie przyciągają bombardowania.

It's plagued by desync terrible servers horrible optimization all around most people just use low graphics to keep a high framerate regardless of hardware. Best of all is Brendan Greene won't acknowledge any of it. He thinks the game is in such a good spot that they can push it out of early access. It still plays better than most online early access games but it's the blind leading the deaf in their dev department. Instead of optimizing the game they push new weapons and maps.There's also no region lock or latency limits so you get Asian players in NA servers and they continually desync and lag all around while hacking and using aimbots.

I played maybe six or so games tonight should have won the last one but was destroyed by two hackers. Watched the death cam to see one of them go full auto at me from between 100 200m hit every shot at full auto he then gets up his buddy whom I knocked out. I go and watch a team members death cam (they were killed by the guy I knocked out) and this fella gets up uses an item for about .002 of a second and then is at full health and proceeds to shoot my team mate through a car. You literally cannot see my team mate from the players perspective.At this point PUBG is a broken game and must be fixed. With over 450 hours in PUBG and thousands of hours in shooters in general I would compare PUBG in its current state to the disgrace that was known as WarZ.Yes Bluehole you are doing alot to combat hackers **BUT YOU ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH**. Also sidenote as if you'd ing bend over for the whiney es that were leaving fog matches and complaining about it and remove the map from the game. That was my favourite map and you ruined it.

2017-05-01,0,0,36,True,Recommended,Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough 2 cups all purpose flour 1 pinch salt 1 teaspoon olive oil 2 eggs 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese softened 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 1/2 cup provolone cheese shredded 1 egg 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto Alfredo Cream Sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic crushed 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce 2 cups heavy cream 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil 2 eggs and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth 8 to 10 minutes add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese cream cheese mozzarella cheese provolone cheese egg and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream raise the heat to high and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile in a separate saucepan warm the marinara sauce over medium low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered stirring occasionally until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game although at full launch still needs masses amount of work and is still really in early access. The new map hasn't been throughly playtested enough with invisible walls lying everywhere to run you vehicle in to I also feel that it's badly designed unlike the original map. The sudden upgrade of engine is causing more problems than it has fixed plus the severe lack of any real attempt to stop cheating before it can affect a game has changed what should have been a really decent game to something a bit off.

2017-03-25,4294967295,2,227,True,Recommended,"Anyone Downvoting this game by far really is idiotic. ""gameplay feels clunky too many bugs hackers not well optimized"". Fellas the Game is in Alpha for god's sake. It's already running better than H1Z1 and all other end stage Battle Royale games/mods. By far it's already passed up CS GO in popularity and already surpassing League of legends in viewers for Twitch. Reason For My Upvote People are crying about recieving Bans for honking their horns around said streamer and weren't aware. First off the bans being dished out are investigated to a fair extent. Keep in mind that they view the games you leave after already joining a lobby until people ""Coincidentally"" stay in that one lobby out of dozens they've let to harass these people trying to stream a game to their fans. Accept the ban and stop acting like idiots. Simple. Having to argue it out with the developers and being stubborn about getting caught won't help. Negativly reviewing the game for this said reason isn't right either. I think these are being dished out fairly. That's that. Developers are pumping out very much needed updates and since the release the optimization they've worked on the game is incredible. I went from running the game at 30 50 frames with Low/Medium settings to 60 100 FPS on Medium/Ultra settings even while streaming since the release of the game. They are slowing down on very small updates so they can dish out on bigger updates. This means there will be less patches on fixing things since they've been working on bugs/optimizations non stop. Monthly Updates will mean more content and a smoother experience. They've been pumping out patches rather than cosmetics more than anything. People are a bit flustered about the gamescon crates but in my opinion that's stupid. The game has grown so much in these past few months that it's already about to show an appearance in the Esports scene as an Alpha state game which is amazing. Give them credit.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Well on to the actual review now.Now there's a lot good to say about this game. But of course to every good game there's the bad parts and to the bad game a good part. We'll talk about both.Pros Addictive gameplay. Your only opponents are actual people not AI zombies (coughcough) A mix of simple AND complex controls for both types of players. Custom games that are almost always available to join! Clothing variety (my guy looks like a technician for some reason lmao) Weapon/vehicle variety It's a game that anybody can play learn and eventually win. You don't HAVE to buy crates. It's optional.

It's impossible to have good luck. The devs can get a little crazy some times...And those are the only cons.I decided to exclude the whole thing about people getting banned for 'stream sniping' because it's absurd. If a streamer was in a random solo game and not custom you'd have to have a load of bad luck to be in the same one as him.Also this 'stream sniping' thing could stop if the streamer never said where he was going and block out his map.So yeah. Those are my thoughts. I recommend this game to anybody who has played H1Z1 or anyone who hasn't.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you haven't picked it up you've obviously seen gameplay and have decided either it doesn't look like it's for you or you're just too poor to buy it at the moment in which case I'll see you around the battlegrounds once you can get it!Update 2018/07/07 Seeing a lot of negative reviews lately about skins and optimization skins are optional and a GTX 760 with an Intel Pentium will run this game at higher then 60fps on low medium graphics (if you need proof add me up would love to show you). and I run this game maxed at 4k with a 1070 and an I7 7700 with around 80 150fps Anyone saying that the game is un runnable has a pre 2000's pc and I don't know what they're on about.Update 2018/10/26 Games going strong UI and gameplay smoothest it's been and overall a great game definitely a contender for GOTY 2018 not even any competition.Update 2019/01/16 Recent parachute changes and the new Vikendi map were a nice change and made the game feel a lot smoother took a little getting used to but it was definitely for the best. There's definititely a reason why PUBG's stayed on top of the player count on Steam and it's because it's damn good.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-18,0,0,51,True,Recommended,Awesome game with huge potential and a relatively short projected early access period. Once they add first person only servers which the devs have confirmed are coming I will be playing this game A LOT more. If you played and enjoyed the battle royale mod for Arma 3 are looking for something a little less arcadey than H1Z1 or want a game to experience the battle royale game mode for the first time this is the game for you! Keep in mind that this IS currently in early access so the performance might not be the best at times and you will experience bugs from time to time. For me none of that has been game breaking and the superb gameplay makes up for any of the early access drawbacks. 100% recommended!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-18,0,0,587,True,Not Recommended,"The ""Battle Royale"" game mode popularized by the Arma 2 &amp Arma 3 mod(s) &amp most recently the wildly popular H1Z1 King of The Kill makes it's return in PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS. The frantic looting and uncertainty of each game although repetitive feels fresh and new each new game you play. Weapon balance ballistics and hit registration feel natural however horrible de sync plagues nearly every game to some degree making what would be a refreshing experience into an infuriating one nearly irregardless of skill. As with most early access games PUBG also has it's fair share of bugs. Although very few feel game breaking and even those so seldom occur it isn't the biggest detriment to having a good time playing. The bugs pale in comparison to the persistent and unyielding de sync issues which we can only hope will be fixed much sooner rather than later. The developers appear to have a pretty clear line of site on what they want to achieve with this game and the steady stream of patches are always a good sign. Weekly patches to address often small and insignificant bugs/issues and monthly updates that focus more on big ticket issues such as new weapons or vehicles and performance and stability upgrades. Sadly atrocious de sync makes this potentially great game only enjoyable some of the time.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-31,0,0,66,True,Not Recommended,biggest complaint for me is the server performance. I dont have the best internet but my ping is not horrible. games like overwatch give me 50 60ms to there servers. but bluehole seems to just have some bad tik rate on there servers as i have had many server dsync issues where i will say open a door and get dysynced and be off to the side of the door. I bought this game when it was quite new and had hopes the server performance would get better but it didnt really change. the game performance changed in an odd way and many settings didnt change perofmance at all. Its a fun game but if they want to come out of early accesse they better start spending some of that loads of money on at least a 30hz tik rate servers. bf1 does 60hz with 64 players so 30hz is well with in the possibilitys exspecailly after all the money they have got for this game. but i fear they will put xbox server performance ahead of us pc users. in the end i am glad i just payed 20$ for this and not full triple a price,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-29,0,0,566,True,Recommended,"Introduction I'm honestly shocked how decent this game is. As someone who has played a decent amount of H1Z1 lots of Arma way too much Rust and don't tell anyone how much DayZ it's rare to be impressed these days. Almost every ""pre release"" game is a buggy pile of that gives me instant buyer's remorse. This game is a welcome refresher.Below is my quick summary of PLAYERUNKNOWN S Battleground (Let s be honest the worst part about this game is the name)The Good Quick matchmakingPre game lobby is entertaining since you get weapons. It s chaos!Spawning is novel jumping out of a plane as you fly across the map is a great twistHuge variety of weapons and attachments possibly the most I ve ever seen in an FPSGreat map it seems realistic with good building placement and lots of varietyAt $29.99 it s decently priced and worth every penny. I probably wouldn t say that at $39.99..The Bad It seems a bit laggy at times. You ll hit a function button and nothing will happen. You mash it a few times and you ll actually pick up the item. No way to check your ping and understand your lag. If I m lagging.. Tell meOdd vehicle placement.. They are often in the woods or in random spots never in parking lots or garages.. You know the places where people would actually leave working cars..Vehicle desync.. It s not Arma bad desync but it s still a little wacky. Why can t anyone figure this out?Jumping. Sometimes I can jump over something.. Sometimes I can t. It s weird and inconsistent.Conclusion Buy it. It s worth the dough. It s not perfect (but what is these days) but I d wager a bet it s the best KOTH shooter out right now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-26,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,I was waiting for full release to write this review. I really wanted this game to be amazing and in some aspects it is. The gunplay is fun the looting and running is fun tactics are fun this is a great game to play with friends BUT its being ruined by the ignoring of bugs and ridiculous features that lead to insanely infuriating moments that still havent been addressed even in 1.0.The parachuting is random sometimes it slows you so much you might as well leave because there will be a heavily armed welcome party when you reach the ground. Sometimes it just leaves you hanging in midair for no reason the parachut isnt snagged gravity still exists but lo and behold you will die from being shot like a sitting duck or just from the fall damage you take after. The vehicles are deadly. Bikes flip on flat ground cars going 0.1mph will kill you if they get within a half metre area of you including if they are just moving alongside you. Sometimes (although this is rare) they just dont start for no reason full gas no damage 3 seconds into the game? nah doesnt wanna work so it doesnt. The terrain and urban areas are ridiculous. Aiming through huge hole a crumbled wall? bullets wont go through it. Wanna climb something while running away at 1mph? you are just thrown over it no option to climb ontop you have to stand still for a few seconds for that one (although I will give them a pass since vaulting is new to the 1.0 update). 10 degree incline hill? go around this is too tough for your puny legs to walk up. Aiming around a tree or doorway with your gun clearly able to be shouldered and aimed? Nope you gotta move further out wouldnt wanna have you using that cover now would we?The zones on the new map are stupid most of the time. The hills make it so you take ages to run to where you need to be. Even if you start as soon as it is revealed you will only just get there in time.Picking things up is garbage. Aiming at the foregrip on the floor infront of you? I think you need that level 1 backpack 15 feet away just outside the door instead. Within arms reach but wanna pick it up through the tab menu to avoid getting the wrong thing? sorry its magically out of your reach now.Grenades dont go where the UI trajectory tracker shows and they constantly kill through walls and floors and somehow flash through solid objects.You may think these are uncommon once in a while problems but no 9/10 games I experience them and 5/10 I die due to them.

2018-07-08,0,0,161,False,Recommended,PUBG is a very frustrating game to love. The physics and gameplay mechanics feel great and it has a stealthy tense quality that many other battle royale games lack. That kind of slow paced very intense gameplay is why I play and love PUBG.However the developers have...strange priorities to say the least. That the game still runs this poorly so long after its EA launch is absolutely unacceptable. The microtransactions are un fun and useless all the skins are boring and the event pass is honestly insulting.But again it offers an incredibly fun kind of BR experience that is hard to find elsewhere right now.If you do buy this game understand a few things 1) It is very very difficult at first2) It will likely not run great on your computer if you have anything less than an i5 6000 or Ryzen and a GTX 1060/RX 4803) You will have to put up with unpatched bugs and terrible optimization for what appears to be the life of the game.If like me you can accept these faults because PUBG is such a unique battle royale experience then you will have a great time. If the realistic feel isn't as important to you or if you have no patience for bad developer choices there are far better BR games available.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you don't want to buy anything in game just don't buy it.Perhaps you sell the crate in the steam market.I think this is a good point to get back a part of your money which you paid to the game. Game I think this game is the best game I ever played. I paid 30 but its worth more in my opinion.If you play I suggest you play with your friend or with a squad but if you want to get more money than in squad or with a friend you can go alone. *Edit 2017.12.29 Try to avoid stress situations to survive. If you use a weapon change the fire mode if you can! Take one of each grenade to increase your chances of survival. Pick up (the higher type) helmet or vest to get less damage than normal damage. Pick up (the higher type) backpack to store more item in your inventory. Optimization I know that this game at Early Access Status now but I think it's good enough.

2019-01-07,0,0,323,False,Not Recommended,"I really wanted to say something postive about this game. But I really can't. I played this game from the start I had to leave the game. This game made me enjoy Fortnite. And I could never forgive Bluehole. It was a huge kick in the face for a moble counterpart for this game be 10 times better than the original. And still is. I see people playing PUBG Mobile more than the PC version of this game. It's really dissapointing. I've been playing PlayerUnkown's Battle Royale gamemodes since ARMA 2. Back when it was a mod for a already popular mod. What is really sad to say is that Epic Games was able to make a game of the same format that is infinitely better than this pile of garbage. Two years since it's been out and it still has all the problems that I left it for in the first place. The only good thing about this game is that they fixed the horrible parachuting mechanics and revamped it. Honestly they need to do that for everything in this game. The hit registery is ing god awful a shotgun blast to the face doesn't kill someone but they can shoot five bullets into your feet and you die. At least Fortnite and other games can get away with this because they have a shield mechanic that works hand in hand with the health system. So a shotgun blast that deals ""109"" damage to the head can exist. In PUBG this really can't apply. Even if you have helmets and body armor it never adds more health or a ""shield bar"" on your screen. Only on your HUD. Making it really inconvenient to check your armor. Plus some armor breaks faster than others. It's all a huge clunky mess that is still under a ""$29.99"" Price point. And it even is more infuriating when the game is a huge ing mess and you add microtransactions and A ING BATTLE PASS. At least Fortnite is a working stable and a functioning game. Despite the horrible fandom and it's cartoony graphics. Fornite is a fully devoloped game and it works for the most part F L A W L E S S L Y. Yes if you don't like building Or that the third person camera kinda throws people off. I get it. It's not for everyone. But for people to defend this game time and time again is really sad. The only thing that I can really say is that if you like games like PUBG go play Blackout.

2017-07-30,0,0,205,False,Not Recommended,Overall this is a great game. However there are a few minor drawbacks to this game.1 the game engine is very unstable and will often freeze for a few seconds (sometimes while in a firefight) and can even hard crash with 0 warning.2 in my opinion the gane volumes are terrible let me explain. If you want to enjoy using turtle beaches and hear people around or near you to have the edge in game you need to turn the game 'effect' volume up however if you do that the bullet sounds goes up with it and its WAAAY to ing loud and will scare the out of you all that for just barely being able to hear someone walking not even creeping around good luck hearing that. So you either have to rely on eyesight (which you'll instantly be at a disadvantage) OR you get ear Terrible feature and i hope it gets fixed along with the engine.Other than those two complaints the game is a lot of fun and even more fun with friends and if they can fix the sound and the game engine i would recommend but as it stands today i don't reccomend buying it right now. wait until the full release and the fixes.Update 23/12/17 the game runs worse and sli is taken out now DONT BUY!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Right after landing you to search the houses for loot which I enjoy a lot doing. The only things I find disturbing is that the game is not very well optimized but the game is still in early access so it is reasonable (hope they optimize it well till the release).Other than performance issues the game is really fun to play and I recommend it to all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-28,0,0,1308,False,Not Recommended,*** Update Feb 2018 ***Update on game post launch Game is now FULL of cheaters. No exaggeration here when I say that 80 90% or more have cheaters in them. This is in OC for us but I have heard other servers are also quite bad. The higher you score in your ranking means you get placed in games with more experienced players which also means you are put in games with more and more cheaters as their rank increases.Until BlueHole/PUBG Corp implements region locking on china/hardware bans on cheaters the game is 100% not worth buying. Your lobby all chat will be filled with people speaking mandarin and games filled with quite obvious cheaters. PUBG Corp have admitted that 90% of cheaters and cheats are coming from China but are refusing to implement proper punishment as yet aside from an account ban meaning the cheaters buy another copy of the game and keep doing it.If and when this problem is properly fixed or heavily reduced then the game might be worthwhile playing. I've currently got around 1100hrs and do enjoy the game but it has gotten far too to play.______________________________________This game is addictive at times fun and at other times rage inducing. The current state is early access so I'll try to keep that in mind. Currently players (at least in OC) will experience server lag disconnects and generally laggy gameplay. The devs assure us they have the highest quality servers but it won't stop you from getting shop around corners and sometimes having your own shots not register when in a gunfight before you die. The desync is pretty awful and there is still plenty of bugs and crashing is a common thing.The RNG of the spawns seems wildly imbalanced. I understand the nature of the randomness but I've seen the extremes of it too many times to thing it works. Same goes for the play area circles. The weapon balancing is welcome but always seems to leave one or two weapons far surperior or broken. And another big problem is cheaters/hackers which there is plenty of. Final verdict decent game with cool weapons and gameplay but not worth buying in its current state. Perhaps in the future when the BattlEye system is more comprehensive in blocking cheaters and more bugs are patched out with better balancing the game will be much more enjoyable and worthwhile.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Admittedly the level of hacking fluctuates you may even go a whole day without someone aimbotting/speedhacking/wallhacking your sorry butt but then there are days when every game you watch the deathcam to see you being shot through a wall a hill even multitap headshot by a pistol at 400m...(great idea the deathcam now you can be 100% sure the hacker you only used to suspect of hacking is hacking...it's like rubbing salt into the wound)...The only way BH will clean up it's act and be proactive about stopping hacking will be when they see sales drop off because of the nuisance value.

2017-04-07,0,0,317,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS REVIEWWhen it comes to battle royal games knowing your surroundings or having decent items can win you the game and this game shows that in a great way. Currently this game exceeds H1Z1's King of the Kill in regards to gameplay and popularity. I have been playing this game for just under 50 hours and have enjoyed every moment of it even though you will die alot even at earlier stages of a match. Winning is a thrill and a challenge at time which takes time to be good at something of this genre. I have not played many games like this due to be a MMO veteran but when I play this game with friends the fun never ends. First off the gameplay reminds me of the old times of ARMA 2 which I loved so much and even though there might not be loads of things to do I am glad that the developers did not charge full price for the game compared to others.My first thoughts when jumping out of the plane not knowing where to go and hoping no one would follow me were scary but after some time understanding the map and went up the ranks faster than I thought I would. I have only won 1 game in solo which made my own heart not stop beating for sometime due to the thrill of excitment rushing through my mind when that last shotgun shell tuck my enemie's last breath and jumping out of my chair knowing that I won. This is a very addictive game and not matter if you are alone or with friends there is a different experience when your feet touch the ground. The problem I have with the game at the moment is the rubber banding through walls server lag and even the worst FPS drop I have ever seen. I do hope they get it sorted but when you start a match and the number of people go down to about 70 people I get a good 60 fps most of the time. The other disadvantage to the game is the slow motion of landing on the ground whilst in a paruchute and the slow start to find the best loot to take your foes not to mention the god aweful melee mechanics in the game where even punching someone they start lagging all over the place or the hit marker does count. For example there was one moment where I punched someone who landed in the same area as me so better take out the competition quickly but he managed to kill me even though I punched him more times than anything.These are only small issues to the game which thankfully are being fixed by the developers so they are listening to us. So in my opinion the game is worth every penny due to the addictive and adrenaline fun action you get with each match. Maybe as an alternative just wait a few months for the patches to come through to fix the game performance but other than that the gameplay is amazing. Not to forget that this game is an awesome way to make friends which having a mic is mandatory is you are playing duo or squad. PROS *Very Large Map*Good variety of loot*Customization of Weaponry*Character Customization with rewards from crates*No Microtransactions*Quick Matchmaking*Plenty of Vehicles*Option for First Person or Third Person*Realistic Gameplay*Active/Talkative Community (but press Crtl+T when on the plane to mute annoyance ' _ )*Sounds of guns are helpful to tell you were someone is clearly.CONS*Lack of variety of guns*FPS Performance*Forces to play game in very low settings for decent fps*Server Lag*Terrible Enviroment Sound Performance (not gun sounds)*Rubber Banding (rarely happens)*Disconnections from a matchs due to host leaving,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-01,0,0,344,False,Not Recommended,PUBG Playerunknown's battlegrounds is by far fundamentally the worst game i have ever downloaded and this includes free games! First of all the movement and just simple slowness of the game is literally mind boggling. It feels like im playing console on my pc. Secondly the sheer amount of buildings and hidey places in this game is disqusting.. ive made it to the top ten 3 5 times and have yet to even see a single player and even if you are to be shot by someone theres no mechanic in the game to be able to the where the shot came from what kindve gun infact does the game even have mechanics? ive landed in the most populated places multiple times and always seem to get killed by someone just hiding in a room or hiding on the roof. The sound ques in the game are absolutely garbage considering the red zone is almost always in the distance but makes just enough noise to drown out anyone moving. The parachuting in the game feels like they used a farming simulator to create. The map is literally so large that a game will take around 40 minutes to complete and thats just the top ten who knows how slow it is from there on. Im not a person who hates games at all playing a wide variety of games from OW to wow COD h1z1 witcher god of war all kinds of games and i have never had less fun than i have had playing PUBG! If i were to say there were good things about the game they would be extremely minor such as the gun models and variety of guns keeps each landing fresh and spontaneous however almost every AR is worthless without a scope. The only thing i really enjoyed about PUBG was the cars. And why do you think this games so popular? Is it the large streamers that play it is it because of the realism or is it because you just dont enjoy other battle royale games? If it is realism i just dont see it. If i were shot in the back in real life i would know i was shot in the back and would turn around in PUBG you could literally be shot in the face and have no idea where the bullet came from. Anyways if you read this all I would like to know what you think?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There may be a few bugs or fps drops but if you aren't trying to be an esports hall of fame twitch streamer you'll have fun. The worst part to me is how great scopes are and how much of an advantage that is.The biggest issue of this game is that it's arma stripped down.It looks like arma plays like arma and only has some ui improvement and slightly better mechanics then arma.Otherwise you can get arma 3 and play pubg mod dayz mod gta mod tons of other mods as well as arma.The instant queues because of the massive player base is the only thing that really separates this from arma.

The pacing the intensity the level playing field etc. Also squading up with pubbers you don't know through the matchmaking system is actually really fun and a viable way to play (most of the time anyway).

2018-01-20,2,2,366,False,Recommended,"PUBG玩了快350个小时了 感慨颇深 I have played PUBG for 350 hours and I have lots of things to say.首先 这款游戏的确是好游戏 这一点我们必须承认 我的推荐是给这款游戏的 Firstly this game is really nice we must admit it.IT IS A GOOD GAME.但是现在PUBG的游戏环境实在实在是太差了 But the enviroment of this game is too bad.为什么 因为外挂 但是又不仅仅是因为外挂 Why?Because of those hackers.(But it's not just the bag of hackers).现在 PUBG里外挂已经十分猖獗了 加速 自瞄 透视 无后坐 锁血 甚至是路飞挂 一拳超人挂 Nowadays the hackers in PUBG are very rampant.Speeding up Automatic aiming perspective men no recoil Invincible men and even ""Monkey D Luffy"" hackers ""One Punch Man"" hackers!这些外挂严重破坏了我们的游戏体验 These hackers have destoried our experence of playing.但是我们对此无可奈何 But we have nothing to do about it.诚然 在PUBG里 90 以上的外挂都来自中国 Truely more than 90 hackers are from China in PUBG.虽然我无法代表全体中国人 但是我还是要向各位热爱PUBG的玩家说一声 对不起 Although I can't represent all of Chinese I still want to say to all of you who love PUBG SORRY.在中国 我们将这些开挂的人称为 孤儿 神仙 我真的希望那些孤儿别再做这样的烦人的事情 In China we call the hackers 'orphans' and 'gods' .I really hope those orphans do not do such annoying things in the game.哦对了 我来解释一下 孤儿 ""神仙 这两个词的含义吧 Oh I think I should tell you what's the meaning of them.孤儿象征着我们全体绿色玩家对开挂者的父母的亲切问候 这是在游戏里是一个贬义词 Orphans symbolize the cordial greetings of all us to the parents of those hackers.This is a derogatory word in the game.神仙代表外挂无所不能 在游戏里 'Gods' means they can do everything.(in game)我想让你们明白事是不是所有中国人都是开挂的 也不是所有中国人都进游戏就开始骂 CAO NI MA'的 I hope to let you understand that not every Chinese is hacker and not everyone who is in the game like to say'CAO NI MA' everywhere.虽然从整体上看 我们的素质的确不高 As a whole we do not have a high quality.但是这就是你们听到中文或者被打死就开始喊 曹尼玛中国人 的理由 But is it the reason of you to say 'Fu.ck you Chinese' when you hearing Chinese or be shot by us?????我们是真的很委屈 你们为什么这么做 We are really grieved.Why do you do this??我理解你们被挂打死的心情 但是我们也在被外挂怼啊 I comprehend your mood when you knocked down by hackers but we are shot by them too!现在我认为在PUBG里的有如下的这几种人 以爱国为理由恶意组队的红衣军 外挂 试图诛仙的玩家 骂中国人的玩家 骂外国人的中国人 一脸委屈关掉语音的中国人 起哄高喊 China NO.1""和 Taiwan NO.1""的外国人和事不关己的围观群众 I consider that there are these kinds of people in PUBG the Malicious teams of 'army with red clothes' and they usually use 'loving our country' to be their reason HACKERS players who want to kill 'gods' players who scold the Chinese Chinese who scold the other the Chinese who turn off the phonetics with Injustice faces foreigners booing and shouting ""China NO.1"" and ""Taiwan NO.1"" and a crowd of onlookers.也许大多数人听不懂现在中国人在广场和飞机上到底在说什么 Maybe lots of you can't understand what are Chinese speaking on the squae and the plane.我能给你们举出一些真实的例子 I can tell you some ture examples.谁在那边放歌 关上 Who is playing songs??!Switch off!能听得到么 Can you hear me?来 左右左右站着的是煞笔啊 站着的是煞笔 Come on!Left right left right the standing men are motherf.uc.k.ers.(this is a sentence of a song)机场卖挂 机场卖挂 Sell Sell how to be a hacker in airport sell sell (someone usually say this when he want to go to airport.Oh he must be very low.)是中国人的跳机场 中国人跳机场 紧接着会有一大群中国人开始骂这个喊话的 Flying to school if you are Chinese!Flying to school if you are Chinese!(and Then there will be a large group of Chinese start to scold the speaker.CAO NI MA fu.ck you bi.tch your head is broken?!)总之 希望你们理解 我们也很讨厌红衣军 外挂 我们也希望有一个绿色的游戏环境 All in all I hope you to know we don't like 'army with red clothes' and hackers.We wanna a green game environment.但是直到有一天 我突然看到有人说要锁中国区 steam上甚至出现了呼吁锁区的讨论组 But one day I suddenly find someone saying that please lock Chinese region!!!And there are even some groups appeal for LOCKING REGION???????当时我的心真的拔凉拔凉的 My heart was nearly frozen at that time.啊 的确 是我们不好 是中国的外挂太多了 Oh really.It's our bag there are too many Chinese hackers.但是我能确定一点 一旦锁区 PUBG就会变成第二个H1Z1 But if you do so PUBG will become the second H1Z1.而且外挂的数量肯定会变的更多 And the number of hacker will rise more.他们开得起一天 100的外挂 就用得起一个月 30的VPN They can use the program of hacker which spend them 100 per day they can have 30 per month VPN.而且如果锁区 就会给红衣军正当的理由 And if the region is locked it will give the Red Army a justifiable reason.所以 请不要锁区 这是一个真正热爱PUBG的中国玩家的心声 So please don't lock region this is the heart of a Chinese player who really loves PUBG.我的英语不是很好 我只是个学生 雅思5.0的水平(虽然已经能申请加拿大的大学了 My English is not good I am a student I only get 5.0 in IELTS. Although the mark is enough for me to apply for the university in Canada)如果有错的地方 请原谅我 If there are somthing wrong please forgive me.如果你真的理解我的这篇评测 请帮我顶上去 让更多的人看到这篇评测 If you really understand my review please help it to top up and let more people see this review.哦 还有 虽然我的头像很滑稽 但是我现在超认真的说 Oh what is more though my avatar is very funny I am very serious!!!!!谢谢qwq 233333333 emmmmmmmmmm wwwwwwwwwwwwThank you sir as.s we can",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-29,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,I deeply regret paying so much for this game only to realize how incredibly boring it is. You basically just sit around for half an hour camping doing nothing then when you come out in the end it's a gamble of pure chance whether or not you win. Yet if you try to make things fun by being more aggressive you lose before getting anywhere near close to the final few people because you end up being an easy target out in the open for all the other people who are camping like you're supposed to. The gunplay is also very boring. PUBG may have gotten the battle royale craze going but there are a lot of other battle royale games on the market that are much more fun and action packed rather than this camping simulator. This game is a total waste of money and I would not reccommend it at all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-30,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,this game could be the worst case of wasted potential ever.i bought this fairly early on and for a while i played it every day. i had 166 hours in it and spent a lot of my free time playing.at first i was willing to write off the problems in the game (and there have ALWAYS been many) due to the game being early access. after all if you buy games advertised in that state you can't expect complete polish. but as time went on and as bluehole (or is it PUBG corp now?) made more and more money i was increasingly unwilling to forgive them. as the game transitioned from early access to retail it got even worse.the first problem for me was how appallingly badly made the game was. the game is horribly optimized runs badly and yet also looks awwful. it's rife with stock assets that at first i was willing to write off as placeholders. as time went on i increasingly started to realize that the issue was simply that bluehole was not willing to hire an adequate team. this is the unreal engine a VERY common one and so finding developers familiar with it would not be a difficult task. yet the horrid optimization poor graphics and tons of placeholders remained and increasingly stuck in my craw. adding to that the game was absolutely rife with bugs many of which were quite literally game breaking (transparent walls) and took ages to fix. the movement is also very janky and nothing feels smooth.the second was that despite playerunknown saying the game would not have microtransactions while in early access it did. this was when red flags started to come up for me. bluehole had already made an absolute fortune just off sales alone and despite work on the glaring often literally game breaking bugs and glitches being slow in coming when it came at all they decided they needed even more money from their fundamentally broken game. i have no issue with microtransactions in FTP games but they have no place in paid titles especially in paid titles where the devs have no interest in improving or fixing their game.the last and final straw for me was the cheaters. cheaters are absolutely rampant in this game and there was a time where the entire leaderbords would be cheaters who were openly advertising their hacks. that's not hyperbole. they would make their username a tinyurl link where you could buy their hacks and then use their dominance of the scoreboard (often for weeks) as advertising. punkbuster has outright admitted that there are unprescedented numbers of cheaters in the game and that despite banning more than they do any other game the number remains high. cheaters are a problem in a lot of games but when there are that many and they remain a problem for that long it indicates a fundamental problem with the game. rather than dedicating resources to stopping this bluehole was too busy further monetizing the game which had already made hundreds of millions from sales. early on players wanted the servers region locked both for reasons of lag and stability (the servers were often overloaded resulting in massive lag and huge influxes of players from far away just made that worse) and also because the vast majority of the cheaters according to punkbuster themselves were from china yet played on US servers for maximum exposure (as again they were doing this to sell their hacks and make money)maybe bluehole is just utterly incompetent or maybe they realized that every time they banned a hacker they'd buy another copy of the game thereby making them more money and continue on. maybe it was a combination of both. regardless the game was rendered virtually unplayable. a game which already had serious performance issues on both ends was so beset by hackers that you'd often run into them in every game. i quit playing after it all just became too much for me. i wanted to like this game. the concept was good and i prefer the aesthetic and style to things like fortnite but the idea was just so badly executed that i would not reccomend this game or games by this developer to anyone. it became readily apparent that they were far more interested in squeezing every dime out of players than offering a good fun and compelling product. this developer (bluehole) despite their rebranding is a company known for stolen assets and exploitative mobile games. they will not improve and they have done this before. i legitimately regret that i gave these hucksters even a penny of my money and i never played with the microtransactions. don't make the mistake i made. don't buy this game. you will be disapointed. this sort of behavior should NOT be rewarded.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,1235,False,Recommended,Let's start at the top in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds 90 to 100 players parachute from a cargo plane on to one of two islands either temperate Erangel which has been in the game since its early access launch or the desert Miramar which is new. Once on the ground these players clad only in whatever rags that loot chests have granted them raid abandoned buildings for weapons and scramble to kill each other while avoiding a vast forcefield that slowly closes in on a narrow area of a map. Die and you are kicked back to the title screen survive and er you won. That's it. Battlegrounds can be played solo or with a team in first or third person but this weaponised form of hide and seek is what it amounts to.This formula has made Battlegrounds one of the biggest games in the world with a seemingly universal appeal it is both the game that boosted Steam's presence in China and the game that my friends who play one game every five years are playing. It's a truth apparently unacknowledged that what the world really wanted was paintball on demand and the rewards for the first game to successfully render this experience outside of ArmA mods and H1Z1 spinoffs are apparently limitless.Battlegrounds is not on the surface a particularly elegant game. Its strengths are in scale not detail and it has not quite risen above the sterility shared by most games with military sims in their DNA. There are vague gestures at this being some sort of edgy TV show a flame motif logo that looks like a bad tattoo and a cast of appallingly dressed mute weirdos. Theme and atmosphere don't matter much here however because these things are provided by the scenario itself and crucially by your friends.To get straight to the heart of it PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is successful both as a game and as a business proposition because it is fundamentally social. This unfenced form of shooter where it is fully possible to go half an hour without seeing an opponent or firing a gun is an ideal place to spend time with people a shared survival story that regenerates itself every time you load into a new game. Your successes and failures lucky weapon finds long range kills and moments of vehicular bravado mean more because other people see them and because they contribute to the feeling that maybe just maybe this run will be the one where you finally make it to the end.Your imagination does a substantial amount of the heavy lifting here. At any given time the excitement of a Battlegrounds match is bound up in your sense of what might happen rather than what eventually does. After all this is a game where only one player or one team walks away feeling one hundred percent good about what just happened and yet somehow despite the most consistent experience of Battlegrounds being failure it retains its appeal. Hell it's often fun to fail my favourite matches are frequently the ones where I'm forced to survive in the bushes with a crossbow rather than the ones where the first house I raid contains a lovely UMP submachine gun with all the trimmings.Your imagination does a substantial amount of the heavy lifting here.

2017-06-19,0,0,523,True,Not Recommended,So I love the concept for this game but I have a few issues with it.1) It's horribly optimized. This game will run horribly if its installed on anything other than an SSD. If you have any graphics card worse than a gtx 980 expect to recieve less than 60 fps on medium or higher settings. I have the game installed on my HDD and joining a server forces me to look at a loading screen for 5 minutes while everyone else has been in the lobby the plane and then been able to jump out. I can hear sound all the while and can move around but I am stuck on a loading screen. I basically have to jump blindly out of the plane then wait 5 minutes on the ground until I can see which is a massive disadvantage.2) It's incredibly buggy. Try not to tab out of the game... you're gonna have a bad time.3) The devs refuse to address the bugs that many players axperience in the game instead focusing on trivial things like weather and vaulting over fences.I'm uninstalling for now. If the bugs are fixed and the game is optimized I will reinstall.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-18,0,0,68,False,Not Recommended,Game developers Bluehole have made a severe and potentially fatal mistake with PUBG. They have ignored the outcry of loyal longtime players for change when it comes to region locking game servers.I don't mind playing a game with people who don't speak my language. I don't mind it every once in a while. But when I sit down to play PUBG in a North American server there should be some English speaking players at least every so often. I started playing again a few days ago after a year long hiatus (back when region servers had purpose) and so far after around twenty or thirty maybe more matches I have played with a total of three English speaking players.This isn't about not liking Chinese people. I've even tried to learn some Mandarin to ease the in game struggle of communicating during intense moments and pathfinding strategies. But this doesn't make any sense. The amount of Chinese players in the North American servers is absurd and unacceptable.And Bluehole has ignored the overwhelming response to the issue. Now you have to go out of your way to find an English speaking community in PUBG for the NORTH AMERICAN servers just so you can enjoy playing. But the way I see it this is as much a problem with the game as any technical aspect that might cripple a player's experience and if the game's broken I won't recommend it.I loved PUBG when it came out. I'm trying to stick around and keep enjoying it but I don't see myself staying on too much longer.

I was 100% convinced this was gonna be my new counter strike if it would get a good competitive mode.The devs focused however on different things. New content new platforms the game would be released on and let's not forget new ways to milk money out of the people that would come for the said above new content.

Maps blow chunks and its just overal not a fun time your chances of actuallay winning a game or even getting close tend to be slim to none. Majority of my deaths in the game have been from random 5 seconds frezzes that only want to happen during the end game or in a firefight and happens non stop at the worse moments. The enemy can easily pick you off when your game lags out.Maybe i will bother touching it again if they actually fix but i won't hold my breath.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-09,0,0,414,True,Not Recommended,Another Early Access game that has potential but the developer has already broken its promises and added the said transaction for the purpose of raising money for the Gamescon tournament.If they've sold a little over 5 million copies at 30 euro I assume they can offer a tournament prize without going back on their promises. The amount of money they made off an early access game is more than enough for a small company to afford paying a 1 million tournament prize.It's not about adding the crates/keys I've purchased several myself I like to have cosmetics I always buy them but they went back on their word of not having microtransactions in the Early Access period. I'm worried that it's only the beginning and that they're going down a road that will cause more harm than good to the game and its community.It's way more likely for people to spend hundreds of dollars on cosmetics if they're not lied to. (Like CS GO Dota 2)I will still play the game but I'm now skeptical and somewhat lost my trust in their promises. The problem to me is that they might follow the same microtransaction ridden business model like they did with TERA and continue to offer only recycled content(no new weapons models maps etc.). If you do not have money to throw away I'd recommend waiting for the full version of the game(unless you have a couple of friends to play with squad games are really interactive).Update 22/11/2017 the servers are still in shambles and at times they seem worse than before.Frequent crashes teleporting through walls and desync.Hopefully the next patch will make the game playable without the previous issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I would not recommend this game if wanting to have as a party/social game as there are much better options I also would not recommend this as a serious comp game as the bugs &amp issues just make the game unbearable if you are taking it seriously.

2017-08-21,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,Honestly cant recommend. Sure theres LOTS of jittering /crashing but honestly the worst part This game caters to people that dont do anything the whole round until the very end. Thats how you win rounds just hide until the end.I promise you 90% of the time you die in this game it will be from someone you cant see that sniped you in the back. Most of the players in this game are Camping. Stream Sniping. Hacking. It's all here.It gets very boring when its 40 minutes of looting then hiding and 10 minutes at the end to kill people. (if you play to win as opposed to play for kills).As for the jitters its really annoying. The whole game feels like your character is experiencing side effects of an ADHD medication. annoying asf and gross to look at.So no as nice as the graphics may be I don't reccomend.TL DR get shot in the back simulator,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,40,True,Recommended,First of all I have more playtime than displayed in Steam because I participated in the closed beta. This game is in Early Access so it is still in development. As long as the developer pushes out updates I don't see Early Access as a bad excuse.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (sry caps) does many things right. The game is far more complex compared to H1Z1 for example. Its tactical depth is superior to any other Battle Royale game (and comparable to the ArmA mods).The technical aspect is still a critical thing in the Early Access version. While having 70 FPS maxed out on my intel Xeon E3 1230 and Nvidia GTX 1080 the frames drop down to 20 30 FPS in cities surprisingly often. Also I don't have stable 70 FPS outside crowded areas. Too often I have about 50 FPS.Does that kill the fun? Definitaly not. Does it hurt the fun? Yes a bit.PUBG is a realtively bug free battle royale game that has some critical performance issues. Apart of that it does hardly anything wrong. If you are into battle royale games and if you can get along with the technical issues you could enjoy this early stage of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-31,0,0,82,True,Recommended,So far this game as brought me a ton of fun to myself and my friends. The game has its issues though.Pros The game is extremely fun and leaves you at the end of your seat for the entire match The map is insanely big and doesnt get bland after a few games The sound in the game is pretty great when the audio doesnt lag. The game actually looks pretty decentCons Bugs Bugs Bugs... However this is still an early access game and I feel that when it is all said and done the game will be one of the best games I have ever played. This game is really fun to make a squad of friends and go for the top spot. Just beware that if you buy this game there are bugs. The game is still in early access phase and so it is going to obviously have some flaws. These flaws include Lagging audio Frame Rate Drops Lag after spawn Sketchy graphics sometimes lag and more lag and finally sometimes it just completely freezes.But however do i recommend this?

Its an early access title and should be expected to have some issues.Note If you only like games were you ""win"" all the time then this might not be the game for you.The Good This game has a bit of learning curve but anyone can jump in and have fun. The most approachable Arma mod I have ever played. While the map remains the same every match (for now) its massive and I am still finding new areas after playing dozens of matches. The gun play is Arma gun play. I like it but not everyone does. the 3rd person 1st person option is also cool. Tons of intense moments.The Bad Its early access so there are glitches. Often times they come at very inopportune moments. Also performance for me isn't great. If you have new PC you should be fine but mine is over 3 years old and struggles to get 60fps even on medium settings. Going to test it again when I get my new GPU and see how It does.Update New GPU and game patches have really helped.

2018-05-09,0,0,176,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is now notoriously known for the loss of the potential it could've had. So many purchased copies and millions of dollars in revenue from the consumers yet this game has rejected me 3 times in a row on separate occasions to play this outdated looking and sticky game. And after finally being able to get online after hours of waiting I played two games and then was kicked from the game saying that there were too many people playing. That's unheard of for games like Fortnite CS GO and Overwatch. Yet after all it's time in early access and it's updates after post release this game is hardly running any better. Arguably worse than before its release with the never ending crashes and bad developer choices. The reviews have become mostly negative after a trading controversy but it just goes to show how little this developer actually cares at this point. Brendan Greene has said that it isn't a matter of throwing money at a problem but time will solve these problems. I find that very hard to believe with the success of Fortnite and the examples made by mostly all developers in the game industry. If Fortnite took a fraction of the time to completely lap you in this race then start over and get a new engine. Make new assets. Get new team members. You charged $30 for a game half the quality of your competitors. Make changes or have this game become a phase as opposed to an empire.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Im all for skins and customization but there are more user freindly ways to do that than RNG lootboxes and $2.50 required keys. Its sad to see such a great game turn to this.

2018-08-16,0,0,184,False,Recommended,I honestly feel that this is the best battle royale style game on the market. While their questionable decisions with the season pass situation and the issue with servers and hackers at times can be pretty rough the game as a whole is really enjoyable.When it comes to battle royale games on the market currently most seem to be rather cartoony or very far from any realism to a level where I can't really enjoy the game. PUBG seems to find that good place in the middle for me. While it isn't full on simulation the gunplay and overall fluidity of the game is top notch. The gunplay is tight and actually changes from weapon to weapon unlike many other games out there. The character customization is a nice plus too I like the fact that we get to do what I like to call 'play Barbie' before loading into a match to stomp some people. There is a nice variety of clothing to choose from and with them partnering with twitch to have Twitch crates our options are getting even better. We even get to choose weapon and parachute skins and while many people don't see this as an added selling point I personally do.Overall the game is a good time especially if you have a group of friends to play with regularly.

2017-09-02,2,2,713,False,Not Recommended,I do not recommend this game YET.this game provides much fun and can give you a great time with your friends. the atmosphere is high and the style of the game is perfect for battle royale hungry players world wide.there is alot of technical issues within the game like crashes and bugs. one time my game crashed 5 times in 1 match without the error screen (this has never happened before). Of course crashes and bugs are to be expected in a early access game but 3+ times in 1 match is just too much. some of my friends also experiences random crashes at the beginning of matches which is a big problem because if you crash before you jump out of the plane you are stuck in it. It appears that you cannot jump out of the plane after re joining the match and forces you to drop at the end of the route. The game can also crash in late game and THAT is a huge problem (obviously). it is the game that crashes and not my PC. The game is not very good optimized in my opinion.gameplay is SOMETIMES very frustrating like when somebody jumps and shoot you with great accuracy. jump shooting should be removed in my opinion or at least lower the accuracy when jumping how it is now... is just insane. also hitboxes should be improved.I think there should be more guns added to the game but that's nothing major. BUT I really think that the micro uzi should be able to use scopes too it is actually aggravating how you can not use scopes on it.and I think there should be at least 1 gun in every house maybe just a pistol. I looted 4 buildings before getting a gun once same with backpacks.after playing this game for nearly 200 hours I think that if you're going to buy it you should wait until they fix some of the major bugs and maybe releases the game fully.this is just my personal opinion that some people may or may not agree with which is totally cool. I would love to hear your opinions and thoughts of the game a game that slowly but surely is getting better.EDIT it's now released and 2018... we're ed,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-07,0,0,330,False,Not Recommended,The game can be pretty fun especially with friends. However I will not recommend it for two main reasons. Firstly and most importantly it is very poorly optimized. Servers are still not as good as they should be. I experience frame drops often especially in firefights. There are simply graphical and performance related issues that I only experience in PUBG. These can often be rather game breaking.Secondly the gameplay is kinda boring. While they are working on the blue circle mechanics and doing some things to make the mid game more enjoyable and less slow paced there's still far too many games where I collect some loot run through open fields for approximately 20 minutes and then get shot in the head without firing once. Yeah yeah I know I'm bad and all that. However many games I've played end with either a horrendous firefight with awful performance or a boring nothingness capped by a single sniper shot to the dome. PUBG obviously isn't all bad and remains extremely popular. The gunfights can be very immersive especially in squads. Some things also look to be improving such as with the new smaller Sanhok map. The devs have also recently tried to address some of the server problems and optimization has been getting better. But because of the poor performance and often insipid gameplay I will not currently recommend PUBG. A couple other things I'd like to mention bluehole is a lifeless inept company concerned solely with profit and there are a lot of cheaters in this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

An Early access game should never be called ""esports ready"" finish your game before putting it on any league tournaments and prioritize user experience first.If you look at the leaderboard of pretty much every region almost all top tens have ""WG"" in their name that means cheat in chinese I am so ashamed and sad because of the toxic hack community and the inability of the devs to stop the hackers from ruining the experience.2)Optimization &amp glitchesIf you label PubG as a competitive shooter and put it on Electronic Sports League the game should be fully ready and optimized. So far there are a huge number of serious glitches that can be exploited for example entering a house through window by ejecting from a car. In addition there are some animation glitches that should not even be in an early access game. Bluehole is a studio that only made mmorpg and it is absolutely not enough for PubG they should really hire more developers who know how to make a proper esports ready shooter.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-28,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,I found this game fun for a bit but eventually just lost interest. The battle royale gameplay is fun in general... you don't feel bad dying all the time because there's only ever one winner. When I played it the game had numerous bugs and issues and absolutely terrible performance. Gameplay wise PUBG just seemed to reward camping way too much. Being aggressive and moving around a lot was pointless as someone is going to spot you and take you out. Third person mode makes this issue worse as people can peek around corners through windows while being out of sight etc. It just promotes the camping style. First person mode fixes this but it still felt clunky. Battle royale is fun but I think you should try one of the other BR games instead.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-19,0,0,245,False,Recommended,I have had this game for a very long time way before release. Back when there was no FPP Erangel was the only map and there were guns in the pre game lobby. I highly highly recommend this game especially over the more successful competitor Fortnite BR.People say its dying/dead don't listen to them its not. Sure its not the 5 million players at once monster it was back in the good old days but I still see 700 000+ players on at once regularly. Rainbow Six Siege has around 65 000 players (on PC) online usually G Mod has around 20 000. You wouldn't call them dying or dead would you?However the game is not flawless hackers especially on AS servers and servers they can get a decent ping to such as OC (me) or SEA are quite common and can really ruin the game. The matchmaking needs improving too in Australia I can never find FPP matches and it isnt uncommon to be sitting for 10+ minutes for TPP and the event pass is a load of Also I'm not a fan of paying for keys for loot crates but thats a thing you just have to live with on SteamOverall though I really do recommend this game and I encourage you to buy it as I have always had a great time playing whether its solo duo or squads.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-09-11,0,0,374,False,Recommended,Now im going to be very honest when i write this. when i first started playing this game it was in early access filled to the brim with cheaters of mostly asian decent and was filled with game breaking bugs. Did i like playing the game then? Yes i did. I loved the aspect of the game where it was the only BR out there which actually worked and was realistic to a degree. The guns were well thought out and their stats were reasonable. Back then i would of gave this game a solid 9/10 purely for the amount of fun i had playing it.Next came the release of the desert map. The idea was great and made it harder to be hidden in the open compared to the OG map. More urbanised areas but in a more centralised area. I had many great games on there and secured a fair few number of wins on this map. However with a new map came a new wave of cheaters the early stages of de sync and a whole lot more game breaking bugs. At this point alot of my original squad had lost interest because of this. I decided to stick around and see if it would smooth out. To some degree it did they fixed some minor bugs which helped gameplay but seemed to ignore the bug issues. They added a new car which in most peoples opinion was not really needed. And then added a new gun as well as removing weapons from the crate. At this point i became fed up with the game. The devs were not listening to what their market was saying and adding things which they wanted and didnt bother fixing the problems we were facing.Sanhok was announced and it actually brought a few of the players back from their dis interest in the game. it was a smaller map less urbanised and truely focused on the pure bloodlust a BR game should have. I thought that the game was going to be revived from its seemingly dying condition. And to some degree i was correct. The devs listened to what we wanted regarding content being added to the maps etc which got a lot of the community thinking that they would fix the major issues reagrding cheaters and de sync. However we couldnt be more wrong. They implimented a kill cam which was suppost to help players reprt hackers in more indepth detail. However yet again BlueHole didnt smooth it out before releasing it. Major de sync issues were experienced in the death cams and it was really hard to tell if opponents were indeed hacking. This in particular really me off. The one opportunity in my opinion to turn this game around then they went and ed it up so easily.As of recently they announced 'Fix PUBG' and to be honest the flaws which were needed to be fixed at an earlier stage of the game are to far gone to be even adressed now. Their intentions with this plan does mean well however it has come far to late into the game's full release to solve these issues now.I do come back to this game every now and again to see whether i can get back into playing this game seriously on my own again. Do i still enjoy it? Kinda yeah. After playing other games for a few hours its nice to come back to the game and improve my general reflexes and tactical thinking. But in all honesty its only fun to play it with friends and then just doss about not taking the game seriously.Overall do i recommend this game? Yes i do despite its flaws it still hold the potential to get its act together and still be as popular as it used to be. Yes i know other BR games are now out there and soon to be releasing. But PUBG will always be the game which truely took off the genre. Its a nice game to play when you have mates and want to doss about. its also a great game to test your mind out. But it will never meet the potential it needs to become a proper e sports game. Yes they have had tournements but its still not to scratch as CSGO or Dota is.Graphics 8/10Guns 7/10Vehicles 6/10 (still bugged to hell)Competiveness this varies but for me its 7/10Overall rating 7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-08,0,0,693,False,Not Recommended,"I have almost 500 hours in this game. I bought this game when it first hit early access and was willing to put up with bugs and issues because it was an EA title. But after the game hit 1.0 and still ran like garbage and still had issues with desync grass and terrain not rendering and most importantly was overrun with hackers I stopped playing for months. I came back a couple days before the event pass dropped and the game felt a lot better they really had made some serious improvements to the gameplay and it felt smooth. It still wasn't up to the standards that I'd expect from a fully released game but it was definitely better than it was when I stopped playing. I really had some fun the last few weeks and even bought the event pass. While it has been annoying to have to check the Reddit to make sure the description was translated correctly because the developers obviously use Google to translate from Korean to English. Descriptions are missing words or are so confusingly worded that you don't actually know what you're supposed to do i.e. ""Heal 200 hp 5 times in a single game"" which is actually supposed to be ""Heal 200 hp in a single game 5 times"". But that's really not a big deal I have had some genuine fun doing a lot of the challenges and am currently level 28. The biggest issue I have with it is that it forces you to play badly for a lot of the challenges. Being forced to take damage not kill other players or when the event pass came out and you did any of the challenges that required you to be in the top 3 5 or 10 then you had to purposely lose to get credit for the challenge. Putting the mediocre event pass aside holy this last update is terrible. It feels worse than it did when the game first hit Steam. The fact these developers are this inept is actually astounding. I've come to terms with the fact this game will never be perfect or even come close to living up to what it's capable of but this is just pathetic. Every single match is flooded with Chinese players with ping so high they teleport around you and don't take damage from bullets due to desync. I have gotten behind people and ADS sprayed them in the back from 10 15 feet away blood pouring out of them with every shot only to have them turn around and kill me. Then on the death cam you see that only 1 or 2 of the 15 bullets that hit actually registered. I am not an amazing player by any means but I frequently get 7 or 8 kills in a game. My point being I know when someone should be dead and these Chinese players are not dying like they should. Watching the death cams is just depressing at this point and my buddies and I are just done. They were rank 18 and rank 40 last season and they have given up as well.There are so many game breaking issues that have been present from day one and have never been fixed. Such as If there are too many sounds around you then footstep noises won't register. Vehicles control like the tires are wet bars of soap and the ground is made of ice. Items take 10 15 seconds to load in when you land and while early game lag is better it's still not acceptable. Bushes rocks and trees don't always render properly at a distance so you can be seen in the open when you are behind cover. And most importantly Just because you see blood doesn't mean they actually took damage. Because while this may be a fully released product its netcode is still back in the pre alpha stage. To sum it up I don't recommend buying this game. The developers either do not care that the game is broken do not have the skill to actually fix it or both. My guess is both. Because when you've made almost a billion dollars off a game and have millions of players who are still willing to pay $2.50 to open a ing loot box and $10 for a pass that should have been free then why would you feel the need to fix anything? China should have been region locked over a year ago simple as that. But the developers don't want to risk alienating that large of a demographic. But as you can see from the recent reviews their playerbase is tired of the t. To put it simply it's an unfinished game with a $30 price tag kept alive by the Twitch community which fortunately is starting to move over to Fortnite and other superior games.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-25,1,2,111,False,Not Recommended,All the makings of a bad time. If you run solo you have to basically keep your voice chat muted because you have every little squeaker screaming at the top of their lungs into their microphones at full volume with full amplification followed by ignorate s using every slur in the book like they just discovered it yesterday. The majority of games have been with literally the most irritating people I have ever encountered period. If it's a fair representation of the community from the hours I have put into this game it's absolute filth.And then there's the gameplay itself. The combat is janky especially at the beginning of the game. You go to pick up a weapon and someone gets to the same room a few feet away you pick up the weapon and then all of a sudden it's in your opponent's hands and your brains are either being blown out or bashed in. Then there's the gunplay where every shot taken feels like a random dice roll per shot decided by the horrid 17hz servers they decided to host this game on especially in close quarters. Then there's the hackers. Make it to the last ten? Don't expect to make it much further because your epic run is going to cut short by someone who is either using ESP or blatantly aimbotting. I've watched many a death cams where my killer was questionable. Staring at me through a wall when my footsteps aren't audible. Shooting me unhindered when they've gotten a face full of flashbang and a completely whited out screen. Shooting at me through thick fog killing me and then snap aiming to some other unsuspecting player who is also obscured by fog. And more than just a few times all of the above at the same damn time. With as bad as the hit registration is in this game I can kinda see why they do it. You have to basically hack your nuts off to get any decent hit reg.TL DR This overhyped joke that Blue Hole and PUBG Corp has put out is nowhere near worth your time or money.

2017-05-11,1,2,1075,True,Not Recommended,"Too many reasons to mention on why this game has gone down the hole. For the first few months the game played great. Performance was alright minimal lag and plenty of opprotunities to win.However these past few months have turned this game completely upside down. First and forthmost you're going to run into a hacker about 1 out of every 3 games. Before last month you might've ran into one 1 2 months. Completely destroys the fun of the game when I'm driving my buggy at 90mph and get double tap headshoted by someguy with an AK far enough away that I can't hear his unsupressed gun when he comes to loot me shortly after.Another issue you're going to run into is the UI. The menu UI is web based sometimes not even loading othertimes giving you random error messages such as ""too many users"" or ""https error"" or ""could not connect"". The cancel button doesn't respond or work most of the time when you're que'd in the wrong game mode/server forcing you to leave the lobby you just joined so you can load the buggy UI and wait another 2 minutes for a que. Additionally I've had a couple times where I've loaded the game up only to recieve a crash report as soon as I hit the menu. Ive never seen another game with a main menu that crashes on start... have you?Lag is another big issue. About a month ago this game ran perfectly smooth for me. Everything loaded and rendered fine no frame skipping no half rendered clay buildings. Since then my cpu and memory usage have both rose from 40 50% to 80%. I'm not sure what was added to the game but it ruined performance substantially (at least in my case). Now instead of smooth fluid movements I'll have situations in the game where I'll be in a gun fight recieve a lag spike teleport 5 ft away and die. Once again competely ruining the point of playing. It's also pretty annoying to pick up a weapon only to find the game didn't actually pick it up due to lag. Overall network lag and client lag are huge issues requiring you to use expensive hardware in order to play the game smoothly instead of having an actual optimization patch.Game breaking mechanics and bugs. Crashing a full health motorcycle into another cars tire shouldn't result in an instant explosion and death. Destroys realism. Driving my boat on open water only to watch it flip over 180 degrees and smash me after a random lag spike. Destroys realism. Buildings failing to render at the start of the game an uncommon bug but it still happens Allowing people to drive through houses and see through walls unintentionally. Buildings failing to completely load at the start of the game Making looting them near impossible and giving a huge advantage to anyone with superior hardware. Gun damage 25% chance your gun isnt actually going to do the damage its supposed to two shotting someone with the double barrel shotgun at point blank range then being killed by a pan because 8/10 of the pellets your shotgun dispensed curve around the enemy. Unrealistic. Crossbowing someone in the center of the neck and dying to a pan because an arrow to the neck isnt a one shot kill but a pan headshot is. Unrealistic. Spraying your entire AK clip at point blank range and only having 4 bullets hit without a kill. Unrealistic. And the list goes on as you start to play more and get a feel for how the weapons should work.Random number generator mechanics. Game should have at least one weapon in buildings. There have been times where I have fully searched five buildings and have not found a single weapon only to be shot down by some guy who rode up with his UAZ and shotty. Seven copies of the same backpack in the same area isnt going to improve gameplay for anyone nore cosmetic appearal that takes up space for actual items that influence the gameplay. Vehicles should also be reworked as many a time I have played running simulator because out of the ten spawn spots near me the game chose to fill in other spawn spots nice and tightly packed together. Sometimes you're gonna see 5 cars in 300km othertimes you're going to see 0 cars in 2000km.Team gameplay. If you only know english better find some friends to play with. North america Europe and Oceanic servers tend to be filled with non english speaking users since this past month. Not sure why this is but I can't even play squads with automatching because my teammates cant understand me and vis versa destroying part of the point of actually playing squads in the first place. There are also people who intentionally greif squad games less common but still a problem.Overall the game isn't worth the purchase or your play time until these problems are addressed. The only redeeming quality of the game I can think of is the idea of the game itself. Right ideas terrible execution.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you buy this be prepared to walk for 15mins just to get shoot by someone still in the killzone or if you're lucky you'll get the drop on someone but none of your bullets will hit on their screen. Oh and the game is poorly optimized to say the least I have a gtx 960 and even when everything is on the lowest possible settings it still drops frames in combat and whenever it wants to.Update Now the game is nearly unplayable due to chinese players and cheaters now overunning NA servers. Also after months the game is still a buggy and un optimized mess and now the developers announced a mobile version when the original is still running like a toaster powered by a potatoe. Now with the 1.0 update it takes longer to load into the main menu then the actual game and the NA servers are still overun with chinese players who lag it make it virtually impossible to win. I will give credit though it seems with the 1.0 update the hit detection is better but long range combat is still garbage even when you calculate for distance your shots never seem to go straight.Second Update Cheating still rampant and hit detection has yet to be improved so far it seems this game may never be actually completely fixed.

This game is the perfect example how to up a great video game concept.almost 2 years now and all we've got Tons of hackers cheaters. The game (despite the fact is fully released) is still crashes lagging and overall run worse than most of the pre alpha games. Little to no new content so far. (we've only got 1 map and very few new weapons ... and people were crying about Overwatch was lack of content back in the days.) Ridiculously high gap between what the player base wants and what the developers want. They not even care about the playerbase ((no one likes Miramar after 6 months of community requests still no sign of map selection the game is still crashes the record system still broken the game is still swarmed by cheaters yet all we've got is emotes weapon skins and PUBG for mobile phones YAAAAY !!!

I immeditaly find a match after changing every single setting to as low as they can go. 20 30 frames per second no matter where I am. My first game back ended with someone grenading me without line of sight it was solo queue so they couldn't have had someone to communicate with. The person ran by threw a grenade and kept running. Whether this was luck or some for of wallhacks I don't know. But it was very annoying to end my game with.While I dislike the game I do have to admit that the controls feel solid. It is satisfying to get a kill in this game as well but the gunplay could be better.I do not reccomend this game and if you buy it you will not get a refund for it if you do not like it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-08,1,2,412,True,Not Recommended,"Over 200 hours played. I can safely not recommend this game to anyone that wants to keep their sanity. It begins as a love hate relationship with this game. Because A Youre not very good yet and you want to get better to win. but B You keep dying over and over because you havent learned the way you have to play in order to win. I understand its a survival game. But the amount of camping in this game would make any normal gamer tilted when you just have no clue someone is sitting in a house making no noise in a corner with a shotgun. And theres nothing you can really do about it but die. Unless theyre bad. The moments when you win at first are very exciting and pretty fun. But its soon drowned out by the countless times you die over and ing over to complete ing t. And after youve won like 5 10 times it really starts to lose its fun. Mostly because youre already so off about how many times youve died earlier in the day youre just like ""yeah ING finally ing ass game"". Not to mention the bugs and lag in this game where I swear like im prefiring and shoot someone like 3 times before they even start shooting at me yet i ing die. ANd they didnt get a headshot kill.

2017-08-04,3,24,185,True,Recommended,Game PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDSGenre Multiplayer Battle RoyaleDeveloper Bluehole Inc.Publisher Bluehole Inc.Copy supplied by Steamhttps //youtu.be/AGVHOpEG2dk1999 Japanese writer Koushun Takami publishes Battle Royale the story of high school students who are forced to fight each other to death. The following year a feature film adaptation directed by Kinji Fukasaku and starring Takeshi Kitano was released to great worldwide acclaim. With the success of the movie there have been multiple directors and writers who have been influenced by it (Quentin Tarantino The Hunger Games The Belko Experiment Gamer etc.). The influence can also be found in the realm of video games with a couple of hits (Fallout New Vegas Dead Money H1Z1) and plenty of misses (The Culling Last Man Standing DayZ etc.).Enter PlayerUnknown s BATTLEGROUNDS at first it might seem like any other quick cash grab ArmA clone that is exploiting a recent trend. But if you look closer you will see that it is breaking all sorts of records on Steam it is actually getting updated by the developers based on player s feedback and it is made by someone who has quite the experience in this type of games. Brendan Greene (a.k.a. PlayerUnknown) has been working on mods for quite some time and he created a Battle Royale mod for ArmA 3 as well as working as a consultant to develop H1Z1.The game is quite straight forward 100 players parachute on an island and they have to kill each other till only one player is left. As time moves forward the play area becomes smaller and smaller so that you are bound to find other players. As of right now the game can be played either Solo Duo or in a 4 player Squad. Graphically it looks very similar to the ArmA games with more action y movements and animations. The island is vast and at first you are gonna get lost very easily but the more you play the more familiar you become with the cities and bases sometimes reliving glorious victories or painful defeats.The placement of weapons and vehicles is randomized. You start off with your bare hands and you can find guns and melee weapons of all kinds pistols shotguns crossbows assault rifles grenades molotov cocktails frying pans crowbars There are also multiple attachments that improve the quality of your weapons as well as police vests and helmets that can protect you and medkits and bandages to heal you up. You can also find some loot crates that are dropped from the sky which have better weapons and tons of ammos. But beware of entering a red zone once there a 1 minute bombardment will take place and running through an open field with giant explosions all around you is both memorable and terrifying at the same time.What makes the game truly unique and replayable is the combat unlike other games of this subgenre the shooting is quite fluid and natural both in 1st and 3rd person. Encountering another player gives you an adrenaline rush and it makes you scared for your life knowing that a few well placed bullets could mean the end for you. Both hiding and running into battle are valuable strategies with many players crouching near a toilet in an abandoned building pointing their double barreled shotgun at the door hoping that no one opens it. Can you really blame the fear of dying? Knowing that you won t respawn there are more instances when players decide not to kill someone just out of fear of being noticed by a third better equipped player.Sound design is a huge aspect of the game and it truly sells the experience hearing footsteps inside a house means that someone is exploring it hearing a door open up means that an intruder is on his way listening to gunshots in the distance can tell you which areas are more dangerous and populated than others the sound of a car approaching gives you both hope (that you can use it to run away) and fear (that the driver has noticed you).Overall even though it is still in Early Access PlayerUnknown s BATTLEGROUNDS deserves its status as THE multiplayer game to play this year. Thanks to responsive controls enjoyable combat high replayability and constant updates and patches this is a survival game that those who want a quick adrenaline rush have to pick up as soon as possible. There is a reason why it has the highest number of players for a non Valve game.Story n/aGraphics 8Gameplay 9Challenge 10Sound 9Replayability 10ENJOYMENT 9FRUSTRATION 6Follow me on Twitter nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook www.facebook.com Join my Steam group,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-20,1,32,207,True,Not Recommended,Had great potential during the first few months of release WOW?! An early access game with incredible gun handling gfx and group potential. The proof is in the pudding over 16 million copies sold. You'd think a game so popular and striving with money would be banging out weekly if not monthly updates right? Wrong. We got absolutely nothing since release but a few guns minor optimization and a poorly designed map. With the new map just being tested I thought to myself wow PUBG really is going places. Until of course they announced a port for Xbox to be released before Christmas.. *sigh* I wonder what the reason behind that is. The PC community funded this port which we never asked for. To add insult to injury it's probably the worst low effort rushed console port to date. Now they'll have to have two teams one working on PC and one working on Xbox thus slowing down the speed of development like it wasn't slow enough. Putting all these things aside the game is full of cheaters bugs lag server issues all that the devs refuse to address. All in all I could not recommend this game to anyone the fact that Bluehole is willing to ship the game as a full release in its current state prove that they are doing a Dean Hall.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-09,77,25,270,False,Recommended,This anime visual novel was one of the best I've ever played. It had one of the most compelling stories I have ever experienced. The anime girls were well fleshed out characters that I really cared about. You may be wondering why I have over 100 hours of gameplay in this game. Simple answer is because of the beautiful plump juicy tender anime tiddies in this game. This game is actually not a thrid person battle royale shooter it is actually a compelling romance visual novel that will completely blow you away you will be playing this for countless amount of decades like me. I've been playing since the year 1943 where I was in afghanistan on the front lines fighting against the murderous psychotic nazis. But this game has saved me from all the horrifying experiences I have ever had on the front lines of WWII. This game has stuck with me till now my wife who is actually a body pillow loves this game. I do not like real women because they do not understand me like body pillows do. Me and my wife sakura chan played this game for countless hours on end because we can relate so much to the main character and his shocking past where *SPOILERS* His mum and dad both died from a terrorists attack where they were taking a holiday in russia *SPOILERS* I could relate to this because my parents got gassed by the Nazis and Sakura chan had her parents killed by a terrorist suicide bomber in a basement of a hentai store in Japan where I found sakura chan when she was buried in the rubble and aftermath of the bombing. I got her out of there and have been caring for her ever since. Many tears have fallen from our eyes because of this game. Few years later we married because of this game we have bonded so much and fallen completely in love with each other. The characters in this game made us so heart wrenchingly sad because me and my wife connected so much to them. There are approximately 25 endings to this game all with different out comes on all of them. This game is very detailed and well made and it has made me a WWII veteran and full grown man shed tears everytime I played. please do check out this game as it is a masterpiece and has connected with me on a very personal level.Jebediah the WWII Veteran.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-19,2,10,167,True,Not Recommended,so far from what i've played which at this point is 75 hours i have won the game around 4 5 times and those games were probably the only fun i have had with the game. 90% of the game is just running around and looting which i find very boring most games you get killed after 30 minutes of looting and runnning by some guy you can't see. The game rewards you with these battle points that can be spent on a lootbox for cosmetics none of the cosmetics look good at all accept some of the rare ones that you will never get becuse the game seems to only give out the lowest quality. The game is not respectful of your time at all games go for ages with very high chance that you will get shot by a guy with a better hiding spot. In this state i believe is not recommendable. You don't need to agree with me most of my friends are playing this game all the time and still having fun.There are still things this game does better than other battle royal type games but it seems like they are in their early stages. thanks,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They said earlier that they won't be able to deliver this game on time and get it out of early access. Maybe if'd they focus more on an actual content rather than ""microtransactions test drive"" they'd have enough time without having to move premiere date. Now for the ""it' s only skins guys"" In this game the clothes give an actual advantage because spotting someone first means life or death it's huge advantage. Now these clothes they presented are all flashy and stylish but the next pack might be ""grass type"" or anything that makes the player harder to spot. They could also make clothes available for player for ingame gold really colorful and bang! it's that easy now players who bought crates with better clothes have advantage. 3rd argument. From ethic standpoint there is no excuse to even ""test drive microtransactions now"". One of the best selling games on steam for many months now. It clearly paid itself already many times for such a small dev team. And i know the more cash the merrier and bussiness always have to earn more but they could also do it in less obvius and greedy way. *sits down after angry rant* Y But wait! Adures! It's for charity and tournaments!!! You... you don't understand. M No i don't. They could easily make a week or a month when some percent from their sales go for a charity but of course not they had to make loot boxes. As for tournaments how about they go out from early access first? As i said earlier they already are behind their schedule. They have many bugs to fix befire they make this game ""tournament worthy"". Also no need for loot boxes. They could easily get money on tournament from sponsors (and they probably do but don't quote me on this) Y WTF Adures! but what about the actual game!? Do you like it? M I can't deny it the game is fun but still buggy and needs more optimalisation (still better that most other survival games on steam).The gameplay is really good the shooting feels satisfying and you can really feel andrenaline rush in the end game which can get really intense. We are still waiting for new maps and some features tho. Y Aaaaaaalright Adures... so you say you can't recommend this game even though you like it? M Yes wait for a full realise. After 3 years i finally wanted to give ""early access"" another chance and I still don't know if that was right decision. With further monetisation this game could really go downhill in half a year. Trust me wait for a full release and then decide. If the game won't be ruined by microtransactions you still will have a lot of players to play with. For now find yourself different game. There are already more really good released games that you will ever be able to play.*********************************Shorter version**************************** All in all it's just shi**y to put microtransations in early access game.

Most of the assets have been bought online with a quick pass of simplygon on top of it ( hey guys Sympligon isn't supposed to be used that way ) meaning a lot of Lods in the distance are completly incorrect and you can end up beeing able to see someone behind an invisible rock or having Houses without windows due to the low amount of polygon Sympligon cutted. The weapon ballistic is an unreal engine 4 plugin. The outfit customization was made by a third party who sell it working as is out of the box. The whole FPS system is likely to be the basic Unreal engine 4 FPS template once agian UE4's crosshaires for weapons and grenades and since this engine wasn't made to accomadate such a large amount of players there is obviously a massive amount of lag input and hitreg and it's not entirely due to the Servers but because of the engine itself not being ablee to handle so many players at once.So now the devs are asking Epic to fix this problem... aherm excuse me? if the engine isn't working as intended it falls on you bluehole to rework the core code and make it work Not epic.I know this company doesn't have the talent to pull this out.

2018-01-10,0,0,1270,False,Not Recommended,Had to delete my old review and start again...I have been playing this game for a while now (casually) coming up to 1k hours and honestly all I can say now is don't waste your money.All the developers think about is money.The servers have worked fine for a couple of months but now there's a lot of de sync since the recent updates (July 2018)Still no region lock and they don't plan on making one still no ping lock so you're still going to get shot behind walls.Expect to get put into squads with a lot of chinese players who don't speak a word of English or Russian kids with ridiculously loud microphones.You play countless hours and save up battle points then decide to grab some crates from the store (all cosmetic items) 80% of those crates will require keys and no you can't just get a key that fits any crate each crate has different keys each key costs $2.50 the chances of getting something better than a common item is probably less than 1% and most of the time it's multiples of the same item.They recently bought out an 'event pass' if you want it that's anouther $10 out of your pocket what do you get for it a few skins if you grind for long enough if you don't buy it though the best you'll probably get is a couple of skins that last 20 or 30 days. half of the 'missions' to get xp are also exclusive to the event pass so you won't progress much without it.The best I can describe the game is like drugs to a drug addict it's ridiculously bad but you keep coming back you think they will fix the problems but they don't. Meanwhile all people will see that don't yet have the game is the countless big stage events the developers are hosting which they shouldn't be because their game is far from ready for that.They are some shady people and put money in front of the player's needs they even tried to sue their competitor for 'stealing their play mode' even though Bluehole uses their engine! It's all laughable!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2019-02-12,0,0,164,False,Not Recommended,This game sucks!! Battle Royal is not a new thing. Not sure why it took off like crazy with this buggy mess of a game! I'm personally not a huge fan of the game type because most of the game is a walking driving simulator. If you are lucky you get some kills or even win then its right back to walking and driving. Aside from my general dislike of BR there are much better games in the genre. Now that Apex Legends is out and free there is zero reasons to play pubg. Apex Legends and COD Blackout are far superior. And at least with COD you get to play the regular multiplayer mode as well. Just say no to pubg!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When it works well it is a lot of fun. However on my i7 3770 gtx 970 8gb of ram half of the time when I join a match it goes to a black loading screen and stays there. I hear the sound of the plane and it forcing me off I hear parachuting and landing on the ground then nothing. I have to quite the game (which is caused issues with my pc for some reason) then relaunch. When I do get into a game there's another 75% change I will land only to see buildings with the most atrocious textures and polygons you can ever see. (check my screenshots) You can't get into buildings which is essential to finding weapons. This issue shows up regardless of my settings and friends with stronger and weaker pc's have never had these issues. This is an early access title so when I bought it I gave it some mercy but since such a gamebreaking bug still exists I can't recommend this. Fortnite which is also in early access (and free) doesn't have any issues like this and is made in the same engine. I find this unacceptable in a title that is in public hands.I hope this game gets better I hope the bugs get fixed I hope the performance gets better but honestly I think the developers aren't focusing on what they already have and working too much other stuff (I haven't seen any notible changes to the game though I do know they added a few things).

I paid the $29.99 because I saw this as a game with real potential and as it turns out even with computers that exceed the minimum system requirements it is extremely laggy and buggy. I even tried playing on super low graphical settings which still only resulted in 20 FPS standing still moving was around 7.

2017-11-15,0,0,253,True,Recommended,For those of you worried that Bluehole ran off with your money Don't be.I was able to play the test server for the 1.0 patch this morning and holy crap was it refreshing. I was starting to become burnt out on this game but the test server is extremely refreshing. The game feels much more polished and runs so much better (1080 7600k consistently between 110 and 144 FPS even when in school!!) vaulting is a great new mechanic and the changes to gunplay are extremely refreshing. They reworked vehicles to be way less wonky and gave them some great new sounds too! Many of the issues with lag (primarily when first dropping into populated areas) have been fixed or are significantly better and it all blends together for a much improved experience.Overall this game should be able to deliver when it is released in December. It's an extremely fun battle royal game with the best shooting mechanics out of any games in the genre right now. Based on this test build I highly recommend it and I would recommend getting it now in case of a price increase and just to jump in now so you can start to learn the game and be ready to win some games when it's released.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-16,0,0,494,False,Recommended,This game has a huge playerbase where MILLIONS are playing at once with that being said there are a ton of reviews and from the looks of it as of mid august the game is rated mostly negative. Most of the bad reviews I've read are people who say the game is unstable or that they are being killed by hackers. When people say the game is unstable I really want to believe it is just their computer when people play most games they want the most beautiful graphics so they put the game on ultra settings and on the pubg steam store page they give you details on minimum and recommended computer specs to play the game. I kinda feel like all the people that say the game is unstable (Long loading times Network lag frame rate) are some of the people that think that if they have the minimum computer specs to play the game that the game should play on ultra. Pubg has some great graphics and can run on most computers but you should also consider that not all computers should be running on ultra. When it comes down to hackers yes there are some proven hackers and PUBG is doing a great job to get rid of them but in all 400+ hours of this game I have ever played (played for over a year now) I can say that there has been a few people who killed me and seemed slightly suspicous and in that case I reported them for suspicous activity but I have also noticed that whatever hack they do (unless it's like a god mode hack but i haven't ever come across that) that the hack usually isn't as threatening as most people think. Before things get to far I do wanna say that this game should fix the hacker problem but that most of the time killing a hacker would be the same as killing any other player and even then coming across a hacker (in my experience) is very rare I don't have numbers off the top of my head but I would confidentily say that every 1 out of 100 matches you player there is a hacker you most likely confront. Overall though I highly recommend this game if you like any other shooters or the literal hand shaking thrill in the top 2. Just make sure your computers performance matches with the configurations of the games video settings and that coming across hackers isn't as common as most people say.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-11,0,0,684,False,Not Recommended,The concept overall is excellent and does provide a good deal of enjoyment. This is however countered by the developer's attitude toward the player base. The implementation of a gambling based loot system (although still not affecting player performance) as well as a negligence to address cheating/game balancing are unacceptable. Ping restriction on server connections must be addressed as any truly competitve game bars the game from being called truly competitive. Few things are less satisfying than being shot from behind a wall or taking a bullet from a dead man. Regional/language restrictions would aide player communication and address most of the cheating issues as 99% of cheats are coming from China (http //www.legitreviews.com/brendan green says 99 pubg cheats china_201098). Regardless of regional attitudes this cancer to the game should be addressed. The preferred solution would be to have effective anti cheat measures and ban those who employ them on an IP level in order to create a level playing field for the Chinese players who indeed do play fair. Another possible solution is allowing individuals to set up client servers with their own rules/guidelines as to who may join (ping related) or control banning. As it stands I am having progressively more negative experiences with PUBG and am irritated by Brendan Green's (being the face of PUBG Corp) attitude toward the player base as not having legitimate concerns.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One of the most unoptimized public releases I've seen especially considering it was in EA to iron out things like this. Pathetic disgusting and disgraceful.Edit SEVEN months later still an unoptimized mess laggy servers horrible netcode. Laggy clients still get to make decisions like shooting people that aren't really there walking through closed doors and what not.Edit Two months later.. Still has severe client server sync issues. e.g. state of doors not being synced getting killed through closed doors since the client doesn't have the correct state from the server hence the enemy can see you and kill you through a door you think is closed.Also there is a bug where sometimes the walls/floor doesn't load on the client causing the player to see through them but also SHOOT through them which is horrible since it proves that the CLIENT is making the decision whether or not bullets can go through walls or not and not the SERVER. Even a noob developer with 30 minutes of experience wouldn't make such a stupid design decision.Edit One month later... still plagued with mediocre optimizations and clunky servers.The client/server desync is real especially when client shows shots as hits while the server seems not to.. after playing for many hours with shadowplay we got a few videos where auto ing half a mag at point blank spewing blood over the screen still doesn't kill ppl..one has to wonder wtf is going on.Server desync causing items to disappear your mate drops ammo at your feet still doesn't show up on your client..Flickering black squares when using red dot sights.. flickering textures in general in some places..Getting stuck in objects like rocks/debris etc is far from uncommonGame freezing when trying to load back into the main menu after match..Spectate is still a joke you friend zooms in with scope at an enemy what to do you see? 8x zoom into the ground straight down ggDon't forget the running jump punch hs that deals as much damage as a 7 62 to the head logicInitial review 5th of AprilExtremely poorly optimized both client and server/net code.Can't even run it fully smooth with semi lowered settings on a Titan X 12 GB VRam I run Witcher 3 on pretty much maxed out settings with very little problems.Desync issues are real af be ready to get shot half a second after running behind a wall.This game also brought me my first Blue screen ever on Win 10 impressive feat.Other than that the games is fun but since these issues especially the net code can ruin a game so easily I'd not recommended it until they actually spend some of the new earned money on hiring some people who know how to develop these aspects of the game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The maps are so lazily throw together every building looks the same making the game really repetitive and boring to look at nothing on the map truly stands out because of that.

2017-08-04,0,0,21,True,Recommended,I finally upgraded my graphics card for this game and I must say that I have had a blast with it. I have only managed to kill myself once with a frag because I was talking to the wife. I just want to point out that most of the negative reviews that I have seen are due to the microtransactions but that's just a way for a company to make money. You shouldn't judge a game by that. That's like judging a game on graphics. If you really are getting that butthurt then request a refund. It's not that difficult. I just hate that Steam users are doing the same thing to PUBGs that they did GTA V when a mod was shut down. With the rant out of the way here is what I have to say Played mostly Solo games they're pretty great because there isn't much communication going on. Even if there is trust no one. Beware of campers.Duo is cool if you have a scrub you can play with more danger due to if you see one guy 10/10 there's another nearby. Squads is duo on steroids. Everything is a trap.AKM is bae.Also on the lobby island there is a tin building behind the cave (have to go around) there are weapons in there to try since anybody with an SSD will take most of the table weapons.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-26,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,This game needs to take a few pages from rust mods of the same genere. For example having a first and third person observation of the game after death would allow for something to do afterwards instead of just disconnecting from the server to re navigate the menu system back into a new game only to die and do the same thing. At the moment it feels kind of like a menu navigator with some fps aspects added on. Also being able to aim down the sights of the guns would be a plus. Unfortunately as I paid $20 for Rust and $30 for this game I cannot honestly say it deliveres a game worth reccomendation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

For some users (including me) sometimes or maye most of the time when you spawn your textures (houses especially) wont load and ive tried a couple of fixes and nothing will help. &gt Community heard some ppl crying about hackers well i dont know.. didnt really find any since i started playing or i didnt saw anything suspicious all tho.. its a game hackers will always exist in the end. &gt OPINION SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME? Well id say yes and no... MOSTLY NO! the game is good but the optimization s*its on everything if u are ready to go on fps drops missing textures and all that s*hit then buy it if not wait till further patches.My review will change in the future if the game improves but for now i wil go with a freakin NO NO! p.s 8gb ram gtx 1070 i5 3470 3 2Ghz cant say my rig is good but neither bad for a piece of .... like this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I run an overclocked i7 with 16gb of fast RAM and a 1080ti on a 150M/150M FiOS connection averaging 6ms to Google DNS and have been a custom PC builder for over a decade.With that in mind this game suffers from fundamental issues like epic server lag terrible distribution of weapons/gear too long to get into a game (2+ minutes with silly shooter ""lobby"" and airdrop) and unoptimized graphics. At Ultra on my rig there's tons of stuttering making it almost unplayable. Elements in the game are unpredictably unresponsive (often lag between sending ""open door"" and door beginning to open) and your shooter experience is slave to the glacially slow animations of your character reloading a gun or throwing a grenade. Vehicle dynamics are decent. Oh and apparently the grenade timers are set in hours because they give anyone in the area plenty of time to pour a cup of tea finish it and leisurely walk away before it goes off. Very unhappy paying money for this game. Initially enjoyed it until the real flaws started to grate on my game after game after game of dying before I could even find a pistol (occasionally 5+ minutes into the game.) Really guys?

The only difference now is that it isn't ""cheater!"" it's now ""stream sniper!"" and now they're actually getting banned from the ing game. While this is a problem on the Dev's part the game itself is very good to play.Just like any other game you have good days playing the game and you have bad days. You may lose a ton or you may win a ton but that doesn't mean you have to write a bad review for the game itself talking about how it is when you lose a ton of games. I've played with people who are absolute garbage at the game and still won. I've played with people who are professionals at the game and I've still lost. I've played alone and I've won more than I lost because there was only one target to killSo why am I telling you this? Because if you're absolute at the game and you've either played five minutes or seven hundred hours then get ing better at the game and don't write a negative review about the game itself. BUT if you got banned from a stupid who screamed ""stream sniper!"" at you and you were just minding your own business then write all the negative you want.In conclusion devs if you're reading this stop banning people because a streamer yelled ""stream sniper!"". The reason why I ask this is because it's complete t.

2017-09-23,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Pure While being hyped for by the streaming community is the only game i've ever encountered that manages to perform WORSe then AC Unity (an achievement in itself for anyone who tried to play it with any GPU that wasnt a top tier NVIDIA one from the same time period).Meanwhile the dev is currently attacking Epic for making a battle royale like game... but at least I'm willing to imagine Epic will actually leverage the potential from the Unreal Engine which the lack of performance clearly shows these devs have not.While it's safe to argue it's hard to leverage all potential for the Engine to shoot yourself as much in the foot as this team does is yet another achievement in itself.For me the current comparison (as an avid Arma3 BR fan ) Performs worse even multi gpu then Arma3 Single GPU even when PUBG is at the absolute lowest settings spare resolution and Arma is on High with only realtime shadows on medium... and even looks much worse at the same time Has potential to introduce interesting group based systems... but since it's supposed to be a competitive environment the lack of performance is inexcusable... UE has perfect options to include Vulkan support (which would've at least alleved the multi gpu GUI issues which are only matched by AC Unity again) is not employed and when trying to use the vulkan tag and some workarounds from experience with the UE BattlEye is being a whiney little for attempting to use the vulkan dll in the windows sysfolders... REALLY? NO benchmarking/testing options/possibilities whatsoever while the devs better know how bad the performance issues are... are we supposed to join a random lobby and potentially CTD while loading? come on... At some point when attempting Vulkan it turns out the game won't even detect driver version properly and erroneously suggests a downgrade (which I tried resulting in the game CTD'ing henceforth in 4k fullscreen no issues in windowed but even more performance loss and mouse input lag added to boot)This may be early access but at least when using the UE use it's damn good set of assets (Mainly referencing to the shader/SFX here) to your advantage... Or even better pick an engine for an actual reason because I can't find a logical explanation for the current state of affairs.Currently all this game really has is a lot of steamers' hype based on empty promises... If you look at this project from a developmental standpoint it is an absolute joke... not keeping mind of performance for something which is intended to be anywhat competitive...

PUBG is in a good spot right now.Now and again I still have issues like random crashes or servers that grind to a halt with massive packet loss. Cheaters are rare but still exist. A large amount of players in China still connect to North America servers which leads to desync still being an issue but this is minor in comparison to how it was just a short while ago.All in all PUBG is good again.

They had and still do have a massive community to back the game up and support its updates and new features but due to poor choices none of these things have been done. Lazily developed and pushed to full release on a sub par core game filled with glitches and cheaters only for further publicity. They have the audience to deliver but they're just not delivering making it an un enjoyable experience to play in. The concept for the game is wonderful a juggernaut in the battle royale genre but falls short in everything but the concept. The audience gives their feedback and the developers choose to ignore it and add more broken features and an entire map. I cannot say this game is fun as it's slow in the middle to even end. Cheesy tactics are way too welcome making the community toxic and abusive. Badly developed bad community just a cesspool of bad things.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-24,0,0,1374,False,Recommended,*RE REVIEW FOR LATE 2018Yes PUBG is a way better place than launch. There is no arguin with that it just is. Is that place good enough to stand up against trhe weight of criticism? I dunno. The gunplay is great but the whole game is still clunky as fook. Why Bluehole haven't let us use banadges while moving I just don't know. Why we still have to reload every gun and switch fire mode when you pick a gun up is beyond me. The greed is really showing now too with so many skins for sale that require IRL cash it's pretty disgusting tbh. But I'm an adult and am capable of ignoring microtransactions. $20 for a nurse's outfit is bloody shady though. The cheating seems to have been gotten under control or the same amount of control as other pc games. I still encounter them from time to time but you will never eradicate cheaters completely. As for player morals they have gotten no better. That's all I can say there. Server performance was a massive issue a bit a go causing huge desync and disparity between clients with tickrate being a major concern. I am happy to say this issue has been massively improved by a secret update that improved things all round. I no longer get shot behind cover and no one gets to run up on me and kill me in 3 frames of animation. So while the greedy corporation is starting to rear it's ugly head the core gameplay is now at a level where I can recommend this game for it's gunplay and core mechanics which are now up to par. It's a great game to hook up with friends and go create some epic and tactical moments. Just leave your wallet in another room. If you want clarification or proof of the server upgrades and tick rate look for wtfmoses on YouTube he made a video recently.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Just dont harress streamers and you will be fine.This battle royal game is fun and addictive specially with friends! The game is early access and there is still work to be done but with that said you can and will still enjoy this game.+ The good ++ The game is early access but the devs works on it all the time and there is updates like every week+ You can play both in first or in third person depending on what you prefer+ You can play solo duo or squad (3 4 players)+ Teamwork and strategy choose where to go do you want to land where it is action right away or a place where you think no other players will go? Should you take the car or run? What place should you go next and so on.+ Alot of loot diffrent weapons and attachements The bad sometimes laggy servers the cars in first person cant see anything going downhillOther notesIts abit of a learning curve both with learning the map since its a big map and handling all the diffrent weapons etc but dont worry you will get better with time.Microtransactions are just clothes you have on your character nothing to do with the gameplay so dont worry about that.Now go buy this game and play it with your friends already!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-01,0,0,242,True,Recommended,First of all I want to address the micro transactions. If you actually read the announcments instead of listening to third party information you would know that right now it's just a limited time thing to jump start the competitive community and some of the money is even being donated to charity. If you don't care about this sort of thing don't buy it. Your character is going to look different within the first five minutes of gameplay or will probably die anyways. That being said I understand that people are jaded after many early access games have cut and run after ramping up their player base with paid DLC **cough cough ARK cough cough** and other micro transactions. It sucks it really does. It sucks just as much as all the broken triple A titles being shipped today. It sucks just as much as the insane price of season passes for most online triple A titles. The game industry is just another business. Wether it's your ISP trying to get as much money out of you as possible or your cell phone company trying to tack on hidden fees most businesses will inevitably try to take as much of your hard earned money as possible. That's just how the world is right now.If you've read this far I appologize for the rant but I feel it's nessisary to put things into perspective when it comes to early access games. Early access games are a gamble. You pay half the price of a triple A title with the hope that the game will stick around long enough for you to have your fun. NOW TO THE GAME I really enjoy this game. I have many friends who play this game. I will continue to play this game. I may even give up a little more of my hard earned cash to this game. If my friends can put 300+ hours into this game I don't see why I couldn't get at least 100 hours out of it and that's more than a lot of $60 titles these days. If you like shooters or if the idea of the game intrigues you I would say just go for it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-09,0,0,181,True,Recommended,"With around 80 hours into PUBG I decided to do a review for people thinking of getting into what should they expect and and what it is.Player Unknown's Battleground's Review Gameplay The gameplay plays out fantastic if it didn't it wouldn't have been able to overcome DOTA 2 and CS GO.There is always that sense of hostility in the air because there is everyone out there trying to kill you unless you are playing squad or duo.There are certain areas and aspects where the game is buggy which is to be expected as the game is still in Early Access.The gameplay requires a great deal of prediction and quick decision making and even more so when playing in a squad or duo.Graphics Well what can I say it is made in Unreal 4 so naturally it is quite aesthetically appealing too.Though there are still some issues with it rendering and problems with the world lighting effects.This will improve over time with patches and updates.Hardware and Optimization I wouldn't say it requires a beefy system to run because 'running' is quite a misleading term.This is an FPS + fast paced so more frames/s means better gameplay output from you.You can't really expect a person with 15 fps on 75% render scale to be able to do anything.I run it with a ryzen 3 1300X + gtx 1050ti 4gb + 16gb at 1366x768 at ultra settings and get easily 60 70 FPS even in the cities.As long as you can run the game at 60 fps even if it is in the lowest settings it is okay but make sure to play at 100% render scale otherwise the game will look blurry af.The optimization kinda is there but don't really expect anything in the optimization field anytime soon.Bluehole will be releasing new content for a while only.Maybe in the monthly update there will be optimization included.Price Well here is the main thing xD is it worth the price of 999 INR ? Well look at this aspect would you play a game for free but it is in both gameplay and graphics or buy a game but get great/good gameplay with decent graphics which you also have fun playing ?The "" worth the price "" aspect differs from person to person personally for me I find it worth it till the very last dime.I am having a lot of fun playing it whether it is solo or teams.Conclusion Great gameplay decent graphics buggy and rendering issues but that can be resolved in later updates.A must have game inspite of being in early access.Rating 9/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-03,1,3,1374,False,Not Recommended,I've owned the game since the end of summer last year during august. When I first started playing everything felt smooth and playable for the most part so I didn't have any issues. While certain weather modes would ruin my performance it would never be unplayable. As the months passed the game improved in performace and content. Although after patch 1.0 which was the full release of the game everything went down hill. The game became plgued with hackers which forced me to go into ffp for the majority of my time playing. As months passed after the chaeaters situation the game was lacking in more content as a fully released game but as each update came the performance began to go backwards . The gmaes servers started to cause stuttering frame loss and crashes. Not to mention recently this year the playerbase has been bombarded with paid crate after paid crate. While these crates were never needed in the first place the developers have ignored the need for performance updates. Recently they have admittted to their faults in falling short in addressing peformance issues which seemed good at first but after this recent SUPPOSSED PERFORMANCE UPDATE. The game has not changed at all. I honestly wish the game would have kept the same consistency it had when it was in early access instead of full release. I would like the recommend this game but with the state it is in now. I cannot bring myself to recommend it to anyone. I love this game and all of its concepts but the development team is killing it with not addressing more serious issues while giving us paid crates that aren't needed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-09,1,3,104,True,Recommended,Ok so first off I would reccomend this game at the moment to anyone who gets less than 60fps on CS GO as you'll get like 5fps on this game. Hopefully as time goes on the devs will optimise more though.The game play is fun but can sometimes feel a little repetitive or tedious. For example every game you stock up with good loot only to get sniped from somewhere you can't even see or someone camps in a house with a shotgun waiting for you. However as you keep playing you do get better and have better ideas of how to get into the top 10.The weapons and items are good and theres a range of guns for everyone and what they prefer i.e shotguns assult rifiles SMG's and snipers. There are glitches in this game but I have seen improvements from the devs. The servers aren't the best and I have had multiple occasions where a shot dead on an enemy has completly missed due to server lag.This game is fun to play especially with friends. Although I have made the majority of my review about the negatives I would definatly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys multiplayer shooters. I think this game will be on another level once the devs are finished and take it out of early access. GET IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! (if you can run it!),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-28,0,0,60,True,Not Recommended,FIRST REVIEWGot this game with all the hype around it. you'll soon find that the games core gameplay is fun however during the time of cool 1v1 battles with people there will also be times that make you want to throw the mouse arcoss the room it comes down to the poor physics that are literally trash for this style of game and im sure you know the main reasoning to why this game lacks that thumbs up appeal. Thats right turn the game down to minecraft graphic mode and you basically win for starts i didn't do it i thought what is the point in playing a game that looks like an a hole however when you are running into the zone (leaving it late like everyother er) and you get shot by ing american sniper through more trees and grass then your local national park... SO you join in on the graphics just for a fair playing field which is just boring. And last thing i can't stand with this game is how the healing system is ed at first i thought better get into the zone in good time only to get shot in the from people leaving it late and how they do this? heal and use painkillers constantly i tried it myself to find how easy it is to spam heals to make it in the last zone for the last i.e 15 i think (most won't agree) that if you late to the zone for more then a min and for the last one too! you should just die because it destory the point of the game with getting into the zone and all that,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-14,1,3,951,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG is fun for a while but with gained experience certain flaws become painfully apparent. If you're a passionate and competitive player this game will test your patience in more ways than one. If you usually end up obsessing about improving your skill and enjoy winning heed my warning STAY AWAY! It's one of those games that came close to greatness and have caused me frustration. If you ever jumped on the DayZ wagon maybe you'll empathize. Having given my feelings for this game an unhealthy amount of thought here's me getting my conclusion of my chest for probably nobody to read. Let the rant begin!The network performance is abysmal. Be prepared to get hit behind cover constantly opponents gliding about and crazy peeker's advantage. The movement desync is higher than firing. Meaning you'll see players shooting you before their movement animations represent as much seeing you before turning shooting when stuck in animations. Super bullets you'll get hit multiple times instantly players having shot you for quite a while before you're even able to react. The hit registration is client side and there's no max lag compensation. So a player with 400 ping will shoot you multiple times before you'll even see him effectively killing you before you can do anything. It becomes more about who can abuse the desync better not aim or outmaneuver. If games like CS GO or Overwatch have ever caused you irritation for its desync this is on another level. Seriously stay away.The client performance is also pretty bad. You will need a legitimate beast of a PC to run this smoothly at 144 FPS. Even if you get the FPS high there are constant stutters and hiccups. Mainly because the frametimes aren't stable and 100 fps feel like 30. If you're used to console or deem 60 fps enough you'll be fine. If you care about graphics this game looks like absolute . Like something out of 2003 with glitching anti aliasing. It's an eyesore for sure. Also there are bugs that have been present for over a year now and have yet to be fixed.The gameplay is where the game shines ... for a little while. When you're new chasing the ""winner winner chicken dinner"" (last person standing) is exhilarating. However you'll soon realize some methods are overpowered for achieving this objective especially passive ones. In example going to remote areas and looting for long periods of time will 100% ensure you're getting geared while others are dying without risk. Then you'll move into the late game. Not having seen enemies for 15 20 minutes this will naturally make you anxious and excited. When you're new mostly you'll just die and loose the gear. Rinse repeat the game soon turns into a looting/driving/running/camping simulator if you're chasing ""Chicken Dinners"". If that's your cup of tea you'll enjoy PUBG for sure. For most though this becomes increasing tedious and boring because it doesn't challenge you. And this is where you'll face problems if you want to continue placing high because this is the only viable tactical style for continuously winning.So what do most experienced players end up doing? They ""drop hot"" which is the popular term for starting games in locations having established themselves as popular PvP areas. Needless to say compared to beforementioned passive and tedious strategies this is very risky. Not only do you infinitely increase your chances of dying (or your teammates dying) but there's no reward even if you're successful. Winning these popular drops will not yield you better gear than those who went to remote areas. More often you'll come out with much less having chewed though armor ammo grenades health bandages first aids boosters and most importantly time and teammates. If you want to win doing this just isn't worth it. Ever. Not even close.So why do so many players still do it? Because it's fun and challenging even if it isn't a viable way to win. In other words if you like winning and PvP this game will cause you frustration because you can't have your cake and eat it too You can't have fun and win too. Like ranking up? You'll be better off looting meds for 25 minutes every game and hiding. Actually the rank 80 player in EU right now does this and doesn't actually use weapons. That's how overpowered passive playstyles are you don't actually need weapons he doesn't even TRY to shoot others. (MasterT94).This issue causes a lot of problems and has polarized the community for a long time. It's been an ongoing debate between enthusiasts and frustrated critics and where both should've won the PvP oriented players have lost completely. The PUBG competitions have established a niche community dedicated to players willing to compete at ""who can play passive styles better"". Employing weapons mostly to scare other teams away out of game handshaking so they don't land on each other or when forced into conflict much later in the game. There's never an incentive to search for action so if you like to PvP but you also want to do well this game will frustrate you. It's not even viable to risk fighting when you're desperate exemplified in article https //www.pubgradar.com/n/5b3fa5a7abd73400213866f8 The offensive side of an idealistic ""viability continuum"" is none existent and so you're only left with obviously better passive strategic choices and obvious choices aren't choices at all. PUBG have yet to acknowledge such balancing issues. If you prioritize winning you will probably grow bored pretty quickly when you realize the tedious nature of achieving it. And even then if you actually want to gain rank through passive styles The ranking system is flawed for this exact reason and nobody actually respects it. Not even the ""pros"" who've dedicated themselves to winning at PUBG will respect your ability to win absurd as it sounds. Most lose respect for winning and by extension the e sport competitive aspect is alienating only competing at passive styles of play not encompassing the PvP accomplishments most audiences find awe inspiring. Returning to reviewing the actual game PUBG has a lot of fun moments. Even if it doesn't support long term engagements as I've detailed thus far the short term spectacle can be fun. Especially when playing with friends the gunplay is great in spite of networking issues and a breath of fresh air compared to most shooters. Clunky but very rewarding. Also driving cars throwing grenades explosions stressful situations and many many failures offer its own sort of fun. If you're that kind of player jumping from game to game without the intention of long term engagements not caring if you lose a lot it's probably worth checking out with friends. Is that worth 30 bucks? You decide.I ve played PUBG a lot but stopped trying to win long ago though I never stopped trying to improve (should be complimentary aspects but isn t). It sounds smug but surviving longer isn t challenging and therefore not interesting. I still play because I enjoy the gunplay and PvP in and of itself discarding all chicken dinners in favor of PvP. As a competitive person this has been a very confusing experience. I don t respect the competitive scene at all considering them a niche of commercially manufactured athletes . And the game s made me so frustrated with its development and ignorance I m unwilling to spent another dime on it. In my frustration I ve found myself hoping that it fails. If any other game replicates the gunplay and introduced a wider viability continuum I m out for good.TL DR If client and network performance is important to you STAY AWAY! Else PUBG is fun for a while but not worth a long term engagement. The game isn't competitive as only passive and tedious playstyles are rendered viable something devs aren't acknowledging and generally seem unable or unwilling to make substantial changes.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-17,0,0,333,False,Recommended,PUBG has updated so much ever since it's early access launch. And it has never failed to amuse me to every update they made (YET). Every match every player starts from ZERO. Skills will definitely be tested in the game. That's why I like it so much. The things that you wanna do is just so versitile. You could play either a sneaky bastard snake or just the guy who shoots all things he sees. Or adjust your guns personally depending on the components you get. Its challenging actually challenging to get to the top every match. Imagine yourself beating all 99 players and being the last man standing. ITS BADASS. BUT OVERALL... gameplay's good. Visual and effects are good. Servers are quite unstable sometimes but not always. NOTE Players who hack gets banned easily (If reported). NOTE 2 This game has a HIGH REQ for everyone's pc.

The first few months i couldn t play this game beacuse my pc was too bad. July last year a got a new pc. With this pc i could play the game flawless. The play principle is Battle Royale. I really liked the game but with the new pc i noticed how bad the servers were. Despite the servers i played this game all the time. So good so far. After the 1.0 patch everything become worse. First of all why would you randomize which map to play no thinking behind this. Although they meant they fix it nothing so far. New map weapons and cars are all ok thats not the problem. Also the performance got way better with the new patch but...The servers are still bad... very bad.. And if you think how many people buyed this game buying good servers shouldn t be a problem...Also sometimes the loot spawn is a joke if you loot 3 houses in military base and only find melee weapons can t understand that...I was just playing a game on the new map 10+ kills full equip and then the game just crashes my whole pc. Im dying right now(can t be my computer i7 16gb ram and 1070 strix).PLEASE BLUEHOLE fix all the bugs and server issues before you patch 1000000000 new things in this game. It s just a joke that this is the most hyped game in 2017...............I wouldn t recommend buying this game to anyone before fixing all this t.This game would be so good if only the servers were good the game wouldn t crash all the time and you could choose which map to play.

2017-07-28,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,"TLDR Performance of game is terrible mods are banning for stupid reasons paid crates in early access and devs are working on console port when PC version isn't finished. Skip this for now unless you have multiple friends to play with and a super computer.At this point in time I cannot recommend this game to anyone. There are multiple problems with this game that need fixed before the developers make this game great instead of good.1. The optimization is absolutely atrocious. Now I average probably about 60 FPS on good areas on the map but sometimes those are hard to come by. My game constantly drops down to 1 FPS (yes you read that right) in areas and it'll happen in about 3 5 second intervals which makes the game unplayable. Now before you ask if my PC can even run this game my specs are an i5 4690k OC'd to 4.2 Ghz with an OC'd GTX 1070 and the game is on an SSD. I have tried almost every settings guide and tinkered with settings for a couple hours and nothing has worked for me.2. Playerunknown (the creator of the game) himself needs to get mods under control. I have seen a couple posts on Reddit about people being banned for ""stream sniping"" from killing popular PUBG streamers when in fact they were not stream sniping. The mods banned these people without hard evidence that this was happening which is not okay. 3. Last but not least Playerunknown has announced that he wants to introduce PAID crates in an UNFINISHED EARLY ACCESS game. This is unacceptable. There is so much that needs worked on in this game and they decide to try and make a cash grab move before the game is even at full release. Imagine if the amount of time and effort to implement this would go into optimization of the game....In conclusion I cannot recommend this game to anyone without an i7 7700K and a GTX1080 Ti and even then it might be if y. The developer needs to get his priorities in order to make this game better than the average early access DayZ/H1Z1 like game. Edit Playerunknown has announced that there will only be one paid crate as a test in early access and has explained in further detail of how the system will work so point three is now invalid.Also August's update looks promising optimization wise so hopefully some issues will be fixed!Edit 2 After the initial August update my optimization seemed to improve on a small scale. I do get better FPS in some areas and do not have drops but in medium to large towns/cities the performance is still terrible. Mini rant They have now officially announced they've partnered with Microsoft to make a port to Xbox One which is not the right thing to do in my opinion. Without the game being finished on PC I believe they will rush and/or not finish the game for us because of Microsoft's agenda. If this game comes out polished straight out the gate on console I will be furious. Finish the PC version first then port to console.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-21,0,0,634,False,Recommended,The negative reviews are ridiculous. The game at its core is worthy of a shot at Game of the Year. It is an endless amount of fun and even more fun when playing with friends. There are issues with the servers that have consistently been improved there are issues with hackers that have been consistently dealt with and there have been issues without a region lock which is partially on the way.

2017-09-03,0,0,171,True,Recommended,25 hours played so far and all I can say is amazing. I fell in love with this game it's good cause it's intense and you always have to care of what is happening around you cause there might be someone. So yeah I'll do some Pros and Cons now.Pros+ Very big map you can play on the entire map.+ Variety of gun and accesories. My favourites are the Scar L and a 4X Scope.+ Variety of vehicles. There are cars (Uaz Dacia Buggy) motorbikes and boats.+ Different weather and time modes (Mid day Sunset and Rain + Thunderstorm)+ You can easily have fun with your friends for example by trying to win only with a car etc.Cons And this will be first on the list because many people will be wondering. It's quite bad performance! If you have a bad PC / Laptop don't get it! I have a i7 + GTX 860M laptop and everything on very low except the view distance gets me only 40 FPS normally. Usually sudden fears let's say. As I said at the beggining you might go looking at everywhere and suddendly get shot and you will probably get scared and jump from the seat a bit ) So if you have any heart problems obviously wouldn't be good to get it. Raging. Yeah well you might get flattened by a car or simply jump 200 m in the sky because a bug and die and you will probably rage the f*ck out of you. So if you have expensive things at home be careful when running at an open field not to die from a car cause you might hit something and break something after. Bugs. There are lots of bugs but it's on Early Access so it's ok for me. Bugs can relate with the upper con. Jumping etc. It's quite difficult to get jumping to places but I have heard they will introduce a parkour update soon and that will change the things quite much.Apart from that wouldn't say nothing else. Overall I love this game as said at the beggining and unless I start getting very angry I don't think I'll stop playing it in a while. Hope you enjoyed this review and Like it so others can see.

Unfortunately the development for this game started taking a nose dive down the sh*tter what with adding microtransactions. It's not even that buying cosmetics is bad on it's own (it is in a pay to play game) it's the greedy no effort tactic of increasing profit by imposing false value on said cosmetics and making you have to gamble for them instead of being able to outright buy them. This turns low effort cosmetic DLC that would otherwise be worth no more than a few pence or bloody well free considering we bought the game ffs into items of inflated value that will cost you well in excess of it's logical value to get what you want.

It is constantly updated and patched to keep it interesting. The mechanics work well with switching between 3rd and 1st person and I feel that most of the loot is balanced and well thought out.

2017-11-21,0,0,228,True,Not Recommended,The Game in concept is great. For the most part this game plays really well aside from the usual bugs and glitches and most games are fun fast paced and heart pounding. Oh wait I meant this game USED to be fun. The game is now knee deep in hackers that most games you are just waiting to see an aim bot or a speed hack. Blueholes complete lack of competence in the department of combating cheating is astonishing. The system in place to report cheaters only letsyou report them IF THEY KILLED YOU. If you down someone see them fly across the screen like an angry spider and then are killed by someone else you can't report the actual cheater. Cheaters ruin this game completely. In fact I don't even see the point of cheating in this game it takes away from the entire soul of the game. If it wasn't for the current refund policy I would want my money back.

With my internet that takes around 6 hours (download speed is just very slow but I can play with low pings). This means that when I download things I usually do overnight which I did with this game but since updates are so frequent (wouldn't be a bad thing if the dev team wasn't a complete how) I haven't been able to play this game in well over a month as every time the download has finished theres always a new update (I usually waited a day or two before downloading it AGAIN).In other words game is unplayable for anyone with sub par download speeds or a restriction on how much data they can use.0/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Seriously it's the better game! Played a ton of it already! Great level design building cover better loot system better gunplay just more fun overall ) And also better pacing )!Update Nr. 4 You might see a lot of people playing this game on steam charts by the love of god don't become one of them this game is average or bad in any respect imaginable. I really really can NOT recommend this game!Update Nr. 3 Oh so now we are at the point where the game has more and more bugs connection issues and even the leaderboards that once worked are now completelty broken (as in they do not record any stats for me). gg wp! Oh and did I mention the ugly sprays everywhere which try to suck off twitch streamers?Update Nr. 2 OH wow so no micros transactions before launch and here they are! Now the devs officially join the ranksd of other scummy ea devs! Congrats! Oh and did I mention they always push back updates further an dfurther and the games launch date? No longer than x months ea my )Update All my points are still valid even months after launch! But we got us a new hero SERVERS TOO BUSY! YAY Now I can finally experience what this game would have been like if it was a hyped AAA release! THANK YOU PLAYER UNKOWN! Yup this is EA alright I think the game itself is good but the execution is Plain Core Gameplay Looting feels laggy and urnesponsive The Netcode is horrible shooting at people feels horrible you never know if your hits will count or not The walking climbing and any collision with the environment is garbage. Feels like a f2p MMO from 2006 The game has a lot of random factors (I won't even start with loot placement) especially the random circle placements in the later parts (top 10+) can be super Scoring system is garbage you get way more points instantly dying cause reaching top 20 gives jack and the base bonus and kills are the main meat. (yeah sure I got a lot the few times I won but that is very rare in such a game) Edit Reached top 9 got oneshot by sniper got 150 points droped down at end of flight got 4 kills on partially afks with my fists (you can even oneshot people with fists! ""headshot"") got 210 points. 25min vs 2 min. Is this deathmatch or battle royale? The scoring clearly says deathmatchOverall probably the least hardcore/competitive shooter I have played in a long time (thx to random/bad game design) with the worst gunplay thx to the netcode.Should it get better after EA I will feel free to recommend the game atm it sucks more than it should even for EA.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Shoot a guy 7 times with a ak see 7 red splats comming from the target just for the server to go nope and refund4 rounds of ammo like it didnt happen.More rng fun.Wearing level 3 helmet and level 3 body armor just to get one shot from a pump action shotty from across the building yet point blank a naked guy hit doesnt register and he one shots you in the dome with a pistol.Land with another enemy you pick up magnum load it and put 2 rounds sqaure in his chest yet he somehow knocks you out.I know its EA I know it can get better but im not gonna sit here and fanboi this game. Save your time money and frustration level and make these guys earn your cash release a gold level game.Also there are two types of players fighting for the futore direction of this game. The first are the CoD/Halo/Counterstrike/name any other twitch title crew and the other are the Arma/Dayz/realism crew.Right now the twitch crew is winning because I have never deliberately aimed for someones head while running and gunning I still manage to get headshots because EVERYBODY seems to get nothing but headshots in this game regardless of range.Hope with all the effort they have put into this game it just doesnt turn into another run of the mill running jumping and headshotting game but honestly I have zero faith in that not happening.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-19,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,"1.0 and I STILL hate this game.I hate this game with an upmost burning passionate hatred more volatile and intense than a thousand Suns all scorching the Earth till it's nothing but a seeping hot ball of plasma. This game...THIS GAME....First let me start by the things that are less opinion focused and more factual. The way things are rendered in this game are stupidly outdated. Things like Foliage and small structures that act as concealment don't even render properly outside of 250 meters where a lot of engagements outside of buildings tend to take place. So you might think you're being a true ninja sniper assassin bush wookie by crawling on the ground being sneaky like but to others you look like a complete nimrod dryhumping a freshly cut lawn in the open. This is a problem from way back in 2005 where the running gag was that the guy running the GeForce 5500 would be at an advantage due to the fact that the player is unable to see foliage. Why is this a thing in 2018?The movement in this game feels very stiff and unintuitive in some aspects but very arcadey and unrealistic in others. On one hand vaulting feels very slow and feels more like a curse than a blessing. After all why vault when you can simply jump over 90% of the vaultable surfaces? The vehicles control SO badly that they might as well not even be in the game. You could barely nick a bump in the road and be spun out even though you're not turning on the wheel or hitting the gas. And since there is no vehicles with armor or at least better cover there's almost no point in getting into these noisy death traps on wheels. But hey! At least you can peel out like in Mario Kart if you hold the brake and floor it at the same time amirite?Let's not forget the netcode. It's just...very ""ugh"" to get shot by some dude teleporting all over the place or shooting some guy several times only for them to turn around and shoot you then die moments later themselves. With how much cash this game is raking in there is ZERO excuse by this point for connectivity to still be this frustratingly bad at times.Okay so here's where the more opinion focused stuff comes out so you can agree or disagree as you see fit.The weapons are just...not fun at all honestly. I don't feel any genuine giddiness when I pick up a weapon that has a reputation for being powerful or reliable in real life. I get that they were aiming for a more realistic vibe in this game (which they overall did not succeed) but couldn't they sacrifice just a little bit of fun? This game is trying so hard to be serious and gritty that there's just no room for joy.Second of all this game is about 80% random. Who you're matched with/against where the circle will be where your drop plane comes in from what weapons will be in what buildings where the circle will shrink to and SO much more is flat out random. I mean I get it like items in Smash Brothers having a bit of RNG can help tip the odds in favor of a player that is less skilled to fend off a veteran player and perhaps even win. But people also forget that this can also stack the odds in the opposite direction as well with the veteran being more akin to a god amongst men. Since the game has RNG oozing from nearly every pore and crevasse things like an MMR system wouldn't really do any good as there are far too many variables involved to calculate.And lastly again the map design is so outrageously bad that I feel like a teenager could come up with better map layouts. Again like I stated before the maps have so little reliable cover that it really only adds to the whole RNG/Luck aspect of the game. If someone gets the jump on you you're already dead. There's nowhere to run nowhere to hide and no way of knowing when it'll happen. To piggyback on the weapons the firearms have very similar sounds that only the most dedicated sweaty tryhards will actually be able to distinguish each individual firearm. Because of this you won't really know what exactly you're up against until it's far too late. Trees in the game are pathetic toothpicks houses are typically death traps in many scenarios and don't get me started again on foliage and cover. The maps are just too wide open.From a nitpicky immersion standpoint there's nect to no flow between landmarks. Apartment buildings are in the middle of open fields with no roads connecting to them houses are on top of mountains with no normal way to get to the top the military base looks more like an industrial park with some red stars slapped on for that ""true KGB effect"" cities will have one maaaybe two roads through the center with houses seeming to be copy/pasted in a row because...reaons. Erangel just doesn't feel like it could possibly be a real place where people once were. Heck it doesn't even feel like an arena. It just feels like some guy lazily copy/pasted the same assets over and over in some places slapped on some roads and passed it off as a map. It's ugly lazy and inexcusable.Lastly I have to say that I dislike how I feel like I get absolutely nothing for my troubles in this game. You get literally or next to nothing for reaching landmark positions like top 50 top 25 top 10 top 5 top 3 or actually winning. And for a game where matches can drag on as long as half an hour that's a whole lot of time wasted running around looting buildings just for some guy who's purposefully downloading video games on his Xbox to slow his connection to shoot you while in his underwear and claim first place. Even so the things you get aren't particularly helpful or exciting. What's the point of a cool hat or hairdo when you'll be wearing a helmet? What's the point of a cool shirt when it'll be covered by body armor? People may have mixed opinions on it but I feel like that's one aspect that Fortnite Battle Royale got right. By sacrificing a little bit of realism for some fun they use shields instead of armor. That way you get to keep your signature look and cosmetics actually have some level of fulfilling meaning. But it's not like that matters because the cosmetics in this game are a joke anyways. There's nothing cool quirky funny or anything that has any level of personality in this game. It's generic to the max.I hate this game's guts and everything it stands for. I only reinstalled it to play 1.0 in hopes of SOME level of change. Instead I just booted up a game that may have been better optimized but is still a wreck all the same 1 out of 5",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-10,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,"This is Early access. So keep in mind this review can change.Right now this game is absolute garbage. The amount of time used on doing absolutely nothing is insane. Just running and being bored. Then mixed the boredom with absolutely dreadful game mechanics. Like Problems with getting over small broken fences and brick foundations (no leap over options). Clunky and bad item pickup mechanics. Poor Graphics and rendering. Unrealistic movements. A badly made deployment method. Wasteful and laggy Warmup timer that could have worked better not being part of the gameplay. Laggy movements. Bad shooting mechanics. Hard to use scope mechanics. Flawed reward system (even after i got enough BB to get a boxes it said ""Error unlocking the rewards"" and i lost the reward crate). A bunch of clothing options that have absolutely no value in game (I hope they add some stats to it or something). Laggy and slow Inventory. Cramming 100 people in to the same aircraft forcing 3 4 players to land at the same buildings punching each other to death within a minute or so from the start of the match. Calling it co op or duo play is BS. After one dies he may wait a very long time for the other player to finish his match just so they can play another one.Only good thing they have here is the idea. And even then they forgot to tell us why we are being dropped on this island to kill each other to begin with?So i wish i could get my money back.

2018-05-28,0,0,232,False,Recommended,A game whose rapid claim to fame became its greatest downfall. While the game can be very fun and is receiving updates (At a slow rate) to improve it the game is plagued with hackers and teamers (People who play as teams of 4 in 2 man lobbies etc.) this can ruin an otherwise perfect run you and your friends may have invested 40 or more minutes into. You'll find great loot and have all the heals you could ask for only to be shot by hacker 5000 feet away from you. The game mechanically still feels like it's in beta and really feels unpolished with parts of the map having 'bad' textures which will kill you or get you stuck in the unfortunate circumstance that you clip into them. Overall the game needs much work before it is even close to being worth the $30 asking price.

2017-10-03,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,The Game Itself Runs poorly even on high end systems especially for a game that looks as bad as this does. Very very buggy. Often when I land the buildings haven't even loaded in yet makign it impossible for me to loot anythign and a sitting duck for any other players.The gunplay is bland. Every gun feels like a peashooter even sniper rifles. The modding aspect is pretty interesting though.The problem is by the time only a handful of people are left your survival is basically entirely random rather than skill based. Hide and hope you see the enemy first. If you get unlucky and are seen before your enemy you lose. Bluehole's Stupidity The developers are blatant liars saying microtransactiosn would not be implemented until after it left early access then adding microtransactions in early access. Not to mention they said it'd leave early access by late 2017 then immediately said that's not true.They've also been threatening Fortnite a much better Battle Royale game I might add that's also free to play for being too similar. Despite the fact that you can't copyright a game genre. Not to mention this isn't even the first game in the genre.And of ocurse there's the recent issue of in game ads in the Chinese clients advertising VPNs.Also they have the tendency to ban people for killing streamers. Despite no evidence that these people are actually watching the streams.Overall don't give your money to these scumbags. The game isn't worth it anyway.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-29,0,0,521,True,Recommended,06/20/17 Out of the few early access games I have played/followed PUBG reigns supreme. The development of the game looks promising and in the right direction. PUBG in it's current state is not properly optimized but has made great progress each patch so far. The gameplay and its developmental progress is what keeps me playing. PUBG's combat is a more polished version of the combat from DayZ. If you ever enjoyed the firefights from DayZ Arma 3 and/or H1Z1 then this game is right up your alley. Like any early access game or any game for that matter PUBG has its flaws but ultimately the pros outweigh the cons. I am very excited to see the future development of PUBG and would easily reccomend this game.12/17/17 Its been 6 months and I would still reccomend this game. PUBG has gone through ups and downs through these months but overall the gameplay is why I keep coming back to play. Optimization has improved but stlil can be improved. The new map is very big and adds a new dynamic to the gameplay. PUBG is still the best early access game and best Battle Royale game currently available on the store.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-16,0,0,352,False,Not Recommended,Alright let's go straight to the things that make this game a success and why it is a TERRIBLE platform all at the same timePros Game introduced alot of customization that entices the player to find the best loot for their weapons ultimately to continue to top 10 and lastly to be the top team of the game. Firefights when fought are extremely action packed and can be really fun to engage in when with teammates (and solo admittedly). Updates are quite frequent compared to other EA games (before 1.0 update) and has spearheaded its way into setting a precedent for other upcoming developers. When on higher setting graphics the game looks visually appealing.although this game has made an impact on Steam for being the No.1 played game OAT it is still susceptible to stupid shenanigans that the developers unfortunately allowCons Without a shadow of a doubt *SERVER HOPPING* Games such as H1Z1 were riddled with AS server players because they abused the hell out of their ping and this game is no exception since its rise to the top. This is one of the MAIN things that I think needs to be addressed furthermore with the allowing of players to server hop they set a dangerous precedent that will allow other EA or AAA developers to allow such a feature. this shouldn't be the case. With the addition of a couple million users came the hackers you'll happily loot an area only to be sniped from 1000M away and insta die or shoot someone to oblivion only to see that your bullets had 0 affect whatsoever take caution whenever entering new lobbies. Last but definitely not least the Drop System. Have you ever gone to the rooftop of a building whilst someone is downstairs and you go to try to find a weapon only to not find one on the upper floors as the person below waits with an AR? this game is HILARIOUSLY ridiculous when it comes to that. You either find what you need in the first 10 seconds or the first 15 minutes it always seems to be hit or miss and it is something that NEEDS to be addressed.As much as I love to play this game It's the problems with the high ping AS players on NA servers Cheaters and Loot System that constantly push me back from actually enjoying this game hope this was a helpful review play safe!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They shoot you through walls move at superhuman speed take out your head with every shot and heal themselves instantly. More than 5 out of 10 games are infested with them.Bluehole can release as many new maps and bug fixes as they want but this game won't survive if they continue to ignore the problem.

2018-06-29,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,Basic walking simulator where you collect items for the first hacker/camper you come across.Only 3 types of people play this game Hackers Streamers and Trolls. There's no casual element to this game whatsoever. (unless you consider cheating or trolling as such.) Ironically this game makes for a poor competative experience as well as the RNG/luck factor involved being too dominant for a balanced competition.You need a 1080ti to get any use out of your 144hz monitor. You'll still get perfomance issues with even the best computer components.The netcode is an embarrasment.The overall design of this game is total amateur hour.The devs seem motivated only by revenue generation as efforts are made to provide microtransaction options but little is made to balance out the game or address existing bugs. There's no money in solving bugs as players have already paid for the game. So as such we see a lot of gimmics and vanity items being added but core issues being entirely ignored. (or even get denied as actually existing as is the case with cheating. Furthermore this is one of the easiest games to cheat in.) Cheaters are customers too so are stream snipers and trolls so they wont fix any of that.The one good thing this games got going is that it makes for a pretty decent spectator experience. I imagine that's why it's so dominant on Twitch. Pretty sure Twitch is whats keeping this game alive. BR in general is pretty okay to watch and it's only a question of time before an actually competent developer does a good job in making a BR game that is also fun to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-15,0,0,671,False,Recommended,"Let's start off by saying as much as I may or may not critisize this game in my review I believe my purchase was well spent and I have definitely gotten my moneys worth.The game started off extremely buggy just like any early access game in it's early stages yet BlueHole was very responsive and was constantly releasing patches. However I definitely can't say that the game is recieving the same attention now as it did a few months ago.I believe that the creators do care about PUBG and want it to progress instead of being like many other early access scams like dayZ but the main problem is that they arent following up on their promises. Honestly I cant trust anything that comes out of Brendan Greene's mouth after BlueHole promisied to create extra measures to prevent Chinese players from playing on EU and NA servers with 200+ ping (Ping lock) and manifesting TPP and alot of FPP games with cheats yet havent followed up on that and the community got called ""Xenophobic"" by Brendan Greene for suggesting region locking China where an overwhealming amount of cheats come from. Right now we need some updates to further prevent cheats which will ultimately have to be region locking China.Dont get me wrong I absloutely love this game. I think its an awesome idea executed perfectly. I really like the new gameplay updates coming out (The 2x is finally usable?!?!.) But I still feel like BlueHole may be catering to the Chinese audience instead of the rest of us because it brings in the most money. Hopefully we can get a ping lock sooner or later.

2018-06-19,1,3,677,False,Recommended,This game gets too much flak and much of it not what it deserves.as far as optimization if the game runs on it's minimum required hardware and gets 60frames in 1080p it's optomized fine if weaker specs can still run it it's optomized fine.is the game buggy? yes but you guys are blowing it out of proportion by a lot.it's still got better combat then the competition.i started with fortnite and hte moment i got pubg ( 3 4 months before 1.0 release) i never went back to fortnite i've seen teh changes done to it but they still have weapon bloom and other things that scream epic just wants it to be a game for casual gamers not anyone who takes it seriously.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Excellent server7. Duo and squad option8. Large trading otionCon 1. Horrible optimization2. Low tree details3. Poor field of view even at max settings4.

2017-08-03,0,0,194,True,Recommended,Five hours is enough for me to make a review because there isn't very much to talk about. But the game is pretty awesome. The gameplay is intense the controls are easy and the danger feels so ing real. So let's in' talk about that shall we?Okay so since the latest update we have 5 game modes solo duo squad solo FPS and duo FPS. The last two are just solo and duo but there is no switching between first and third person it just stays in first person. Which is pretty cool because it evens the playing field a little. Third person offers a wide area of view and it is much easier to spot enemy players. During shoot outs (when you zoom in) your view will be switched to first person. It can be kind of jarring at first but you get used to it. But the FPS gameplay changes everything suddenly you find yourself very carefully peeking around corners. You soon learn that med long range weapons do absolutely nothing in buildings as it can be super hard to swing your gun around a corner. But an UZI or an UMP is perfect for entering buildings with. The game is fun. That's just it. It's a clear and concise form of gameplay. There is no extra t. Just what you know about the map. I do see a lot of complaints about the Microtransactions. It's stupid for the Devs to do that when they promised that they wouldn't but I most likely will not be purchasing a key to anything so I suppose I'm just apathetic about it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-17,1,3,123,False,Not Recommended,"Close range combat is atrocious. Most guns do no damage and are incredibly innacurate. Shotguns? HA! Youre better off yelling insults at your enemy it might be more reliable. Pistols and SMGs are the same way but at least they are somewhat accurate. Mid to long range combat is decent and the game shines when you have a decent firefight. Map selection is a bit dull for a 30 dollar game. Erengel is decent and has a decent amount of diversity. You got you large cities farmlands and hills. Miramar ing BLOWS. Hills and valleys everywhere and the man with the high ground will win. Vehicles are absolutely necessary to staying alive as walking on the road is a guaranteed death. A map selection was in the works in december but I doubt it will actually be a thing anytime soon. Until then the best option is to move or delete the map files from your game installation which will connect you to only Erengel servers. Matchmaking is fast but these chinese players are a problem. They INFEST North American servers with high ping and cheating. You will get shot around the corner and your shots will not hit them. Almost every killcam I watch I see my attacker shoot at where I was 10 in years ago yet he still does damage. Also queuing up with randoms in NA servers pretty much guarantees you will be teamed with a chinese player. How am I going to win the game if there is a very obvious language barrier? Brendan Greene gets his panties in a bunch when people call for a region lock even though these chinese are the biggest problem this game has. Hackers are a huge issue. Hacking runs rampant in this game and according to Brendan Greene the majority of cheats are coming out of China. Thanks to the lack of a region lock these hacking s can take their cheats to NA EU and OC servers. There really isnt any escape they are everywhere. Sometimes its aimbot that killed you or sometimes it is someone running and ESP program. A hacker could be tracking you throughout the game and you might not even really know it. Game runs like complete When into the game for the first time the map will take centuries to load. I will often ""load"" into the spawning area where I can hear footsteps and noises but I am still looking at the blackloading screen. I have decent internet and a good hard drive so I don't know what the issue is. A friend with nearly identical specs loads in fast yet I am always stuck with waiting to load in. Framerate is ing atrocious even on low settings. I have blue screened multiple times when playing this game even with the most up to date drivers and a very capable system. I only blue screen when playing PUBG so I believe the game is causing some sort of issue. General lack of polish. Vehicles feel floaty and the physics are incredibly buggy. There are certain parts of the map with clipping or floating objects and I've even gotten stuck at a part in the mexico map. This is a game that sold millions of copies in early access and continues to sell as a normal game. There should not be this lack of polish. It is unfortunate to give this game a thumbs down. There really is a good game here buried under all the chinese players. Fun in this game can poke through occasionally but getting to that point can sometimes be a night of rolling the dice and hoping for the best. Perhaps the best way to play this game is to do so sparingly maybe logging on once every few days. Also",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-23,0,0,294,True,Not Recommended,"This game is very poorly optimized (See Same engine fortnite i get 350 frames fortnite in action and between 70 140 PUBG and thats all ultra in fortnite and medium high in pubg)This game like most FPS's suffers from cheating. Its pretty rampant as well. A decent killcam would help with deciding to report or not.The actual coding of the game is garbage and if you think 64 tick in cs is what makes the game welcome to half that or less in pubg servers... They should rename to Looting Simulator 2017.There is no skill to the spray patterns you literally pull straight down and its a laser.The most game breaking part for me is that even when you chicken dinner it doesn't feel good. It just feels like a loss...""well on to the next round""...as well as knowing its entirely RNG as to why you won (loot circles random better positioning due to circles)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-17,0,0,31,False,Not Recommended,This game has been out for more than a year now and it still runs like crap. People cheating garbage shooting gameplay. Horrible weapons that feel horrible still with attachments in them. The cars are trash. The game is not optimize at all you can have a expensive rig and the game doesnt care. The game is still a clunky mess and is not polish like Fortnite and probably COD Blackout will have better gunplay than this. Buy at your own risk and if you dont like those first 45 minutes refund it i cant go back now but i rather play fortnite than this tbh. Maybe when this game hit update 2.0 i will be back but thats a long shot. off to fortnite,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-20,0,0,383,True,Not Recommended,The game has far too unpredictable of a damage system. It may seem to take you 3 shots to kill someone with a sniper yet they can 1 hit you with a ump. The system is far too clunky and Im not even a competitive player. Also when you first get the game yeah its kinda fun however after a good amount of matches it becomes the most enraging experience ever. Too many tryhards play this and will beat you in every firefight. Loot crates cost money..... why does EA get so much about this and not Bluehole? The optimization is awful I have a decent PC that runs most games very well however I play this only to see that I cant enter buildings because they haven't loaded. ALSO if you have a mid to low end pc do not buy as you cannot handle firefights. If an enemy shoots you there is no time to react as the game WILL stutter and freeze because of the weapon sounds playing. Honestly there are so many better games don't waste your money on this one.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The lag is also immense in the first few minutes which means you will end up dead in a busy start.Ive had moments when I feel I had been screwed over with a horses Most of these moments consist of problems with hitboxes such as Shots are not registering Oddly formed hitboxes ( persons is wearing a helmet of a level 1/2 which has an open face part yet the helmet covers his whole head including his neck)I have a few other reasons aswell but that will do for now mainly because im too exhausted and mad..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-30,0,0,185,True,Not Recommended,To start i would like to say that the game has a good concept however there are so many small issues that it just ruins the game. Optimization is key the graphis in the game are by no means good yet it takes significant effort for my computer to render buildings as i land on the island (At times getting myself killed because i cannot go inside to loot.)

2017-08-30,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,I knew I wasn't gonna like this game a whole lot when I purchased it but of these looting based arena's that I've played this is the one I like the least. I found The Culling to be a much more entertaining game.The combat is very centered around guns and even more specifically sniping each other. Melee weapons shotguns etc are *almost* completely useless after the first 10 minutes of a match. The fights are very CoD/BF/CS like where 1 3 bullets and you die I've never liked these types of shooters. Then the map in PUBG is so ridiculously large it is the biggest running simulator I've ever played. The field's center is random. It could be on the very edge of the map even and the death field will close in an ellipses. If you enter the match on the opposite side the field's center which you have no idea where it is when you choose a spawn location and you can't find a vehicle you could spend the entire time fleeing the death wall.Most matches of PUBG either have you drop into a populated area where you rush to find the best weapon you can and have a fun fire fight utilizing different weapons of the game to keep surviving or no one shows up at your site so you spend the next 10 15 minutes looting and running to center or looking for other players to kill. Eventually you may find another player or group where you may gun them down from 200 yards away or you will just get sniped yourself wasting all the time you spent getting gear that never really mattered anyway.I'll most likely keep playing this game with friends only. I'm told I could earn my $30 back if I sell the crates in game but after 14.4 hours I've made $1.80 back. Meaning I may have to put 240 hours into this game to do so.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The gameplay is very slow and farming heavy. U die mostly without knowing from where which makes previous farming useless. Basicly u farm and camp for 10 minutes kill up to 2 people if u are very good and partly lucky cause of lags and than u most likly die or luckly win by camping out the action. Vehicles feel very unstable and wannabe real.

Everything is so damn censored now a days to the point where you can't have any fun since someone will claim to feel offened and emotionally scarred. Gameplay wise its a shame that low graphics settings give such a huge advantage. The looting system lags and I feel that the hitboxes are a bit off. Oh I know why. ChInEsE pLaYeRs. Please region lock them. They account for 99% of the cheating in this games as stated by the man who created it and cause the lag in the game. Id rate the game a 6/10.

2017-08-27,3,3,346,True,Not Recommended,Seriously this game is terrible i have put 200+ hours into this game and i honestly dont why because it is terrible. The starting lag means that you cannot pick up weapons and are just having to wait a minute before you can move around properly. The close quarters combat is the worst ive ever seen it always comes down to who has the worst connection you will get angry as you die over and over again to people teleporting all over the place. If you are in EU forget enjoying yourself and having fun everyone who plays it is a sweat and is just boring to play. To do well in this game you must be concentrating the whole time and if you have a lapse in concentration you will die by some stupid means. Furthermore it seems to me that as they add more content the game gets worse and deteriorates. The game is nothing more than a fad and as soon as another battle royale comes out that is stable and doesnt have such shocking connection issues this game will go out of style.

2018-01-04,1,3,223,False,Not Recommended,"Game is OKThis type of Arena Last Man Standing Thing always works for me.Got killed by hackers the last 3 Matches deathcam is proving it. Huge problem in the game!Edit As most hackers join EU servers from China a region lock would be much appreciated but isn't brought into the game by the developing team. Edit 2 New Reasons New 1. My favourite dying procedure is having my game crashed while my team is expecting a fight and my charakter keeps running towards the enemyNew 2. After the Anti Cheat Enhancement Update we couldn't connect to the game servers. At least we didn't join a game with a hackerAs this game has kind of an e sport potential there are some things that I'd warn new players about 1. The round outcome is kind of luck based because of the huge advantage the loot quality provides. Now don't get me wrong. Variance in loot is important but because it's kind of randomized you can be the best player and loose the round to some noob. My recommendation ( brendangreene PUBGCorporation) would be some balancing. Let me set an example From 1 to 3 (in armour levels) the ""tankyness"" gets higher (as it is right now) but also from 1 to 3 (in armour levels again) you get more stiff /inflexible and slower. You'd need to go with what u got use (or be forced to use) different playstiles depending on your armour level. 2. The game is buggy as hell.It is seriously not great.3. The vehicle handling is literal aids. 4. The weapon handling is . Let me explain it the best i can I originally played battlegrounds in Arma 3. Arma 3 has excellent ""clean"" weapon handling. Things that are wrong with pupg 4.1 Bullet drop is badly portrayed4.2 Bullet travel time is badly portrayed4.3 Weapon recoil is badly portrayed. Example The AKM the time it takes to get from normal (before a shot) to normal (after a shot) is too long. Your charakter will basically balance the recoil out too slow slowmo alike",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I gave this game a chance and it did nothing but make me despise Bluehole and Playerunknown. This game is becoming more and more irrelevant as other titles like COD are taking their idea and making it better. PUBG will never progress. It's entire lifespan is proof.

2018-06-06,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,Hahaha. This game is a ing joke.TL DR The devs are a joke. They are suing another company instead of fixing their ing game that should have been fixed prior to leaving Early Access. So I've played a moderate amount. And I've tried my best to support this game but the game is messed up.So many games are broken nowadays but PUBG took it one step further. They released crates/micro transactions DURING EARLY ACCESS. I disagreed with this move but ey so what. It didn't affect the playability of the game.But then...They released out of early access with a game that ran just about as good as a dog without legs. Seriously PUBG Cooporation? You released an unfinished Early Access game with two maps and a ton of game breaking bugs?But so what? I continued playing and trying to enjoy the game as much as I could. But week after week and the game made no progress.How on earth could a company that has made millions of sales for a game as expensive as PUBG possible not have the budget to hire more devs to get this game done faster? 2 man indie studios release updates faster!!! Well they're also making a new game and Bluehole are no longer the main devs for PUBG. Great less dedication.But then recently still few updates but a new map is coming! Yay! Erm the test servers and experimental servers still have the same bugs in them that the main game does.Then one lovely day I wake up to a BBC article about how the PUBG Developers are trying to sue Epic Games for making another battle royale? Don't get me wrong I dislike Fortnite as it just isn't my type of game but damn they're trying to sue them just because they are making a better game?Holy though. If you actually read the court case it is pathetic. They claim that a ing frying pan is iconic to PUBG. then. My mum can't cook food anymore and will have to stick to pots from now on instead. She might get ing sued.But yeah I keep trying to tell myself PUBG will get better but it simply hasn't. The game was most likely developed solely on the Unreal Blueprint system which would explain why it ran so poorly during early access.I'll probably keep playing it because I must be some sort of masochist or something. I just cannot honestly recommend that people buy this game as it isn't worth it and it should never have left Steam Early Access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-30,0,0,314,False,Not Recommended,Gave up after 300 hours. I don't feel any improvements in terms of game mechanics nor performance. Performancei7 7800k + GTX 1080 Ti + 32 Gb DDR4 + Samsung SSD 500 Gb is only good to play on lowest settings. GraphicsThis hurts my eyes. Devs added sharpness setting but still it's quite hard to distinguish enemy from the bushes. My eyes hurt pretty bad after 30 minutes of playing. Although I have no such spotting issues in other shooters.GunfightRecoil.... Just if to compare it with any BF/COD I can easily control recoil of any gun. A gun I have just shots in the direction I pointing to. Good aim good k/d. PUBG just ruins this experience. It feels like your character is not a military guy but a weak junkie with shaking hands.Bugs... Misaligments is a funny thing this just doesn't shoot in the direction you're pointing to because devs are too lazy to test and it gets explored by streamers like WackyJacky.Broken scopes.. Any scope is physically living separate live with image it's showing that is jumping and blacking out the view during shooting... Very convinient... If it's some kind of realism addition then the implementation of it is SoundSound is garbage looks like the game is capable of playing 3 audio files at time that's it. Cars are loud as for no reason just to make hearing issues for players.Server performanceGetting shot behing the cover sync failuers lagging characters lack of proper shot detection.Game mechanicsSuper slow healing/boosting/vaulting/movements/animation of player actions.Way too long waiting time at the beginning. Devs really should have a close look at COD battle royale beta. Amount of time between player's death and new session actual gameplay beginning should be minimal.Instead of adding well known deathmatch/team deathmatch mode with usual respawn (without skydiving) to game to let people practice gunfight they added usless test island where messing around with dummy targets is far far away from reality what you get when fighting with other players.UIUI just broken restart button fixes main menu after few retries but why I have to even do this?In game menu that handles items and other stuff is hard to use fast it's just inconvinient in general.and of course tons of bugs and cheaters...It'd be great game if devs'd do improvements fast enough.

Ignore all the players who give it bad reviews who have less than 5 hours...or even 10 hours of gameplay. Its a great game to play solo but its an even better game to play with friends. Now one thing that bothers me are the negative reviews that focus on the ""invasion of chinese players"" on the NA or OC servers. True it is annoying but you shouldnt give a game a negative review based off of players choices. Now you could say ""well I gave thema negative review because they are ignoring us on giving china the region lock"" but thenwhat about the other player base? Should we get a region lock?

2017-09-28,1,11,185,True,Not Recommended,After 180 hours Many kills Many deaths and many many chicken dinners. I can honestly say that this game is This game is not based on skill. Like many multiplayer games in this day and age everything that happens in this game is based on luck. You pick a town if you get lucky you get a decent weapon if you dont you are screwed. Some towns have nothing but shotguns which are worthless for the majority of the game. Then you get the pleasure of trying to make it inside what everyone calls the circle. You may have landed dead smack in the middle or all the way across the map from it. Theres no rhyme or reason to the circle. Its all random. You have to have your head on a swivel if you are going to survive past the first couple circles because people can be hiding behind literally every tree. The second you stop you will get sniped by someone 800 meters away that you cant even see. Or you could get run up on by someone who has been following you for 20 minutes playing it safe. This again is all based on luck. If you are lucky enough to make it to the top 10 you are then going to be forced to either run directly towards your enemy or have your enemyt run towards you with no cover. Basically if the circle chose you congrats you are the chosen one you win. You get to watch the last couple people run directly towards you trying to outrun the blue death that lies at their back. So will you like this game would you be good at this game? The only question you need to answer is can you point and click? if so eventually you will get a win. But more often than not the game will you like its prom night. No amount of skill will guarentee you a win in this game. Ive got a bunch of wins but the truth is they mean nothing. They were all because of luck.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-08,3,45,283,True,Recommended,"There are a lot of reviews giving this game quite a few of negatives and honestly a couple are deserved. There is a major problem with hackers and cheaters ruining games and the loot boxes aren't that fruitful usually. Prior to the vaulting update mobility can be challenged by a simple fence reaching up to your knees.With those out of the way I can honestly say this game is 100% a fantastic choice for anyone looking for great team based game play that has a focus not just on run and gun quake style killing but really making tactical choices. That is the key that separates this game so distinctly from other Battle Royal style games like FN. More on FN later. The weapon attachments vehicle choices movement (crawl for safety rush to the zone or loot more and risk taking damage?) and distinct style of each gun really lets you set up for certain styles of game play. I'm the mid low range guy in our group that prefers shorter range combat like shotguns for instance. The que in this game is nonexistent. It's amazing how fast you'll get pulled into a game full team or solo. It almost trivializes death ""Oh I got so far only to get plucked by a lucky shot. Ah well."" *instant reque*. It goes a lot to reduce frustration when you can just jump from one game to another while at the same time keeping the game intense when scrapping for gear or getting to that final circle. As far as Fortnite goes I hear the two games compared quite a bit and every time always have to bring up the fact that game modes do not mean game styles. FN completely lacks the tactical edge and accuracy of PUBG your guns don't have nearly the level of customization you have to deal with quality of loot and your accuracy with most guns is fairly poor. Use of cover is discouraged in a lot of places because most all cover is destructible . You can build cover and walkways and such in that game adding a very interesting aspect that PUBG lacks but doesn't do much to change how the game is played in a much more run and gun fashion. Overall I would suggest this game to people who are looking for quick intense games that don't require a permanent investment. You won't find any levels bonuses or any gimmicks like that here. Team play gives so much more of a fun experience as well.Hope this review helped!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-01,0,0,14,False,Recommended,I am saying I recommend this game becuase there is no 50/50 option PUBG is a fun Battle Royale game that can prove quite the challenge to new comers in the shooting genre!I do have fun playing the game the challenge of going against 100 odd other players each match to see who canemerge victorious is quite enticing and the major variety of weapons offered in the game is quite the treat.This is most definitely not a game for the casual player!Pros Good variety of guns Big challenge and test of skill Very fun to play with friends Strategy is a fun aspect of this gameCons Not very optimized People who are coming from Fortnite to play this game need to have a clear head I think. The games to have massive similarities but they also have massive differences too. The shooting mechanic and gameplay is different The buildingmechanic adds a whole new layer to Fortnite strategy wise but the military aspect PUBG brings a different feel. Fortnite definitely is a lot easier than PUBG but does not make it a lesser game. I suggest if you are going to play this game for the first time see if one of your friends have it and team up with them.The steep learning curve of the game can prove difficult for newcomers and can put people off the game easily. Teamworkis also one of the best parts of this game.The game is very awkward to run and I sometimes have issues with it with my GTX 1080 Ryzen 7 1700 and 16GB DDR4 3000MHZ RAM. It can be off putting but you do sometimes get a good night in where it doesnt bother you.This game is very enjoyable for the hardened player if you like strategy or multiplayer games its a must!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-29,0,0,234,True,Recommended,"Amazing game! When I first got this (During the Steam Summer Sale) I did not play all too much but after coming back to it I've gotten better at the game and got some friends who I can play it with. The game is purely fun if you enjoy intense moments and down right hilarious glitches/moments which happen throughout the time you play the game in the Early Access stage.Only problem I've found was that a few of my friends who have older builds (GTX760 and a 960M) have trouble loading in quickly but if they are in the server but haven't loaded in then they will load in by the time they hit the ground usually.Edit (10/25) After looking over the current reviews I will add this section of the review to state some more stuff 1. Hackers The hackers in this game are horrible. (They can shoot through walls go fast like sonic shoot you in the head from 4+ kilometres away etc.) They seem to not be being dealt with but the real thing is they are but they are able to continue buying the game. (Like in CS GO the hackers do get banned but buy alternate accounts allowing them to hack more and more. Which by the way is not making Valve want to improve VAC so that the games they make are ""unhackable"".)2. Input Lag The input lag as far as my experience with it is relatively frustrating. The input lag seems to be in the beginning of each game (Warm Up and about ten seconds after hitting the ground.)*Note My internet is 80Mbps download and 10Mbps upload3. Cosmetics They're only purchasable on the COMMUNITY market. The community has items up from other players of the game who achieved the items from playing the game and achieving BP (Battle Points). If you don't like paying for cosmetics then play for them. The only things you can't play for are the outfit sets the twitch prime things and the older items which were taken out of the BP crates.4. Performance Even with my specs (listed in the note below) is either a constant 80fps or less only 100fps+ during menu. The performance needs work but this is still Early Access. If you want to play something that'll give you a constant 240fps+ go play CS GO or wait for further optimization.*Note GPU GTX1060 6GBCPU i5 6400 2.70GHzRAM 8GB DDR4 (I think)5. Servers Need help. More servers which can actually support the 100 players better are needed. Probably more in the non NA servers since I haven't had many problems yet unless the Input lag is that bad.6. Bans The bans are kinda stupid if I base this off of the reviews of others but I've yet to see anyone I know (who has teamkilled even intentionally) been banned. Teamkill bans are from REPORTS posted by players. Not Bluehole watching everything and saying ""Oh let's ban him because he shot this guy.""After this I hope many misconceptions have been cleared. This game is EARLY ACCESS meaning it may not be as good as a game like CS GO. (Even though Valve isn't doing much with it) The game is fun but tends to not be if you cannot quite understand it. The learning curve took me two months of not playing but afterward the game becomes either very fun or very competitive. Thank you for reading my long review have a good day.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Devs need to work on optimization bugs and stuff like that not on extra maps and that kind of stuff (for now) if they want a game to be better.Their system requirements are fairly low but the game still runs like crap for almost everyone.The game is buggy and unoptimized would crash a lot greedily use up any ram it can find and refuse to free it up after closing forcing me to restart my pc each time. what's more the servers are just garbage. and I honestly just don't get this game. The shooting doesn't feel particularly good and it doesn't feel like a real shooter. Hiding is not a fun activity. Inventory management is not a fun activity. You spend a huge amount of time doing nothing leading up to a 2 second encounter where you don't get any kind of feedback about why you won or lost the encounter and it's just over one way or the other.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-31,0,0,209,True,Recommended,Hello today I am going to make a review on one of the best games on steam right now. Also I will be defending it from the backlash of the recent dicisions the devs have made. First PUBG gives you lots of emotions. Sometimes you will feel sad andry or joyful. But that is what makes this game so great. The rush you feel when you land that epic headshot or your in a mad max style car chace these moments with your friends can't just happen in most games. Secondly there is no reason for the community to be in the torm that it is in right now because of the announced micro transactions. Micto transactions are completely fine if they stay COSMETIC AND COSMETIC ONLY. If it stays cosmetic which is the plan then no player will have a certain advantage over the other. Finally about the devs banning that stream sniper the devs have special tools that help them find out if the person is sniping or not. Coming from a guy that has tried countless related titles you will not be disapointed in buying PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-23,1,4,3,True,Not Recommended,Overrated in early release.This game has an awesome concept and it is fun don't get me wrong. However in its current state I can't recommend it. It's buggy laggy and flat out annoying most of the time when you're playing it.When it's functional it's great Yet with bugs like it failing to load the game when you're qued You will be in the game hear the sound hear yourself enter the plane forced out without the option to hit the parachute cause the game hasn't even been able to load yet...then you die because you couldn't open your parachute cause the game wouldn't load on time.Or after you've landed and you're standing in front of a house waiting for it to load so you can go inside and try and find some guns. After 2 3 minutes its still not loaded so you're forced to move on without a means to defend yourself.I've even had laggy experiences where say you'll get hit then the game stutters and and before youre able to even respond from it lagging you're dead.I'm also on a 150 megabit connection so I know my internet isn't the problem.I'm sure with some polish this game could be a lot better but for me personally I thought it was vastly overrated and wish I didn't buy it in early release,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,914,True,Not Recommended,As of now the game is pretty much unoptimized requiring a higher clocked processor. Core count and GPU don't seem to matter much as I get about the same experience on a GTX950 and a GTX1080 ti.Crashes disconnections being unable to connect party issues launching issues server availability issues. Voice chat working or not randomly.Gameplay glitches here and there. Bad vehicle physics. Bad movement physics.And microtransactions on a early access paid game. That's just shameless. Awful. Incredible.Wait for retail then buy. December 2017 edit They fixed the voice chat issues. I was feeling lots of new stuff and fixed stuff had been incorporated to the game but re reading my old review everything I said before still stands.The game on the so called 'Test Server' now performs at a higher FPS. Anywhere from 90fps to 144fps. It feels smoother too. But at what cost?Well the game just doesn't render stuff until it's on your nose Houses 40 meters away might render with windows or doors closed even if there's somebody shooting at your face from there. Signs boxes etc might just not render so you can see your enemy just lazily standing there on the roof and no matter how hard you try and keep shooting at their head your bullets impact against invisible stuff.Trees keep changing their LOD models every meter you get closer to them going from a 2D sprite to a couple of them to a basic 3d model with some 2d sprites to finally several 3d models of varying complexity.. All that in 3 secs of walking towards any given tree.It looks completely ridiculous. Most building also keep changing texture quality depending if you're 2 meters away 5 6 and a half 8 etc. No need for 37 different LODs please!They've been experimenting with lag compensation and seem to have decided that the player with the lower ping has the truth. So if you have higher ping than your enemy it doesn't matter if you got under cover on your pc if they see that you're still running and shoot you in the head you're dead.If you're ambushing them and the instant you see them you discharge your shotgun in their head you're dead because on their screen they've probably gotten to you and shot you in their face so your shot with 200ms more lag than theirs will not ever register. Oh and also they're adding some lazy attempt at not rendering other players unless the server registers they're on your line of sight.Add the lag compensation and invisible objects issues and you have a complete hot mess of a game where enemies are completely invisible shoot you from nowhere and suddenly pop up or disappear.ESports ready and 1.0 releasing tomorrow.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My FPS are on 60FPS dipping down to 40 again and again. For me thats allright. But not everyone has such a good GPU.If you want a Game that works well dont buy this game YET.

Hopefully you can get a vehicle! I die more times because of the blue line than from other players. I get the reason for this game mechanic but it's way out of balance.

2017-08-01,0,0,227,True,Recommended,For all the hate over the microtransactions off.PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds or PUBG for short is a battle royale online multiplayer game that stretches h1's formula to make it more appealing to new casual and expert audiences. At its core it depends on what mode you play on. There are solos (1 person) duos (2 people) and squads (3 4 people) to allow you to play with friends to get that coveted 'chicken dinner'. Even though there are complaints about the game being too RNG reliant its an amazing move. For instance its an indicator whether you will have a strong start or not it makes you play differently to outlast others (based on what loot you and they have). This aspect keeps the game refreshing and enjoyable and to create memorable moments. If there were definite spawns for guns and other things it would be a constant fight over who gets the spot. This makes up the fact that the map isn't randomized each game but it allows players to create tactics and strategies for different areas. (Other maps are confirmed for the game but no date was specified for release).There has been controversey over the microtransactions that will be implemented or have been (depends on when you see this). People are getting for no reason whatsoever when other games like cs go and dota 2 have similar systems and those items can be really ing expensive. The microtransactions are for the players to show more support for the game and to fund the prize pools for tournaments. This game is one of the top on twitch (at the time of me writing this) for a reason poeple really love watching it. So whats the difference for the pros in a more competitve viewing?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

People getting killed with ""Punch"" while parachuting 1 hit kills seemingly out of nowhere. The Ghost mode hacks are the worst.This would be easy to combat and would work itself out naturally as other online games do if the players steam profile name carried into the game. However the game makes you create a new profile with a new name and DOES NOT REPORT STEAM PROFILES TO THE STEAM SERVERS. Look in the ""Recent Players"" section to see for yourself.This allows cheaters to wreak havoc with impunity as the average player will only encounter them in passing. The official forums have a ""report system"" but you basically just open a customer support ticket and have to provide video media. So basically unless you're recording every second of your gameplay you have no way to report other players.The developers have actually openly condoned cheating in their game. They allow shader injectors and ""reshade etc"" that can be used to remove folaige completely remove any sort of cover making the stealth aspect of the game completely null. This is allowed and has been said as much by the developers themselves. So get Reshade and go nuts.

2017-08-03,0,0,224,True,Recommended,So the game is freaking phenomenal like the recipe they got going on here is f*cking GOLD. It's basically a straight to the point dayz standalone but you can go solo duo or squad of 4. It's highly addicting and fun even though myself and my friends aren't even really trying to get first place although i have gotten first place in solo duo and squad many times. Once you get past that point and you start to enjoy the game for what it realy is. PUBG is phenomenal because every time you jump out that plane..... PUBG is going to be a different experience everytime! One time i knocked out a squad of three guys in a house with just my fists i died two minutes later but i'll never forget it.So all these pansies talking about micro transactions hmmm ok well i don't think i will be buying any of those chests or keys or whatever since i don't care about cosmetics too much on this game. So many thumbs down because of that? if you were worried so much maybe you should get a job and pay for those transactions you can't afford? obviously it bothers you that much but no need for the thumbs down because of it. That is like me rating a product 1 star because the product came damaged because of shipping or whatever. Doesn't seem logical does it? All in all i take a break from arma 3 or league and play some pubg its quick and it's fun. Content i think comes out every month which is pretty decent.

2017-08-24,0,0,262,True,Recommended,Any complaints people have about the game are almost purely external to the game itself. Some community drama with streamers bans and microtransactions. But this is almost entirely unrelated to the gameplay.The premise is a simple Battle Royal 1v99 (Duo/Squads too) deathmatch where you need to scavenge for supplies and weapons while trying to stay alive. You'll die a lot get frustrated get unlucky but what sets this apart is that you'll never waste your time. Everything from the scavenging to the stealth to the combat is gleefully satisfying. And when you die you can immediately queue up in to a new match one in which you'll wait &lt 10 seconds to join.If you like tactical shooters like ARMA and survival games like DAYZ this game has the best of both (Both in gameplay and the fact that the developers of each game are closely related). But the extremely fast turnaround makes games more agressive and exciting. The game is incredibly well made surprisingly well designed and has me coming back for more every day. I've never seen such a stable multiplayer game at such a large scale before. I can count on one hand the number of games that have been ruined by latency or server issues which is an incredibly low figure for a purely online multiplayer shooter.Anyway I'm not great at writing reviews but know that I'm a huge fan of the game. They're incredibly responsive to the community and keep pushing great updates to the game as it progresses out of early access. Definitely a company and game people should be supporting.(Also if you check all these negative reviews still have hundreds of hours. Nobody actually cares about microtransactions they just like to complain. The game is good.),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In both rounds I was pointlessly walking around searching for stuff and looking for other people. Yes I dropped at abandoned and uninteresting spots. The map is so big it's difficult to even find somebody. So the game has a trick to this it constantly shrinks down the play area. If you go outside you die. So the map becomes smaller and smaller. There is no plausible/realistic reason for this to happen (no fire no tornado...) other than it being a simple game mechanic to make a round end by force.The performance is horrible and as it turns out pretty much nobody plays on Ultra settings since they are unplayable (and NOT looking good at the same time). I'm running an overclocked 1080ti and a Threadripper 1950X but still...I tried High Ultra...framerate was toilet.You need A LOT of time sometimes a lot of luck or at least a lot of knowledge where to find the good stuff.

2017-08-11,0,0,928,True,Not Recommended,As you can see I have quite a bit of time invested in this game so it's obvious I enjoy the game even with the game breaking issues. I'm patient and (old) can get past them fairly easily with a flick of my computer's on/off button. The initial idea of the game is good last person / team standing wins Battle Royale in it's latest form. The recent addition to the First Person Perspective (FPP) is smart and welcomed by many. However the game crashes and the moral compass of Bluehole is flawed and has forced me to give this a negative review.* The paid crate system (admittedly my biggest issue) is an awful idea in this game and going back on your word (see lead designers comments at the release of the Early Access (EA) about not introducing a micro transaction system prior to full release) must be held accountable. * Is the game fun? At times it can be a lot of fun but there are still serious flaws that need to get ironed out. I've played many a game in solo duo's and squads where the server completely locks up and everyone has to either exit the game completely or wait for a memory dump error that will eventually kick you back to the main screen. To be fair on this point it's Early Access so these issues are to be expected. Patience is key here... )* There is still the issue of lag (both video and network) that are client related happening. There have been updates that have made this better over the past two months so that's good news.I refuse to recommend a game from any company that continues to try and make money with microtransactions in Early Access. It's morally wrong and we as a community need to stand up to these companies and tell them 'NO'!My recommendation for now is to save your money wait to see the direction Bluehole takes and that all of their game breaking issues are rectified upon full release. The game certainly has promise hopefully their greed doesn't get the better of them (i.e. DayZ &amp Ark).Best regards....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-23,1,4,176,True,Not Recommended,"What a disappointment.Downloaded the game hyped as can be me being a huge fan of battle royale games. I was very quickly disappointed.There was no support whatsoever for my 21 9 resolution monitor. The previous fix that people were using was now purposely removed by the developers. Now anyone with an ultrawide monitor is forced to play with extremely zoomed in nausiating and unplayable fov. The field of view is also cut off on the top and bottom. This is just completely unacceptable if they can't develop another fix then don't completely remove the current fix. You're screwing over a portion of your community because you are too lazy to make a better fix to replace the old one with some considered op.Well let me tell you this how come ultrawide monitors are a pay to win advantage that shouldn't be allowed? Then shouldn't we restrict the game to 480p with 30fps and very low settings? Because otherwise an advantage would be given to people with faster computers! That would be awful now wouldn't it! You might be thinking ""Why don't you just suck it up and play it with black bars on the side until they make a better fix?""Yeah that would be pretty neat if it were possible. Instead the game just stretches itself out with the whole thing being completely distorted making it horrendous to look at.The developers are currently sending the message to their community that they are fully willing to screw a decent amount of them if it means less work. Stop being lazy and fix your game. Until then I have refunded the game and won't buy it until a fix comes. For all of you who are on the fence don't buy this game. If this can happen to the ultrawide community it can happen to anyone else. Don't risk wasting your money because the developers want to save their time.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is missing quality it's built good and graphics are good but there needs to be more variety. More custom games and also make it more accessible to the average gamer not just ""famous streamers"" nobody likes them and let's be honest they don't pay your wages to develop games. It's the general public. Make the servers good nothing worse than a decent game that lags constantly. Make the guns more realistic.... If a pistol and assault rifle battle the assault rifle will always win being able to cause more damage.... Restrict shotguns. Make healing harder and also punish people that stay outside the zone. Punish people that camp. If they stop moving for more that 30 seconds make it so they make to more. Even make it so people can view where they are. Camping isn't good for this game. Listen to average gamers for ideas and possible new features. Also this isn't E Sports ready it never will be so stop dreaming. Make rounds different.... Different modes eg smaller zones faster zones restrict parachute flight and movement keeps people closer together. Also rank/skill matching. When matchmaking only add people with the same skill base together. So new people have a chance to win or get to know the game. Also this means the ""pro"" players can only play against other wanna be pro players. Make the maps more fun and where you can change certain things in the map that can effect how the game will play out. Loads of ideas but none of you lot read these or would ever take note.

BP is used to buy yourself new loot crates for items to customze your character starting at 700 for the first 1400 for the second 2800 for the 3rd... so on and so forth.

This ""game"" was rushed out of Early Access in a shameless attempt to coeerce mummy and daddy into buying it for their future toxic online gamer. It is very VERY obvious that PC players were used purely as a testing ground for the Console market so Bluehole could get down to doing exactly what they were planning all along pandering to the PS4/Xbox One market so they could sell copies of the game for 79.99/99.99 instead of the 'measely' 29.99 they are tearing out of your wallet for this half baked half finished dog The developers have once again gone for the business model of jamming crappy content nobody asked for down your throat instead of fixing the content they already had.

I've played this game since the first time you could buy it and I still really enjoy playing it casually or just hardcore sometimes. It's awesome playing with friends and even though solo play feels a bit lonely it's still incredibly competetive and fun.PRO'S 60+FPS is the most wonderfull feeling when playing this game wich can now be done even with a GTX 970. Bullet drops is f*ck*ng awesome and feels really realistic. You can honk in your car buggy truck or motorcycle this is a serious +. Vaulting over objects make for fast and smooth gameplay. It's cheap compared to the amount of fun I am getting out of it (30 euros!). The reward system is really awesome and there is NO pay to win aspect. You can actually earn some serious cash playing this game and selling the items you win in game (I've made 114 euros so far). Buy this game!

This made the experience far more enjoyable and I'm now loving the game a lot more than I thought I would.Gameplay wise this is quite similar to Fortnite 100 players in one huge map all compete to be the last man or woman standing. The concepts are quite similar except in PUBG it's more grounded to reality and you can't build massive forts and crazy stuff like that. You can chose to go it alone in Solo or witha buddy in Duos and with a Squad of four if you want this allows for some really fun games when playing in a squad with friends. The game may take some practise to get good at as it took me about 2 hours to get my first kill in the game but boy when you do get that kill it really does feel satisfying. So far I have not played with any hackers and I really hope it stays this way as I've had a blast with the game.Graphics are nice and while a lot of people may experience huge FPS drops I don't seem to get any when I play. The visual quality of the game looks really realistic and stunning even the inside of the buildings look so real. It gives you a real sense of immersion in the game. One major problem is that the graphics take about 10 seconds or so to render once I enter a building so it can't be quite fustrating when trying to hide from enemies. If you're getting bad FPS drops I suggest playing on low yes it may look hideous but at least you should be able to get 50+ fps on this.In conclusion I really do recommend PUBG only when it's on sale as paying full price is risky if the game doesn't preform well. My advice is if you want to buy this do lots of research and watch Youtube benchmarks of the game on your system to see how it runs as one person may get really good FPS while another may get terrible FPS. Don't immediatly get this game without doing some research first as you may almost end up refunding it (like I almost did). This game has a lot of great things however it still has a lot of problems that need addressing like server issues bugs etc and I believe in due time the developers will pull their together and dedicate time to polishing the game rather than attempting to sue Fortnite.Overall rating 7.5/10 Good.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-26,0,0,135,True,Recommended,I've never felt so stressed out/entertained while doing very little in a game. As a developer myself PUBG scares the out of me because they completely abandon world building character design narrative and other whole realms of design.That said I'm completely obsessed.10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-03,0,0,222,True,Not Recommended,"People are acting like this game is the pinnacle of perfection. It maybe the best of its type but there aren't very many battle royale games to begin with so that isn't a good point. Being bad but the best of something doesn't mean it is good. It just means it is the best choice out of a small pool of bad choices. The game does have the potential to be a lot of fun if the developers stop making questionable decisions in regards to both game additions and keeping promises.People are more upset by the fact that the developers lied than the fact that the crates exist as they were always going to be a thing when the game actually launched out of early access. They are very inconsistent about exactly how much is going to charity and the tournament fund. Regardless of them having more than enough to fund both themselves.Only a portion of the profits from the crates are going to charity and the tournament if you bother to read the text. They don't say how big that portion is and every sale of an item or crate on the Steam Market gives them even more money.From the in game text when you choose to open a crate ""Partial proceeds of key sales go to charities and Gamescom prize pool.""The announcement made it sound like 100% of the profits were going to those and many of the people defending their actions still seem to think so. People seem to not understand it's not the existence of micro transactions but that they outright lied to everyone.I don't even understand how they are going to have a serious tournament when the game has random loot drops plane trajectory vehicle spawns plane crate drops circle location etc. Competitive games need to have more consistency between teams to be taken seriously. The game also suffers from server lag and various other issues. Hosting a tournament for an early access game with RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG is baffling.People need to stop defending shady business practices just because they like the game. I am glad you like it but that doesn't change the facts. With the amount of money they are making off this game they need to invest in more staff so the game can actually be made properly. The game still has a lot of game play issues and it is debatable if they are good enough developers to actually provide the product everyone wants.Accepting the fact that they just outright lie to their customers is a dangerous thing and sends a message to them and other developers that people will just willingly deal with it. People supporting or defending this action in any way are setting a dangerous precedent for the future of what customers will stand for.The industry is terrible about releasing broken games that aren't ready for release day one dlc and season passes no patches after release (NieR Automata Deadly Premonition Dark Souls) tons of unfinished early access games etc. Gaming maybe more popular and accepted in culture than it used to be but it isn't in a good state so people should at least attempt to make a stand against developers that don't keep their word when the game has already made a ton of money and hasn't even released on consoles yet.While I don't think this whole micro transaction controversy should be a complete deal breaker I also don't think it should just be brushed aside and actually defended by some people because they are so blinded by the state of the gaming industry or so enamored with the game. Nearing closer to the actual 1.0 release the game still has many issues it needs to fix.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-08,0,0,63,True,Not Recommended,"Adding microtransactions is a scummy tactic to capitalize on your games popularity. Yes the crate is for tournament funding but it is also important to note that this game is wildly successful. They have no shortage of funds as is. they don't need your money they want it. It is also important to remeber that there is no gurantee that all of the proceeds earned are going towards the pot. They could take a cut for themselves. There is no doubt in my mind that this was just a cash grab done to bank on the games sudden boom.Even with the scumminess of microtransactions as a concept aside there is actually still a bigger elephant in the room. That elephant being the promise that no microtransactions would be in the game. That statement has not only since become a boldface lie but one that the developers have turned on at the drop of a hat. Worst off it's a lie the developers are allowed to get away with. Early access is a cancer that gives devs permission to lie to their consumers. There comes a point where you have to ask yourself ""If they lied about this what else have they said are lies?"" There is no gurantee the game will come out of early access at all. None of Brendan ""playerunknown"" Greene's other projects have made it out of early access.

The moment someone jumps me or anything remotely action packed happens my frames drop under ******* ground and I die. The last update improved the performace slightly but its still utter bull****) It relies way too much on luck if i told you how many times i landed on the roof of the school got a pistol turned around and got shot by some **** who lucked out and picked up an ak or some ****...you would be shocked. A training ground where we can test the guns and improve aim on some bots or something is missing really badly Every match is the ******* same. You jump down if you are lucky enough you get a weapon maybe a kill. Then you run around the map and loot and die for some dumb *** reason (90% shot by someone i cant ******* see beacuse my graphics are so **** i cant see further than like 60m). Its for some reason insanely hard to win a gun fight (note i am very experienced in fps i have 1600h in tf2 and many more in a lot of other fps games im not saying im really good but i for sure am better than what it looks like when i play this shi*ey game) last time i won i killed one person who was camping in the house and then i got lucky with the last circle and three people died out of the safezone trying to get up the cliff and they lost because GUESS WHAT ?? THEY GOT UNLUCKY!! and that win wasnt even satisfying i felt bad for winning that honestly. most of the time i stop playing the game because i rage quit with the reasons listed above. Just a bunch of dumb I want to say you shouldnt buy this game and i will for now maybe if things change big time it will be worth it but for now i suggest stay the **** away....Oh and the pros...well...uhmm...i guess like one out of 60 times its fun because you get lucky (not satisfying tho).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-07,0,0,376,False,Not Recommended,"Full with racist children squeaking i ntheir headsets.I generally have no problem with fun voicechat talk however the community playing this game seems to solely consist of either people never using microphones or those using it in only a negative attitude.The game is an attraction for young people who believe that shouting the N Word all the time makes them edgy and cool. The typical 14 20 year old gamer for you.But today its all about ""Memes"" right?On top the game serves no content really. 2 Maps one mode. One Mode means literally one mode.At least you can play this one mode in several ways meaning alone or up to four players in any combination. Meaning you can also go into a match as a duo but play against squads.Which is nice i have to admit however the rewards you gain with doing so stay the same which is just showing the beginning of bad design execution that consists in any other regard.The Blue circle is a generally bad idea and absolutely Un Battle Royale.The original idea and movie used the sectors on the map as a way to kill the contestants which means that specific announced sectors became deathzones.Here it just looks like they searched for a way to keep the pressure up and tried to get people to meet each other and the best they could come up with was this.I could continue with so many things but i leave the bad design bulletpoint like that for now as its flaws just jump into your face the first time you start to play.The graphics are somewhat ok but the game runs so bad that you would wish they were worse so it ran smooth. Which it doesnt.Dont get tricked by people coming off saying ""Ah but it runs fine for me no lag (spikes) no stuttering no bugs at all.They are either outright lying or they lack the competence to even make such a statement (meaning they just are unable to see its problems or notice them).However there is not only plenty of evidence that the game is technical garbage (netcode is the worst of any online shooter you could pick right now with a tickrate of 17 we already had vastly more when Counter Strike Source was popular thats about 15 years ago).Even if there was not that much evidence the technical issues regarding lag and fps drops are a well known running gag among the community and the games critics.So much in fact that it feels a bit useless to yet brag again about it.The last issue is the game has tons of downtime. Meaning a lot of time where you do nothing or even waste your time without doing anything.Oh yeah you might spend 20 minutes looting stuff ending up having the best equipment possible and fully modified weapons and yet die instantly through a low tier spread weapon in mid range combat. Probably because yet again the game lags or stutters at the moment where someone comes around the corner.Meaning you worked your way to that point with 20 minutes of doing nothing but opening doors and managing that horrific inventory system to then just die and not even using a weapon.Conclusion The games problems are so much in your face that the game is currently i nthe position of being the best example of what to do and what to not do.What to do is investing into good game ideas as people like these new and fresh ideas as proven by the sheer amount of players.What not to do is to fail at delivering and execution. Running worse like Counter Strike Source while also looking worse than it.The game will shrink in size.Others are already in the line to gather its players who are looking for an alternative to escape the hostage situation that is PUBG. You can avoid it currently when you want to play this gamemode (Battle Royale) but as soon as another competent developer manages to execute it better (which is quite a low bar) these people will forget about their Stockholm Syndrome and just switch.And we havent even started talking about the games worst problems like the amount of cheaters being into it.The fact that they are proud of banning a million people doesnt really speak for them.I predict that there are better ways to do this gamemode better ways to technically deliver it better ways to present it and better ways to make it fun and interesting.At the point where a studio does that the games size will again shrink because of named problems.Not only because its an unfun game not only because they deliver no new content not only because of cheaters.But because all of the easily 2 dozen points that i could use to show its bad sides.And i literally can only find one upside.At this point i unlocked enough lootboxes that i didnt open (because i just dont care for the clothes you get through it) to sell them for enough money to get my money back.Sadly refunds dont work after this playtime.I basically now got the game for free. The only plus i can come up with. Ok well the buggy physics are sometimes funny. Crashing into an invisible wall with a car is super fun.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,259,True,Not Recommended,This game is probably the best BR game right now. It's a mix between ARMA and Battlefield. It's a got a lot of great elements however the bad parts overshadow these quite drastically. For example The damage system needs a lot of work. A full shotgun blast to the chest within a few metres whilst wearing level 2 armour won't kill you yet a pistol only needs 3 4 shots to kill you whilst wearing the same armour. Very frustrating. The electricity moves at such a fast pace that you're constantly having to run into the safe zone regardless of if anyone is waiting for you. You've got to be lucky to not run into someone waiting for you. There's no time for flanking or anything tactical so praying is your best option in this regard. There are a lot of lag and random hit registration issues which admittiedly are being patched pretty quickly. If it wasn't for these frustratingly bad things then this would rank above H1Z1 and DayZ. As it is it tries to do both but just not as well yet. Hopefully the damage and electricity is fixed then I'd be up for recommending this to people.Update 19/07/2017 The game is still pretty fun for about 5 minutes despite the dreadful hit registration stupid circles moronic campers and awful bullet sounds it's okay. To expand on my previous points Hit registration I and many others have been hit behind trees and walls due to this. When a bullet should hit it doesn't and when it shouldn't it does. Client side hit reg for you though. Stupid circles The circles are completely random which is fine except for the fact that you can drop somewhere and the circle be over the other side of the map. You can't out run the circles so unless luckily find a car you're ed. Moronic campers People will camp outside of the circle knowing they will die just to kill you. There should be some way to stop this such as not being able to see into the circle or not being able to shoot whilst outside the circle adding another element to strategy. Awful bullet sounds The sounds strive to be realistic but are far from it. It's pretty dumb that they intend this to be realistic yet it's not whatsoever. If you want the game to be realistic then make it realistic but don't make it half way between because it's not working. Have it so that if you're shot whilst aiming you obviously can't aim you can't shoot a gun if you're shot in the arm and can't run if you're shot in the leg. Either all in or all out. As of right now with the amount of cons this game has I wouldn't recommend even if it was free.P.S. At least I've freed up some space on my hard drive.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,tl dr The game is great but feels like it's not finished its mad fun to play and worth the 30 price but only if you can ignore the issues the game has.THE PROS The game is absolutely terrific to play. The gameplay is something that I really really enjoy the overall mechanics the basic idea and the design of the game really appeal to me. The guns handle great in my opinion if you are a casual player like me it's still an easy task to get used to the sistem. The loot system is also great for this type of game I prefer the random loot over knowing what loot is where sure you can get shafted if you loot a whole house and all you have to show for it is a foregrip and a sickle but that for me is part of the fun.As mentioned before I am not a pro player so my hearth starts to race when I get into a top 5 situation but I am starting to get used to it. Playing with friends is also a blast.THE CONS That said I bought this game when it was in beta like most people it was great fun if a bit of a buggy experience but hey it's an early acess game you know what you are getting yourself into. The updates on the test server were regular and you can see that Playerunknown and Bluehole really care and want this game to be the best there is.And this is why I am so confued over why the hell they already released it. It's not a finished experience. I have two computers one with a GTX 950 and one with a GTX 970. Now the final version of the game is optimised performance wise but looks horrible. Even on the very lowest settings at 1080p it requires just shy of 2GB of video memory. This means that no matter how strong of a card you might have if you have 2GB of video memory you will not be able to set the settings higher than the absolute lowest. And if you do it seems like the game blocks the texture settings and everything looks like its made out of Play Doh. On the 970 it's a bit better the graphics look okay but get beaten by really old games like Battlefield 3 at least in my opinion.That's if you care about graphics which I really don't so lets get to the core problem Bugs and rubber banding. The bugs are mainly present on the title screen it's difficult to get into and leave a game sometimes. But when you do oh man does the early game experience blow. The rubber banding is extreme and it persists for about five minutes five most important minutes in the game if you land in a populated area and this for me is unnaceptable when talking about a finished game. The tickrate is also abysmal but i don't notice it so much so let's say it wont get in your way.In the H3H3 Podcast Brendan said that that there will still be updates after the full version releases so why release it in this state at all? I have high respect for Brendan and Bluehole and wish them all the best but untill they fix these very basic issues (WHICH I KNOW ARE NOT EASY TO FIX) I unfortunately won't be able to recommend this game. That said I very much look forward to the update that will change my review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Erm they have always said it would be implemented. Plus it is only cosmetics no pay2win at all. Furthermore you dont have to spend money on crates you even get 2 free crates besides 1 that only can get opened by a key. So far they have been pushing out updates every week and one big one every month. I have only experienced improvements and optimisation. Last update there was some problems (so what it is Early Access) and the devs worked it out within 24 hours..

2017-04-13,2,42,361,True,Not Recommended,"Update even later ""Frick"" this. After large promises about not having microtransactions in Early Access and not adding ridiculous clothing they just announced paid crates with random cosmetics including Japanese Schoolgirl Pink miniskirt lady and I don't even know male kill bill cosplayer?. At this point the game has become full on meme.Servers still suck btw.Update 1.5 months later Server and client performance has been patched multiple times making them a bit more stable. Serious rubber banding and mutliple second delays are far less frequent (but not entirely gone) any kind of close range gun battle still boils down to a coin flip imgur.com though. With sometimes frankly ridiculous results imgur.com .Also whoever decided to put a motorbike that throws you off (and usually kills you) when you tip it over too far in a game with vehicle physics this and broken deserves a special place in hell.We're two months into their advertised six months of Early Access performance still sucks and the list of promised/announced/talked about but not yet implemented features seems to be growing instead of shrinking.Review as posted originally Dev promises weekly patches? Let's see how that turned out Release version Alright so this is a buggy mess of laggy t. But there's a good game underneath it let's hope for some optimisation and better servers.Early Access Week 1 Update Fixed some minor issues I guess. Major problems remain. Pressing the ""Play"" button is still a gamble with an about 30% chance of getting connected to a server that doesn't rubber band and generally lag like Sometime around here one of the ""Daily updates to improve server performance"" s the sound system making sounds arbitrarily cut off after a few meters. Doors directly next to you sometimes make a sound sometimes don't footsteps become basically inaudible various sounds (most notably bullet ""whizzes"" and cracks) disappear completely.Early Access Week 2 Update Literally worse than a ""no show"". The update was rolled back immediately making a lot of people download two 2.4 GB patches in a row for nothing. Promise of weekly patches officially survived zero weeks.A small update is released to adress the sound issues. Bullet sounds are back footsteps and shots are now basically the same volume and carry for ridiculous distances. Annoyed irl that you sometimes hear your upstairs neighbour walking around? Try being able to tell which floor the guy three houses down the street is on! Great ""fix"".Early Access Week 3 Update Disables the ability to modify .ini files. Many community fixes for problems ranging from FPS issues over mouse smoothing to FoV adjustments become impossible without offering any alternatives. More like Early Access Week 3 Downgrade.Don't get me wrong. Somewhere under this huge pile of bugs lag and stupid dev decisions is a great game. But I can not recommend it in its current state. It needs some serious optimisation and polishing to be considered anything more than ""barely playable"". In fact the Week 3 ""Update"" brought it over the edge from ""barely playable"" to ""unplayable"" for me personally. Tight FoV and mouse smoothing becoming non fixable were the killing blow.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My answer personally right now is no but only for the minority of which is the poorer more unfortunate gamers out there that cant afford middle to higher spec'd pc's. SPECS The minimum GPU for this is game is GTX 660 which I am currently using in my build although i belive what ever statistical testing they did to get this (what seems to be) estimate is very wrong same goes for the processor... A I3 REALLY?! My processor is better than that and let me tell you minecraft looks better. its like im playing a classic 8bit with the amount of low res pixles on my screen. GAMEPLAY I know 0.8hrs of gameplay time isn't enough to be making a justification for a game and then making a review as i have little to no experience on what looks like would be a entertaining game from the YouTube videos and my 15 friends that already own this game (I wish i could jump on the ''ban waggen'') Inside joke for all the s ). However from the experience I have and as I say this review is for a minority The game from my specs (just above minimum) was not getting a steady frame rate above 25! I would drop from 40 to 25 then down to 1 freeze for 2 seconds and backup. That ladys and gents is called a ing stutter and a half. Im not complaining about the graphics if the game was still playable i would not of made a refund but.. it's not. Even YouTubers I'll use my boy Nadeshot as an example has a sick new 2017 top spec pc way over 5gs for sure and has to run this game at minimum graphics May I also add in the majority of my long 0.8hrs was spent in the main menu configering settings to all low FFX and FFA all off because i couldnt give a .Conclusion Id say if you have anything ranging from a I5 and a GTX 700series (or a AMD eqivilant) or above your fine to run the game but dont be expecing a ing nice looking 4k BF1 as you will still be on 40fps minum settings with all grass turned off (its pretty much a tactical advantage though).

2017-05-30,0,0,147,True,Recommended,To be 100% clear i have not had much experience with other games of this sort (Battle Royal) i have played a couple on my own computer and have played others such as H1Z1 King of the Kill on other peoples computers. My specs are listed on my account if needed to base any kind of counter argument or if needed to see what computer i have to get the frames i do get. This game has many pros and cons but personaly i believe the Pros out weigh the cons. At the time of this keep in mind i have only played 42hrs on PUBG.Pros 1 The loot seems to be very balanced and people who land in high populated areas are rewarded by better loot but those who go to low populated areas can still get loot but are usually less equiped than someone who landed in a high populated area.(Example Gatka Low George Pool High)2 Gun fights generally are very fun and dynamic depending on where you land gives you a different kind of gunfight so if you land in Mylta you may get in a roof to roof fight or a close range shotgun fight but if you land in the Gatka you may find your self fighting through water.3 Driving although can be improved my a more fluid and quicker turning and reversing is very fun and hanging out the sisde of your car you shoot someone is badass.4 Gun balancing is very good and most of the time what gun you use it completly down to preference so if you dont like using the Kar 98 you could use an M416 or the SCAR and all the guns aside from the VSS feel like they're in a good place.5 The map is amazing and offers so many different ways to get around the map different settings different kinds of loot and gunfights as i explained earlier.6 This game is also very good to play with other people as you get more kills than usual and you also from my experience get better loot than you would if you were alone.Cons 1 Although it has only happened to me once i have lost connection to servers and have DC in a gunifght i was going to win. This was frustrating but it was at the start of the game so im not to bothered. I will also like to point out many problems that i have had with the game happen in the begining and as the game gets on any problems i had usually are gone and i can enjoy the rest of the game bug free.2 This may be a minor detail but i would still like to point it out there is a rain glich (if you dont know what this is its is a bug in which a player cannot hear the rain and everyone else can that means he can hear footsteps others cannot and is so broken and OP many stermers such as Cohh play music so their sound is also limited.3 This is where Pc specs may come into thingsas my computer isnt some kind of watercooled beast no too often i would say 1 in 5 games i will spawn im parachute to where i want too go and my buildings look like something from that scene in Cat in the hat where they ride Mrs.Quan down the slide. They morph and i am unable to get inside of them which sometimes leaves me DEAD.4 Meds need to be a little bit more common in less populated areas this isnt a huge issue but i go to kahki quite often and me and a parnter will loot the entire thing and come out with 1 first aid and bandages thats it.5 This game is very campy and boring in solo. If you want to run around and get loads of kills this game is not for you unless you're very skilled and know alot about the game. Solo is full of people camping buildings and waiting for you to run into their little trap before they blast you in the head with a shotgun. If you play by yourself and want torun around and get loads of kills i would recomend H1Z1 King Of The Kill as it is way more fast pace and there is also 150people on the map.(Yes i do know H1Z1 has its problems and DayBreak are lazy)In conclution the only big thing to complain about are people who are to afraid to get into gun fights in solo and some connection issues. I recomend this game highly and although a bit expensive is worth it if you have the time to play it.Probably wont get read but i got bored and wanted something to do.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Quick and easy looting system. Constant updates and bug fixes so far from the devs (A breath of fresh air for Early Access). You can deflect bullets with frying pans like a Jedi.Cons Server lag can be quite bad at times (Devs have already addressed this).

Which says nothing about the game even the worst games are fun with friends.Worst thing is that the game is not even long enough to create stories you will later recall of epic holdouts. Even moments that seem to be exciting at first become repetative due to the nature of the rounds and will not leave a lasting impressionGame loop is Run and find wepons before someone kills you (kind of fun)Mid game wait until the play area shrinks (kind of boring)Last one to get noticed wins. (not fun due to bad gunplay)If all of your friends have it and you dont want to be left out sure buy this game.

2017-08-10,0,0,129,True,Not Recommended,I am very disappointed in the turn of events and the direction this game is going. If I was anyone looking at potentially purchasing this game I would consider not doing so. This game has blown up and instead of the devs being humble they did a complete 180 and turned their backs to the community that helped this game become so well known. This game has an insane amount of money put into it and its not even out of early release. The money must have gotten to their heads because before they promised no paid in game microtransactions until release. We are still in early access and with one of the most recent updates they rolled out paid in game microtransactions. We all expected and knew that would happen upon release but with their blatant disregard for their community while still being in early access has had a massive impact to their player base and support.

Arma and H1Z1 are either too hard core or not realistic enough I like the fact you can't jump from a high speed car/bike and live to see end game. I have had my fair share of deaths and some fun and exciting wins (had a solo win with 0 kills lol thankful I took a screenshot of that one) seems position helps quite a bit as well as luck (skill if you have it).If you are someone who rages easily may I suggest a few shots of your favorite drink before hand as you will die more then you win by A LOT. You will also face a lot more skilled players who can one tap you while they are running and such but those times you do get to the final circle it makes your heart race and your hands sweaty lol.See you on the BATTLEGROUNDS! &lt 3,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When i started another round it do not start. It stops at loading screen and just game is not responding any more.I do not know why is this happening!

2017-10-22,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly I thought I would really enjoy this but that is not the case.It's buggy as hell. I appreciate it's still early access but they've got the funding. They have a button on the main page to 'refresh the UI incase it's buggy'. If that isn't an indicator of what to expect I don't know what is.Performance is terrible. People with modest rigs still suffer from poor fps.It's so clunky. Things you can't walk up or climb over are just beyond frustrating. Putting your gun to a window or over a desk prevents you from doing so. When you think you're picking up ammo off the floor you end up picking the gun instead you switch back but then have to reload the gun again even though it was previously loaded.The maps are so large half the time it feels like a walking simulator. You spend 50% of your time staring at the floor for items 49% walking and 1% shooting.The general gun mechanics are strange. There's been several times I've pumped a full round into someone (the blood spats are an indicator it hit) and the player is still alive and shoots you dead in one. Other times I've shot someone with a shotgun from 25 meters away and killed them in 1 hit.The devs themselves are poor too and act like children. It's just a massive cash cow now. Here's why Bringing in micro transactions during early access is just unethical especially after the amount it's made in sales there's no excuse. Bringing in micro transations when they clearly stated they didn't. So that was a massive lie. They ban people for stream sniping and even those that aren't. There's no care for their players. They support the streamers because it's their way of marketing and getting more sales. They ban people from their forum that have posted a polite opinion.

2017-08-27,0,0,270,True,Recommended,I'm sure there are 8 million other PUBG players who can put this better than I can but I'll try anyway.PUBG is an excellent game where you're dropped onto a large map with 100 or so players. Last man standing wins. Simple right?I feel like PUBG has an excellent balance between the health of your character and the damage of different weapons. The guns all feel very powerful but you don't feel squishy and vulnerable. There is also an excellent balance on the size of the map it's big enough to feel like you're traveling far from other players. It's big enough that you need to be careful that you don't die outside the playzone. But it's small enough that you can run/drive fairly substantial distances and if you have the fuel a vehicle can take you across the entire map.This game is sometimes quite hard to run. When in cities I often find there are frame drops. And occasionally I get large lag spikes.As well as that PUBG has its fair share of bugs. Such as having vehicles glitch into objects and explode immediately. Or when your gun is bugged and you can't fire it.But take that with a pinch of salt as the game is still in early access and there are plenty of bugfixes on the way.So overall I'd recommend this game if you have a relatively powerful PC patience and the knowledge that eventually you will get hit in the face with a pan and die in this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-11,0,0,460,True,Recommended,Obviously I like the game as I have played far more than I should have over the course of a month.Is the game glitchy at times? YESIs it optimized for best graphics and FPS? NO (not yet)When the glitches happen to you or to others will you be either infuriated or laughing so hard you might bust a rib? Emphatically YES!I can't begin to describe how terrible the vehicles in the game are where you think you are safe driving at speed only to realize either your jeep can do more cartwheels through the air when you strike an invisible rock than a Circue 'Du Soliel performer on Crack or come to the conclusion that you are riding around in a unbelievably loud Steel Deathtrap of explodey proportions. Or when you try to escape a firefight and drive away as bullets are ripping through both steel and flesh as your car takes about 45 seconds to reach blazing speed of 12 kph.Or how after parachuting from the aircraft and landing on a roof with 3 teammembers... and realizing they are not YOUR teammembers as they beat you to death with their fists while your actual teammates continue to loot and ignore your pleas for help.You need to play it for yourself. Grab some friends get this game and have an absolute blast learning the in s and outs of PUBG! Highly recommend.9.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-28,0,0,257,True,Not Recommended,"Amazing game. Fun to play with friends or solo. Evenly distributed loot airdrops are worth the risk the first person is an amazing added touch graphics are great and matchmaking is instant.HoweverUnder no circumstance will I recommend this game. And for multiple reasons.1.) Every location based server has their own issues. Australia/Oceania's servers are flat out broken. They are basically required to play asian servers so their ping isnt in the several hundreds. North American servers have horrible hit registry. European servers had a horrible desync problem. Yet this is not the worst of the issues.2.) Sounds are quite off. While a lot of time was taken to fix said sounds so location could be made it is still incredibly hard if not improbable to determine whether someone is ahead of or behind you. It just sounds flat. And this is coming from someone with surround sound headphones.3.) My final point and the strongest is that the developers need to stop that god awful lagswitch they built in to deter people from cheating. Its killing the game for me and many other people. I have 150/50 internet and for every three games I only have one that is genuinely playable because ""Network Lag Detected"" pops up stops me from moving covers my screen in a shadow and prevents me from doing anything at all while the world moves around me. This can happen anywhere at anytime but usually every 6 to 10 seconds lasting upwards of 5 seconds. This places a target on your back when it occurs in game. You cannot loot move open doors nothing only stand still probably in the middle of an open field and hope someone doesn't snipe you. It makes driving impossible travelling long distances implausible and looting painful. And I am not the only one having this issue. It is happening to thousands of others. A simple google search will bring about thousands of threads on steam and other forums that in short say youre SOL. So as much as I love this game as much as I try to play this game and have a good time and how amazing this game is I cannot under any circumstance recommend it for what it is in its current state. The first two issues being very minimal in comparison to the last and able to be looked past. But while the dreaded ""Network Lag Detected"" lagswitch is implemented I will not be pledging to this game anymore. I would rather deal with cheaters than deal with this supposed deterrent anymore.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-18,1,12,339,False,Recommended,Been playing this game for about 200 hours now and still feel mediocre at it. Winning fights is a challenge most of the time but that's what makes this game so gratifying. This is the hardest game I've ever played. Yeah you run into the occasional bug but I've rarely run into desync issues especially since the updates. Be prepared to spend at least a 130 hours or so getting crapped on by other players or your own random squad members parachuting to the wrong place. But with the new practice mode and Aimtastic you'll start seeing improvements. Slowly you become more skilled and then you get addicted because you want to keep getting better and better. Every death provides feed back analyze what you got wrong what the other player got right if you had the right gun for the situation and learn learn learn. That's what makes this game fun. Sure there is a little bit of RNG at times where you can't find a gun right away and get killed but it happens to other players. Sometimes I find nothing but a pistol and I go hijack cars from other players. After 200+ hours I still get adrenaline surges and quickened heart beats (which I hope goes away at some point because it'll ruin your aim).Game is highly recommended if you have time a friend you can duo with to teach you and can survive the steep learning curve. If you don't play a lot of FPS it can be challenging but I'm getting there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-27,0,0,402,True,Recommended,"Just know that about 90% of the time you will land not find a gun in 3 houses and the guy that landed near you will basically land in an armory.Update (11/16/2017) I don't really understand why people are saying this game is dying. There are 2+ million concurrent players and the devs are still implementing new updates and are working on a new map. It's not going anywhere anytime soon. Stop equating it to Dayz they are not the same. Dayz never had 4 times the number of concurrent players as the next biggest game on steam. Just because you're mad about the game doesn't mean that it's dying.Pros Best implementation of the Battle Royale game type that I've seen Devs are very active Pretty good weapon models. Recoil patterns are pretty realistic. Decent graphics if you choose to use them (see cons)Cons Lots of bugs (EA) Car mechanics need work. You'll flip on bumps that you can't even see. Grendades bounce half way across the map when you throw them It puts you at a disadvantage if you use high graphics settings. Low graphics allow you to see players much more easily at a distance because the grass and foliage isn't rendered. They will think they're hidden but you can clearly see them. If you choose to use high graphics do not sit still in a bush and think you are concealed. You aren't. Weapon distribution needs work. Stream sniping bans are BS Jumping mechanics suck Too many hackersOverall I think the pros outweigh the cons in this game. There are no horrible game breaking bugs or power hungry devs banning half of the playerbase. I'm going to pull the ""It's early access"" card because it very much applies in this case. There is work to be done but it's off to a good start. If it were as broken as the reviews make it seem it wouldn't have 2 million people playing it every day.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-10,0,0,213,True,Not Recommended,This game is plauged with terrible bugs that the developers have still yet to fix even though the problems were there from the beginning. This is turning into another DayZ Standalone situation flooded with tons of players who are looking for a great time but are basically screwed when the developers never fix major flaws with that are being basically shoved in their faces by fans. You have made freaking bank selling a of copies but you really have nothing to show for it other than an incomplete game that seems to only get worse and more buggy with each update as you add more weapons and noone asked for. I see lots of reviews about hackers but I have yet to see one personally so I won't fault it on that yet probably because I can't finish a full match without the game ing up royally in some fashion.The game in its current state for me is unplayable with buildings taking 10 20 minutes to load in if even loading in at all once the map itself didnt even load in. They are trying the push the game saying its esports ready when at an actual tourney the ing had connection closed. Not to mention they added in Microtransactions in an early access game. This is ing rediculous. Might as well make it free to play too while you're at it. The game does not need a new bloody map it needs to be optimized and stabilized before you start adding new content that will most likely break the game even more. Don't add the map don't add vaulting and new guns untill you fix your game's bugs and issues. I will say when the game used to actually run I had a ing BLAST. Trust me I WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME infact I DO like it. When I'm actually able to play the game without it freezing crashing buildings failing to load and other t that crushes this game. Gameplay is fun but you can't even enjoy that sadly when it has the tendency to break its own legs then try to run a marathon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-07,0,0,174,True,Not Recommended,After rapid development and transparency of developer's actions/targets here everything comes to a stall with numerous issues and degrading community.Pros Excellent gunplay Adrenaline and satisfaction that you get on your 'chicken dinner' One can everytime get a different feel of the game just by changing playstyle (i.e. looting and running camping in bathroom or FFA in Sosnovka MB gathering loot from corpses) Character customization options Improvise adapt and overcome loot is RNG Quick reaction luck and tactics are almost always necessary to winCons Still no region lock Poor netcode and client side hit marking which results in an advantage for players with higher ping (yes there is pinglock but you can just play in different region) Stallment on game optimization especially for AMD's GPUs Frequent problems with connectivity and servers uptime Increasing numbers of bots and players farming Battle Points which results in almost empty map between 1st/2nd circle Numerous players playing outside their regions I haven't encountered obvious examples but other people report about an increase in number of cheaters one can't be sure about that as there is no killcam (unless it's speedhack...) Sounds levels while it could be realistic still it's a pain when you increase volume because you think that you heard steps and suddenly there is an airplane flying above you R.I.P. headphones. There should be a script decreasing Master Sound Volume in such moments really. Pro whiny streamers developer's attitude.I don't recommend this game right now unless developers again start working hard on their title communicate more and resolve problems related from increasing popularity of the title (farmers region locks connectivity).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

At least explain why we're parachuting onto this island and killing each other? No? Too hard? Ok then...GAMEPLAY (2/5) Fun battleroyale gameplay with exciting weaponry where you parachute onto an island loot to your hearts content and then kill everyone you come across until you're the last one left standing. Sounds awesome right? Well yes you would be right but the game's poor optimization stands in the way of all the fun. I don't have a bad rig by any standards but I experienced a lot of issues trying to play. The forums say its the last patch but I'm not sticking around to find out as I don't have the patience or time to play a game that isn't working up to standards.SOUND (2/5) Sound in this game is important. I can hear people quite well in this game but the quality of that sound isn't super great. In a short period of time I ran across quite a few audio glitches such as sound not playing when it should sound becoming suddenly ear drum blowing loud and sounds like gunfire not sounding like gunfire but more like screaching monkies. Not overly impressed.GRAPHICS (3/5) Graphics are not bad but most people won't be able to enjoy them as they will be set to the lowest quality to maximize FPS due to the poor optimization of the game.REPLAY VALUE (4/5) Replayability of this game is very high due to the nature of the game. Its the games strong suit. You will continue to replay matches over and over unlocking clothes and other cosmetics for your character.DO I RECOMMEND? No. Not really. Its a close call though and it really depends if you are willing to put up with the terrible optimization and bugs. Honestly I'm refunding the game. I've never refunded anything before. This is the first time I've been this disappointed with a game. I see it has potential however rather unfortunately it doesn't deliver due to a host of technical issues. I'll be back in another 6 months or so to check it out again once its had some more development time.

2017-04-13,1,10,9,True,Not Recommended,The gameplay itself is very enjoyable. It's a 100 man free for all deathmatch in a very sizeable map with no respawn and Day Z like scavenging mechanics with all weapons ammo clothing and items needing to be procured on site as opposed to entering the map with a loadout. Players must stay within a certian circumference that gets smaller as time goes on forcing players to continually converge in a proceedingly smaller area. A match can last about 25 30min+ depending on how good/dedicated you are or when the game decides to crash.Weapons are customizeable with attachments you find in the field scopes holo sights silencers etc. Very cool.Items extend from shoes and hats to bandages and medkits as well as melee weapons like crowbars.Your character's clothing and accessories are customizable from the main menu of which are acquired by lootcrates you unlock with battle points earned from matches.But the performance is TERRIBLE terrible for an early access game but even more so for a $30 game. Absolutely garbage performance. In 2 hours I've crashed 4 times and have consistently hit slideshow grade framerates and assets that straight up don't load. I'm well above the reccomended specs and play games like Battlefield 4/1/Killing Floor 2 with no issue.It's really hard to enjoy the excellent game mechanincs and game concept when the game itself runs like a pig. Which is sad because the 'game' part of the game is fantastic.Cannot reccomend in its current state for $30 dollars.

Drop from a plane collect loot kill players get pushed in closer and closer try to be the last man standing. The gun play is pretty realistic and it's always fun to get into an intense firefight.+ Great fun with friends+ Very High Replayability+ First Person and Third Person modes.+ Vehicles + Depening on how well you do you earn battle points. You can use these to get crates which you can sell on the market for profit OR open them for a cosmetic item. More of a personal note When playing in a squad it's very common for one of your friends to get knocked down and within a second they get killed with no chance of reviving them. This causes you to either leave the game or your friends have to sit there in boredom watching you play the remainder of the game. Can be frustratingly repetitive. Example Spending 20minutes looting / looking for players and then suddenly getting sniped across the map.

Today was the first update which was released towards it. 60hz better frames better anti cheat (Soon ) better hitreg.And this is just the first patch there is more to come. You can read everything in the Dev's blog a week ago. Yes Locked lootboxes is a thing even if you pay with Battle points. But it's only cosmetic and doesn't affect gameplay as such in any case. I have a gtx 1080 TI and a 8700k game runs okayish for the hardware I have but you'll get constant 80+ fps on a decent i5 now.

2017-10-24,0,0,504,True,Not Recommended,Recentl Ive noticed that there have been a lot of cheaters. I remember buying this game in june and only ever encountering 2 cheaters until october 21st. My friend all of a sudden told me that there were so many hackers and I really didnt believe him since it was a bit far fetched...oh but I was wrong i played around 8 games...i kid you not 50% of the games i died to a hacker. We rarely died to normal boys. Anyways Im disappointed at how the devs handle this game. I know its supposedly a early access game but lets be honest...its not. They have more or less as many players as CSGO and they still use a ing clucky Unreal engine. They should use their own engine or a better one. They removed the jumping crouch bug BUT STILL DONT USE A JUMP SYSTEM!?!?!?! They say that they dont do monthly updates anymore because they felt as if a deadline would limit their creativity and that it wouldnt be a good update...LAST UPDATE WAS ONLY ING FOG UPDATE SOME GAME TWEAKS AND IT SPAWNED BIRTH TO A BUNCH OF CHEATERS!!!! THEY SOLD AT LEAST 12MILLION GAMES AND EACH COPY COSTS ON AVERAGE $20 AND THEY DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO COPY PASTE THE ING VAULTING MECHANICHS FROM RED ORCHESTRA 2 FOR S SAKE THEY ARE WORSE LORD GABEN WHEN IT COMES TO UPDATES AND CREATIVITY. Even the whole fortnight thing...WHY DO THEY EVEN CARE????? THE ING BATTLEROYAL GENRE DOESNT BELONG TO THEM THEY SHOULD OFF AND LET FORTNIGHT DO THEIR THING. They arent gonna lose money or are they??? Why do they make this game into an esport? The only reason it got so popular so fast is caus ing H1Z1 was too much of an arcade game. I swaer if u want to get richer than PUBG ing make battleroyal right. Ez money. The last thing I have to say is that they apparently ban stream snipers...? Why tho...? Its not illegal&gt &gt &gt ????,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-27,0,0,228,True,Recommended,This game has the potential to be one of the top games out. Playing it gives you that chasing the dragon feel you get from H1Z1. Personally I'm enjoying much more than H1Z1.This game has a much larger selection of weapons and the attachments are a game changer. Rather than shuffle back and forth while tagging each other you can engage in more fulfilling firefights. Combat happens at much further distances thanks to scopes. Tactics are more important than ever none of this hop out of a car and mow people down crap.The game needs some optimization yes but it's already leaps and bounds ahead of H1Z1. The devs are really active that should say a lot for the future of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Theres alot of server lag de sync and what not. I haven't noticed any fps problems myself but they're out there. The sound system sucks it's almost like when you get shot the bullets themselves project the sound of the guns shooting something like that anyways. Also the footsteps are strange the carpets sound like sand for some reason and your foot steps sound like thunder.I can't recommend this game as it is and the price is just way too much for how much stuff there is to do in it. which is only the battle royale gamemode of course.

2017-05-18,0,0,98,True,Recommended,Nervous and Excited 95 other players and myself jumped from the plane and into the arena. I hit the ground and frantically started searching for supplies. Before I knew it there were already 30 players eliminated leaving about 60 to fight to the death. I came upon a church where after searching for supplies and finding an ak12 (or whatever it is) I see a care package falling from the sky. I watched it for a little while to make sure no enemies where in the area then proceeded. To my surprise there was an enemy crouched behind the other side of the package. I was able to sneak up on him and shoot and kill him giving him no chance to retaliate. In the package I found a sniper rifle and 8x scope. Not bad at all. Continuing my hunt there were only 20 players left the play area getting smaller and smaller. I picked a hill that was still in the play area to see if an opportunity to get a couple kills with the sniper rifle presented itself. Looking down the scope I heard several shots coming from my left that were very close which greatly alarmed me. In prone I peaked out from behind a large stone to see ANOTHER PLAYER doing the exact same thing I was only he shot first. Needless to say he lost his life due to his trigger finger. 10 players left. Forced to leave the hill due to the play area shrinking I layed down prone in a field and tried to come up with a gameplan when another player peaked his head out from a nearby hill that was very small. He did not see me and I was able to get a headshot on him with my sniper rifle. The play area shrinked again and I was forced from my cover in the tall grass. Unfortunately I was found and shot by another player. The adrenaline rush and anxiety associated with this game is amazing. I finished #7 a little off but also impressed at my own ability to be a complete jackass to other players sneaking up on them and taking their loot.This game is very buggy but is frequently updated. I urge you to give it a try. I almost didn't buy it because I hate wasting money but I still think this game is worth playing but maybe not at the $30 price. If it's on sale its a no brainer but at normal price it's really at your own discretion. 10/10 would get jumpscared shot again,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-08,1,2,23,True,Recommended,"We stared at each other across the room and froze! Panic started to sweep over me. The hairs on my neck stood up and I could feel the first beads of sweat forming. I nervously patted my utility belt nothing. The backpack I had just picked up felt light nothing useful in there either. Between us lay a frying pan. I needed it. I could tell he was thinking the same but we were both still. That frying pan is the only thing that will kill him quickly. He knew it too. One of us is dying in this room today. I looked around for a plan. I spotted the pitcureframe on the fireplace. An old couple lived here dead now of course. Ever since the invasion Earth had become just another entertainment channel. Simply fun to watch for the Others. Ever since Arena 2053 opened man and woman have been fighting each other. Not through choice but through necesity. That's the only way out of this place and into the Haven. You have to win. But at what cost?Some choose to play the Arena. Few like it. Most find a hole to crawl up in praying the Others don't punish their behaviour. A gunshot fires in the distance inreasing the urgency in the room. I could tell he was unsettled nervous unsure of my skill. We studied each other's appearance. In the holding area of the Arena you can use influence and money to buy better clothes to give yourself some camouflage. Many would pay extra for this advantage. Everyone else was just grateful for the plain clothes they throw at you. Not ideal but better than nothing.Strange relationships form in the months you wait in the holding cells of the Arena. We all know there can be only one survivor but this doesn't stop people trying to form alliances. Some choose to become subservient and crawl behind their masters hoping for a quick death from them in the Arena. Some try to swim to safety but the Others always see. A floorboard creaked in another room snapping me out of thought. We weren't the only two here. We looked at each other again. ""I don't want any trouble mister. I just need that frying pan y'hear and I'll be gone"" he said a slight tremble in his voice. A door opened followed by a woman. I recognised her. She was a previous winner. She looked experienced. Tired. Scars of previous battles told stories on her face. Why wasn't she in the Haven? It didn't make sense. She looked at us both slowly and then down to her hands. All of us stared at the shotgun. It was a double barrel. She only had two shots maximum maybe it wasn't even yet loaded. She looked like she was weighing up her options. She could take us out but the shots would have to hit true. If she missed then one of us would still be alive and closer to the frying pan. Whoever was left holding that frying pan held the upper hand. She raised the shotgun to the other man. ""NO! DON "" BANG!The noise was deafening and shocked me into action. I lept across the room and fumbled with my fingers to grip the frying pan. ""PICK UP GODAMNIT!""I yelled. She turned to me and fired. Fortunately the thin wooden chair took the full impact of the shotgun. She looked up and realised her mistake. She started to fumble with her belt looking for any kind of weapon. I raised the frying pan and with all of my weight crashed it over her head. She fell instantly in a heap. Blood trickled out and down between the floorboards. I breathed heavily but this was no time to stop. I grabbed the shotgun and some shells from her belt. Whilst reloading I hear a groan and look over at the man who was shot. He was trying to crawl out of the door with his hand on his stomach clearly holding his intestines in place. He would never make it. I had to do the kindest thing. I walked over with the shotgun. ""Please mister. End my pain. Shoot me."" He said our eyes locking. I could see the terror the panic. ""I'm sorry this has happened to you"" I said whilst raising my shotgun and aiming between his eyes. I could see the terror and panic turn to relief.I pressed lightly on the trigger. Then stopped. I noticed how little shells I had left and thought about the sound the shotgun would make. It would alert others to my prescence and I couldn't afford that. I lowered the shotgun and placed it on my back. ""W what are you doing mister?""I released the frying pan on my belt and raised it. ""No! Please! Mister!""I threw it down and across his face. The sound was sickening as bone crushed and skin split. He was gone. I looked around surveying this horror show. 2 down 98 to go. I walked out of the door and started to run.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME if you are looking for a solid shooter game. The community is one of the worst as 90% of the players are campers. This game is not worthy of the ""Battlegrounds"" title as there are very few battles going on within the game and if you are lucky enough to get in to a battle you will most likely feel like you are at a disadvantage as the person who is firing at you will probably be out of sight so you will be dead before you get to spot them. Also close quartes combat is quite possibly one of the worst aspects of this game as it feels sluggish and unsatisfying even if you manage to succeed in your close quarters fight. The movement in this game is also dreadful because the characters are so slow in all aspects of movement so good look climbing and jumping over obstacles in this game because the movement makes the characters feel extremely disabled.

But I met a few guys and joined them on Discord and we played a few sqad games and it was great fun. Running around trying to find weapons and protective gear and of course always looking out for others who try to do the same. And then thre is the play area that gets smaller and smaller as time progresses. The smaller it gets the more players are in the same area. Near the end of the game it gets intense as a lot of players fill a very small game area. If you dont have a good weapon and at least level 2 vest and helmet you'r dead. As a team based game I'll give this a 5/5. If you only play solo i will have to give this game a 2/5 not much fun. So if you have some friends to play with you should buy it right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-29,0,0,548,True,Recommended,"After a near 300 hours playing this game I have come to the conclusion that it is the best Battle Royale game in it's genre and to be fair it wins that title fair and square as PlayerUnknown (the gent we have to thank for the mods and game mode itself) is the guy creating this masterpiece.I don't fully agree with the games early access model and that the game had a seperate external from steam Deluxe Edition pre purchase however it wasn't as expensive as the standard edition and some of the clothing items included with the deluxe edition like PlayerUnknown's Trenchcoat and Scarf are worth more than 300+ on the steam community market effectively making that piece of included digital content more expensive than an actual copy of the game...but I digress.Player unknown's Battlegrounds is a fantastic game for an early access and a Beta and the devs seem commited and active towards fixing glitches issues and adding more content as well as balancing weapons and optimization. Realistically the areas in which this game falls flat is in the minor annoyances likes getting stuck on objects in a falling animation taking random damage from unknown sources out of nowhere low FPS drops in certain areas of the game or if someone throws a flashbang and Sniper rifles appearing to fire higher than where the scopes crosshair is aimed these however have only been glaring issues since the latest patch and will soon be fixed (as of this update the above mentioned glitches and bugs are currently fixed)Looting in this game could use a bit of tweaking as there are ways of looting quicker and more effectively that give you a quick edge competitively early game but this isn't a game breaking exploit there are however some other issues that really break the game and with your perception of if it was a fair match or not such as terrible server lag netcode and such as there's been plenty of oppertunities I've pushed into a building or defended mine from a impromptu home invasion and I fire both of my trusty shotgun barrels into a would be invaders chest and head at point blank range only for the damage inflicted to be completely ignored and for them to slowly pick my health away with a handgun or other weapon at this stage I think the problem is that the servers themselves need to be top notch and seeing as this entire game runs of the pretense of being a dedicated competitive ""last man standing"" survival shooter then the shooting as well as the netcode should be some of the best you will ever see in a game which currently it just isn't.Not to discriminate but the servers are also just terribly laggy and they really should look at getting some top of the line hosting models and such as sometimes servers just topple over which never makes it a fun game or match as you will find yourself rubber banding glitching through walls and objects or straight up being shot when behind cover or clearly out of ""line of sight"" of the enemy firing on you maybe on your screen you're safe inside that room or behind that wall but on their screen they can see the perfectly formed red mist spraying from your head...please guys you're games incredibly fun but focus on server stability and optimization of netcode and frames per second not adding content...don't make the same mistake the DayZ Dev Team did.What I will say that I cannot give the development or PR teams any credit for is banning people for honking car horns near a streamer when THEY implemented that feature into the game so what a streamer whines like a little baby to you guys and you decide to throw out a ban for that?! It's pathetic grow the up and tell the streamer if he wants to play with zero delay on his stream then he's a and deserves it simple as.Otherwise I would HIGHLY recommend this game for it's interesting gameplay fun movement and easy to pick up model of play you can get absolutely wrecked and still want to jump into another game and that I find brilliant about this game.Now on roughly 350+ hours and it hasn't gotten any older or boring highly recommend this game it's ing incredible.Ritra out!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is realy good even if not optimized yet it has a strong gameplay and it's more about survive dont playing like a fool running in a unicorn mask and being smart.

2017-07-07,0,0,226,True,Recommended,This game makes the player feel tense with an actual sense of value and fear for their characters life something that similar games fail to do and I would definitely recommend it given that 4 million purchases have been made in its first month and that I had 30 hours of gameplay in the week after my own purchase. What really makes the game is it's use of sound in footsteps and gunshots however the player movement in a word just feels sloppy. Your player gets caught on rocks and steps of cement that barely reach their knees and cannot jump over such without a running start. I understand that the game is in it's earlier stages but with a type of gamemode as competitive as it is the slightest flaw makes the experience too frustrating.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Consedering this game's still is on an Alpha state (Early Access Game) is remarkable to see that the community is growing rapidly and that the developers are engaged in make the game better. Undeniably given the fact that's still in Alpha there are some (others argue many) bugs and glitches. But so does every other early access game. Bottom line is If you enjoy First/Third person Shooter games with elements of survival which requires not only luck but strategy as well and next gen graphics with relative low hardware requirements this is the game for you. Always look for gameplays before buying. Still if you're looking for a game to play solo or with your friends and have fun have at it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I don't mind the little issues/glitches because I know they will get fixed the game is too fun to even care at this short point in its life. I run this game on an i5 4670k 4.4GHZ and a 2GB GTX 770(Upgrading soon) but I am still able to run this game nice and smoothly. Depending on location I typically jump from 60 120fps.

2017-04-29,1,2,113,True,Not Recommended,I'd rather watch paint dry or better yet loot dirty laundry from around my house and throw it in the washing machine. It would be more fun doing those tasks then putting another second into this game. I've tried getting a refund but that was a no go. The main problem with this game is there isn't any actual skill involved. If you are successful at winning a match you either landed in the dead center of the player circle camped in a house the whole time and ended up getting LUCKY and found good loot. Or you ran around for 30 minutes and stayed on the edge of the player circle laying in the grass hoping no one sees you. In either instance you've done nothing. The fire fights suck poorly optimized even if you have a god tier computer. What I would reccomend is if you want to waste $35.00 (CAD) either go buy some scratch tickets and hope you get lucky or go to the casino and play penny slot machine for an hour. You'd have more fun and you'll get the same result. Luck based.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,0,0,120,True,Recommended,So I have only got 20 hours on the game so take this short review lightly. I decided to wait before giving the game a review untill I actually won a match. The main thing that I would like to focus on is that you do not need to be good at shooters in order to play and actually win a game in PUBG. Ive never played any games related to this one like DayZ or H1Z1 so this was my first time playing a battle royale style game. Im very inexperienced and I play on a PC that is below the minimum specs required for the game so I deal with lag. I was still able to achieve a win in a duo match with my father who does not play shooters at all so the entire concept from the ground up is new to him. The game isnt based on how good your computer can run the game or how accurate you are with the weapons in the game but more about the decisions you make. Decision making is what really determines if you are succesful or not. The game is also fairly easy to pick up and start playing. Simple and easy to use controls. It feels smooth in my opinion and I would reccomend this game to anyone looking to have some fun. It might not be for everyone but I definetly give it a thumbs up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-21,0,0,75,True,Recommended,I haven't played a whole lot of games but I got enough to understand alot of it. Coming from H1Z1 there is alot more to do playing Battlegrounds then H1 and yes the game just came out but I feel this game movement is a bit wierd alot better then H1Z1 but still shooting is hard or not as clean. This game needs alot of improvment when it comes for performance Im running a AMD FX 8350 GTX 750 TI SC and with having my card overclocked it helps alot but having some friends that have alot better specs then me they have there graphics better but barly achiving 60FPS even on low at times. But over all of that a solid game in my opinion I just think this game mainly needs a performance boost.

My parachute pulled and I spiralled down trying to land before the who decided my chosen group of houses was a ing shared endeavour did.I landed first on the roof of a building with an m16a4 and 3 packs of 30 x 5.56mm ammo.

I crouched. Aimed down my sights and waited for him to peek his head up the stairs so that I could give an free close shave haircut on the house. He ran up and tried to jump off the balcony only to get stuck against it. I pressed shift steadying my aim and let a burst fly into his idiot face...As the rounds hit and I got the red notification on screen ""1 kill"" his body ragdolled violently into the distance. I summarily had my first multiple . I quickly ran to find a kevlar vest optics helmet ammo and more weapons in my compound. MY ING COMPOUND!

I entered and ran upstairs confident af with all my gear and my 1 kill. I rounded a corner into a room that would have a window overlooking a wide open field and....As the spray of buckshot rearranged my face and my player model quickly turned into what I imagine Jabba The Hutt's mangled turds resemble. I remember staring at my screen with my mouth and eyes wide open for just a second before I vowed that this game was the biggest load of I had ever played.I immediately queued for the next game and cleaned the bodily fluids from the walls and my chair and rig.

The game itself takes 6 8gigs of ram to run where i have never seen another game come anywhere close to that also this game is HEAVILY based on proccessor i had a gtx 1070 with a AMD A10 5800k proccessor which is alil older but was only getting 30 35 frames and would dip down on occasion i upgraded to a 7th generation i5 7600k and since then i hit 100 150 fps constant with the same gtx 1070 card.

2017-06-11,0,0,472,True,Recommended,I have been playing this game for over 3 weeks now. I absolutly love the game. The thrill you get from it is just what you need in a game. My heart races and a pump of adrenline start flowing through my veins when I'm being shot at or I am some of the few last survivors. I love playing this with friends because it brings us together as a team.As for the game I have a few good things and a few bad things about it.PRO'S The game has a good loot range already with weapons and ammo throughout the whole map. Vehicles are good to have in the game as they are a life saver sometimes. The circle to stay in is a brill way to make the game last man standing. The map is a fair good size. Weapon's feel good plenty of them.CON'S The games graphics should be locked a bit or changed in a way for people using lower graphics settings because lower settings give's you an advantage to see people in the distance. The Rendering distance changes the grass rendering so hiding in grass offers no real camoflauge. Some of the vehicle's need to have their stability tuned a bit for example the motorbike. When at high speeds the bike has the tendancy to drift when taking sharp bends going top speed. Other vehicles do this as well. Another map should be introduced to keep the game interesting to people and the map / server is random rather than people getting the option to pick which one they would rather play on.Overall very good game just needs a few adjustments.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-16,0,0,2274,True,Recommended,"I see a lot of ""Not recommended"" here from people who clearly do not understand game development and that is perfectly understandable. But please don't naively accept what people complain about here and avoid what could potentially be a very fun experience for a reasonable price.Games development is a business and it is complicated. It takes hundreds of employees working together to build market and maintain a successful (profitable) video game. I know I'm stating the obvious but there are so many people here who seem not to know this simple fact.Bluehole have created one of the top 5 most popular games here (daily) and I suspect they were more than a little surprised at just how popular it would be. Six million copies in early access alone is nothing short of mind blowing for a game with one map and mode (currently). Despite these frankly shocking sales numbers and daily player numbers in the hundreds of thousands Bluehole have managed to keep the game running on dedicated servers with impressively low down time.I see people saying they don't listen to their customers and I have to strongly disagree. Just look at their Twitter accounts forums and the updates pages here to see what has been addressed and implemented at the behest of the players.Bluehole and PlayerUnknown have been incredibly vocal about the progress and hiccups of development for PUBG. I applaud the way they have handled almost every stage. Have they made mistakes? Of course they have. Unforgivable mistakes? Well that's subjective but I would argue not.Have they kept all their promises? No. But personally I think I can forgive them adding microtransactions or slowing update and release dates. I can do this because they have solid reasons for doing so. The crates are optional and only have cosmetic items in them so I see no reason to complain about them implementing something which almost every video game released in the last few years has. Especially as there are AAA games out there that cost more than 3 times that of PUBG and their crates have gamebreaking equipment and buffs in them.If people want to financially support expansion and improvement of the game and to keep the servers running with a pink skirt on their avatar then I'm all for it. Okay so I have said enough to be accused of being a shill. That's okay I wanted to bring a little reason into these bizarre reviews and that is a price I'll gladly pay.Now on to my review.Pros Fun.Solid mechanics. This could be argued because they're still a little clunky but credit where credit is due the improvements are rapid. I honestly expect this game just get easier and easier to control as time goes on. However I have no problem shooting people looting or getting from A to B. Regular updates with noticable improvements (albeit a little too regular and I agree that they should be realeased in a more tested and stable state).Developer to player communication is very good and reasonable visa versa.Down times are very low for an EA.Balance seems fair and when it doesn't they seem happy to roll back changes.Community. I've made plenty of friends in both the game itself and associated Discords.Optional cosmetic micro transactions are optional and cosmetic only (A difficult concept for some but you are actually not forced to pay more than you take responsibility for).Price. The cost was more than reasonable in my opinion and is of course subjective (had I hated it I'm sure I'd be sending this one down to cons).Cons This is an Early Access title so it does have bugs and down times (this doesn't bother me but it is a consideration).The sound design needs some work and there are times when I take my headphones off to cope.There is a steep learning curve if you haven't played this type of game before (again this is just something to consider but I'm okay with).Community. I've been trolled and encountered cheaters. There's nothing new about that in online gaming and I don't blame Bluehole provided they're making a reasonable effort to control these issues (which they are). But if these things really get to you then that's why this is in cons.Jumping over things is a frustration at the time of this review but I know this is likely to change so find out for yourself at the time of your purchase.All in all Game 7/10 and rising with each update successfully implemented.Bluehole 9/10.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-30,0,0,245,True,Recommended,PUBG as it is. I have about 60 hours In this game so far and I can easily say that its the best looking playing and operating game you'll find on Early Access this game blows its competitors out of the water being H1Z1 KOTK which PU helped work on but this game is very very polished for it being in the state its in the team really focuses on optimization and gameplay over graphics they listen to their community about what they want to see out of the game and that alone is a feat. What I hope to see. Honestly so far this game does have almost everything I personally think it should be shipped with but here are some things I wish would be added in the near future 5v5 and Up Squad Matchmaking Higher Variety in Pioneer Crates Survival of some sort or other modes (Zombie is WIP) Bigger or different maps Better in game voip Tournaments via In Game Ghile Suits are rare in the world not only airdrops Diving and other finesse moves to dodge vehicles and other actions Maybe some Aerial Vehicles Final Verdict. Overall this game is a solid fight to the death sorta deal with a lot more potential in the upcoming updates has a great replay value intense PvP the perfect example of a love/hate relationship and you can find yourself easily getting sucked in and playing countless hours before really noticing this game is on my Highly Recommend List because it is very solid game and has a great team behind it and the hype train will not die on this game as long as they keep the good updates and finding ways to change it up then they will never see a drop in players and for those of you waiting for it to go on Sale good luck the team needs all the money they can get due to company size so that being said the current price tag ($29.99) is way more than worth it for all that you're getting.9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Considering I'm playing it with an AMD Phenom II 555 with 8gb ddr3 and a gtx 970 I find the game more than playable! Theres been a lot of backlash about microtransations recently but I would point out that if you don't like it don't buy them. No one has to buy them and it makes NO difference to how the game plays they are simply clothes for your character. The fundamentals of the game mechanics are unchanged by microtransactions!Back to the game this game is quite simply one of the most intense games I've ever played. When you make it to the last circle with 2 or 3 enemies you can feel your heart almost beating out your chest. Another aspect of this game that makes it fun is to run squads with friends and lay down rules for your squad i.e pistols only cars only. When you do that it makes the game very entertaining and a great laugh.Buy this games its amazing,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I implore anybody to try this out. If you're a fan of H1Z1 then definitely because the stuff in that game that annoys you...chances are it does not exist in this game (for me anyway). There is no real sense of ""Ah this gun is too OP"" that comes with a lot of these styler games. It's more a case of whatever you feel works best for you.

2017-05-01,1,2,188,True,Recommended,Hundred hour review.The developers of this game made one crucial improvement over H1Z1 You cannot exit fast moving vehicles without severely injuring or killing yourself.This tiny common sense change completely changes the gameplay. In h1z1 the game is dominated.. DOMINATED by the playstyle of folks driving at ludicrous speeds and teleporting out of their vehicles to shoot people with a tremendous positioning advantage. In BG vehicles are vital transportation but a liability in combat.They also require much more time to accelerate realistically which balances their use quite nicely.Besides the vehicle issues BG also delivers a more engaging realistic and detailed environment than h1z1. I am partial to eastern european warzones so maybe I am biased. The groudn cover is denser the lighting subtle and realistic I feel there are more unique and diverse structures that actually see use in the game the dead zone sometimes ends up in exotic locations weapons are customizable and loot crates contain rewarding hard to find equipment there are boats and above all the dev team seems pro active responsive and competent.When i come in first or second it isn't because I abused mechanics or sheer dumb luck it is because I logically used the terrain or anticipated movement based on the play area. Or what I didn't do like landi in the middle of the most desirable looting area with thirty other killers and expect that i am somehow special and favored by the gods.Game is fun.

2017-06-23,0,0,337,True,Not Recommended,Most common bug for me is aiming and firing. When I aim down site 1/2 the time it will not let me unsight unless I change my weapon.HOWEVER the MAIN bug is firing with full auto. every other magazine it will just stop firing and never let me fire any gun again for the rest of the match. It happens most often when firing in bursts but also happens when just going full auto and holding fire.Hit registration is also sketchy. most of the time it works but I find the longer the shot the less likely the registration is. I have gotten multiple headshots with a Kar98 seen blood and they don't even act they they are getting shot.The last complaint I have which isn't game breaking but still needs improvement is the grass. The render distance for grass needs to be much MUCH further than what it is now.

2017-04-24,0,0,101,True,Recommended,"Optimization At this moment you need a GTX 1080 ti and a new core i7 to play it on ultra and even with this specs there are framerate drops to 30 fps. I'm playing it with a 1070 G1 and i5 at 3.2Ghz. On on some areas the cpu is working at 100% and the graphic card is only about 70% I have no bottlenecks on other games so I assume that the optimization is very bad because other games with a lot of screen elements like the witcher 3 works perfectly on my computer. So if your pc is not very fast wait for performance patchs before buy it.About the game Great potential this is one of those ""just one more game"" videogames. You have to be very careful on the battlefield and it would be boring for some people but exciting for others you need to get lucky finding weapons and gear as well. Sadly most of times the players who win are those ones who camps all the time or others who play on a smart but dirty way (for example parking a car and wait for someone to come and drive it to shoot them) maybe something like a hunger bar could fix the campers problem forcing you to explore the map looking for food.Another problem is that melee weapons are totally useless because damage is very bad it have to be fixed too for exemple with stealth attack executions. Some points you have to know .The gameplay still feels rough the first and third person camera needs some improvements and mouse sensitivity works strange. The servers are working good most of time wich is impresive on an early acces with thousand of players but you need a fast and stable connection to play with no lags. You will enjoy the game so much more if you play with friends so I wouldn't recommend it if you are going to play alone. Well... as I said before the game have a great potential but it's still on early acces many things have to be fixed and it's expensive so I would recommend to buy it on some months...",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,45,True,Recommended,The video display is horrible controls need a rework frame rate is not consistent and it is a very buggy game.But I will still play the s**t out of it.The pacing of this game is perfect. Starting out there is a good chance you will find a reasonable early game weapon (like a shotgun) to defend yourself with. Depending on your attitude it is possible for you can get knocked out immediately or end up in the top 10 out of 100 players left alive.The game is best enjoyed with the maximum allowable party members per server which is four people or one squad. Your squad will fight to be the number one squad left alive out of at least 25 other squads. Calling out potential targets trading weapons mods and armour with your teammates over the course of a 30 minute game is what makes this such a great game. Once they fix all the bugs in the game I guarantee it will be a very popular multiplayer team based game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-30,0,0,143,True,Recommended,This game might be an early access and it could be very early for me to review it before it is being polished so this is just a Preliminary Review I don't get the fuss behind people giving negative reviews about how bad the game is no it is not at all not for me at least. I never enjoyed such a great intensity and pressure that makes me focus I admire the idea and how other games influenced developers to create such an exciting game. People rant about the challenge and how developers don't listen sometimes yes it could be sad but think from the devs' perspective if they are trying to create an e sport game that can stand they need to fill a certain criteria in order to join. We as well don't have that much e sport games in the market and dont go COD or BF bullcrap on me they are more arcadish and more easy to script so never compare a potential upcoming e sport game to a game that can be easily scripted by others just to ruin your fun time.I have other shooter games like CS GO and I had my fun time with it but this one I could play and enjoy daily just for it gives me more diversity. Yes lag issues texture issues etc issues You idiots can see with your OWN TWO BLOODY EYES it is not 100% completed and I bet you some games isn't 100% DONE and they are still on early access and pisses us off and thats my fear from the devs.The experience of this game never got me mad to the level of rage quitting like some other games in fact I love joining another round I get much better experience and better at what I do the ambient and shooting sounds is your number one target and always concentrate on quickness and the flexibility of always moving around.Last but not least either Squad or Duo the communication is vital and very vital without it you feel blind you feel you won't get the statisfaction of hunting others. The Solo Mode is a way to level up your chicken dinner game. Good luck to all of you see you in the grounds. P.S Don't Rant enjoy till it is done and then compare the early access with the finished product.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-28,0,0,45,True,Recommended,EDIT PUBG has officially reached 2M concurent players on steam... No idea how this game is good but NEVER in my mind was this game worthy of being the top played game on the platform. Goes to show the power of twitch and the livestreaming community (and hundreds of thousands of chinese players who login everyday).A slow paced Battle Royale game more tactical and less action packed than the competition but it's also more realistic and has better visuals.First of all the solo mode is bad. I don't mean it's completely trash but it definitely doesn't feel like a game that was created with solo in mind you spend sometimes up to an hour alone listening for sounds looking for enemies in the distance trying to flank other people fighting etc. Where the game really shines is when you get your buddies involved. The fact that you can't stack things like helmets and armor makes sharing alot easier and the slow paced tactical part of the game becomes fun because you can establish a strategy and be alot more mobile. If you're looking for a BR game that focuses on duo/team but has a poor solo experience you should get PUBG (this game) but if you're looking for a good Solo with a decent duo/team i'd get H1Z1 instead. (Edit if youre looking for a more laidback/chill BR experience try Fortnite!),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-18,0,0,450,True,Recommended,Amazing game for people who aren't lil es. It is basically the perfect combination of H1Z1's KoTK and DayZ. Instead of being arcadey and Counter Strike twitch firing like this game heavily rewards you for playing stealthily and working with your squad. While I love H1Z1 I think PUBG is the game that every KoTK fan wanted KoTK to become eventually. I wouldn't say it's better than KoTK even though I enjoy it more but it's a really cool alternative execution of the Battle Royale idea with a fresh perspective. That is if you're not a lil tiny whiney tear machine.It has it's downsides like it's still laggy but not near as laggy as when it first came out. They are releasing patches rapidly which is quickly making the game a ton better. I have never been so happy with an early access game before and I'm one of those non puss people that can stand huge amounts of bugs for a long time. (I did play DayZ for a long time since it was a mod). The thing that sold me on this game is during the closed beta I kept finding things I didn't like about the game and the next weekend they would be tweaked or fixed. That still seems to be the case though I don't have as many things to complain about as I did then at all.Onto the gameplay it's actually VERY HARD. Not in a bad way though it can be frustrating at times because some people and squads are already very skilled but the feeling of reward for getting better is pretty amazing. It's not just a twitch fire 2 tap headshot game like H1Z1 this game requires a lot more ideas on how to approach a situation. It forces you to think in different ways especially when you're forced to run across an empty field with your squad at the very end of the game. In some ways it's a good thing but it can be equally agrivating when it seems like the safe zone circle is always against you. With that being said wins in this game are incredible especially with a squad. You definitely earn it.So with all this being said replace that filled diaper with your big boy pants if you're going to play this game. It is far from perfect but it is quickly getting there. Once they optimize the graphic performance and smooth out the lag this game will be exactly what I've been waiting for someone to make for years. If you're in for a real man's (or woman's) challenge then this is the game for you but if you regularly can't stop crying about there being in your diaper then stay the hell away from the big boys. Go play Five Nights at Freddie's or Minecraft with some 8 years olds that's where you obviously belong you damn diabolic factory of a baby.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Obviously if you have a sniper you have a long range advantage. Over all this game is amazing the devs actually care about their game and are working towards optimizing the game. There's guides online that can help with FPS increases that'll make the game run smoother. If you're reading this and are choosing between H1 or PUB it's an easy pick between the two.

2017-03-28,0,0,197,True,Recommended,A Good Buy or Not? First off this game's mechanics animations and gunplay are all great. Loot is spread out fairly map is big and the community is great! You know those games that each kill means something? It makes you feel great. Not the call of duty kill 30 people and not feeling any satisfaction from those kills. With each kill I get I feel like that kill could be a youtube video by itself! The only problem I have been having is FPS issues. My rig is definitely on the high end scale and yet I only get around 30fps on low settings and even lower when recording or streaming. This is due to poor optimization. The Dev Team has put out that this is the first thing that they will be working on so hopefully we won't have to wait long.

Another reason of quiting the game was because of the update of the new map. The biggest thing I hate about H1Z1 is all of the colorful clothing they have in the game making everyone look stupid.*If one of the developers read this please don't add colorful clothing like H1Z1 that is all I ask from you.*After getting this game when it released I have loved it ever since. This game is always entertaining whenever you play. I find this game really fun when you have some friends to play with. I don't play much solo's because of how many people try really hard to win. I have had some really funny moments while playing in some games. One time I landed and retrieved a viehicle on the road and all of a sudden I see a car coming my way so I try to ram him head on and out of no where 2 3 more cars pop up.

The team behind this game releases weekly updates diminishing any game breaking item or glitch.I would buy this game now in order to play with the regualar updates and changing gameplay.

2017-10-19,0,0,712,True,Recommended,Look. I'm not going to tell you this is the best or worst game in existence. The game is fun and challenging and requires a certain degree of dedication to bring yourself up to a satisfactory level of skill. The strategies are different between 1rst person and 3rd person for example and different people enjoy the playstyles of each. This game is currently not a full release title. The optimization isn't there yet. The framerates for those gamers that don't have super computers aren't there yet. Frustration exists but the dev team is hard at work. Can you wait for it? Of course. But should you wait for it? My opinion is no. Buy this game immediately so I can headshot you from a grassy hillock at 500meters with my compensator equiped AKM. Please buy this game immediately so I can mow you down with spray fire with my micro UZI when you think you're all alone. Spend your money now I'm gonna like the way you die.

2017-11-12,0,0,375,True,Not Recommended,While immensely flawed from the begining PUBG brought a new and intense gaming experience like nothing we had ever really seen before.In spite of the bugs and shoddy servers my friend and I put hundreds of hours into the game mostly playing Duo's and now we consistently rank in the Top 50 players on the leaderboards.Sadly in the last few weeks the game has become infested with hackers and Bluehole has expressed no interest whatsoever in taking serious steps to remediate the problem. Based upon the limited available evidence it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5% stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend. So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs. Tencent's stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam stats.While it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz Warz and H1Z1 into irrelevancy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-12,0,0,564,True,Recommended,"Bought this game with intent to refund as it did not run well on my older hardware but got hooked. After playing for a few hours I feel like I can make a reasonably accurate review. Pros I've found Good gameplay not just a mindlessly shoot everyone you see game requires strategical planning in order to get a good rank Amazing map massive island which allows for many styles of gameplay from stealth to maniac Very hard to turn off I just keep playing game after gameSome Cons Runs very slow at higher details on my i7 3770 and GTX660 Now at least a stable 60 80 fps in non crowded areas with ultra textures and max screenscale with Ryzen 5 1600 and GTX 1060 I seem to get quite high input lag a pain when looting and you have to go back to close doors a second time. Gone with PC upgrade although server stress can definitely affect it. Jumping is super buggy. Definitely looking forward to vaulting in a few weeks.Some suggestions set the server finder to default to the last used config instead of NA Solo. Fixed Possibly a sort of ""sandbox"" mode to test weapons and get a hang for the game before playing a match Also a killcam to show who killed you would also be good. The upcoming 2d and 3d replay features will help amazingly.Overall a great game but with a few issues that could be fixed",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-14,0,0,113,True,Recommended,This game from reviews popular opinion and personal opinion has the best potential out of every current battle royale game to succeed. Currently it is buggy choppy and overall unoptimized. Most early access games like this would normally be viewed as a risky investment. However the developers currently seem to have what other early access games don't have. A release date. They also are very committed to their weekly updates with bug fixes and their montly updates with fresh content providing enourmous boosts toward the finished product. The devs seem to actually be working to complete this game at a rapid but successful pace. The investment toward this game at its current state may be risky to some but I say not as the price may increase further down the road of early access during the release of more content or at the final release. In the end if you are buying now don't intend to get the best game of your life and don't expect it to live up to it's hype simply think of buying the early access as a pre order with a discount and playability.

I will go over the Pros first.Pros Good selection of guns they all fit the balance of them.Great map comapred to King of the kill.There are structures all over the map so don't worry about being stranded with no loot.Attachments with the guns make them very good.Fun to play with friendsGreat to play if you are tired with h1z1 king of the kill.Aiming is very well first and thirdpersonCons This game really is solid for the most part but it has some flaws.Cars are pretty useless sometimes because you can not go full speed and get out if you do that you die. (It does add skill to the game though)This game for the most part needs some big performance updates. It needs some optmisation. This game is pretty good for the most part PlayerUnknown did a good job in my opnion.By the way if you can not run this game well Set all you're graphics options to ""VERY LOW"" and turn you're resolution down. Now that should boost some FPS. If you still are getting lag than search on youtube about how to increase FPS I have done that using this video https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 3LG78ItS1ZM&amp t 146s.

Being an Early Access there is quite a few areas that require work but in its current state it is more than playable.If you haven't played an ArmA based game before it may take you a little while to get used to the mechanics of the engine and the weapons. But after a couple of matches you soon adapt to it.Also items you unlock can be sold on the Steam Market some are worth a good amount of money.

2017-08-29,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,I completely regret buying this game. I have never been so bored with a multiplayer experince in my life. You spend most of the game just sprinting towards the safe zone and if you're lucky enough to land in the safe zone you just hide in a bathroom and wait for people to walk by so you can pick them off. I managed to get into the top 3 many times just by laying behind a car for 20 minutes and even managed to get first place a few times. So very boring. It's a perma death game which is fine by me but you die very quickly in most matches and loading a new one will take you about 3 minutes on average. Also the developer is very shady. They snuck micro transactions into the game after many people bought it in early access with a promise of no micro transactions ever being implimanted. The developer also has gotten into the habit of baning players that popular twitch streamers complain about with little to no evidence of actual harrassment leading to many wrongful bans. I deleted this game from my library because I no longer wish to support this developer and I suggest you don't bother even buying it on sale for anything mor than $5.UPDATEBlue Hole is now sueing epic games because they think that owning PUBG gives them the right to every battle royal game in the genre. Do not support these devs in any way. Every bluehole game should be boycotted. They made an inferior far enferior product and instead of improving to compete with fortnite they choose to try and sue them to eliminate the competition in a very facist way.

Considering the competitive nature of the game I really hope that the devs try to fix this issue although all things considered I think it's a really fun game worth picking up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-29,0,0,53,True,Not Recommended,I'd love to give this game a good review however with constant broken promises the ban happy mods and DLC in an early access I just can't. The devs of this game will take the side of a streamer if you just so happen to kill one in game. It's so bad to the point that the devs themselves literally admit the accusation is unprovable. However expect a 7 dat ban if you happen to get so unlucky as to kill a person that's standing in the community. Streamers themselves admit to getting tens of people banned with no evicence on their part other than simply playing the game and them being killed.The DLC for an early access game is simple terrible. They have the audacity to charge $30 for this game (Half the price of triple A yet a fraction of the content). At this point it's clear the devs are more interested in shaking as much money as they can out of the community rather than provide timley content.The devs promised no micro transaction a simple AND keeplable promise yet are somehow unable to do just that. Any promise should be taken with a grain of salt as it's clear they can't even keep the most simple of promises of inaction.Aside from all of this it's a simple map not worth the price tag.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,480,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Having a blast in this game fun attachments and a lot of variety in guns.However Before I get bashed for this realize that I love this game and only want it to improve and since people are writing so many goddamn positive reviews saying this game is awesome and perfect I don't mind people saying its a good game what I do mind is that people are giving it perfect reviews due to the hate towards h1z1 (which I also own) just because this game is better then h1z1 does not mean its perfect. And trust me I enjoy this game quite a lot however there is many improvement to be made like the following The servers are sometimes so bad they will not load in textures.And the game runs ok (this game needs more optimization anyone with a 950 do not buy this game my friends can barley run it at lowest settings)My specs GTX 960 SSC 4gbCPU I5 6600k16gb of ballistic ram.My Battleground Settings Very low shadows High Foliage medium antialiasing Ultra Post processing Render scale 120 Texture Ultra. and an average of 45 to 50 frames.Conclusion This game needs a lot of work and I hope they update and make frequent changes the game is not excused for being early access I take this as a weak shield to deflect critism. This game needs improvements If you have extra money and you don't really know any other games to buy then buy this game as long as you have a 960 or higher (preferably a 970 or 980) and your cpu is a ryzen or i5 intel series. (sorry for any amd gpu users I have no idea what graphics card from amd side runs this game well just look up some videos)Hope this review is helpful and please don't hate this review as I said I only criticize it for improvment.(edit I do enjoy this game BUT MANY GAMES are almost unplayable and so that is why I choose a negative review Its very fun but if im not enjoying half my games then its not worth a positive review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,21,True,Recommended,"First Impressions after 3 hours of gameplay Positive Definitely a very very promising game that already kept me rooted to my seat for 3 hours straight. Did I say It's a LOT of fun especially when you team up with some friends. Gameplay is like DayZ but more fast paced. The map is big but there's a nice feeling of panic and paranoia when the ""green zone"" gets smaller and forces the players to keep moving. Surviving requires a good amount of tactical thinking co operation (if playing with friends) outsmarting your opponents and stealth. Dicking around or choosing your landing point poorly when prachuting from the plane WILL get you killed. There's a decent amount of weapons to be found and you can customize most of them. Each weapon feels different they have different kind of recoil and there's nothing like hitting a half naked guy in the face with a frying pan and taking his Red Bull. Graphics and sounds are nice but there's still room for improvement. Gameplay feels pretty good definitely more smooth than ARMA but there are some moments where it feels a bit clunky. If you die you can just exit the game and join a new one.Negative Dying within the first two minutes still sucks. Had some FPS drops but overall the game runs pretty smoothly on my rig. Luckily the devs are trying to fix this already but those with low to mid range rigs might want to wait for the patch. Didn't run into any game breaking bugs but had to restart it once when the main menu failed to load. The game is fun but needs more content and variety before I can imagine spending +100 hours with it. It can get quite repetitive pretty fast especially if you play solo and lose the tactical squad aspect of the game. It's a bit pricey for early access but after trying it out I don't mind showing the devs some love.My specs Intel i7 6700KGTX107016GB DDR4SSD drives",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-29,0,0,418,True,Not Recommended,"The Game itself isn't that bad of an idea considering what he did on Arma 3 but when you take to account that the game is really buggy and the MPs and Shotguns are really overpowered compared to the Rifles the story chances quite dramatically... I often see myself dying in a situation I know where he will come from me with better gear (M4 Lvl 3 Vest and Helmet) should easily win these kinds of situations but I often just die so much faster from a Vector or UMP that i could rarerly even hit him 2 3 Times... the game isnt really that good yet.

2017-03-28,1,34,118,True,Not Recommended,Let me start off by saying that This is a good game dont get me wrong. But there are many problems to be found in it.1. optimization is little to non existant.(while droping from the plain frame rate can to drop all the way down to 1fps)2. Its either got hacker or really bad netcode.(it takes me a whole mag that has hit with at least 6 bullets to kill someone and takes them 2 shots to kill me with the same weapon)3. The Zone appears to be either 20 feet away from you or 20 miles away thus not giving players a chance to get into the play zone unless they have a car or a boat.4. The lag is there wheather your internet speed is 1000mbps or 500kbps you will encounter lag that makes the game unplayable.(keeps teleporting you back to the same spot you were at 4 seconds ago)NOTE This is a GOOD game but there is still quite a bit of fixing up to do.Conclusion At the game's current state i would not recomend to buy it. i would wait untill they fix some problems.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Playerunkown created the battleroyale mod on arma 3 which i played extensivley and thoroughly enjoyed it was one of a the best mods out there for arma 3. When i heard of battlegrounds being in the works i made sure i had all the updates and i bought it on realease from day 1 i enjoyed this game as much as i enjoyed my 1000+ hours on arma 3 although at first i was running around as a naked little man with no clue of how to do anything. after playing for a good 50 hours i managed to get my first top 5 and i felt like i was the dovakihn having just been chosen by the greybeards. But the best was still to come as i made friends through the community and played in squads and duos experiencing a more immersive and hilarious at the least experience. To put it simply this game is the bomb yes it has its kinks like cars blowing up inside walls and severe lag spikes and fps drops on a rare occurance but for a game in pre release state having only been out for little over 5 months the development team have done an amazing job at balancing gameplay improving performance and adding to the game diversity with guns vehicles and more. if you have some money you dont know what to do with throw it at your computer and buy this game. its worth it to hear all the chatting in the lobby before you enter a game.

Instead theyre pushing micro transaction and other useless stuff that doesnt really improve gameplay. Developers are getting greedy and thats not a good sign for this massively popular game since it would be a down hill from hereupdate 3/23/2018months after i left the first review the developer of this game still have not fixed any of the problems that i have mentioned above. The server is still and laggy people die from my shots after they have hid behind walls and etc. Instead of fixing server problems and hacker problems what did the dev do? Add emotes Add more guns Add more loot boxes for microtransaction Add useless emotes that no one ever uses in the game. If this game was free i would not give it such a harsh review but this game cost 30 bucks since beta about 2 years ago and its in the same state as it was in beta.

2017-07-26,0,0,170,True,Not Recommended,PUBG is a typical battle royale style game. Here's a short rundown of a typical match in case you're not familiar. You start in a plane flying over a large island. You choose when to jump out to skydive/parachute to a location on the map. You don't have any weapons so you're best of looting nearby buildings in search of weapons &amp ammunition kevlar vest &amp helmets and healing items. Every couple of minutes the playable zone on the island gets smaller and smaller. If you're outside this zone you will take damage and eventually die. The objective is to be the last one alive there is no respawn.If you like the battle royale genre you will like this game. Stop reading this review and look up the technical problems and bugs this game has to make sure they're not dealbreakers to you.If you don't like battle royal genre you won't like this game.If you have no idea whether or not you like this genre read on.I personally dislike the battle royale genre and this game does nothing to fix the issues it has. However it is probably the best iteration of that genre on the market right now. It hits that sweet spot between realistic &amp arcadey gameplay. If you've always been curious about this type of game I'd recommend PUBG above H1Z1 or the battle royale mod in Arma 3. This genre can deliver some absolutely thrilling moments but it pales in comparison to the amount of downtime you have to sit through.The 2 main reasons I dislike the genre and as such PUBG are as follows 1) The game does not sufficiently promote interaction between players.A core component of multiplayer games is interacting heavily with your fellow players be it fighting them or cooperating with them. Very few multiplayers games don't do this. PUBG suffers in my eyes because I don't feel compelled to fight other players most of the time. This is a problem because that is the main reason you'd want to play a game like this. You collect weapons armor and so on to use it against others. There are multiple reasons why this problem exists Any kill you get has a very low impact on the total number of remaining players. Even getting 10 kills (which is quite a lot for one round) means there are 89 other people who are still around to kill you.Engaging other players gives away your position and exposes you to attacks from other players.No respawn adds a massive amount of tension to the game but also means that every engagement is very high risk. Even if you are very good at PUBG and you have a 80% chance to win every gunfight you take you only have to lose one of them to lose the entire round.Engaging other players consumes resources such as ammo and healing items. There's no guarantee that you can loot the person you just killed to get that stuff back.You can often times land in locations that won't have many other people in them and loot to your heart's content. If you actively avoid conflict you can make it to the smaller zones almost every single round without having fought any other players while still having good loot. This is probably the most important reason why interaction is easily avoided. You'd expect there to be two types of areas high risk high loot and low risk low loot. However there's a third low risk high medium loot. Why take the risk for high loot items when you can acquire similar gear with lower risk? The balance here is entirely out of whack. 2) The developers are adding microtransactions in their 30 early access game even though they promised they wouldn't until release. gamasutra.com These skins will not be obtainable via ingame currency. i.redd.it I'm not a fan of the CSGO system (even though I've indulged in it to an extreme degree) but the developer doing this even before launch when they explicitly said they wouldn't is enough to turn me off from this game. The only reason I will continue to play it is because my friends won't play anything else. Such is life.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,67,True,Recommended,to preface i haven't been able to play a game for more than 10 minutes in just about a year now because i just lost interest in gaming. After some convincing from my friends i got this. first night i got it we played for 3 hours straight the next day i was off work and school and it was my birthday so i played solo for about 3 4 hours and played squad mode with 3 friends for about 8 hours off and on. this game has that little something you can't explain that makes it so good. It's like when your momma makes dinner and you can taste the love in it. If you're new to this type of game i like to think of it like streamlined DayZ where you cant respawn and the goal is to be the last one alive. the gunplay is great the firefights are intense and whether you play alone or with friends there is always action around the corner and fun to be had. The only bad thing as of now is the optimization like the framerate actually is pretty good once you get past the beginning of the match but in the beginning most of the time when i land i can't get into houses to loot yet because the houses haven't loaded in yet so i just gotta walk around for a minute or so and wait for them to load but i did see that an optimization patch is planned for april 7th.

I was so amazed it was difficult to react after that happened. 8/10 would buy just for the random events that come about in battlegrounds.

Also everygame you play with Wacko60 you will win because he is the best player ever to play PUBG James is trash tho.I would reccomend this game to all friends of wacko60 and or anyone who doesnt have friends who will troll you with grenades.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,1,1,301,True,Recommended,"PUB is the very definition of 'Refinement"" to the Battle Royal Genre. Generally we've seen it been modded into Arma 3 a custom game variant that became H1Z1 King of the Kill to quite a few games just trying it out but PUB takes it to a level that is worth the try.There is Steam Refund for a reason! I haven't played much but from the very few latest patches they have added into it is quite up to the quality we expected in an early access game.FRYING PANS CAN SAVE YOUR . LITERALLY! A simple detail yet worth every penny in a way.Graphics is quite what you expect lush scenery with dense foliage. Quality in textures and though performance isn't it's key currently in the future they promised to address to the performance issues over the course of it's development. Even just to show that performance is being constantly worked on the new latest patch was a big one to help increase performance in alot of areas and so far my experience has had no problems.For the price 29.99$ I think it is a STEAL! This game can soon eventually turn into something bigger and better within the coming 6 8 months. It's understandable why you would want to wait but I believe you would enjoy the experience now along side with us in this wacky NOT Softcore nor Hardcore Battle Royal Game. It is a well polished game from a Early Access View (Suprisingly!) and all it's general mechanics work. Sure rage moments will happen but the game makes you feel ""Aw it was just a game no biggie losing"" but would still make you want to go for the feeling of ""ONE. MORE. ROUND!"".A fun shooter to enjoy with friends up to 3 to join you in a Battle Royal.#DamFukinWorthIT",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-17,0,0,107,True,Recommended,More refinements are needed.Good Points 1. The Creative way and Unique experience of battle especially with friends.2. Intense Gameplay.Bad Points 1. The Optimization sucks. My laptop with Geforce 960m graphic card can only run the lowest quality with 48FPS. You kidding me? Everytime I play this game The garbage textures and models make me feel disguested. If the superior laptop can only play with garbage graphics how about other laptop players? Do they need to buy Alienware? My laptop is able to play Overwatch with epic graphic 60FPS but PUBG enables me to cook eggs on my laptop! Besides I noticed that usually when I move from one big area to another my screen just paused for a second because it need to load new staff on the map. It would be a big problem if I was in a fight.2. THE WAITING TIME SUCKS. Everytime I died I have to wait for 8Mins to go back to the battleground again. And the possibility of being killed at the very beginning is 6 out of 10. Even if you survived the first few minutes you died easily with no kills or only 1 or 2 kills unless you are very good at playing this game. Besides This game is not a game for hiding sometimes people got shot from nowhere and the direction is not clear when you get shot. So I mean what really sucks is YOU LOOT THINGS FOR HUNDREDS OF HOURS and SHOOT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES and EVERYTHING IS GONE IN A SECOND and sometimes you don't know who killed you where he was and how did he do it...These are the things that the player need to know after they died in the game. But the camera just faces the ground leaving the confusion and disappointment to the player. 3. The server sucks. It's laggy sometimes when I was killing someone. Sometimes the server just dont response when I was going back from the game to the main menu so I have to open the task manager and the task manager doesn't work because I can't click on it. So I can only restart my computer everytime this thing happens.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-17,0,0,38,True,Recommended,This game can be just as frustrating to play as it is fun. You can land out of the plane and die within 20 seconds or you can survive longer hunting for all the weapons and ammo in the world only to be taken out whilst having your inventory open or by that annoying blue field of death. Yes its a great way of making players zone into one area for more action but come on does it have to continue all the way down to a few feet in diametre! why not use the zoning area until there is say 20 players left in still a decent size area to continue being tactical without having to just dash out in the open because of that frustrating blue field. I know this is so far just a battleroyal style game but I hope they somehow introduce other game modes/ways of playing in the final release because this game is getting repetative already after 10 hours of play. few other things id like to see in the final product. killcam replay. option to watch the rest of the game until the end. better customization of player.Overall worth playing altho im not convinced its worth 26.99.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,293,True,Recommended,As of right now this game is great! For early access and being out for less than a week I can say that this game is going places and can probably replace H1Z1 eSports. However and I know that this is a fresh out of the oven game I don't think that this game should be like Battlefield 1 and 'require' a 6700k/7700k processor in order to run smoothly. I have an i7 4790k processor that has been in my computer for roughly 2 years and I feel that that alone should be able to run this game at a decent rate. The key thing here is optimization as I also have run into plenty of bugs that either won't load buildings/entities properly or just kill my game completely. In conclusion this game has plenty of potential and is already quite enjoyable but it needs time.PS Also every single time I've run into these types of serious bugs I've been playing solo. The worst I've gotten while playing duos was just really bad FPS.TL DRPros Great ideaMassive potentialNice balance of community and competitive scenesWAAAAAAYY better than H1Z1 could ever dream of beingLeaderboards!Cons O P T I M I Z A T I O NHeavy lag at the start of every gameConstant FPS drops 100ms worth of lag whenever I try to pick up somethingSolo games are bug infested (for me anyways)A bit steep on the price at $36.99 CADSuggestions If PU were to add OPTIONAL MICROTRANSACTIONS (which they might have to as you need a continuous revenue stream on games) either make them marketable or make them very inexpensive (50 cents to $1).Alright thats gonna do it.

The amount of hackers that are rolling in seriously about 7 of 10 of my games have someone either aim botting or speed hacking. Speed hacking is by far the most rediculous as you can't even hit the person yet alone make sure to not blink otherwise you won't see them. I know this is a beta game but if you don't take action now on the hackers or put on some sort of guard like other games do where the servers can predict you're hacking if the people are using certain programs. I'm starting to dislike the game now and you can't say no one is hacking when I've come across multiple speed hackers.

2017-07-25,1,1,963,True,Recommended,Going to keep a short review for this one I'm sure many know the details of the game and if you don't just check out some youtube videos which will help you!. This game I'm going to say is worth the money not just because it's a fun and realistic FPS game but you know the devs are behind their title and are listening to OUR feedback. Which in todays gaming industry that's a luxury! one that I think the moaning babies who play this forget. You have multiple world wide servers to choose from so it caters to players all over pretty much you can play alone double team or squads with your friends which is always fun and eventful!. It's a great game with a fantastic mix of realism fun and some seriously nail biting moments. There are issues with the game but they're being stamped out and none that I need to point out in the game. My biggest issues are actually just how the game is played and thankfully the devs are adding things to basically help players like myself who don't enjoy the 3rd person aspect all the time. So soon for this game is the 1st person mode which restricts you from going 3rd person and leaves you only with your front view of your weapons. This is much morer realistic and changes the game almost completely in terms of how it's played No more cheese players hiding behind walls unseen and being able to watch you then pop you in the back of the head. You will be forced to peek a corner if you want to see what's around it making for a much more tense experience. Basically that's my only issue and it's not really something I find an issue it's just I wish I had the 1st person game mode option and as I mentioned it's being added!. So if you do this game you have many many hours to put in and not only for enjoyment but if you're competitive you'll want to really master your gun skill in this game and you will feel yourself improving as time goes on. Which is a great feeling and it's awesome when you rack up the kills and win. There's allot coming to this game and If you buy it You wont regret it!.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It gets hectic you learn your personal playstyleWhat weapons are considered OP by yourself what isntStrategies to win etc.For awhile youll likely be frustrated I didnt win my first match until last night made consistent top 10s never that number one until I got into a duo with a friend of mine together her and I killed 12 of those players even 6 a piece.Things that would be useful picking what maps you see. I cant stand the desert map. Maybe change how the whole firing through windows thing goes if we spot a player in our secluded area why cant we crouch tall enough to fire through a window instead of the darn windowsill? no logic guys!All in all wonderful game ill likely play it for a very long time but there will be a point the game dies so the devs should look into a form of 'offline' mode where it spawns 99 other bots instead of varied skillI know its alot of work but these are wonderful devsGLWS PlayerUnknownEveryone else I look forward to seeing you in game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The whole survival aspect of this game makes it a lot more about tactics than ability to point and spam your clicker. The map is huge so it's easy to forget that the game starts with 100 players but this also means that it sometimes lacks action until later in the game once the playing field gets smaller.Solo mode is good but would strongly recommend starting out with a team of (at least) 2 players even if just to get used to the map.Still in early access so I'm sure it has plenty more changes to be made.

2017-07-28,0,0,238,True,Not Recommended,I really liked PUBG originally but with the announcement of Microtransactions (which I'm not going to cover here because other reviewers have already said everything that needs to be said about that.) I decided to write this due to a post I saw on the PUBG subreddit that made me want to vomit. To summarize this briefly a guy and his friend were playing PUBG and made the mistake of killing two streamers. The streamers got upset and accused the guy of stream sniping and then the streamer's viewers went and reported him for the alleged offense. He was then handed a 7 day ban. He claims that he had no idea who these guys were and wasn't stream sniping. Whether or not he was stream sniping really doesn't matter all that much. What does matter is that even though there is no way to prove someone is stream sniping the developers still banned this guy because they value the opinions of twitch streamers over everyday customers. So if you decide to purchase this game be aware that you are rolling the dice every time you shoot at someone or throw a grenade because if it happens to be a popular streamer you can look forward to a 7 day ban.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-06,0,0,18,True,Recommended,"Going into PUBG you're probably thinking Oh this is that H1Z1 and Arma gametype. You're right!It's got some improvements over the old and some areas still not improved to where expected. Theres three official game types and a number of custom server types. I'll cover the pros and cons per section Squad CombatThis is the most played type. You can que up officially as Solo Duo or Squads of 4 (You will be auto paired if you quo for a team by yourself) drop into a map find weapons try to survive. You will compete against other players and/or squads to do this and often will drop into an area with others and immediatly have to try to fight or flight your way out of it. There is some meta to what to grab what attachments to prioritize etc. But it comes down to a hair of luck and a hair of skill. Communication with your team mates is vital using map pings and Voip (Ingame voice communication exists too.) In custom modes they can alter weapons to specific types or all melee or no weapons at all! Allowing for some forced creativity on victory.Pros High Adrenaline fun push you to the edge of your seat as you go from calm and collected to panicking each time a shot whizzes past your head. Relatively stable servers while there will be some graphical glitches or lag at times I've never exprienced a full ping drop or server crash that wasn't a private server. Lots of weapons to pick from and learn what guns work for you while making due with weapons you despiiizzzeee.Cons There is friendly fire which often means a team mate can just kill you for fun because you have a gun they want or you're the odd man out on a three man group. Or because they wanna ruin their team's fun and run it one man. They can even do it because they are just racist/prejudice trolls. Sometimes you will die to nothing or to complete lag. You can duck past a corner and be in the clear but because on the other's screen you're still in view... Well pop goes the weasel. Custom servers are usually terrible to join. Mostly because its 80% randoms against a team who work together with voip and set up the map's rules so they know EXACTLY what will be in play just not where.ZombiesRecently added and only avaliable as a custom mode. A team of humans must survive against a near hundred zombies. Zombies get no means of protecting themself but are legion. They can break doors but pickup no items. Players still follow the standard rules. Compared to normal this is a different approach but without good co ordination becomes a cat and mouse game where the zombies get scattered and have no idea where humans are until they get picked off.Sadly I can not pro/con this as currently it is just a heavilly flawed gametype. As it's a custom mode usually the humans will all be the creator and his friends. If you EVER get to be the human consider yourself blessed. Following that you're going to experience the same as normal modes but with a massive handicap. Zombie teams teamkill CONSTANTLY. They don't seem to care they will teamkill each other then other zombie teams until the humans get a free win. Threats of being banned off the custom server fall empty since they will either not be banned or just find a new server to troll on. In it's current state I suggest ignore.Overall the game is high tension fun and despite my gripes I heavilly enjoy it. Even when I get TK'd and have to watch my team and grin when they get whats coming to them.Suggestions for the devs Remove Team Damage. Theres far too many teamkillers and currently it serves no real purpose to be able to kill your own team. There is no reprocutions for it pre made teams are using it to farm items and weapons off of a single pug who they will drop in a heartbeat Zombie mode is incredibly flawed because of the TK happy zombies. In most situations a player won't intent to hurt their team mate and accidentally shooting them is rare. But its become incredibly frustrating to que up get in game then drop just to get to play for five minutes before your own team mate shotgun blasts you in the head because you picked up the Vector or because they think you're going to weight them down later. Fix Zombies. Right now it is virtually UNPLAYABLE for anyone but the humans. Zombies have no way to universally communicate with each other they kill each other all the time (see above) and end up running around aimlessly. Atleast restrict the map faster or add some kind of indication for all zombies to see whenever a human player is spotted by a zombie. OR Increase zombie melee damage because right now its pointless to try to gank a human as one squad. Optional Punish teamkillers. Accidental purpose doesn't matter. If there is a punishment its currently not working. Lock them out of games for awhile after a teamkilling make them unable to use two primaries something. Right now no one cares no one has insentive to stop. I'm fine with accidentally being sniped or being shot over good reason by a teammember. But when its not even the first five minutes and I get gunned down from behind and when I ask why their logic being and I quote ""Thanks for the sniper ."" then being gunned to death mode... Yeah thats going to kill you in longivity quickly.Overall Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a fun game in early development still that I do recommend you buy. The Dev team do listen to the complaints and criticism and even add things based on popular demand but you will be facing a lot of headaches going forward. You will not win often but when you do it will be the sweetest victory.Also? boats. Just 'm.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-09,1,1,204,True,Recommended,Addicting af. The game is super intense and very tactical. Its in early access and i cant wonder what this game will be when its released fully. The main issue with this game are the bugs and crashes and stupid servers it is in early access so i guess these will be there. Thing I learnt playing this game is China no 1. Happy gaming folks,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-04,0,0,406,True,Recommended,A game that is well worth the money even in the early access stage furthermore I have never known a game where after I died I was happy to sit and watch my squad play on the tension and nervous adrenaline rush you get from watching is almost the same as when you are playing and for those in the know the smaller that circle gets the higher the tension grows.

2017-06-29,0,0,1094,True,Recommended,Amazing game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-12,2,1,94,True,Not Recommended,"Let's get things straight. I had 90 hours on the closed beta and got pretty worn out of it. I had 20 wins as solo 15 wins duo a 6 win streak with a buddy and a high of a 12 kill win (SOLO that was actually the WR in EU servers for a short peroid of time). All of these games came from hundreds of played games of course. I enjoyed the time I played and decided to play a couple months later(present day) but I came to the realization that this game was very repetative and was lacking something. I could go on to say stupid uneducated things about this game (and how the silencer is too strong in such a tactically filled game ) but I've summed it up to be 99% faith in yourself 1% actual chance (this is not actual but exaggerated). Out of the 100 players all of them have an equal and similar opportunity to dome you from somewhere you have no idea to find a better gun then you in the early game and to sneak up behind you (maybe that is the beauty of the game itself)? Problem is there is little to no skill gap in the game. The learning curve for this game is pretty simple. Doesn't take much of a player to point at click at a guy who is running in a field because the zone wasn't in his favor or he was ""unlucky."" However My reasoning for this game not requiring a lot of skill is in the Early Mid game where you have to loot. You can get killed because of the luck in the early game due to someone finding a M4 them finding a vest a helment (etc) and you only finding a pistol. However on the opposite side of the spectrum if you kill the person with the M4 that took skill. Skill is when you actually kill someone who has better loot than you or you get ""lucky"" and see the other player before they see you. We can all agree most of the kills in this game can be broken down into one sentence You see the person first or they see you. I mean at the E3 interview the interviewer made a comment saying ""Thank you for experiences for both the joy of winning and well the joy of a bullet flying through my head from no where and i'll never know why."" Brendan Green's response? ""You got to love and enjoy the salt."" This game is getting a reputation of exactly what I am pointing out. This game is almost too tactical to a point where if forces you to camp because you don't want to die you know? You don't want to be seen so you elimante the factor of sight. On the other hand the game doesn't reward risky players or players who run out in open fields and push houses to kill players.Aggresive players 9/10 times die because the game is meant for a slower pace. So lets take the top 10 players. They are the best they play tactically well and they know when to be aggresive and when not to be. The ""average"" win ratio of the TOP 10 PLAYERS IN THE GAME is 16%. Meaning out of about 6 games if you are ""one of the best"" you will win 1 game. Obviously you aren't going to win every game and thats not the arguement i'm making. I am simply stating that to win and actually enjoy the ""chicken dinners"" is going to take (statistically) 6 games which compliments my argument of stating that most of the wins come down to luck. Now the late game is just positioning based off luck on where the zone closes. There is no arguing that. Late game you have loot it all comes down to these last couple zones. If you were lucky enough to get this far then your death will be even more frustrating because you've just played for 30 minutes looting camping killing 3 4 players who you either saw first or killed because they were unlucky or dumb players exposing themselves. Then boom your dead. Try again next time! But but what about the insane clips of people killing people from hundreds of meters away? I agree that took skill. You don't see that very often HOWEVER it took an immense amount of luck for those conditions and factors to perfectly align hence the reason those clips are highlighted. What's next... you can't have perfect positioning in this game. Period. UNLESS you are lucky. Your chances are SIGNIFICANTLY increased if the zone closes around you. I mean it's a video game at the end of the day personally I don't want to loot for 45 minutes and then end up in a top 5 situation where I get domed into the back of the head where I have no counter play too. Unless however you get a level 3 helment which is rare unless you search tons of houses to find it. But then whats the point of level 1 and level 2 helments if you can get domed from an uncommon gun (Kar)? You can't predict the zone and maybe that is why this game is intriguing? It's all chance. In the end if you enjoy doing the same looting over and over again and dying hundreds of times to get 5 10 wins you'll enjoy this game. I only see the game as a game to play with friends otherwise don't play the game. My recommendation is to wait a year or so before the game is completely finished. Maybe it will be more enjoyable then. I' not going to pull the ""buggy"" card because thats unlogical and plain stupid considering going into buying the game we know that it is an early access however the game as it is is buggy and needs work. Not to mention the cheaters but that will get fixed soon. I just giving my honest opinion and you can take it how you want to but I don't expect a lot of good responses considering how ""brain washed"" everyone is about this game. Obviously my opinion isn't the right one but it is defiantly relatable.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have had so many genuinely intense moments playing this game that I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters. The gunplay is well done and the options of gear keeps the game interesting from match to match. In my 40 hours of play I have had two crashes and a handful of instances where the opening menu bugs out. I have not encountered any of the server issues that several people seem to have problems with. I do have to run the game on low settings to get a smooth framerate but it still looks decent. Still requires some heavy optimization but so far I haven't lost due to anything I would consider unfair. Personally no deal breakers here because the gameplay is phenomenal.Get it if You like intense pvpYou enjoy gaming moments that leave your heart pounding and jitteryYou like strategizing about how to approach situationsDon't get it if You need a polished/bug free experienceYou're a sore loser (you will ""lose"" a majority of your matches)As long as you can accept that this game is being worked on and it isn't perfect you will have some truly amazing experiences.

2017-04-23,0,0,569,True,Recommended,This is my first battle royale game so I can't really compare it to other games from the same genre. The game is very intense and not for anyone who is easily frustrated by deaths. Any small mistake can give you away and firefights have high stakes since you can die very quickly. Regardless of me being a newcomer the game is incredibly fun and rewarding when you manage to last into the later stages of the game. There is a thrill in luckily finding some good loot or killing someone with really good loot. The systems and basic flow of the game can easily be learned in two or three matches tops and everything is streamlined into looking at the map and managing your inventory.The only cons I can really give are that the performance is pretty bad. You have to tweak many settings to medium or low in order to make it run smooth. It can still get choppy at times but overally it's decently stable and playable it just won't look like Crysis or anything. The devs have been continually working and will continue to work on performance optimization as this is an early access game. It doesn't hinder my enjoyment of the game.Overall it's a really great game and if you're even slightly interested after watching someone stream it on Twitch or something definitely pick it up. P.S. I've only played it solo and it still manages to be fun must be even funner with a duo or squad.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-02,0,0,126,True,Recommended,Was anticipating this game ever since it was all over twitch. I came from mostly playing H1Z1 kotk and since have unistalled that game. Not that it's a bad game but I just enjoy this one so much more I never desire to play H1 anymore. This game plays more tactically and slower paced so keep that in mind. If you want a more arcadey fast paced twitchy shooter you should probably get H1. If you want a more slow paced game this is for you. While it is still early access it feels great. A new patch jsut recently came out which gave me about a 20 fps boost. The game feels great and when you die you dont feel like its because of BS but simply beacause the other player was better in that situation. I can't wait to see how the developers continue to improve this game. Seems like the only way is up. $30 well spent!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,474,True,Not Recommended,"Extremely buggy. PUBG has killed me so many times because of stupid bugs. When i join the game nothing seems to load fast enough and i get like 1 15 fps for a period of like 10 seconds to 2 minutes. I have a gtx 1060 enough ram and a good cpu so this shouldent be happening. This happens like right when i touch the damn ground so i either get killed right away or have to sit there waiting for the world to load. Also after playing a few games the loading screen simply freezes and I have to Cntrl+Alt+Dlt and sign out for my PC to do anything. Since the new update terrible things have happended. My game crashes almost every game halfway through. It either says ""Your files are corrupted"" or simply crashes without notice. Its literally the most annoying thing ever. I tried almost every *FIX* youtubers have reccomended but none of em have worked. For some stupid reason these bugs arent there first priority and the devs decided to add FPP and other gay guns before they fixed these bugs AND the devs lied about microtransactions. BUT the game itself is extremely good and very addicting at that. The devs have listened to the community (Somewhat) and have fixed and added great new mechanics in the last few months.

2017-06-06,1,1,112,True,Recommended,I will cut right to the chase. I have searched far and wide for a game like this... The tactical play style with just enough action to keep you on your feet and your mind engaged. This game is truly a test of mental strategy from the very beginning dropping out of the plane at a point at which you choose (I find this better than H1's system of random drops) to the end game with your heart racing as you search around you for other players. I very much enjoy the game even in the slightly buggy state it's in. As someone who has played countless clones of this style of game I can assure you this is the very best implementation of the battle royale system on steam. Period. I can't wait to see where player unknown takes it from here.

2017-06-29,0,0,171,True,Recommended,I'd like to start off by saying the dev team really deserve a pat on the back for the dedication towards monthly updates that have been slowly but surely improving the game. Playing with friends really brings out the fun in this game. Tactical teamplay solid communication and using the games mechanics to your advantage (3rd person) are all important factors when going on your adventure in the motherland. Theres always funny moments and derpy times so its not always so serious. Where as solo litteraly gives you paranoia. Constantly thinking you saw someone in the distance only to realise it was a lonely bush. Then BANG a bullet litteraly flies past that naive little head of yours causing you to jump in your seat and litterally yourself. One of the few games Ive played which really gets your adrenaline pumping when the time comes.I couldnt recommend this game more pretty good acoustics a half decent weapon balance (atm) adrenaline pumping and forces players to constantly adapt to their environment. 8/10....and its only in Beta,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-13,0,0,148,True,Not Recommended,Firstly I'll get this out of the way I HIGHLY recommend to play with friends the game is much more bearable especially since the amount of camping is generally reduced. The solo experience is absolute trash.95+% of the time you're running around looking for a high powered scope some medkits that particular attachment you're missing...The rest is somewhat evenly split among * actually shooting others* getting oneshot by somebody camping the whole match in a room with a shotgun* getting disconnected by some random errors or crashes* losing half your health when leaving a car going at 10kmh* getting hit behind cover thanks to the great netcode (I'm afraid to find out what the tick rate is...)Overall I found it very repetitive and frustrating each death feels like I've wasted the whole time especially when it happens before you fire a single shot.Especially the melee fighting is completely broken I kept punching people sitting still and could barely hit them... and when hits register the feedback (blood splatter) appears after 1 2 seconds. Needs a LOT of work.Yes it's alpha I know I know. BUT I review the product as it is now (it's marked as EA review) If it improves I'm happy to modify my review even though I doubt the core gameplay will change which is my biggest gripe.So far the devs seem to have been quite productive but I'm very skeptical of Early Access games these days.

It's addicting and you can have alot of fun with it. The Micro transactions are for a limited time with the crate costing 1.90 ($2.50) to open. It is getting constant updates and they are looking after the game. It is nothing like CSGO that Thrives off Micro Transactions sometimes costing 100's and 100's of dollars/pounds to get a knife or gloves for example you get crates For free just like Overwatch you get loot boxes by playing the god damn game...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-16,0,0,185,True,Recommended,Death by someone a kilometer away with a sniper rifle and a 15X scope is exactly what i call fun especially when I don't even know if thats how I died. I could have been killed by a bird that got a lucky shot in with its s h i t. I could even have been killed by a gentle f u k k i n g breeze for all i know. I'm not going to lie though. This game is extremely fun to play. You feel acomplished when you kill a person and even getting down to the last few people is the most tense experience i've ever had. So if you want to constantly be asking yourself how you died or how you can empty your clip into a persons chest but they turn and kill you instantly with a single head shot then this is the game for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The devs really put in the effort to make the game better than it was on earlier builds of the game. The devs listen to the players which makes it all the more fun and better to play in the long run.

2017-05-27,0,0,542,True,Recommended,iv spent a decent amount of hours playing this game. there a few things i would recommend fixing starting with the small bumbs everywhere tht if you drive your vechcal over you either flip your car up side down screwing your self or you fly 10 feet up in the air and take dmg when you land.. or you just stop completly and ofc there will be some dude with a sniper that one shots you gg. next circle rng for people that don't what it is it's where either you have to push towards the circle while the other players don't need to move good rng for them rng for you.. not the best explenation but what ever google it. 2 suggestion to fix this would be either increase the time left for circle to move on the last few circles or reduce the damge the circle does on the last few circles so you actully have time to move or engage in fights and not be complety screwed because the circle went to the opposite end of where you where at.. last thing i would fix about this game are the shotguns. for thoes that haven't played the game shotguns are the only gun in the game that let you one shot someone regardless of gear if your range of them it doesn't matter if you shoot them in the head or the chest it's a one shot.. some time they might require two shots but only if they shoot you in the leg or something.. for clarification the only other guns that one shot people are sniper rifles that require you to get a headshot in order to one shot if you don't get a headshot then it can take up to 3 shots to kill someone getting a headshot with a sniper rifle is pretty difficult especially if the target is moving so it does require a decent amount of effor however the shotgun requires no effort what so ever it's broken and encourages camping (where someone will just sit in a room all round waiting for someone to open the door) (you have no idea how many times iv spent 20 mins getting kills a tun of good loot just to get one shot by some dude with no gear who sat in a cornor of a dark room and one shot me as soon as i opened the door) getting one shot by a shotgun isn't fun it's probably the worst feeling you will get playing this game knowing you just got killed with the eaiset op gun in the game tht takes no effort no skill what so ever and you couldn't do a dam thing to stop it .. (not taling about the people who run around houses with shotguns hunting you down you could do something about that but the people that sit in rooms waiting for you to open the door ) it's suggestion i would make nerf all the shotguns so you can never be one shot by a shotgun when you are at full health with lvl 1 armor and helmet currently from what i have experinced iv been one shot with level 2 armor and helmet at full health makes no difference which is tbh. fix these changes and the game is golden super fun addicting and overall just a great battle royal.p.s sorry about the bad grammer im scottish and i don't give a .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,51,True,Recommended,"Playerunknowns Battlegrounds is the latest and that much i can say in advance most likely the best last man standing multiplayer shooter that has been made so far. This game with it's overall simple but well executed fun concept kind of reminds of playing a round of Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros when I parachute out of the plane. Just playing the game for the fun of it. That is the way of playing I enjoy this game the most just jump in go ham have some laughs and when it's over just jump into another game. Solo games are great for both very relaxed OR very aggressive game play. Duos can get very intense at some times and squad is prollly my favorite due to it being the most tactical approach if played properly. Needless to say that goofing around in a squad is also going to make up for the most hilarious moments like having your squads car explode 2 seconds after you ran over a full team of 4. For an Early Access game this one performs actually quite well. Gunplay already feels fluid and comfy while perfectly nailing the sweet spot between realistic and arcade style gunplay. Everything works very intuitive and self explaining impactful and right f.e. weapon attachments you find actually do give slight advantages in reload time mag capacity or stability. In the near future the game will also have a shooting range for you to test out any gun available in the game. Developers confimed that the final game will have full Steamworks support in 6 months when it leaves Early Access meaning full modding support for long lasting re playability. Also the price tag will stay the same which will help to keep out a good chunk of people using cheats in the long run. BattlEye is running already and I do consider it to be a not so useless Anti Cheat since it caught me quite fast when I scripted a bit with a paid bypass back in Arma 2 days.My overall verdict for the game as of March 2017 is an 8.5/10... with the potential to become a 9/10 game depending on how development goes during Early Access and what kind of content will get added or altered what issues might come up etc.So you might ask ""Is it a must buy then?"" or ""is it worth 30 bucks?"" Well if you ever thought that ""100 people fighting each other to death last man standing style alone or in teams of up to 4 on a massive map"" could be fun then yes it absolutely is! It really does not matter at all whether your mindset is competitive and your aim is to climb the leaderboards or if you just casually wanna get some frags and fun this game manages to cater to both audiences. Hence why it is so popular with 50k players daily on Steam and about 90k viewers on twitch constantly being the 2nd most watched game after LoL for a week now since steam release... these numbers tell us a lot about how enjoyable and entertaining it is to play (and watch) this game despite it's beta like development stage. We shall see how Early Access goes and what game we get then. If major things change I may update this review at release. Warning If you do suffer from low frustration tolerance and feel bad or even get mad about dying many times in a video game though I highly recommend staying away from PUBG.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You then get teleported to an airplane where you framerates drop despite your computer being half decent3. You now press CTRL + T muting the screaming Russians so you can actuallly focus on where you want to drop4 At this point you can either Jump out into the first main city and hope you don't get killed by some lucky piece of who gets an AKM as their first item Jump down at a small town and hope you get something that isn't a crossbow5. After getting your (hopefully) good loot you decide to either Play aggressive af and hunt down everything that moves Play like a wussy and try to survive with your gear6. Depending on your playstyle 2 things can happen Aggressive playstyle You actually get a kill and while looting your victim you get shot in the head by some camper who got a kar from the supply drop and has the 15x scope equippedWussy playstyle You have now been hiding for the whole game and there is 5 players left you hear shots nearby and think ""Hey I might actually win this I can go on ahead kill the guy who is low on health get good and win"" and while you're on your way to cleanup the battle that has been going on a few meters from you you will get shot by the other kid who also has been hiding the whole game behind a tree7. You died and you're filled with rage complaining over the newbie playstyle that got you killed but later you realize that you played either played the exact same way or would've played the exact same way if you had the opportunity to do so.8. You now start to think what the meaning of life is. You just wasted 20 minutes of your life and you decide to take a break from the game9. 15 minutes later you return after having seen a pro player easily nailing down 11 players (Referring to www.youtube.com/aculite) 10. You're filled with hope and you're joining a new game thinking that you learned a new way to play but you just can't seem to play properly and the exact same things happen again...This is unfortunately the sad truth of the tough life that many PUBG players experience everyday.Anyways 10/10 would recommend despite the lag and desync the game has (Yes I do know the game is in development) but hopefully this will be fixed in the future updates.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Breaking promises to your customers leads to other promises you can break and my review will remain negative until they remove the transaction. I recommend not buying until early access is over or they drop the price.Also $30 for a battle royale game with one map and one game mode is ridiculous.

Although only being released for a week the game is already less broken than H1Z1 and has received more relevant updates than DayZ has in over 3 years of Early Access. As expected from an Early Access game its optimization isn't great however if you don't mind decreasing the video settings the game is perfectly playable in a competetive environment on any mid high end machine. The developers have posted a clear development plan for the coming months of optimization and patches. If you're pondering upon purchasing the game as you're worried about performance on low mid range machines I suggest you wait a couple of weeks for the game to become more optimized.Overall great game!! 10/10 IGN D,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Turns out by swimming across the river to make the circle I had snuck up behind a guy who had probably done the same thing purely by accident.Only instead of KAR98ing this peasant in the back of the head I came to the conclusion that a silent pan death was more suitable and entertaining end to his life.

2017-04-05,0,0,45,True,Recommended,not an indepth review here but imo its better than h1z1 dayz and arma 3 combined because it incoroporates elements from all of those games the scavenging of dayz the pace of h1z1 and the tactical format of arma 3. so basically its perfect if you like those games. people are crying that its buggy and poorly optimized or whatever and... it is. but thats because IT JUST CAME OUT.devs will be improving it over time. i wouldnt recommend unless you have a really good cpu and gpu because i have gtx 1060 SC and i5 3350P 3.1ghz and 8gb ram (none of which are not top end but still very good). with that i get 50 70 fps on very low settings which is really bad. i get 25 40 on normal. so i really hope this changes in the future. that said if you can get around 60fps on very low then will be fine. overall its a fantastic game. it is exactly what i want for this type of survival game. they finally got it right.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Gunplay is done very well to me it feels similar to the gunplay of Rainbow Six Siege. If you enjoy hardcore battle royal games you wont find a better one.

2017-05-12,0,0,332,True,Recommended,"I've had more memorable moments in this game than any I can think of so far everything that happens whether bad or good is enjoyable. My heart has almost jumped out of my chest a couple of times while playing Battlegrounds and my hands have got jittery with excitement and adrenaline almost every game. When I die I don't get angry and want to ragequit usually it was my own mistake that got me killed rarely the game. I usually just want to try again and so I do.This game has massive potential in fact out of any like it I believe it has the greatest potential. It has a seriously sound team behind it and even though it's in early access it is more enjoyable than most ""complete"" games in my library.Solo is great probably the most heart attack inducing but you feel you're there in the game for every second you stay alive. Duo's and Squad games are where it's all at though in my opinion. The amount of fun you can have making plans and running circles around enemies in this high pressure environment with others is ridiculous it's just a giant sandbox of death and it works perfectly. The future updates to come sound very exciting too so this game is on a path to success I think.I love it I probably won't stop loving it. You can love it too now go.

With a variety of weapons and vehicles and many different approaches to every situation Playerunknows Battlegrounds (PUBG) succeeds are providing an enticing experience no matter how it is played with every round being a different story. From getting everything you need in one building and dieing because of the boundry to only finding a pistol a motorbike and a trusty Frying pan (pick those up they are the best defence) and having an airdrop deliver you to victory. In a group when one of you is put down to 0 hp you get put in a ""fight for life"" scenario in which you are forced to crawl around on your knees until your either reived by a teammate or are dropped by the opposing players. Of course if neither of these happen you just fall over dead but cross that bridge when you get there.The community is just as crazy with the classic sayings ""CHINA #1"" and ""Angus get on skype!"" every time you wait for the countdown you will get a good laugh from someone.

Not only is PUBG better than H1Z1 in almost every way but its even a more mature looking game over H1Z1.

It is now very prone to freezing full blown crash to desktop sometimes requiring a full restart enable the PUBG.exe client down as you can t shut it down via task manager.I've lost count of how many crashes I've had when I have been on decent runs / kill streaks only for the game to crash.

2017-08-27,0,0,43,True,Recommended,pros The gamepay is solid feels smooth and doesn't feel clunky like other survival games within this genre. For example like games like Dayz but this may be different by the time you read this review. The gameplay also changes pace quite often sometimes fast and sometimes slow The graphics are great in this game. The map is very well designed with urban areas and small towns and villages to open fields and hills allowing players to make the most of the weapons that i have if they wish to snipe from a hill top they can if they see a drop and choose to snipe from a distant hill they most likely can The last point that i mentioned makes the game very tense because you know there could be a player around any or every corner.Cons As it currently stands of the date 27/08/2017 the game is not worth the price point of 26.99. As it stands the game doesn't have a whole lot of content don't get me wrong i love the game but i would much prefere a price point of around 15 in my opinion. The performance in this game can be quite poor at times. But it's not as bad as it used to be and it is evident that the devs are trying to improve the performance. Glitches with rendering buildings can occur quite often in this game although some players never seem to get them. and some do regardless of specs so it seems to be luck.In conclusion this game is fantastic i would recommend this game however if the game is ever on sale then buy it as fast as you can!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-01,0,0,906,True,Not Recommended,Just played two games in a row with hackers.. this is starting to become pretty rediculous. Why even have leaderboards if most of the people towards the tops (all of Solo top 10) are hackers. Wasted 20 minutes looting boths games and getting set up to be killed by someone who shouldnt be allowed to play the game. I have a lot of hours put into this game and enjoy it a lot BUT they should not be worried about vaulting when they need to get rid of the hackers. The game also needs A LOT of optimization to be done. Amazing concept I just am extremely disapointed that they have not tackled these problems when it is one of the most popular games played presently,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-15,0,0,351,True,Recommended,MIDGET PORNNow that I have your attention THE GAME IS AWESOME!Of course it has a lot of things to improve (Performance vehicles weapons etc.) but you need to know that the game is in its early access stage. It's going to be developed and changed as we play and submit our feedback!Found a bug? Report it.Have an idea? Submit your idea.The core of all Early Access games is that WE are part of the game as testers and with any cool ideas. If the bugs or if those ideas don't ever leave our mind they are probably going to die in our memory.Don't be afraid to buy this game as I said before it's AWESOME! But you have to know that you will find bugs and performance leaks. Don't ever EVER buy an early access if you want a full stable game.One of the main concerns of players was the lack of updates but let's be honest... the game updated almost two times a week after it's release. Some weeks passed away and after a lot of new and cool items of the agenda were done they decided to take a break. People sometimes get angry because of that but I think that's no problem.

2017-05-05,0,0,117,True,Recommended,The Battle Royale / Hunger Games Simulator you always dreamed of... though a bit rough around the edgesDumb name great concept.Buggy jank riddled execution of a concept so brilliant at its base that this game shines regardless of its issues.It will crash to your desktop and when you open it again you'll still be in the same party you were before it crashed.Controls are weird finnicky and many don't have an explaination and are discovered via message board postings. Examples HOLDING the RMB moves the camera in slightly... but TAPPING it toggles you to FPS iron sights.Holding SHIFT lets you run... but when you're in iron sights it holds your breath... and slightly zooms in non scoped rifles.You can only refill a vehicle's gas when you are sitting in the vehicle and it's not moving and you right click on the gas can. ... and it goes on and on...BUT... AGAIN... Despite all these rough edges there is a quality to this concept that it seems absurd no one has attempted it in this way before.I look forward not only to this game as it improves but also to the littany of AAA devs who will take its good ideas and implement far more polished versions of the same concept that this game seems to have nailed at its most base level.A must own for anyone who doesn't mind their blood pressure going up at the thrill they get when they get within the last 10 players and have no idea where their enemies are as the circle closes in.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I was hesitant to give a EA game a chance but I'm really glad I did. The gameplay is there and the level of ""jank"" isn't anything worth complaining about I grew up playing PC games in the 90s so I know a thing or two about jank.The use of sound in this game is incredible. It reminds me so much of Dukematches and how you would need to carefully listen to your environment in order to detect nearby players and instantly come up with a plan to survive. There is heavy emphasis on psychological gameplay when you encounter another player. You must constantly outsmart them if you are to survive.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-27,0,0,107,True,Recommended,"Detailed review?Its just as fun as you think its going to be. Still a little buggy and needs more optimization patches but these guys are really consistant on the updates and no microtransactions in game (Hopefully for good). Singles duos and squad playlists are available and the matchmaking is lightning fast. Limited customization for character appearance but i dont mind too much. You earn points to buy ""crate"" like boxes that reward you what seems to be a random cosmetic item the price of the next crate increases everytime but resets every week. As far as gameplay my only complaint would be optimization and thats just me being picky. I have a 2 year old system i5 3690 gtx 970 and 8gb of ram and the only times i realy have any issues is when i first touchdown after jumping out the plane but this is improved alot since the last update. Im not running it on ultra though im on a mix of med and low again optimizatoin is in the works i could probably run it higher but in a game like this you really want solid fps without worrying about dips. Regardless it still looks good on the low mid settings this will be the last thing on your mind during the game to anyone who might be put off by this. All that set aside you will find that turning down certaing effects like foliage to ""low"" will not only help give you a boost in performance but also a slight advantage against somone who has it set to ""high"". Again thats just me being picky honestly none of that even matters once you get locked into gameplay. You've seen the gameplay you known what this game has to offer. If you have the slightest ich to buy this game i say buy it now its well worth the $30. If you can convince a friend to buy it too you will have even more fun this game gets really intense and the encounters can be crazy having a friend there to experience that with is a blast and the lightning fast matchmaking i mentioned makes it that much easier to just say ""one more"" as you attempt your shot at being #1 one last time before you go to bed (because you spent all day playing it on accident). This game can be challenging you have to remember there are 99 other people in that lobby and all of them want to kill you but again giving it another go is always just moments away there isn't much to learn if you are new to the genre just watch a few PUBG tip videos or something and you will be ready. Start that download!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-21,0,0,491,True,Recommended,I played Battlegrounds after the huge optimization path this weekend and my general feeling is that Greene's aim is looking pretty spot on. If you've played or watched any battle royale matches you know the drill players after a brief and violent wait in the lobby (a small island littered with weapons in this case) board one of several planes that then fly over a much larger island.Battlegrounds does lean a bit closer to King of the Kill than Arma 3's Battle Royale mod in that it is incredibly easy to jump in without having to first watch hours of it being streamed just to know how it works. The houses and shacks on the island are overstuffed with guns melee weapons ammo first aid backpacks and the always startling number of motorcycle helmets you tend to find in the post apocalyptic future. Equipping yourself for combat can be done with a little luck in a matter of minutes. I never tried out a melee weapon tho.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

ITs absolutely uncalled for this behaviour kills your fan base. You KNEW gamers would hate this move but you did it anyway. Its the exact same for Shadow at War since they declared microstansactions and acted as if it was something good. NO! The game is being boycotted beyond belief with that t move.Moral of the story Do not add microtransactions in a game PERIOD it has a very negative impact and you suffer MORE than u gain and will end up losing the majority of your player base because people feel cheated out of CONTENT that they could earn in game but instead HAVE to pay money for it. I love this game so much fun with my friends.

Spawning RNGof the worst kind. No vehicle in you area well you may just leave the game because the blue wall of death will kill you or someone thats waiting for you. lags / performance / Jumping / shooting while proned is not that great You cant outrun the circle of death. You can see through the blue circle of death. It would be much more fun if that thing would also block visibility to some point like a gas or fog cloud. That would also allow players to survive being in it and run out of it. Gas masks are in the game but have no effect. . that could be easily implemented but theirs more important stuff like a shop to implement. Keys to buy / i somehow expected to buy a full price game and not some free to play monetize game. Future server hosting and custom game modes? No objectives that could make the games less repetitive Working on zombie mod. Like we havent had enough of those games. Instead they could release some more maps even temporary with the same buildings or working on a random map generator for this game. If Streamers are special treated than i want server without them! I dont stream and i dont wanna play with streamers so let them play with their own. I get that streamer helped to make this game popular but giving them that much influence over the game is a bad move imho.+ Can make fun with the right Group + May give you an Hearattack+ Graphics are ok but most will turn them down anyway and the Foliage is problematic for the gameplayI dont wanna totally bash this game since one truly can have a good time playing it with a nice Group or even Solo from time to time.

2017-04-15,0,0,179,True,Recommended,If you are a fan of H1Z1 or the Battle Royale style of gameplay this game is a must buy. I have a 970 and run this game at a pretty solid 60 FPS. It will dip down to 30 FPS during the pre game phase where everyone is grouped up together but once in game everything is fine. The mechanics and playstyle of the game are great the blood splatter is an excellent hit marker and feels visceral. Bullets do intense amounts of damage so firefights can last seconds if someone gets the drop on you making the game more about placement strategy.Pros Good graphics as far as Battle Royale games go. (Better than most) Smooth gameplay Firefights are intense Each gun has it's own use and you can sense the improvement an attachment gives.Cons Sometimes the game servers rubberband requiring you to pick up an item twice to get it or shut a door twice. There is an issue post game where sometimes the start menu won't refresh and you have to manually close the game. No real hit marker to give you a sense of where you are being shot from. Characters hop out in front of vehicles so if the vehicle is still moving even slightly you will be run over.I see my con list more as a list of in game bugs because as for the actual gameplay I have literally zero qualms and really enjoy the game. I'm also pretty anti micro transactions which is a core mechanic of H1Z1 I absolutely hated. How can you justify charging for additional cosmetics when the game itself isn't even finished?In PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds you get coins at the end of each game receiving more based on your performance (How many kills you got or how close to first place you got) and those are used to purchase the crates for cosmetic gear. Not only that the cosmetics from the loot crates are clothings you can find in game so if you don't have something (like say a gas mask) that you want for your character you can still equip one in game if you find it.Overall I find this to be a very enjoyable and competitive Battle Royale style game. I have really high expectations for it's future as it already has solid grounding in it's features. This game will certainly be on my go to list.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-08,0,0,293,True,Recommended,OLD REVIEW I know it's early access but it's actually unplayable for me. Terrible framerate and garbled sound. I'm refunding for now I'll think about buying it again if it ever gets fixed.UPDATE Changed my review to positive after applying some tweaks found online. Game is playable now but I have to run it on way lower settings than I feel like I should have to to barely hit 60 FPS. My specs as of writing this are i7 975 Extreme 3.33 GHzGTX 980 4 GB10 GB RAMThat being said the game is still very fun especially with friends. Hopefully it doesn't fall into Early Access hell like so many others. If the game ever gets properly optimized it'll be great.UPDATE 2 4 months in since I bought it and the game has goine through a lot of changes. Performance has gotten a lot better although it's still far from perfect it's perfectly playable and I can hold over 60 FPS most of the time with occasional drops that don't really hinder the experience much. If you're somehow still on the fence about this game or don't really know much about it you really can't go wrong if you're a fan of shooters. I put multiple hours in almost every night with a group of friends and it's still always fresh and fun. Can't wait to see what this game is like in 4 more months.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I drop where he usually drops and I never get the same set up can I blame the game? yes but that would be childish more or less I put it down as bad luck and he got the better set up along with an advantage of height.this games great it has its bugs but at least they put it as ""early access"" compared to most saying it's a fully developed game. Cant wait for the vaulting patchput more .45 weapons in you drop waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much .45 for the guns available to make it even phesable BTW the UMP in real life is a .45 in most countries the 9mm version is the version they put out so EVERYONE could handle it (look at CS GO it's a .45)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No tanks like srsly? this game is called Battleground and 0 fighting vehicles and theres like 100 ppl in one server. Black characters in this game always die first such a racist community and devs. Spawn with no weapons like dude how can I even play this ?. This game is so retard you start on a plane but you can't drive one. 2 circles in the map ?? like wtf man which circle should i go to. Suggestions 1 No black skined characters only white and hispanic so the game is more balanced and no one has to die first.2 Add tanks helicopters and cars with machine guns.3 At the start of the game you can control the plane and go anywhere you want.4 RESPAWN FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.5 1 circle on the map so you don't confuse players where to go.6 Spawn with weapons and loadout plz.____________________________________________,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My heavens means no way but it's like CSGO it's the same thing over and over but it NEVER GETS OLD. I find myself concentrating so much harder than I ever have in a game before because you are alway in panic mode scavenging while watching your back listening for cars and footsteps checking your coordinates. It's just a darn good game. If you don't like it go play your ""king of the krap"" because even though I like H1Z1 this isn't a comparison. Almost identical concept? Heck yeah and guess what it's 10 times better. I can play on almost all high settings (i5 7500 1050ti ssc 16gb ram) and only drop my lowest while parachuting in the rain to say 30fps and I keep a steady 50 65 at all times which is perfectly playable.

2017-07-07,0,0,39,True,Recommended,I got this game after watching Viva La Dirt League's blue force field video (awesome vids by the way). Unintentionally death by blueforce field was my first game expperience! But I was #16 so all good! Anyways although mostly you end up dying in pathetic miserable ways the journey there is often hilarious. So far I have managed to get to #3 by virtue of driving around in the final tight circle in a military 4WD until I jumped from the flaming vehicle to my death. I have killed someone with a pan. I have in turned been killed by the silly mistake of not reloading my weapons... twice. I have stolen Dacia's and had them stolen from me while I looted houses. I have made it across a contested bridge crossing amidst a firefight by swimming underneath it. I then died as I crawled away from the scene. Inside is your friend. A vehicle is a lifesaver. Footsteps mean both someone to hunt and also your death. My only grumble is that I have to run in Medium settings and that death usually comes from something you can't see. But it is possible to have quite an adventure without even firing a shot... and still end up #3.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-22,0,0,1189,True,Not Recommended,At this time I would not suggest buying this game. Instead pay close attention to the comments section and such. Wait for the cheating issue to be fixed. You will find that 3 5 out of 10 times you are killed it is someone cheating. The game is a great concept and could be very fun without the cheating. I will list the pros and cons.Pros As I said above the concept is great. The fast paced yet at the same time slow and calculated game play can be quite fun.The map size is just about right for the way the game plays out and everything looks nice.Offers a first person locked mode.Great fun with friends playing duo or squad matches.Cons The obvious is the bugs given it is alpha but not a terrible many of them but still there.If you are into more realism this is not for you as it is a health bar system and when you hit people they suffer no penalty for being struck by bullets or hand weapons. So be prepared to say WTH quite a bit as you unload into someone with a 5.56 and those 3 center mass shots didn't do anything as they return accurate fire. Cheating which I would put at the absolute top. The game is just swamped with them.Movement is like ice skating rather than walking/running. The walking needs to be tamed down as does the running. Bunny hopping is of course present and should be taken out and replaced with a vault feature or stamina system that limits the jump function. Recoil on the weapons is overly done and needs tamed down. (I have more than enough time with weapons in my profession)There should be a hard core setting which not only forces first person but implements the stamina and improved hit boxes to include a momentary stun when being struck by bullets or objects. The kids can have their 3rd person bunny hopping nonsense but let the adults have a mode in which sound tactics and realistic expectations are present to at least some degree. When you have someone dead to rights and they instead of taking cover run directly at you sprinting side to side jumping around from 50 yards away or better knowing they can take advantage of poor mechanics and not worry as much about being struck down in the wide open while closing in on you that something is wrong. I would say my frustration level with this game is at least a 50/50 or better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-09,0,0,597,True,Recommended,230 hours as of writing and I suppose I finally should write a review for this game (I don't need to explain what the game is. It's currently one of the most played video games in the world second only to League of Legends. If you don't know what this game is watch a youtube video)The Positives Diverse loot system that's being expanded daily. Yes the devs eradicated the weekly updates due to pressured deadlines that as they explained was causing more problems than benefits. (Some people found this fishy unreliable or as a way to break away from having to support the playerbase. This isn't the case. Which brings me to my next point) Regularly updated game with a developer that is actively looking with fellow developers for a way to further his game. Some people are stating that the game is looking like it is going to be abandoned. That's simply not true. There's a map due very soon for Pubg most likely within the next month or two and another one that's supposed to be released before the full release of the game at the end of the year. The original map which is rather poorly done Greene has even admitted to saying was just a base. He said in an interview that they intended on remaking the whole map once further maps have been pushed and their goals have been reached. Greene although he made a very moronic decision to add microtransactions (which was only moronic due to the fact that he told the community they'd not exist in early access) he has told the community that he realized that promising that made no sense and he needed to test the market anyway. Since then the microtransactions have been removed (for now). Ultimately it does not affect me personally and it has not swayed my review for the worse at all. In combat action that genuinely gets your blood pumping. The looting system rewards skilled players and does not leave anyone disenfrachised. Diverse apparel for in game Massive map to play on. A genuine step up from the DayZ mod and king of the kill. Entirely. Greene has made a genuine effort to improve the game. At the time of writing he is attempting to incorporate the amazing water from sea of thieves into the game (at least in a technical sense) and recognizes that the default unreal assets are bland. He got a game out there. It's still in early access and he's working hard to have everything done by the end of the year.The Middling The Gamescom microtransaction was a kick in the face to some and a ball suck for others. I myself bought several of the crates and although they did not yield amazing loot it was by my own free will and I got some half decent stuff. It was entirely optional and is gone now. Some people used mob reviews to whine about this and I thought it was just pathetic. Yes the developer went back on his word for one thing and explained his rational. He's not abandoned the game and I still trust that he's trying to do what's best. Physics isn't perfect yet. It's much better than other battle royales however at times driving a motor bike into a slight bump will just ing stop it completely instead of flipping it. There's some issues here and there but it's not gamebreaking.The Negatives The netcode needs work. There's a decent disparity between the shooter and the one being shooted and it makes it very difficult to have fights at times. Beginning of the matches are almost always laggy but they are making efforts to improve the netcode regularly and I believe they have a path set out to fix this. The game has optimization left lots of it. It hasn't been released fully yet so I can't totally on it for it but there are some times that are just like wtf. Running an RX470 where I can hold about 50fps 1080p maxed out in most places the game will randomly have issues with gpu load leaks which may drop fps or cause stuttering. Again early access and it's not as common as you'd think. It's more of an AMD issue / mid end GPU issue. Most people with GTX 1070 or above can play with nearly zero performance issues.Summary The game is ing amazing as is and has had CONSISTENT improvements. It launched HORRIBLY with optimization and netcode and greene with bluehole have consistently patched those problems and produced a fairly stable game with amazing features. The game has a lot more en route before release as well as more after. I have faith in this company. I genuinely believe they're creating a wonderful game and I don't believe the devs have any intention of abandoning the game. It's huge.

2017-04-01,0,0,188,True,Recommended,"I'm gonna be honest here in this review although I love this game.First let me go over the pros.I definitely think PUBGs has one of the smoothest combat systems that just feel right.It's easy to learn and use interface (in and out of game) there isn't any clunkiness to it.The queue times are lighting fast within seconds you can find a game. Which in games like Counter Strike although in their own right pretty quick. Not even close to PUBGs while also having a bigger player base.I think lastly one of the absolute best things about this game is the team behind it. They're putting out patches daily weekly and monthly basis. At different degrees of course (monthly patches being the big ones) I think it speaks volumes about what they think about their game. Great mix of realism and arcadey style battle royale. Best described as ""A mix of H1 and Arma 3 BR"" Now some of the cons. This game has a good amount of bugs in action at this very moment. Performance issues. I can't say for myself I run this game at High settings at 60 FPS with an ""AMD build"". And I have friends with I7s and I5s who struggle to run the game sometimes with what they describe to me as ""potato textures"". Meaning they won't load.The spectating feature while very cool is quite buggy and won't give you the best display or audio while watching.Some other thoughts. I see some people complain about the price of the game. And about how 30$ is too much but I believe in it's current state it's well worth the 30$.I'd give this game a 8/10 while a great game still needs some work but work that seems to be getting taking care of.My PC SpecsCPU AMD FX 8350 Black Edition.

Im currently running the game with an Alienware Laptop with an 750m graphics card and 8GB of RAM. My processor is an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 4700MQ CPU 2.4GHz and im getting about 50 60 FPS.

AAA quality game with an indie price great developers great game great community. There is one big issue with this game and that is the fact that ""low"" shadow and foliage settings give you way too much of an unfair advantage which is a bloody shame since this game looks absolutely gorgeous. Post processing shadows foliage settings being on the lowest possible option allows you to see through places you shouldn't see and it almost completely kills off hiding in plain sight and blending in with the environment hiding in bushes or tall grass is also somewhat useless against players with low settings. The developers should probably make it so that those settings don't completely remove aspects of the map but just decrease their quality.All that aside I highly recommend this game it's a blood boiling battle royale to the point where the survival aspect of the game could even be qualified as the ""psychological horror"" genre.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-02,0,0,19,True,Recommended,I haven't played a battle royale game at all. Mostly seeing others play King of the Kill and others they've always hesitated to mention why a player REALLY needs to get this game. But upon seeing this one others have said that this is a more polished version made by the ORIGINAL creator of the first iteration of the battle royale game. That being said optimization is key. This game is in early access obviously so there may be some irregularities and oddities with the visuals. On my rig I have an 8350 16gb of ram GTX 970 and I can run it on 1080p with a mix of high medium settings and get near 60fps. One's experience may vary. Onto gameplay you can run this solo or you can join a duo lobby in which you are partnered up someone else if your friends list isn't that populated like mine. There are weapons and armors scattered on the land one has to scavenge and be able to traverse the land or risk being spotted. Overall I've been playing on the duo lobby for 5 hours straight today and I could easily go for more. This game has the promise to be the most polished version of a battle royale game I don't see any microtransactions in this game yet only a small store that awards a type of tiered version of chest I just unlocked one requiring 700 battle points and the second tier is 1400. Out of 100 players this game can give you an adrenaline rush or you can be sinister and pick off the others once you've found a spot. From here this game can only get better. 9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-02,0,0,477,True,Recommended,I have been a long time FPS player. From games like counterstrike to overwatch. I have also played survival games like rust and the forest. I owned H1Z1 but never played it because it was to much of a hassle and the game seemed to arcadie to me. But this game is something else a great balance between realism and game. The rounds are fast paced and action packed however i feel they could be a little longer. The game isnt fully optimized yet but the devs have already told the community that they are working on it as well as with a date intended for the update. This is probably the best money I personally have spent on an early access game in a long time the devs seem active with the community and i feel this game is going a great direction. I would recomend this to a friend in fact I have recomended this to friends so we can play squad. If your thinking about purchasing this game and youve played fps and survival or even other BR games then as of its state right now i would say its worth the 30 dollars.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Playing with other people is a bad idea because of team killings and non cooperative players. Also there is a huge amount of bugs. Imagine an ant nest and all the ants are the bugs in this game. It's even too much for alpha/beta. Compared to other games in that stage I've never seen such great amount of bugs. After the last bigger update my PC just crashes and reboots haven't found any fix for that (updated drivers reinstalled the game updated bios and other software that comes with my motherboard). I don't understand why they would launch such a raw game to the public at such early/buggy stage.

2017-07-03,0,0,215,True,Recommended,Let me start off by saying that this is my opinion of the game as of 7/3/17.I enjoy the game a lot and am playing it quite a bit with my friend everynight. The game needs balanced bad in my opinion. For 4 games in a row the circles started at the same part of the map and a static vehicle spawn did not work. Not only that but shotguns are super over powered I was killed in three shots by one from over half a block away at full health a level 2 vest and a level two helmet. The spawn quantities for certain ammo types and pistols need taken wayyyyy down or for 5.56 needs taken way up. In one building I found over 140 rounds of .45 but in the 3 apartment complexs I searched I only found 30 5.56 rounds. I understand that the weapons that take this ammo type are high tier but at least give us some more ammo to use the weapons when we are lucky enough to get them.All in all I do recommend the game ever with the balancing issues the optimization issues and lag issues. These are all to be expected in a early access game which is why I dont hold it against it too much. Just do not buy this game and think it is going to run at 60fps constantly and have amazing ping you will not. The biggest lag and fps issue is when you first drop and everyone is jumping out of the plane and you are rendering the world around you all at once. Once again I do recommend this game and hope that it get better and good luck out on the battlefield.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-22,0,0,230,True,Not Recommended,It was tough deciding if this was going to be a positive or negative review due to the onslaught of bugs and frame rate problems with this early access title so this is more of an informative post so here goes Player unknown's battlegrounds or PUBG is an extremely fun game when played with friends if you are a solo player id recommend finding a +1.The minimum spec requirements for this game are COMPLETELY INCORRECT this game is unplayable with those specs i have a gtx 1080 and a i5 7600k and i have serious fps issues with this game sometimes on very low settings i usually get a solid 90 fps but at times that plummets to 30fps or lower for what seems to be an empty field this game is just about playable with 40 fps but you are really not going to enjoy close quarter engagements.I would say gtx 960 or equivalent is a bare minimum along with a i7 cpu as of the time of this post the game is extremely cpu heavy with the so called minimum specs you are going to struggle with getting 10 fps in this unoptimised game.So really the question is if you have a good enough set of specs then go for this game its great but if you dont have good specs this game will cost 200 400 pounds just to get specs to actually run the game without lagging 24/7For better and more researched information go check out the pubg subreddit at https //www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/thanks for reading Player whose friend can nolonger play this game due to the new patch removal of sm4 in steam launch options.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you are reading negative reviews from people its probably because they played for hours and haven't won a single game and are now blaming the developers for making a trash game (ITS EARLY ACCESS PEOPLE)If you want a COMPLETE game do not buy this if you want to have fun anyway and laugh at some of the random glitches in the game because it is playable with out a doubt but under the little video you just wanted is a giant blue marker literally telling everyone this game is not complete.The devs pretty much always listen to a degree but make changes to the game that everyone is always happy for and the devs make weekly small updates and monthly large updates so dont expect huge changes during the weekly ones. The devs already have plans in the works for many new features maps game modes for private servers.I have played enough (have not played since month 3 update) almost 90 hours and still enjoy this game a lot id suggest playing with a buddy or a couple friends if possible as solo can be a bit much your first time and a bit scary.10/10 would follow the snake again,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,84,True,Recommended,I would like to start off saying that although I do not have many hours on the game currently I have been staying active in the patch notes and such so I feel like I can explain somethings that players may or may not understand. First of all yes there are going to be crates that require keys to open. However it has been announced that only a few crates will require keys to open and that the players will be able to unlock free to open crates normally. Other than that clarification the game is very fun. Every time I start a new match it feels like I just got a new game the excitement only builds as the lobby timer goes down and as soon as the plane lands Chaos happens. Running across a bombing site drving over whole squads and missing every single sniper shot due to your teamates getting in the way are just part of the package.

2017-06-01,1,1,100,True,Recommended,Very fun game and can be very tense at times however something needs to be done about teamkilling when playing in a squad with auto team matching. If 3 friends are playing together and decide you the fourth member should no longer be alive there are no reprecussions from that. They can just kill you 1 minute into the round and take your items for their own use. I wouldn't care if this was a rarity but it happens way to often and takes the fun out of it. Serious repercussions and punishments need to be implemented for team killers. EG you're instantly kicked. What if it was genuinely a mistake? happens. You don't deserve to finish the round if you've taken that privilege from another player. It's devastating when you're one of the last few players alive.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-02,0,0,260,True,Not Recommended,Right now I can't recommend it just yet simply because too many games release on early access and never finish the product. Further more most these day use early access as an excuse for every short coming. With that said here we goIn a nutshell incredibly fun but fear will grow stale in a little while.The game has tons of potential and is great in many ways. I'll focus more on the cons as friends who value my reviews always ask for such. Pros &amp cons.Pros Pretty much what most say. Tons of potentialUniqueFunAddictingImmersiveBeautiful graphics and audio.Skill based.Cons I hope if not all most would be fixed in time as its early stage.Expensive for early accessExtremely poor rewarding system I loathe pay to win but grinding and having something to show for it is always fun. Perhaps a leveling system or skilling with locked servers based on levels are in order.Right now playing 12 games to get a tshirt is unsatisfiying and will shy away the goal orianted ones.No steam achievments.Not enough variety/game modes Practically one game mode and one map are not good enough.Will grow stale/too repeatative in timeFixing foliage as currently anyone with ultra pcs have to drop their settings not to be at a disadvantage against those running on microwaves.Better security against cheaters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,258,True,Recommended,Okay I'm gonna put this quick and simply. There are two main Battle Royale games out on Steam right now both in Early Access and promising constant support and development towards release. So which one should you get? H1Z1 King of the Kill is $21.99 (CAD) and PUBG is $36.99 (CAD). H1Z1 has gone through multiple re constructions and re iterations through development team changes complete map rehauls and gun balancing. It's improved greatly from its start a few years ago regarding optimization but still needs much more attention towards car physics gunplay and map POIs. It has been floating in Early Access for about two years which concerns me especially on how the devs have been treating the community with garbage in game purchases and long waited patches. Player Unknown's has just released this late March and already has proven to become dethrone H1Z1 off its stage. It takes what H1Z1 tried to do and does it incredibly better. Car physics are realistic but fun gunplay is difficult but satisfying and rewarding the consistent updates and transparency with the development team is unmatched. Running off the constant feedback of the community the dev team is pushing new balance and performance updates regularly backed up with a larger monthly update fixing and adding things into the game. A few years ago H1Z1 showed promise as we waited for it to be Steam's main stay for Battle Royale. It flopped as it had a monopoly on the market so the desire to update it became almost non existent. Player Unknown's has now taken a large chunk of that community waiting for something big and ambitious and now controls the larger passionate playerbase at full force. Either way we look at it competition only helps the consumer as these two games will now fight for our hand to their game. H1Z1 has now seen this and put their team to work and has since the release of PUBG fixed some crucial things but is now behind in the race. To conclude I say yes Player Unknown's has now proven to me that I can trust their team driving this game and to that I can confidently recommend PUBG to any Battle Royale seeking player.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-14,0,0,410,True,Recommended,This game is one of the most addicting games I've ever played! The gameplay is completly up to your playstyle and it gets intense affff at times. The gun fights and intense teamplay will really put you on edge! Death always sucks especially when you're fully looted up and there's only a couple people left. It's UNFORGIVING. The sounds and gunshots in this game are a key thing to playing and surviving. The only issue I have is the server lag problems and connectivity. But of course this game is in early access and it's not perfect it seems like every couple days they're dropping updates with hotfixes inbetween.

2017-05-05,0,0,209,True,Recommended,For big ARMA/Day Z players this game will probably feel like a good fit. I'm going to mostly compare this to ARMA/Day Z since a lot of the potential players are coming from there. This game feels a lot like ARMA just without the clunk. The shooting feels solid not floaty spam like H1Z1. Those who prefer shooting in first person as opposed to third this game feels like it is more suited to first person than 3rd person. Overall at the time of writing I would give this game a solid 7/10. Once some bugs/performance get ironed out I think it could very well go to a 9/10. Final Thoughts The price point is a little bit high for what you get. The animations and sound could use some love gun sounds are solid however.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-28,0,0,256,True,Recommended,This game's developers are actively making updates to further optimize it I can play with around 60 frames in rural areas with a small drop to around 50 frames in cities at 1080p so I'm satisfied with the game. There are still a few random crashes but it's early access so I can't complain too much. Just to note this game seems to be pretty CPU based so it would be very beneficial to have a good CPU (I upgraded to a ryzen 1500x and my frames boosted around 10 20 fps).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-23,0,0,1244,True,Recommended,"I admit an addiction. I also admit painful issues. The concept of the game is simple but thrilling. You have one life no respawns chance loot and a heart pounding 1 v all deathmatch. It is on an appropriately massive open world island. There is a race to keep up with the shrinking field of play using cars motorcycles and most often... running in cover and looking over your shoulder. When you (regularly) end up in the same building or field as another poor like yourself... the adrenaline surge is real. It is simple fun. And a big dose of it. But there are real cons and most of that is expected for an Early Access game that exploded in popularity. The most grievous issue is with server desync and server lag. Its not always an issue but when it is think ""FPS shooter over 56k dial up"". You just got owned by shots that were fired 3 seconds ago long after you moved in to cover. You unload a clip in to an opponent... but not really. Delays and lag when opening doors and making moves. And those moves are life and death. Those issues come and go I would say I experience it 30% of the time. Dev's acknowledge it and are addressing it in future patches (June and later) But the game is still so fun I deal with it. There are some other small issues I dont like in terms of character movement controls being slightly wonky and loot distribution. But those are also issues that the dev team admits and is working on. This dev team seems to work well and seems to be honestly motivated to get out of Early Access and in to GA. So far I trust their work. I would recommend the game if you have interest.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-14,0,0,514,True,Recommended,"I have been burnt on so many early access games as you may all have too. My deciding factor on buying this game was that I felt I could trust my friends who say AS IS that the game is great. While other games have promised features updates and plans of improvement PUBG has an already fun easy to learn and hop right into game. I feel that the game has already paid for itself in the 7.6 hours I have played with only taking a break to get food. I do not feel immediately burnt I do not feel as if it is a game that ""just needs a couple of months to get it worked out and then we can have fun and play as a group"" and most of all I feel like it has a SOLID starting point as in that we don't have to wait to have fun. The fun is here it will just improve over time. My first few games were with a couple buddies the mechanics were easy to jump right into from playing Arma and such. In those first couple of games I was just getting the hang of it and eventually made it to a #3 spot in the game. That was great I was immersed heart racing yelling with my buddy to push out and shoot people and 100% into the game. By the end of the night I was ready to keep playing. Pros Great Game Not just a base of a game with empty promisesYou can just jump right in and start playingIt has a great map and navigation systemHas a good selection of gunsQuick to get into a game quick to get out and start another.Combat seems to be inbetween Arma and Rainbow Six Siege a good balance.It has realism but not so much that you lose fun just to be more realistic.The vehicles drive well not too arcade esque. Inventory system and attachments are very easy to use.Map is easy to use on the run along with quickly using inventory.The game is quite beautiful IMO with not too much flare that makes you turn down settings to see another player.Lots of little things that you won't notice because they are done right and that's a good thing.Cons Performance is the main one rain needs to be optimized HEAVILY. Opening doors and entering vehicles needs to have a bit of tweaking with the delays.The fact that I didn't buy this game earlier.Network lag is an issue sometimes.In the beforegame lobby when people are shooting rapidly it causes a lot of lag.Parachuting should be a little bit quicker when landing.Footsteps should be a slight bit more pronouncedI'm really nit picking because there aren't a ton of things wrong here but maybe more cars?And also lastly a larger distinction between driveable and non driveable cars.Suggestions Add armor for cars and attachments? More scope varietiesVariety of guns addedInstead of a single plane dropping maybe twoMore carsA player positioning system similar to ARMA 3 where CTRL+W/S Makes you go in (12 positions?) from prone to standing?Obviously more clothing options (I'm sure they are in the works)And lastly add boats I think that would be a very interesting thing to spice things up.All in all I was scared and vowed to never buy another ""Early access"" title (AKA Give me you money now so we don't have to finish the game). I made an exception when I saw PUBG and I am very glad that I did! Would recommend 8/10 and I am sure that it will soon reach a 10/10 for me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-12,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,Im no pro gamer. The learning curve on this game is pretty high despite you thinking its simple..all you have to do is survive. You die a lot but the games start quickly so it evens out.I get that this is EA and that there are 'bugs'. What ruins this game for me is two things 1st. Lag. What has me shouting at my monitor is dying because I couldnt get in a vehicle under fire as Im trying to 'line up' the 'get in drivers door' menu and then to have a half second delay when you finally do. Opening doors in general and picking up items are the same. This kills the game for me. When survival is the point of the game actions need to be swift.2nd. Hacking. Others have commented and I am pretty sure that I have been victim a couple of times. As i said Im no progamer and there are much better players out there than me but I cant help thinking with some of my deaths that it wasnt just a skilled shot that got me..how did you know in the first place that I was even in a room with the door closed? Or manage to one shot me in a car travelling at 65kph that wasnt driving in a straight line?So its a good premise for a game and its good in short stints but I cant recommend it at the moment at the price and until its improved.

2017-05-24,0,0,31,True,Recommended,First of this is a new account as I have multiple for the game since queue time's get fairly rough when your MMR gets higher so all in all I have roughly 250+ hours on it.But I'll make a fairly brief and honest review of it.This thing has Game and lots of it. It's addictive It's fast paced It's tense It's the type of do or die type of game where every decision you make can cost you your life.People are not absolute bullet sponges here either nor is it like playing CS GO COD BF1.It's got it's on flair on the DMG and how it works with bullet dropoffs and range factoring in and certain distances but not all.But and there's always a big but . It's unoptimized and with every patch they push out to change optimization it works till the next patch where you're back to square one or even worse than when they first tried to fix it. Netlag is an issue and will get you killed if it's not on your end it'll be on the enemies side remember BF4? It's fairly similar to that and yes I know how the dmg system works how the damage is calculated by the server and what server acknowledges and what it doesn't and why it is that way.But I'm talking about where you're behind a building and you die and on your deathscreen you then see someone peeking around the corner as if they've seen you for 3seconds and already lined up the shot. The server isn't behind by 3seconds everyone knows that. But this will get changed I'm sure of it.The Final Verdict on my end should still be obvious.I love the game I absolutely adore and wish the devs the best of luck in removing all the kinks and I whileheartedly recommend it to anyone who has the money to spare and are up to the challenge because it is a challenging game to get into.You will have to relieve yourself of everything you know and learn it from the ground up tactics that work in other games might not work here as a lot of it is simply experience and being able to analyze every situation you're in down to a T . But it's worth it so do give it a shot and if you have friends.I prefer duoing over full squad but both are a lot of fun but duo is just my style. )Good luck out there and see you on the battleground.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-24,0,0,2020,True,Recommended,Love this game. Can't wait for some of the bugs to get worked out but overall a really good experience. highly recommend for anyone looking to play H1z1 King of the Kill this is much more fun imo!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-23,0,0,272,True,Recommended,Alright ladies and gents.. Let me give you my take on this jaunt.This game is pretty ing good. Hopefully if you read this I expect that you have played H1Z1 or atleast know how that game works. H1Z1 being the main competetor with Playerunknown Battlegrounds.I will start with my dislikes of Playerunknown Battlegrounds (PUBG)(Note this game IS EARLY ACCESS BUGS/OPTIMIZATION ISSUES ARE RELEVANT HERE) PUBG definately has it's flaws when it comes to Optimization &amp Performance. Even the most up to date PCs (im talking a 1080 GPU) struggle to substain 60 fps on high/ultra settings in most areas around the game. (We're talking 30 45 fps at best) Running the game on Medium graphics is enjoyable and gets the job done. Give it time they are working on optimization. I appreciate how rare med kits are in this game (Med kits which heal 100% of your health NOT first aid kits) but I don't see why the bandages only allow you to heal up to 75% of your health. / The healing in H1Z1 is a lot better IMO. I think bandages and first aid kits should be allowed to get you back to 100%.PUBG is having HUGE success and I hope they can better optimize their game quickly so more people can purchase the game and enjoy with good frame rate. No 1080 should be taxed like it is here. Lets go to the LIKES of PUBG This game is tactical as . You can't sprint towards people and jump around the corner with a shotgun like you can in H1Z1 first of all you can't jump and shoot like an idiot because that isn't realistic. The slower pace take your moment tactical player will have more fun and will win more games. The Compass and Map being pinned on the HUD is a must have for battle royal games. PUBG does a fantastic job here. The compass on H1 is on the top right corner looks out of place and no map on the screen. The map also shows you exactly where your character is in relation to everything around you. H1Z1 highlights the cordinate (H4) for example. Not a very good system for this style of game. The customization of weapons is ing great! Like I mentioned above the strategic tactical player WILL MOST LIKELY WIN! Do you want an automatic shotgun with a supressor? Sure! How about a sniper with a surpressor? Sure! Favor more accuracy and instead use the flash hider over the supressor to engage in a long range fight? You got it. H1Z1 lacks here but PUBG does a beautiful job. One game you might have a kar98k sniper but are left with a 2x scope. The next game you could have the Kar98k with a 15x scope! Your gameplay changes based on the attachments of what you can find.Now I run this game using a 760 GPU. This card is a good bit outdated so I lowered my settings to the lowest to get the best frames I can get. I can get about 60 80 in towns. The island you spawn on has a lot of shananigans going on and it really taxes my computer. But that's okay.Hopefully if you got this far you learned something about this game If your computer can run it I highly suggest picking it up. This game is fantastic to play solo or with a group of buddies. Vehicles are more common here (over H1) and make the game so much fun with friends. And if you CAN'T run this game stick around watch for updates. They are working on it. ) Anyways I'm tired of typing. Have a good day.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I think with the whole build up to the end of the game it should give some time to fight with the few last teams alive but all i ever seem to be doing is running or dying to the gas. just my opinion but the end game gas needs to be slowed down a little.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-27,1,1,370,True,Not Recommended,This game runs like Worst optimization I've seen in a while. If you don't have a really powerful PC prepare for a experience low FPS crashes and whatnot. Often enough the buildings won't have loaded yet as I touch the ground and I need to wait a minute until my CPU (i5 6600K) can handle this mess of a game. This is the only game my computer has ever had any issues with including GTA V Witcher 3 etc.This game offers a wide variety of bugs to choose from (randomly).This game's servers are a joke. Period.This game's randomness is a bit too much for me (I know it is a BR game). Sometimes I will enter 3 or 4 buildings (after waiting outside for a minute or two until they load properly) until I can find a decent gun.The randomness in this game is a bit too much for my taste (I know it is a BR game). Sometimes I will search 3 or 4 buildings until I can find a decent gun.The only reason this game has so many players is that it's the only ok game of the Battle Royale genre. As soon as a game of this genre comes out this game will be dead just like it happened to H1Z1 KOFTK.Obs. Fortnite follows a different line of Battle Royale with cartoonish graphics and a building system so I am still waiting for a true and realistic BR game to come out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-10,0,0,295,True,Not Recommended,Overall the game is good performance is good for my system but one thing that i really hate about this game is the inconsistancy in damage from weapons its most likely down to hit reg or server lag but every so often i have these games where someone can one tap with a pump action shotty with helmet and chest rig and no damage is given to either piece yet i still get dropped. then other games will happen where i do the same (or so i thought) they take 4 5 hits with the same level armour on them. the game needs fixing i know the server tick rate is most likely the issue as there maximum 15 on tick rate for NA and 10 if not 5 for EU with many sources stating the same online. there servers need fixing fast because the way damage works it can only be put down to poor server tick rate and hit reg issues. and as of right now i cannot recommend this game till the devs pull there finger out of there *** and increase tick rate on the servers. i know this can be done as i have exstensive knowledge on the UE4+networking and this can easily be resolved with better servers to handle tick rate.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Oh yeah when there's a refresh button on the main menu that allows u to reload the main menu when it's not responding you know that the coding for the UI sucks and that shouldn't happen to a game with this many players. Again the gameplay is totally ufn but the game is just not polished PUBG has so many players now BlueHole should have enough money to fix all these major issues.

2017-10-21,0,0,497,True,Not Recommended,After almost a year of closed beta to early access and a few years of total development the game is still pretty low budget. the Battle Royal game mechanic is fun no matter who makes a game about it. Don't mis interpret battlegrounds as being a good game just because your having fun with the 'mechanics' inherit in any Battle Royal style game. What the Developers have produced around that game mechanic is a low quality un professional adolescent attempt at a game. BlueHole doesn't have experience making a single Shooter game or First Person Shooter game and it shows everywhere. bad netcode creating incredible inconsistency dying around a corner when a building is completely protecting you from gun fire. lag desync rubber banding Inconsistent weapon mechanics and physics(some weapons act realistic only in certain situations but cartoony in others like the game is having an identity crisis) some low powered pistols will kill somebody in 3 bullets at full health while the next game the same gun will take 7 bullets as if the rules of the game keep changing per match not allowing you to build knowledge and skill around expected behaviours from the game environment and players. Lv. 3 armour will reduce damage one game then reduce no damage at all the next game. paying for keys to get items you may or may not ever get complete rng micro transactions and this is taking place after the game is still a mess and isn't officially released yet oh and also you have to pay full price for the game upfront. Terrible quality textures some textures look like N64 graphics and haven't changed since last year. Gun Damage recoil range and power seems to follow no assemblance of logic or order this is after the developer insists on some extra realism by focusing on there being different bullet types but this ammo will do different damage depending on the gun you put it in. and then also may or may not do a certain amount of damage depending on if armour or helmets function properly or not.

I have found myself many times with my heart racing when I got sniped when combat was near or when the number of players still alive was closing to 1.

2017-06-10,1,1,74,True,Not Recommended,"I wish there was a ""meh"" button because I neither like nor dislike the game. Since there is none I go with the dislike and here are my reasons why 1. The game is poorly optimized. It consumes way too much resources for what it does. Maybe this will be fixed maybe not. But everyone with a system that is older than 3 years can forget to get anything higher than 20 fps on low settings.2. Despawning grass. The fact that after a certain distance grass just despawns is a joke considering the game tries to emphasize on hiding in it. There are multiple ways to fix this for example they could increase the draw distance for grass (but that would require even more resources) or they could simply remove the grass and emphasize more on the bushes placing more of them for cover.3. The vehicle handling is laughable. You can have a lot of fun with it and create a lot of funny accidents but IMO it is unacceptable to ask 30 for a game where the vehicles get send sky high because they so much as graced a small ledge or if you tried to ram a jeep into a motorcycle (savest way to get the jeep flying).4. The sound. I don't know what it is with the steps in this game but more often than not it sounds like there is an echo to your steps right behind you which can be irritating in the beginning. 5. Texture bugs. I had more than a few rounds where the textures of buildings would not load correctly and therefore render me unable to enter them in search of loot. This usually comes with a coin flip if the textures get loaded within 20 seconds or not worst case so far the textures didn't load for 4 minutes and then I got shot. And no it is not a problem on my end since this happens only every 4th or 5th round still it is an annoying bug.6. Grenades. They bounce back as if they are thrown against a rubber wall. I once threw a grenade right in the face of an enemie it just bounced back to me and I had to run away from my own grenade which I had thrown roughly 20m.Those are the things I dislike about the game. But there are a few things I like as well but they usually are fun because my squad and I are going for a troll tour. For example crossing the river in a yellow car or flipping it in the middle of the end zone and staying in it because nobody checks a flipped car. Overall you can have fun in this game if you don't take it seriously. For it being actually competitive it is way too unoptimized and unfinished. I wouldn't buy it for 30 again it is more like a 15 20 game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Most fun I've had with a game since I got super into Insurgency! Definitely some bugs to iron out but that's kind of the point of early access so hopefully by release it'll be rock solid. In the mean time it's just absurdly fun hilarious thrilling heart pounding excitement every match.EDIT After seeing a lot of complaints in other reviews about campers ""ruining the game"" I felt I should address this in my review for anyone who wants insight from a semi competent player.This isn't CoD. Camping is part of the game. I don't personally think it's the best strategy for every match because my favorite part of this game is that there IS no single best strategy. Running and gunning is viable. Camping is viable. Running and gunning can get you slaughtered. Camping can get you slaughtered. This game is about choice and about weighing possibilities at every turn. You can't take out the campers any more than you can take out the runner/gunners. But you can outplay people by being smart and playing tactically.You think it's unfair that a guy posts up in an outhouse the whole match? Toss a grenade in there and solve the problem.

2017-04-11,0,0,2362,True,Recommended,"so i have over 600 games playd with a 13% winrate and a 33% top 10 in both duo and solo so i feel like i can recomend or tell about this game in better detail.i wanna start by adressing the issues ive had the last 7 days. The ""Lost connection to host"" has been a huge problem for me. it have only happend 11 of my 600 games but its still really annoying because i actually loose the game i was inn when the host disconnects. (frustrating when you try to get a good rank.)Another very common issue is the server laggs. the laggs is global so it does efect everyone and not just you.Another big problem is the circle you have to outrun. The last few rings are too quick and they hit for too much. Now to the things i enjoy the most about the game! It is pretty much a combination of the battlestyle from Arma3 and the battle royale from H1Z1. The guns are very balanced where you can snipe people with a M416 just as good as with a SKS witch doesent make the snipers Over Powered. you can allso find Kar98k (sniper) in regular houses so you dont have to find an airdrop for the snipers. The rank system is allso very good where you have 3 different ladders. one is for the overall score one is for wins and one is for kills.

2017-04-25,0,0,39,True,Recommended,Let's be clear this game is early access as hell but the fact that the basic concept shines through so well is a testament to where this is going. Battle Royale (the Japanese pre Hunger Games Hunger Games) is an amazing movie a decent magna and I've heard it's a pretty good novel too. This game is the closest approach to it I've ever played. Getting there is very difficult because a lot of FPS games have little to no consequence for playing badly. You can run around in Halo get noticed take a few rounds and the shields will save you and later recharge. You take 3 rounds in this game and you're likely to be mortally wounded bleeding out crawling on the ground hoping they don't see you. The tension this inspires is amazing the level of tactics you have to apply to stay alive on an island with 99 other players is ever climbing as people learn the game.Grab a rifle if you can find it hide in a building or out in the forest and try not to be seen. It's far harder than you think.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-27,0,0,91,True,Recommended,Really good game! I love physics and the game world. There is just some things to change/fixThings to fix You cannot jump while ALTing (looking around you) Huge server lag EU which forces me to play NA sometimes NA is fine. Weapons clipping through walls and doors Parachute landing too slow f*ckfest (You should be able to cut the parachute mid air) Spectating is totally a mess sounds come from wrong directions and it lags like hell.Things to change Area NEEDS to come/move faster its like 20 mins before people are even on a similar area.. Sounds need to be heard much louder if someone sneaks up to your house you cannot even tell. Non drived cars should not have lights on. This is not necessary but i think it would be cool to see the next area (white circle) on the ground too so you could take better positions etc.. I dont think it would make the game too easy just much more enjoyable. MORE GUNS! ) Color variety in Dasia not only blue (Things that are awesome! Guns are very fine balanced!

2017-04-04,0,0,92,True,Recommended,I never was big into Battle Royale/King of the Hill mode games until I got this game. I played H1Z1 KOTK and Just Survive (prior to that being basically abandoned) and it was just a meh experience. As a veteran of many FPS games tactical shooters and having 3000 hours of Arma 2 and 3 combined I'd say this is a great blend of both styles perfectly executed. I've been one to fall for the bait of Early Access games that never finish or come full of empty promises. The devs of this game are doing a great job out of the gate and the future for it looks very bright.There are currently some optimization issues but the transparency of the devs with a timeline of when to expect certain things help greatly with knowing when to roughly expect what to be done.Every match is intense from start to finish your adrenaline and anxiety is through the roof. Winning a match is a very satisfying experience and is a challenge that is hard to find in shooters. This game is well worth the $30 cost of admission and if you're looking for something with more realism better shooting mechanics slower pacing and strategy involved than KOTK than this is the game you must get.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-10,0,0,145,True,Recommended,This is the first game ihave evrer writen a review for and that is a great thing. This game if all that h1z1 king of the kill could not be. It has quick loading times you can spawn whenever(drop out of a airplane) You can actually see the reticle and the invitory is amazing and adding scopes and modifications is as easy as easy as can be. The one thing i have about this game is a few small glitches but that is to be expected in a early access game. One glitch is only being able to move in one direction which at that point you need to reset your game. My fravorite thing is that dying in this game doesnt make you want to refund it. You always get some sort of reward allbeit small but still you get something. If your looking for a fun game with a fun adn funny community get this game. 10/10 so far.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-08,0,0,273,True,Recommended,I love this game. It's a survival battle royale type game. I do reccommend this game... but ONLY if you have a medium system or above. No lower end PC's will run this game just forewarning. I played H1Z1 King of the Kill. Had been playing it since before the game split into two and went full access. But this game... this game trumps it by 110%. I'm gonna make this review easy by putting pro's and con's. Pro's Attachments for guns A wide selection of weapons to find Backpacks Helmets and Vests have 1 to 3 lvls The ability to revive your teammates when downed. (obviously only duos or squad) Vehicles are nice and very common so you don't feel trapped Gunplay is nice being able to play first and 3rd person The boost system for health regen and movement speed is awesome Devs are on top of things and are adding new updates all the timeCon's Very unoptimized so lower end rigs can't support it. ( I deal with the problems because I love the game and I have a mid ranged rig ) Campers galore!!! Hit detection is horrid you never know where you are getting shot from. ( especially if they have a suppressor ) Some bugs not a tremendous amountI have plenty more to say but for now that is all.

2017-05-01,0,0,276,True,Recommended,Ok so some of the experiences in the old days of the DayZ mod were priceless truly moments that I wont forget.I've struggled since then to have those 'moments' recreated...UNTIL NOW!Holy crap I've played 2 hours of this and it's been amazing. My buddy sat on the water tower by a small town whilst I was in a nearby house watching his flank from a balcony. As the map starts to close In we realise we are in perfect location and didn't need to move. We saw 2 guys heading across the field to loot one of the larger buildings in town we see them in the windows watching over and as true pros we count down our shots 3.2.1. Bang one hits the deck and instantly dies whilst the other got away hiding in one of the small rooms.We left him there for a while until 2 men roll up in a vehicle not realising what the hell has just gone down. What house doo they choose to loot the one with Mr Hiding man upstairs we could have taken the shot at these guys but watching it play out just seemed like the better option. Flashes and gun shot sounds echo out across the field to find that the guy hiding took both of these guys out. He thought they killed his friend... he was wrong.Just when he thought he was safe he started to make the way towards the vehicle the others left and boom 5 shots in his back brought him down. Was such a great moment. This is what i've missed. Great for alpha stage and ran surprisingly well on my now slightly dated machine. Worth a try? Damn right it is.

2017-10-03,0,0,15,True,Recommended,"First of all I do recommend this game but only if you are willing to look past some of the issues the game currently has. My personal issue is that I have a system that is somewhat over the recommended requirements. Only problem as I can see it is that my Graphics Cards is kinda old GTX760 4GB. Everywhere i checked and calculating how many fps i should be getting on the medium to high preset of the game was around 80 90 fps though I get 30 50 on very low low presets and some rounds that it takes my system 1 49 minutes to render the houses when i first land (yes i set a counter P ). So this leads us to the first and major flaw of the game in this stage of it's early access. It's a bit of a gamble i have to say as there are games now out from bigger studios that still have the same optimization issues as they did in their early access. I hope the developers will look more into the issues than the cosmetics... So far the cosmetics are dropped from cases which you can get with ingame money (BP) and they are free to open. I put this much emphasis on free cause of the game that introduced/popularised skin gambling (CS GO) and it created a terrible microtransaction trend.Now another big issue of the game is the server issues. FIrst day I got the game I was kind of sceptical about it as 30$ for an early access seemed a bit too much. Anyway when I first entered the menu i was greeted with a massive issue with the server. I even set a reminder in my pc so I would not go over two hours of gameplay to be able to refund. With my internet connection (250 mbps) I should not have any connection problems with an EU server. Despite my internet connection being supperbly good though I got a ton of ""Network Lag Issues"" and I died many times for that reason. This is as big of an issue as is optimization but I'm willing to overlook that for it being in Early Access. The reason I recommend this game after three paragraphs of salt is that the games that I actually got to play ( 15) were really fun and stressful in a good way. The adrenaline in a gunfight the hapiness from finding a good gun/equipment the satisfaction of a long kill the tension on the coming footsteps the feeling of teamwork in Duos with friends(or strangers) that delightful feling when seing that #1 (I came first two times D one in solo and one in Duo D but my friend died T_T ). And the overall feel of the game is amazing. I only recommend it thought to people willing to put up with some potential issues. I will probably update this review if things change with the issues.

2017-08-11,0,0,311,True,Not Recommended,I simply have to chime in here. As others have stated I love the game at it's core it's updated regularly and you see tangible changes and improvements on a regular well communicated level weekly and monthly. With 250 hours on record playing solo (Not a single Chicken Dinner has been had) it has it's hooks firmly embedded in my skin and i'll still be playing it moving forward but I know it will be subject to the shady gambling sites regarding crate items.I have had enough of Youtube videos showing kids wide eyed in horror / elation as they gambled weapon skins for real money in CS Go and despise it. Something just feels off with it to me. I have no problem with gambling in real life but to do it through a game that you love that hasn't even left EA yet is purely a cash grab. I was playing last night and zoomed in on a guy who was wearing pink leggings and thought great H1Z1 has invaded my beloved PUBG. Shame on you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,1,1,204,True,Recommended,Let's get right into the bad news first off because that's what a review is about right? This game is pretty decently hard to run I run it on very low on every setting and I have a GTX 770 with a i5 4690k the sounds can mess with you every now and then the ghillie suit doesn't blend in nearly as much as it should the blood and bullet effects drop me down to 4 FPS when I'm close enough and the guns aren't really plentiful unless you spawn in the right spots but that's about all I've got really. Now let's talk about the good.I addressed the sound issue which they'll be fixing real soon (probably sometime early April) along with some FPS issues people are having. They already have huge plans for the game new maps fixing issues they actually listen to the customers which is really unique in a company. The game is loads and I mean LOADS of fun it's so satifisfying killing people with whatever weapon you've got the playerbase is really kind honestly and I haven't really been talked to badly yet. It's beautiful to look at if you can run it consistently and the gun play is amazing. Like top tier amazing. The game feels like ArmA in a lot of ways which is really good the character movements guns they all kind of feel similar. I'm so happy this game was released so fast and kind of came out of nowhere I thought I was going to be a little disappointed but I'm not in the slightest. Amazing game really amazing. TL DR it has some issues right now that are to be fixed real soon it's an amazing shooter with great mechanics feels nothing like H1Z1 (thank goodness) and it's 100% worth the buy if you've got an up to date computer,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-27,0,0,127,True,Recommended,This is hands down the best battle royale game ever made to date it is everything that was good about H1Z1KOK merged With PlayerUnkown's Arma 3 mod it is just the right mix of arcadey gameplay and realism that makes it so memorizing to play and it is still in early acess which means it can only get better. What i do advise though is if you have a lower end Pc then i reccomend you wait for the game to become more optimized at the moment the game suffers from rendering issues with systems that either don't have 8 gigs of ram or without an ssd.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you first start playing you will probably die a lot but once you and some friends start figuring out plans of how to take over towns and where your next destination is you will start to have a lot more fun. This game isnt perfect however the optimization isnt the best so far but already I have noticed some improvements. The game play is very fun for anyone wether in a small group duo or solo. This game is for everyone. Out of all the battle royale games I have played this one deffinently takes first place for me.

2017-04-01,0,0,254,True,Recommended,"What we have here is the culmination of work done by Brendan Greene through his work on his Dayz mod Arma 3 and H1Z1 all of which i played many times. After the slew of trash ""AAA"" games over the past few years it was refreshing to buy a game (for not 40) and watch the hours played grow much more than some games. When it first released there were indeed problems i remember the sound was properly ed and the optimisation was a true flaw but having put the graphics on very low i could easily play it with friends and it was a good time. As extremely sizeable patches came out Very low changed to low and low changed to medium. Optimisation is working and the game as a whole is getting even better than at its release. The gunplay from day 1 is still next to none and the mechanics that are still being largely expanded upon are brilliant. Then comes the reason recent reviews are mixed. Apparently Brendan promised no microtransactions until out of alpha and with an update added invitational crates you could earn for battlepoints but could open with a key. My favourite quote some guy in the forums said was something along the lines of ""they are milking us dry with all these microtransactions!!"" which i laughed at as it is the most optional thing i have seen. I really couldn't care about cosmetic microtransactions i firmly believe i owe it to the team for making such a good game. Now if they started adding meaningful content behind a paywall THEN we have problems but being able to earn crates i can sell for 2 just benefits me. So yeah if you are on the fence having played king of the kill buy this one its actually good.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-30,0,0,19,True,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battlegrounds or PUBG is a game in the battle royale sub genre of the first/third person shooter market. The basic premise is 100 players drop onto a large map filled with numerous buildings villages towns and other major structures such as a prison and airport. Your job is simple. Kill everyone else and be the last man standing.The idea isn't original by any means as H1Z1 king of the kill came before but PUBG has produced a somewhat slicker and more technically stable product though that isn't to say it isn't stable all the time. The semi regular patching cycle does fix and add new items but it also breaks the servers for long periods or creates odd bugs that can persist for days at a time. This happens nearly everytime but they do fix the issues pretty fast so it isn't unstable for long.It isn't all solo shooting as you and upto three friends can battle in squads to be the last squad standing and honestly this is the way the game should be played. While solo has it's moments being in a duo trio or full four man team creates some really memorable moments and if you can get friends to play with you the game is so much more fun. There is also a first person only mode that is currently in beta at the time of writing for those who prefer that view mode for play.Players can use a variety of weapons from pistols smg's shotguns marksmen rifles sniper rifles assault rifles and light machine guns. Some are obviously better than others and usually you will want to scavenge as much as possible to find the best gear. Vehicles are also available but they are strictly for transport so don't expect to take tanks or APC's but hell you can run people over for a few quick kills.Probably the most contentious issue is the store which isn't asking for micro transactions but items bought using the coins earned in matches can be sold on the steam market place. So expect to see items on there for incredible sums of money for no reason other than it's apparently rare. Luckily the store only rewards clothing and not items like weapons or skins for those weapons. Though give it time.In summary the game is good but does need work to fix some server side issues and expand the content to add more map types and game features though these are in the works. Remember it's an early access title and so you should be aware that one day it might work and the next it won't because updates happen and the game changes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The best is to take places other wont go and you might get good loot. An backpack is not an option to survive it is a have to to survive. so i rate 9/10 and why 9 and not 10 well its because not many tips and hints ingame you got to discover most of it ingame and ther is one problem that i overcame and that is the parashuting you cant steer forward while parashoting only downwards so where the parashute opens thats where you beging so steer whil freefaling tnx for reading and stay awesome!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-22,0,0,714,True,Recommended,Addictingly fun and getting better all the time.A pulse pounding paranoia inducing all PvP battle royale. Drop with up to 99 other people either solo as a duo or in squads of up to 4 onto an abandoned island chock full of weapons gear and supplies and just try to be the last surviving individual or group as a slowly damaging barrier gradually closes in forcing everyone still alive into the same spot.Starts out as a frantic race to scavenge decent weapons and gear. Then it slows down a bit as you travel the 7km diameter island trying to stay within the ever closing barrier. Once you get down to the last 30 survivors or so things start to get CRAZY. Suddenly there's a person around every building behind every tree and squatting in every bush. And EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM wants to be the one to kill you.The graphics aren't spectacular and honestly the game is pretty unoptimized (I can run most games at 4K with no sweat this I have to drop to 2K with all my settings at 'Low' just to get a decent framerate) however the raw fun factor is undeniable and the devs are working hard to make the game better all the time with new content added monthly and bugfixes and performance updates coming every week or two.I can't wait to see where this game goes but no matter what I'm hooked already.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-06,0,0,149,True,Recommended,I do and also don't reccomend it... lmao. So I realize this is early access as of August 2017 so hopefully this will be resolved but from what I've seen (happening to me as well) their is a game breaking bug involving the homescreen of the game. You load into a main menu in which your character isn't there. You can see the church in the background but not you. Their is also no option to queue up in the top left... you are basically stuck. I recommend purchasing after this is resolved. Other than this the game is overall very fun. I enjoy the aspect of a brushed up better version of H1Z1. Can be very intense depending on where you land and how you play. Or it can be very slow and sneaky. Either way I enjoy it.Edit A new update was released fixing the problem entirely.

2017-10-31,0,0,53,True,Recommended,I bought this game to play with some friends and I did just that. The first couple of games was a bit of a learning curve to determine whether to be a hoarder or just be happy with what you got. After overcoming that hurdle and surving to the top 25 I think of myself as a Rick Grimes but with less zombies I'm on top of the world.. But glitches when getting out of a vehicle or just randomly flying off into the distance bring me crashing back down to Earth. Oh and the hackers will most certainly make you smash your desk.Edit If you equip the fry pan and run with it in your hands you get the odd sensation of being a jedi dodging bullets... It's not as cool and definitley not effective.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-15,0,0,230,True,Recommended,My review may or may not be helpful depending on where you live. I live in Hong Kong (Yes no need for VPN) so I don't go through what people in the states and I don't deal with the outrageous things that people in mainland China do. What I can tell you is that I face absolutely NO problems with bans and all of that. The game runs surprisingly well on my core i7 7700 with GTX 1050 16GB RAM LAPTOP. I can get around 100 FPS on a good day and 45 FPS while accidentally running google chrome and wallpaper engine in the background.The game is brilliant in terms of combat the only thing I would say is that the Aim Down Sights should be holding right mouse instead of clicking. As an active Call of Duty player (yes I know shame on me) it just feels right to hold down right mouse.Another thing is that there should be a guide of some sorts to help you out when you start. I remember my first game I didn't know how to bloody jump out the plane. I also didn't know how to aim. Something to do with the map and it's spawns as well I think that vehicles should spawn MORE. The chances of getting to the circle at the other end of the map is slim to none without a vehicle and from what I have played vehicles don't spawn often.For weapons i think the developers have done a great job. They could make it better by adding some sort of advantage to the holographic sight because in my opinion the red dot is better in every way. I also think they should add laser sights (yes my COD self is coming to the surface) so that aiming from the waist is slightly easier.In conclusion if you live anywhere outside NA or China I would get the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,847,True,Recommended,This game is leaving early access this december.I had a blast playing this battleground.It's a generic 3rd person shooter without unnecesary competitive mode like any other games so maybe that's what makes this game more fun to play because you play without having concern about your rank tier or whatsoever but maybe not for some player who want to treat this game as a competitive one.The pressure you'll be experiencing is different with any other survival game. It's something new in gaming world.The physics still kinda buggy but acceptable. Note that this game is still in beta access and still developing. Vaulting and physics correction are coming on December when the game is leaving early access.Play alone 100% fun guaranteedPlay with friends 400% fun guaranteed + extra salt. steamsalty TL DR This game is GOOD and hella fun but don't expect this game to be a non buggy one.Recommended.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-28,0,0,202,True,Recommended,By far one of the best early access games I have ever put money into. Imagine 100 players all air dropped onto an island with nothing but their parachute. You land! Then race is on to find as many decent weapons and supplies as possible to eliminate all other players within the map. At the same time the impending force field that is hot on your tail will slowly push you all together towards the end of the game and cause one hell of a mexican stand off...I rate it highly and would recommend to anyone that enjoys the battlegrounds kind of genre. Plus if you feel like teamwork is more your strong point they have the options of being in a duo or four man squad. Try it. Play it. Love it.

Here's why...PROS +The game is about ""last man standing"" but you can win together with your friends if your squad mates are the last people alive+The sound is awesome guns actually sound like guns.+Great for casual players who can't really commit to a videogame(like being online 24/7 or you get raided overnight and lose months of progress yeah you know what I'm talking about) +Pretty fresh concept so long time fps players don't have all the advantage which means it's ok to be a noob.CONS The game is pretty laggy because of ""poor coding"" plus bugs and glitches. (To be expected because it's ""early access"") The biggest con by far is that currently is that there's absolutely no reason to stay. The gameplay is fun and all but there's no real progression. When you win you get some currency. But what is that currency for? Just some box that gives you a random clothing. The problem with the box is that it can give what you already have. Not only that but the price of the box keeps increasing. If you got 3 white T shirts then boo hoo.In conclusion the game is pretty fun but there's not enough content to play with at the moment. I need better reasons to stay. Otherwise the game will probably die like Titanfall 1Edit 8/28/2017Well Early Access and they introduced microtransactions for ""cosmetics"" only. That stuff doesn't fly on this type of game where camo is extremely crucial. Also streamers seems to be entitled in this game except of being you know JUST ANOTHER PLAYER. At the streamers' word you can get banned. I thought PUBG was headed to being an actual good game seems like I was wrong.

2017-11-11,0,0,19,True,Recommended,I'm having absolute blast! PUBG is a product full of contradictions. It's ugly for 2017 standards interface is clean but clunky smoothness is a rare occurence and there is only one map. Game is extremely hard. Not only you fight with enemies but you fight with yourself trying to keep the emotions managed so you don't suddenly start rushing to that house on the other side of the street or won't jump out on much better equipped enemy. And here lies the secret I've never played a game before which would beat my butt every round and force me to restart again but in the same time give so much fun that I forget about whole world for this 20 30 minutes of playthrough. You have plethora of weapons with mods (silencers scopes grips you name it) variety of vehicles to drive with random equipment spawning and constant feeling that you want to learn to get better. Save yourself some pain and watch youtube guides first otherwise you will do what I did on my first playthrough when I didn't find any weapon apart from crowbar and was trying to outsmart a guy with SCAR who came in a buggy. While he was chasing me around I tried to jump into his buggy but did that from the back and ended up in some kind of weird backseat with my butt directed right at my enemy's gun. Guess what happened. A mix of masochism with big learning curve (game is VERY easy to play and VERY hard to master) a refresher in boring world of COD's (every series with same issues) or Battlefield (big chaos). Here you actually need to think. And I mean really THINK. Not about large scale tactics. You have to make decisions Should I stay longer behind the tree? Should I enter the house on the other side of the street? Why the doors are open? Why they are closed? Why this guy left the M16 on the gr.... *booom*! (headshot!) There is a lot of negativity lately with regards to cheaters. I play on EU server and have not encountered one (or they hide well) nevertheless I believe they are somewhere as in every game.

Nearly every time I die I hear gunshots see my health drop then i just drop dead and never had any idea where the enemy was. Then I'm dead and it still doesnt tell me where the enemy was. If at least in solo mode once you died it could show you the 10 15 seconds leading up to your death from your killers POV that would be really great and would make the game a lot more fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-13,0,0,443,True,Not Recommended,Well I gave Bluehole the benefit of the doubt but nothing has changed in regards to cheaters. On November 3rd they posted on Steam apologizing to the players for the amount of cheaters we have all continued to experience. They claimed that they would be releasing stronger anti cheat measures the following week. In October about 33% of my games had cheaters in them. In November about 50% of my games have had cheaters in them. It would seem that Bluehole's apology was nothing more than an attempt to save face with the community rather than provide any sort of solution. There was plenty of evidence to be skeptical of Bluehole's integrity 6 months ago...as of today any faith that the community has left in this dev is a delusion. The level of incompetence and unprofessionalism from the executives at Bluehole has been demonstrated since the release of this game. Not once have they delivered on any of their promises update deadlines or development target dates. Hopefully one day the gaming community will get tired of being dumped on by game developers and actually start moving towards taking back the industry that we helped build throughout our lives.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

We kept an eye on it for 1 week to check about the game's perfomance etc and the we got conviced that this game aint gonna go by the dayz develompent. So we bought it. The learning curve was medium after you learn the weapons bullets etc you are starting enjoying this game especially when you squad up.Finally i would like to add that there is a circle mechanic that control the map and make the players come up against its a little bit rng so be prepared for some random circles trolling you.All in all Pubg is a fun game that you can try hard or troll around with your buddies.

SHOCKING you people don't ever read anything.The money from the keys are going to the prize given at GamesCom it's a way for the COMMUNITY to help fund a professional competition for PUBG.Now on to a more formal review This game is both enjoyable and frustrating but still enjoyable while being frustrating. By that I mean it's highly enjoyable to shoot people get loot find the best/most tactical way to engage in solo/duo/squad play...but also enjoyable when the physics (or lack thereof) make your car launch in a random direction that causes utter panic on if it's going to right itself or if you are now in the middle of a field with no cover and now no vehicle.It's nothing but pure win and most of the ""negative"" reviews are probably from people still playing ""The Division"" so they are a bit confused on what a good game actually is!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-24,0,0,280,True,Not Recommended,//Second review I have 60+ hours of gameplay on PUBG so the things I say are based on first hand experience.My first review was mostly positive but after some time I have changed my opinion.PUBG is a simple game with a simple idea set on a fairly well designed island with great spots. But the game is currently hardly playable Below I'll point out the reasons why.REASONS I HAVE STARTED TO HATE PUBG#1) Sound problems of the back sounds is a disgrace directional sound is incorrectly implemented from a correct sound concept. Sounds aren't were they should be when it counts. Normal stereo sound is wonderful if you are looking directly at a moving car or directly at a shooting enemy the problem occurs when you get shot at from an unkown position. If a bullet passes by you from the left as an example the sound will put you off and will sound like it is from a different location like right back. This makes it nearly impossible to find the shooter if you don't understand the broken mechanics of the sound engine This MUST get fixed it is a 10/10 problem that can and most likely will get you killed making the experience unjoyable. A simple fix would be too remove the current sound system and use ARMA's sounds instead.#2) Textures not loading this one has been an issue from day one. Textures not loading and causing the building to look like mushy two toned roblox creations. This is a game killing bug that kills me 9/10 times because it stops you from being able to loot the building and if you force youself through the wall you have a high chance of getting stuck in the wall or table or whatever is in the house worst when stuck you can't get out and if you can you will die from falling. This happens more and more after each repeated session only after I leave the game and go back in those it stop or load faster. I have rage quit because of this. A fix would be to optimize the algoritm which loads textures and set a higher priority for building textures.#3) Network lag this one I can let slide for now. It does seem you are fixing network and server problems which is great.#4) Just optimize the damn game already you are using UE4 a powerfull engine with the capabilities to optimize that a simple game like this can get played on a low end pc THIS WILL INLARGE THE PLAYERBASE AND BRING IN MORE *PROFIT*.#5) A reason I like the game it is fun it requires skill and it keeps you busyI give PUBG a 7/10 rating and a NO RECOMMENDATION until above mentioned problems get fixed.//Thank you have a nice day,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Challenging in a positive way but your chances of survival are totally random since the many different weapons are never in the same places and if you don't find a vehicle to escape the incoming deathzones you'll die in no time. I personally don't like the aiming modes which you can only toggle and take a lot getting used to it'd be more intuitive to just hold the right mouse button to look through your scope. Matches can turn into frustrating time vampires especially if it took ages to find the first weapon for your individual playing style just to get shot by someone half a minute later. You then have to start over again without weapons or any of the equipment you exhaustingly collected.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Proceed to the middle of the city and kill three on the way. Feeling like Rambo now. The first safe zone appears on the map and you realize its gonna be a gauntlet on the way to a safe hideout. Proceed to the safe zone and kill 1 on the way with a well placed headshot. When the brain matter clears the air you see a buggy glinting in the sun. Fueled and ready to drive to safety now. LETS ROLL OUT BOIS! Get some sweet air over the first hill and hit the open plains ready to fire the boost and tear flipping everyone off as you pass by. WAIT!!!!!! Whats that?

2017-09-07,1,1,1,True,Not Recommended,I saw this game getting a lot of attention and decided to try it out. I thought MAYBE it had some appeal that I couldn't see after watching some gameplay and reviews. I was wrong. It was exactly what I expected it to be.Technically the game worked. The graphics were decent (even though i went low for the competative edge) the mechanics worked. The problem isn't so much the game as it's the concept. My first match went as expected I made it to the mid 30s. 2nd Match 3rd place. 3rd nearly as well. Why did I do so well? Because I camped. I camped hard. I spent 95% of each match reading a book on my e reader crouched in a windowless room in game.Fact is I see it like this. I could either A) have fun and lose or B) Camp till the last 5 and have a shot of winning. Neither option wholly appealed to me so I'm refunding. I completely recommend this to any and all campers in any other FPS I play. This is your home. Go home.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-24,0,0,251,True,Recommended,"Player Unkowns battlegrounds is the perfect mix of the arma style BR expirience and the h1z1 BR expirience. I ing love this game with a passion since it takes all the things about h1z1 I dislike and adds onto them. this review will focus mainly on what is in the game that is not in h1z1.#1) Attachments system and the large amount of weapons (still growing!). something kinda boring about h1z1 is the small amount of variety. its AR 15 and Shotgun with the occasional ak and or sniper riffle. end game combat is allways samey and its kinda like playing a cod game where one gun is overpowered and it oversaturates the gameplay. in this game however you have no clue what your enemy may have. he could have a meriod of assault riffles which all have there strengths a high power sniper rifle a dmr a sub machine gun. you never know! and it makes every engagement so much more fun. and to add atop the guessing game of engaging an enemy is the attachments. with a wide variety of low to high power sights a few grips silencers and a few oddballs every gun can be tailored into something you like. it makes looting dead doods more than getting some more ammo and helmets.#2) Armour done right! Okay the armour system was something I thought would turn off a lot of players. but I was totally wrong. everyone seems to love this new system they used for armour and I love it too. the difference between H1 and PUBG is that you can only carry one helmet and one vest at all times. this makes breaking helmets a hell of a lot more scary than h1. carying 2034 motorcycle helmets in a backpack seems kinda stupid if you ask me.#3) Tiered loot. the vests helmets and backpacks are ""tiered"" in this game from 1 3. 3 being best. this makes looting something more than an early game strat. getting better gear as the game goes on is part of the fun and trying to find higher tier loot is essential to victory. unlike h1 where you find a helmet and its the best helmet you can get right away its a little bit more expanded from the 1 helm 2 bag 2 vest set up h1 has. 3 of each means a ton of weird and allways differing combos.#4) Healing. Healing is a bit weird at first but I really like the way it is handled. healing is done in 2 different ways. dirrect and boosts. direct healing fills your bar up to a set amount so bandages are 5% and first aid kits are 75%. however dirrect heals can only get you back up to 75hp. boosts are a long term lingering effect that provides regen and faster movement speed. a bar above your hp will show the amount of boost you have after using a boost item (energy drink painkillers adren) and depending on which bar its up to (out of 5) it will give you specific effects. ex___ ______ ________ __ small decent good regen amazing regen!regen regen +speedas that bar fills the beter the effect is.#5) Vehicles that act like vehicles. since this game is built on a very modified version of the arma 3 engine this game has vehicles that ya know.. act like vehicles. not toys. and theres a pretty large variety of vehicles!#6) Bullet physics. this game has them.#7) weapon handleling. I love the fact that this game pretty much forces you to use first person in combat. unlike h1 you cannot hipfire 3000 meters out. you must ads to have accurate shots and unliike h1. the first person is more than just a gimic.#8) Squads vs solo's. In this game squad combat is the general synopsys I get from the comunity as being the way to enjoy PUBG. and solos is more fun in h1. I dont really believe that because I prefer PUBG across the board but its pretty fun.#9) Optimization. okay. the hugeeee downfall of this game as of current is the fps drops and overall problems. due to some very hard to fix reasons this game must be played on low settings to ensure a 60+ fps count on a decent rig. (I maintain 45 90 with a rx480 8gb with everything very low except textures being high)Overall I love this game and the constant additive of new content and feedback from the devs ensure this game will take over the battle royale market once and for all. I love the game and I think if the optimization probs are fixed I will be able to give this a 9/10. give it a try if you have the extra dosh! thanks everyone.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

More fun in Duo or Squad que Solo just feels bit booring since there is no one other to talk about tactics etc. Solid 5/5.RE REVIEW after first monthly patch (http //playbattlegrounds.com/news/68.pu) More than a solid BR experience now. Almost all the server lag/rubber banding/etc problems are gone. There are couple times in 10 hours of playing about when you might get shot when you're already in cover but that might be because that player is playing for other continent than you so the ping between you and the enemy is abnormally high.Framerates has improved a lot no more laggy 40 fps with my rig (see my profile) near Georgopol or other bigger cities.RE REVIEW after several monthly patches (08/26/2017) With every patch this game has improved a lot. First person especially is golden. Flanking is so satisfying and very rewarding. No more ""Oh I got shot"" prone and med up while you look for your enemy.RE REVIEW after 1.0 launch Very great progress performance wise thanks Bluehole. Also new map is refreshing tho there is a lot of camping possibilities inside the houses but there is a lot ""bumps"" on terrain so you have a lot cover atleast on one side.Can't wait for possible winter/night map or mode.

2017-04-09,0,0,104,False,Recommended,Ok since I'm recommending the game it's obvious I like it. It's a lot of fun and matchmaking is super quick. Really that's all I'm looking for in an online game. I do have a few gripes though there seems to be an issue with viewing your online friends to invite them to a game sometimes there are framerate drops and it would be nice if there was a killcam or spectating option. However I know this game is still early access so I believe it is safe to assume the friends glitch and framerate drops will be hammered out by the time the game actually releases so it kinda has to get a pass on those for now.EDIT the game is now fully released and there is now the option of a killcam and they implemented something better than spectating (the recording feature).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-22,1,1,100,True,Not Recommended,It's a fun game but it's terribly optimized and has some game breaking bugs such as being able to jump through windows without being heard vehicles killing you just to kill you and inconsistent hit boxes.

2017-08-09,0,0,279,True,Recommended,After playing just under 100 hours of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds I feel that my opinion on the game has some weight to it.To start with this game is beautifully made! Yes the optimisation leaves a LOT to be desired but after playing for a while on a reasonable gaming PC it feels plays and acts perfectly. Battlegrounds has a simple premise of kill everyone else. That it. The controls are very easy to pick up and learn. The character customisation is done well enough to satisfy most and the currency system rewards getting a high rank doing loads of damage and the amount of kills you get making someone who has a lower skill level late game still able to get plenty of points even without getting near the top ten making the game more rewarding if if you have trouble winning.I would seriously recommend this game to people new to the battle royale genre and experienced players such as H1Z1 and The Culling players as its simple objective and easy to pick up controls make the game plenty of fun very quickly for new players and the strategy and awareness that goes into playing the game makes it even more enjoyable for experienced players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,354,True,Not Recommended,I don't know much about Blue Hole's promise about promising to not introduce microtransactions during EA but I think the introduction of microtransactions creates a bigger problem for the community.My thought process of the microtransaction is more about how it creates a market of cosmetics where people want for insane prices (hundreds of dollars for a skirt from a box that costs BP + 2.5 USD is an insane profit) even if you don't get the best item several cosmetics are still fairly high in price and a huge window of income for players.With such crazy profit waiting to be made the hacking scene in PUBG now has a major motivator who are the devs themselves. I don't really know what PUBG gets from having an unhappy community but I guess cash grabbing is cash grabbing and the reason games are created nowadays are for profit not for enjoyment.So what I think is happening is thatmicrotransactions introduced (profit for Blue Hole) &gt People wanting new cosmetics (creating demand and profit window for hackers who can farm BP) &gt hacks being made (third party benefitting from microtransaction) &gt People getting banned for using hacks (more profit for Blue Hole and third party because people will try to go back to the game and use it more subtly making it hard for Battle Eye to detect) &gt Prices go down due to demand being met &gt Time to introduce new cosmetics in new boxesQuite disappointing as I really enjoyed the games before the microtransaction got introduced. Even though there is fairly low chance of meeting hackers it ruins my gaming experience as I don't know when I'll get shot from hundreds of meters away because he knows where I am without having to spot me by looking.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-24,0,0,105,True,Recommended,"This review is going to be a bit of a roller coaster of emotions folks. Read through to the end please.This game is fantastic in concept mechanics and in gameplay execution. In spite of this I simply CANNOT reccomend this game in it's current state. Unless you have a computer that is leagues beyond the listed reccomendations in hardware (of which I should note my computer is far better than the requirements) you are going to have a rough time. In order to get this game to stop stuttering at the slightest hint of activity I had to force it to run on DirectX 8 for those who don't know what this is long story short I had to make the came hinder itself in order to achieve a playable framerate. This is AFTER I lowered the majority of my settings both in game and through basic file editing. I am running a GeForce GTX 970 with an additional allocation of RAM. This game will STILL often drop frames on multiple occasions even after every single fix I have tried found and experimented with. In a phrase the game is poorly optimized. However the developer has openly acknoledged this and has shown to be working on this other fixes to the game and working on eliminating the amount of ""hackers"" that have been present. The game is still fun to play when it runs smoothly and even with the drawbacks I find myself returning. It is for THESE reasons that while I cannot reccomend the game in its current state I can reccomend it as a whole. It IS in early access and the developer IS doing well in communicating with the community and fixing the problems. I have great expectations and plenty of evidence that these expectations shall be met in as swift a manner as they can be. Moving away from the issues at hand the game is as polished as it can be when it comes to the base gameplay and mechanics. It takes the ""Hunger Game/Battle Royale"" formula and focuses on it. Other games have added this as an afterthought more still have simply failed where PUBG shines wonderfully. With the addition of custom servers on the horizon the antics are sure to only grow in hilarity and fun.As such I reccomend purchasing PUBG supporting the developer and enjoying the game as it grows and improves.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-14,0,0,861,True,Not Recommended,This game started off as a great idea and that's about all I have to say that's positive. I've waited about 5 months to write a review to see if the company made progress on making it better but they didn't. The initial 5 minutes you will have to pray to whichever God you believe in to not get rubberbanded around killed behind corners or have bullets disappearing. You know stuff that probably shouldn't be happening. And every update I hope they optimize the game then afterwards watch my fps slowly drop from 200 to now barely making it to about 70 90 if I'm lucky. I've lost faith in this company that they will actually try and make it better. But you know another map and more guns are way more important than what everyone is asking for in optimizing the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-02,0,0,360,True,Not Recommended,"I bought this game together with 5 friends . What a new and great experience . Being in the last 10 survivors can be more intense and stressful than a final exam . You can begin the game with a very powerful sniepr rifle or with a bag and a cooking pan this makes every new game you participate different and your survival can last from 10 seconds to half an hour . We had tons of laughs in the beggining dont always take this game too seriously fool around a bit . Its not an easy game especially if you are not familiar with these kind of fps games ( good luck cod and cs players ).The thing is that now the company has made a SH!TLOAD of money and everyone thought that they deserved it. The game was new and early access so there were countless bugs and gliches . Everyone was expecting that these problems would be deal since they got so much money but its quite the opposite they just keep ignoring them . The servers suck big time when a lot of people are logging in they will often crash and even disconnet you from your current game and not allow you to participate for some time . The bugs are still there with no change at all and for some reason that i dont know hackers have multiplied like bunnies in the last few weeks a problem that is also not being properly dealth with. Instead of developing and ""fixing "" the current game they are realeasing a new map .In conclusion Pros New experience Skill based game really fun with friendsCons Devs not giving a sh!t Countless bugs and glitches Terrible servers way too many cheaters Really bad engine ( i get 50 fps at tops with an average gaming system ) Not fun at all after some time You can choose to wait for it to be properly published .",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,0,0,28,True,Recommended,Wasn't sure if I would like this game based on what I saw sometimes no action just running to a destination on twitch and figured there would be a lot of camping (as is the nature of these types of games). However this is not the case. Pretty much the whole game you will be making life and death decisions deciding to loot an area go investigate a distant gunfight or make it to the center. And at no point will you get bored of running to a destination because you need to stay alert will most likely get shot at or run into a gunfight. And finally it is so rewarding to get a kill or even to make it to top 30 and feel the stakes rise.Pros + good servers for early access+ good hit detection + responisve fun mechanics+ good sound + good matchmaking and pretty much no lag+ devs have and will continue to put out a lot of content and patches updatesCons okay graphics bit of a response delay when picking up items opening doors etc. lots of clipping that gives you away user interface could use some workOverall great game that does its genera (battle royale) really well.9/10 for early access 8/10 if it was full release,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-29,0,0,565,True,Recommended,I don't tend to review things but here goes.This game has some fantastic potential barring a few server issues here and there (Peak time latency and picking up items) and a few crashes on my end (Possible memory leak) the game itself feels solid the audio design feels like it's on the right track and player engagements feel incredible.I'm not sure why some people complain about campers you've got a constantly shrinking play area and of course you're going to pick a building to hold up in for a short while. That being said running around for an entire match? Totally plausible. Just pick your cover keep your eyes peeled and take shots when you think you can do well.For an early access game some of the polish feels great. I look forward to seeing how the game develops as the playerbase grows and hopefully the devs will listen to the players to help build this into a fantastic Battle Royale.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-29,0,0,22,True,Recommended,Overall I think this is a pretty fun game. Only a few hours in and I think it's worth the money especially with friends. It's amazing to see how quick 100 people start getting picked off. Pro Fun exciting gameplayeasy to find weapons and armorgood sized map with plenty of hiding spotsonly takes a few moments to get into a match despite 100 peopleCons Optimization. I play at med settings at 1440p with a newer i5 and a fury x. Still get fps drops in combat sometimes that are game ending. Some rubber banding as well. Buggy botty. Look not sure what the cause here is but something is off. Watched my squad mate get headshot by a rando we never saw while being in an enclosed hall with no windows. Another one of my friends got headshot while going over a bump on a motorcycle without seeing a guy muzzle flash nothing. It's annoying but not game breaking yet.Character creation. There is like 8 different models and that's it. Yeah you can customize a bit with different outfits but they're time consuming to unlock. Would like at least more hairstyles if not things like beards or faces. Made my character before seeing what my friends look like and well I'm now one of a triplet.Price. I really only got this because so many of my friends are playing it. If not I probably wouldn't have bought it due to the price. For an EA battle royal with really only 1 non custom game mode $30 is kinda steep. I think it would be more inviting at 20 25. Hopefully more content and modes makes the price more appealing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Definitely worth $30 and 100x more fun when playing with friends. The only thing I would like for the developers to improve is the rewards in Squads. Getting 2nd place only gave me 140 BP whereas if that was solo it would be close to 1 000. To me Squads seems more difficult than Solo. Fantastic game great developer team and huge potential.

2017-04-29,0,0,151,True,Recommended,I love how fast the matchmaking is there are bugs (ofc its early access) but I haven't really found and gamebreaking bugs. Every now and then I crash but its not too often and the fact that you can boot the game and get into a match in less than 2 minutes makes crashing more tolerable. The performance does need some work but I still get above 30 almost always. (I have a 144hz monitor and it hurts my eyes to see 30 fps in games but its not too eye jarring in this game.),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-20,0,0,85,True,Recommended,"Here's how I see this game.Pros Very few hackers. Fairly well balanced weapon choices. Fun to play solo even more fun with friends. Winning quite literally means ""you played better than 99 other people"". Or at least got luckier. Choice between third or first person depending on your style. Graphics are polished and nice to look at. Chicken dinners are tasty.Cons Playing with auto matching in Squads or Duo is very risky almost unplayable because of friendly fire. You can report now which is good but it's still super annoying to deal with. Can get repetitive after a while for some people. Network lag hits every now and then. If you're unlucky enough for it to happen during a big fight it's very frustrating. Few but deadly game breaking bugs such as building textures straight up not loading at the start or cars going through walls killing you inside buildings. Likely to get fixed in the near future hopefully. Lobby voice chat is unappropriate (but this isn't really unique to PUBG). Basically unplayable for low end PC's especially in big cities.Overall it's is way worth the price imo. I personally tend to dislike shooter games and was very skeptical about this game but PUBG has managed to convince me otherwise. If you're bored and you never tried a Battle Royale style game before this might just be the game you've been waiting for. If not then it's still worth a try get it on a sale if you're really skeptical but it definitely lives up to its good reputation.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,931,True,Recommended,This game is great one of the few Early Access games that will actually be a FULL title release in a few months. As for the Microtransactions I don't understand why people are getting so butthurt if you can't afford it then don't buy it and don't complain that they're adding it in. it's not pay to win so what's your problem. I actually enjoy the new crates it doesn't ruin the game at all actually it makes the customization a lot better.Now you have to hand it to Blue Hole at least once a month or every few weeks still do a full update add new items in.

2017-05-20,0,0,1700,True,Recommended,Product received for free. similar to all the other survivor games but still plenty of fun. This game still has a long ways to go but hopefully the developers do it right. Right off the bat you can tell there is a huge lack of polish and the UI system needs some help. The animations are no where near the quality of a AAA title and the server lag is also an issue. If you're willing to ride out the development process and want to play a pretty popular survivor game then check this game out. In the current state I give it a 7/10 with a chance to hit a 9 once it's fully released.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,0,0,247,True,Recommended,This game is honestly one of the best video games I've ever played. It is so much endless fun with or without friends. I know the game is still in early access which scares a lot of people but I'm telling you it is still an extremely fun game and is nothing like H1Z1 or DayZ where the bugs make the game unplayable. There is also an extremely low number of cheaters which is another plus considering H1Z1 is riddled with them. The devs are constantly adding new content to the game and are really working hard to get this game out of early access which is another bonus. If you like battle royal or shooter games I really think you would enjoy this. I will say that you need a fairly decent PC to run the game well (I have an i5 7400 AMD RX 480 4G and I get 60+ fps with medium settings). Playing this with friends definitely adds to the fun but solo matches are still just as fun and if anything they are much more intense. I hope this review helped and if you are on the edge for this game please just give it a try I think you will thoroughly enjoy it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I had thoughts that it may turn our like DayZ or H1Z1 and what have you but I gave it a chance and I was surprised at the results. At first it is a difficult game to get used to especially considering how well optimized this game is from the start. Yes It is not complete. But it is much more playable than the games I mentioned earlier. Yes there are bugs but it is early access. This is the first game in EA that I have played with so little to complain about and the fun I have compared to the qualms I have with the game completely outweigh the latter 10 to 1.

2017-07-21,0,0,154,True,Recommended,"Honestly this is a very good game in my opinion. The game maker's ability to listen to the community and actually implement things that matter is a little bit lacking though. Although the game is constantly improving. I do genuinely enjoy playing this game when I'm not getting shot from absolutely nowhere. Speaking of the community though this isn't the game for you if you can't handle being called a name or two... Or perhaps a million. The community is certainly something alright. But sometimes the best thing that you can do is just change your voice chat channel to team only. It'll save your sanity and your IQ level. Anyways this is an amazing game for being Early Access. The devs are doing a great job forgetting about their deafness to the community. I look forward to seeing the game grow. Even if that means hearing more of ""I'm a snake follow me.""Take a chance on this one. It won't be an investment you'll regret if you enjoy working together with a team in Squad mode or just need some good alone time in Solos.

Most of the non recommended review currently are about the developer breaking a promis about Micro Transactions but if You look past that you see a game that will define what a Battle Royale game is supposed to be. However this game is riddled with bugs and glitches but that is understandable since the game is early access but I cant stand the ping lag and crashes. For a game priced at 29.99$ Daybreak (developers of the game) can atleast fix the fact that if i shoot a guy first with a shotgun and all my pellets hit but he shoots me after we both die at the same time. This game also has a toxic community with me learning the chinese word for N****r and connecting into a game instantly drowning below the comments of ""CHINA NUMBA HUAN"" and the song ""Alabama N*****r"" If you can see past some of the problems then this will be a fun game for you. Also make your character black since he's hard to see under shadows (no racism intended just facts) I also recommend joining a squad finder on discord (forgot the name derp) less trolls and more lols.

2017-04-14,0,0,929,True,Recommended,The battle royale we need but do we deserve it? The game is slow and more tactical than it's counterpart KOTK but it is far more promising than what other EA br games has to offer. This game hits the nail on the head on many issues that has been plaguing br scene for a while and it's beatiful in most aspects. While the game has many familiar issues like most EA br games does it still looks very promising. The good Amazing atmosphere Plenty of gameplay inside it you got always something to look out for while playing either weapon gadgets or healing equipment Solo gameplay is tough but the gameplay is by far best when you play with friends. Spectate feature that worked on a fly Cars and boats are means to travel from one point into other. They are means to travel you don't want to stick with for too long Different guns for every purpose. Gameplay rewards for each match in terms of statistics or points that can be used for cosmetic purposes. IT'S FUN. You get to dictate starting point in the game. (More of it in neutral) Second chance feature in Duo/Quad game modes. Your game won't be ruined by random lucky headshot from other side of the game. Gives tactical depth in group play.The neutral Starting the game is slow jumping in takes ages. Still it's tactical manuever so this is just personal preference. Like most EA games lacks optimization in order to get solid fps across entire game not just inside houses. Limits low/mid end computers pretty heavily. Hopefully will be fixed in near future. Gadgets like Silencer dominate extremely heavily. It's almost like invisibility.The bad Trying to jump over obstacles or stacks of junk is pure nightmare. Gameplay hiccups like getting stuck or massive lag but i'm confident these are gone by the time this game is released.Overall it's quality game and the dev's seem to have extreme serious attitude towards delivering THE prestige battle royale game we all want. While i never can advice buying EA game unless you are willing to accept the risks involved i still hope anyone looking at this will give it a shot specially if you got friends to play with. This game is amazing as a group play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-09,0,0,111,True,Recommended,so this is my first time writing for a review9/10 for me good game good co op but it's all gone when you found an empty house all of player will compete for the weapon even it's among friend.even in real life i started to become anxiety if i found an abandoned house maybe if go to that house i'll get better weapon vest or maybe some helmet. This game is good if you have exactly 3 friend because the squad matchmaking only for 4 people. it's better if the squad will become massive like 10 people maybe.Yes i would recommend this game to all of you steam player.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-30,0,0,1333,True,Recommended,Seems like a lot of people is mad because they have introduced micro transactions about skins. For me that have played this game alot don't really care about skins. If you want to pay extra 2 50 dollars for key.. buy the ing key. if you dont want the key dont buy the ing key. dont blame the hard working gamedevelopers for both keep their jobs or the ing company for just answering the free market. This isnt even a game where you need any skins. if you want to choose skins without micro transactions and refuse to pay. move to LA and suck some Political correct,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-07,1,1,54,True,Recommended,I really recommend this game to people who love heavy strategy tactics and team play. It's an awesome game. I would recommend this over h1z1 altough h1z1 doesn't require a beefy pc. PUBG is a cpu and gpu heavy game. If you want good quality and high fps you will need to invest some money. Personaly I don't have a very powerful pc so I put the settings on low and reduce my resolution and I get stable 50 to 80 fps.

2017-08-07,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,Had my eye on this game for a while and was excited when I finally got it. I started playing only to find it almost unplayable. The stutter is the main problem for me it's not awful but is quite annoying and makes it quite difficult to compete with other players. There are loads of crashes and errors which I was expecting but are still very annoying for a game worth 30. I have a good laptop and no computer whizz so it's extremely difficult to find solutions to fix these problems. Also I'm new to these sort of games and never get kills or survive for very long I feel if they added a training mode of some sort it would allow new players to improve and have a chance. I also feel if the devs posted step by step tutorials of fixes for different issues such as the stutter and crashes it would help me and many others out massively.

Cheaters are real (watched a hacker through a 4x tele 20 or so afk to is location and pistol whip them all...while looting a create. Sadly i wasn't recoding this to post a pointless report that would not get anyone banned)4. Bugs are real (free wall hacks through random selection on texture rendering or should i say lack thereof)5. Worst of all devs that think content fixes bugs by replacing bugs with more bugs.6. FPP is the only game mode worth playing yet is only available for US asia and UK...As an Ausralian...180+ latency is soooo joyous in a shooter.7. Report mechanic is pointless...just there for peice of mind.8. 3rd person gimps the game9. frustrating built element scale...i always wanted to feel like i was 4ft tall10 Armour is pointless...bug or glitch this I am unsure of...i have been 1shot through t3 gear with AR's11. Zone mechanic takes emphasis off gunplay and player vs player interaction especially at later zones where players are destroyed if they have no meds or are being engaged and time flies you by.So onto the Positives 1. Gun fights are addictive2. Made steam money off crates3. can team up with 3 buddies...the other 12 or so have to wait because teaming is banable supposedly....(still unsure about this positive)4.

2017-11-07,0,0,209,True,Not Recommended,Yeah so lets get into it.+ sometimes makes me grin after winning chicken dinner. being an arma 'rip off' or 'mod' and charging as much as 30 is ridiculous. copying the arma engine makes graphics look very pixeled and blurry also vehicle movement and jumping are very unnatural. close quarter combat is very laggy and unfair. you cant even select to hold the targeting its fixed to toggle unlike in every other FPS game. map gets boring after 100hrs. developers making new map when the existing map is still a joke and very buggy. the game is full of hackers even the statistics list is full of hackers like '20 games 800 kills and 600 headshots' and the blueholes developers dont give a landing a shot is equal to get laid with jennifer aniston. you can hear teammates footsteps even from a great distance but you cant hear the footsteps of a enemy player even when they are only a few meters away. more to come.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-10,0,0,241,True,Recommended,This is my review for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.I overall really enjoyed the game. Jumping in at anytime and trying to survive gives a lot of exhilaration and adrenaline rush. PUBG as of now also hit over 20 Million players so more and more people play this game. There are a few different game modes like Solo Duo and Squad. I have played all these game modes and I have to say it is a lot of fun to play this game with friends. You can also team up with a random person too.The game is expected to have an official released somewhere around December and also it is gonna get a new Desert Map which is awesome. I really enjoyed playing the game but now lets go over to the cons.Cons 1) The game is pretty badly optimized and you would need a pretty beefy system to run this at 60 FPS. There are a lot of bugs for a game in Beta even though it might be early access but it should be better later on.2)The developers are also banning hackers too which is a good thing but there are many hackers still which ruin the game.3) Many people have reported being banned for stream sniping or other reasons but I have never been banned. You can always send an appeal and also give your in game footage too I believe.4)The Character creator isn't strong but I am fine with that but some people might be sad with that.I am very satisfied with this purchase and I will be sinking more hours into the game!I have a YouTube channel called Fat Vorior and it would be awesome if you could check it out. I post PUBG Moments and Compilations.https //www.youtube.com/channel/UCc0T4JymbXJg8NKyIrOn2YwThanks for reading my comprehensive review!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

With millions upon millions of dollars in profit instead of making the game actually optimized and make it work properly they decide to milk it for all it's worth and work on the xbox release. This is a typical scenario of the modern developer ignoring the game itself and abusing it for money. Classic early access B.S.Wouldn't recommend this game to anybody I would ever meet.

2017-05-08,0,0,229,True,Not Recommended,"(UPDATED 10/17/2017) Read the TL DR at the bottom before you downvote this At first I was very impressed by the reviews and really went along with all the hype. YES this is an EA and quite literally EVERYTHING CAN be subject to change OR NOT for anyone like myself who has been playing EA games for 15 plus years we all know that by the ToS Agreement it really REALLY depends on the credibility of the Developers THAT BEING SAID these are actually very good developers. Solid know how. Very dedicated to what they are delivering. But Trynnun why the negative review then? Simple Accountability. No Developer regardless of greatness and credibility should be opposed to criticism in a negative review. EVEN MORE SIMPLY PUT I want these problems FIXED because I am addicted to this game. Yes Yes... The hype is true the game is great ASSUMING SERVERS and things like I am about to list get addressed. Remember this game is rated Mostly Posistive and we all know that can be a dangerous thing for an EA game to have ESPECIALLY when it has bugs and errors. The more and more I played this game the more I began to notice things and problems that were NOT on my end but specifically with the server As more time went on I began to get very upset by these problems as I noticed that the Majority of my deaths were not actually caused by a player killing me but by the game and map killing me itself Whether it was falling to my death from getting out of a still car (not moving) or getting stuck (EVERYWHERE) and waiting to die from the play area moving away from me. It was never ending it seemed. So I began to screen shot things as it happened. I created an album that I will be updated as I find these problems and it will be linked here. Each photo will have it s own little description/background. Some Individual Examples http //imgur.com/fHiYW5c http //imgur.com/iFQtUgg http //imgur.com/m2KdDKp http //imgur.com/Zazq8jl http //imgur.com/mJLVCTu http //imgur.com/APRzIVd http //imgur.com/NgvLZUb http //imgur.com/fg80niv Album updates 10 May 2017 3 games added 1 nasty glitch found of total control loss The WHOLE Album http //imgur.com/a/ikPGK Again I just want to clarify a few things. Sometimes the game runs great but then you run into some major glitch or the game runs really bad and yeah. So again The game itself is FANTASTIC despite the pain of all this. EDIT I used to feel this way but now you can just buy it all in the market place so now it doesn't matter... way to ruin something cool Developers... Here is how I used to feel... (Speaking about character attire only ) I also want to say I especially love the rarity of all the items and I desperately want certain items and attire and I hope they do not change that system at all unless they at least triple the amount of awesome items you can get then maybe instead of you getting one item from a box maybe you have a chance to get 2 items instead. &lt (so yeah... before items would drop and you had a decent chance and getting something cool if you played enough... now just f*** right off with it.... Seriously... What a broken money grab now.) TL DR DON'T buy it ... just don't... IN A NUT SHELL Developments since release&gt Kill streamer Get banned&gt honk at a streamerGet banned&gt you like free cosmetics ?Now pay for them&gt performanceStill sh t&gt servermega sh t&gt Cheaters and Hackers In gameALWAYS!!!Unless you want to deal with a whole lot of frustration during a BS drawn out EA process where there is poor server optimization and Devs care more about selling the game then and promoting it cattering only to streamers WHO ARE ALL MOST LIKELY USING SUBTLE HACKS save for a small few. FYI I will delete comments outright if you are going to talk about streamers. The whole topic is BS since they are the main marketers for the game. NOTE I will say streamers like DocDisrespect actually look like legit players with the way they move and play with no questionable play mechanics in their performance unlike other streamers *cough* grimm *cough* F.Y.I. BattleEye Reported in the month of October of 2017 in response to the Dev's of PUBG and their Marketing team that they ban more than 350 000 players per month which is way more than what the Developers and marketing teams reported. They responded to this because it was like a slap in the face to all their hard work like ""What??? We do WAY more then that are you kidding us???""...and every seaspmed player paying attention to this is like ""Oh gee... I wonder why... _ "" In every major review of this game where they talk about the games ups and downs they never mention the biggest ""down"" which ""IS"" the games LARGEST problem and that my friends ""is the hackers and the constant cheaters!"" Now with all the updates as of todays latest patch it takes forever for the game to authenticate and start up and cooperate with steam then when you do finally get into a match let's say you are playing by yourself joining ""Squad"" you're entire team is speaking some asian language (IN THE NORTH AMERICAN SERVER) in a game where communication is paramount... as if the RNG wasn't bad enough in this game you now have THIS New Game CHECK LIST ....STEP 1) Connect... (dissconect)... try again... connect... something about steam... TRY AGAIN... something about httprequest(WTF???)... TRY AGAIN... bad client... TRY AGAIN... failed to authenticate... TRY AGAIN... failed to connect... TRY AGAIN.... ect. (5 8 minutes later proceed to next step.)STEP 2) Start a new Game and ""Click Ready""... canceled... TRY AGAIN... canceled... TRY AGAIN... servers are too busy... TRY AGAIN... (game crashes restart from STEP 1)STEP 3) IN Squad/duo GAME&gt Pre Game Island waiting Things you need to know 3a) Do you have a full team?3b) Does your team Speak the prodominant language of the region of the server?3c) Is your Team From your server region?If you answered no to any of these continuing playing at your own risk and try to enjoy that horrible experience of a team that can't Communicate with you drive you anywhere (most likely) and will go off and do what they want and put you at a disadvantage. (Advise restarting from step 2)FINAL STEP 4) Couping with the RNG and all the Hackers while in game Soft Aim &amp No recoil shooters are the worst... Advise uninstalling game. EDIT Wow the BS bans are real. I have never so much as had a warning or a ban however all al my buddies that I played this with are all banned for killing streamers during their stream. We all only ever use Teamspeak and Team talk in game. So it's LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE for them to be harrassing other players while they are talking to us. I'm the worst player out of all of them. I have never had a chicken dinner and I do all the same things they taught me. They got dinners all the time and now they are banned...... makes me wonder if the Devs are only banning good players and leaving the bad ones in as fodder for the streamers.EDIT 04SEPT17 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME Still no warnings or bans however with as much money as they are making the problems are the same with their servers after all this time. Note the FRAME PER SECOND (top right) https //imgur.com/NOUwSDp Their servers and optimizing is still really bad.ALSO......... WTF IS THIS S*** https //imgur.com/qhtQEv7 No wonder EVERYONE is getting banned by streamers.... THIS VERY RULE is against the VERY GAMEPLAY ITSELF!!! ... So what are we supposed to do???

2017-10-18,0,0,133,True,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUYI bought this game a while ago and it was fun at first. But once the devs stopped patching things added in paid loot crates and allowed cheaters to flood the lobbies the game ceased to be fun. Servers are absolute right now so don't expect to have a game without lagging at times the game is very poorly optimized so fps drops are extremely common and the combat is ed up in many ways. For some reason they decided that a 12 gauge shotgun shouldn't kill people at point blank range. I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say this either I had the semi auto shotgun with the barrel basically touchin the other person's chest fired twice hit both times and got one shotted by their pistol. this game.Right now PUBG gets a 4/10 from me. Would be higher if the devs actually worked on patching this ing mess instead of porting it to consoles.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-18,0,0,427,True,Not Recommended,Im not one to put out reviews but GOD DAMN this one makes me have to! If you are a fan of this game type then dont bother buying this game at the moment. Bluehole has already said they have to many players for the servers and yet havent done to make it better. I have never had so many server connections in my life and now that BLUEHOLE has made their 300 MILLION from the game they dont feel the need to fix just pump out a retail version which will only cause more server issues....good plan Bluehole. ing dumbasses.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,391,True,Not Recommended,Don't get me wrong I love playing this game and will probably still play but it's quickly turning into a dumpster fire. You'd think with all the money the devs made that stability of any sort would be a priority but it's seemed to take a back seat to money and monetization. Updates have slowed and stability (especially network wise) has gotten worse as the game has gone on. Ridiculous banning still runs rampant and hit detection is all but a guessing game.

2017-04-26,1,1,542,True,Recommended,After sinking 100 hours into this game i finally feel comfortable in giving it a review and overall wholeheartedly recommending this to anyone who is a fan of the genre or even shooters in general. Whilst the game is still in Early Access and games in this genre typically have a bad rep PUBG has to be one of the most addictive game experiences i have in awhile. The gunplay reminds me that of Battlefield a blend of tactical but not overcomplcated gun mechanics with each gun having its own recoil pattern statistics etc. and is extremely rewarding. The Zone sytstem keeps things interesting and there is strategy in howw you use it do you get in the Zone quickly and set up and mow down unsuspecting players or do you frantically rush whilst it's behind you and try and catch people by surprise. It's this kind of fun but intense gameplay that makes it fun. The game isn't perfect and thats putting it nicely. Sinces it's Alpha there are bugs to be expected (One annoying one i experienced included me getting stuck inside a box that didnt allow me to move into the next Zone causing me to die very frustrating) the hitboxes and netcode are abit wonky and the Sounds whilst on the whole good can decieve you when it comes to postioning and distance. Despite the bugginess I can 100% recommend this game if you have a few friends who are willing to buy it to as Squads and Duo is extremely fun the Solo experience is also good but its hard to warrant the asking price for this kind of game if your willing to only play alone. The dev team also seems to be keeping to their promises with weekly updates which keeps the game somewhat fresh and the updates consistantly improve the game unlike other EA games of this kind. My hopes for this games future is more cutomization to warrant having a marketplace that doesn't just consist of 3 overpriced gear pieces and a load of generic shirts and boots (Jacket for lyfe) more weapons and maybe even more maps but we'll see. Right now I'd say the game easily an 8/10 for being a fun tactical and sometimes even paranoia filled battle royale that is easily the best of it's kind through content alone and for being one of the most addictve 'Just One more rounds' games i've ever played.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It definitely is more than a mindless shooter as it requires you to take risks and plan your next move. Although it does unarguably has a few kinks it needs to be worked out the developers are working hard to make sure it further locks its position as the #1 game on steam with the most concurent players.9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-11,0,0,122,True,Recommended,"Despite having major graphics issues crashes and wierd player glitches this game plays very well. The combat doesn't feel clunky like DayZ and isn't too ""arcadey"" like CoD. Teamwork (if you're in doubles/teams) is essential so having a mic is a must as there is no text channels. All of the guns react and fire the way you'd expect with projectile dropoff and penetration. There is still some balancing that needs to be done I feel but overall the weapon choices make sense and all serve their purpose well. The game looks great on high settings albeit quite laggy even on mid high level systems. From forums and the discussions here on steam though it seems like even enthusiast builds are having issues with FPS so do not expect the game to be like most other triple A titles out there in terms of FPS. Turn all the settings down use the launch options and it will be playable. Overall I would reccomend this game as someone coming from ARMA mods and DayZ. Do not expect this game to run well on all systems however. If you can't justify the purchase based on that give it time the gameplay is top notch!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is going to be a long one as i love this game as much as i loved world of warcraft when it launched! So ill go ahead and start by listing some pro's and con's of the game. PROS Blue Hole does frequent updates play with friends or alone very tactical game fun to stream/watch Vehicular manslaughter!!! You have to have skill to shootCONS It's early access (bugs) Community (not gonna lie 50% of players are rude)With the pros and cons out there i dont believe there should be any doubt about purchasing pubg. There is a new topic that has some pubg players worried and that being micro transactions. It's now $2.99 to purchase a key to open certain crates. There are so many people that are upset with this change in the game but in my eyes you dont have to buy the keys as the crates dont drop any special guns or anything to benefit a player in any way shape or form. My love for pubg has even gotten me to purchase the game for friends!! dont worry about salty players they are everywhere in this online world. Hopefully something i posted will help someone make up thier mind on purchasing pubg.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-21,0,0,698,True,Not Recommended,First time writing a review.513 hours into this game and 513 hours of fun this game has been a hell of a ride for me and my friends. It is a very very enjoyable game to play with your buddies... BUT...1. Due to being early access this game is not well optimized prepared to suffer textures problem due to the high memory usage of this game when runned (6 10gb) random lags/freezes etc2. I went through my first 500hours or so while meeting only 2 hackers however in just tonight as alone (before i write this review) i met hackers in 8/10 games. I know for the fact that every game has hackers but the high amount of hackers in this game CURRENTLY is making it unplayable.I really do hope the game can be optimized in the near future and also perhaps the team of PUBG can figure out a way to prevent hackers.. but for now.. i must say its hard for me to enjoy it with my friends ATM,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-22,0,0,429,True,Recommended,I recommend this game and I don't. There isn't a neutral option but let's start off with the Pros and the Cons.Pros You'll find a game in less than a minute due to the active player base of over a million players a day.It's quite easy to play (Not that hard to learn how to shoot and heal)Every game is different safe zones will be different each timeThe environment is awesome (rain fog sunset day time ect)The guns are all nice but definitely shotguns just destroy everything at close range /.The crates could add some more loot to make it more worth but other than that it is usually rewarding.The voice chat is cancer but can be hilarious (Ctrl T to mute)Pans can 1 tap people and after you knock someone out in duos or squads talking smack is hilarious.China numba wan?Cons (Personal issue) I sometimes get a texture issue where the game is not fully loaded in and I can just walk through buildings. It's hard to pick up loot however it gives a network lag and you will be frozen which makes it impossible to play.I have yet to see a cheater but there are tons of cheaters in this game but chances are you will be fine.The safe zone never ends well for me honestly! But I mean that's called RNG so this point is invalid.Some guns are not balanced like the mini 14 however it is fun to use.Sometimes it takes years to kill someone like damn!Probably missing a lot more but that's all I could think of I have a GTX 1060 6gigs of vram and 8gigs of ram. The game is playable with a steady of 50 120 fps on all low. You don't need to make everything ultra the game is just fine on everything low except FOV and anti aliasing those are important.Squads can not be taken seriously like no joke knock like 2 3 people but the last guy can just obliterate you making the knockdowns useless. I wish they revamped the knockdown system to like 1 revive per person or even a hardcore mode adding no revives.Due to massive amounts of people on the game servers can be really laggy at times which is a pretty big issue.Thanks for reading my opinion.I also need more ram.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,44,True,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Will get your heart pumping for sure!Check out this video! https //youtu.be/wE_PnAO0NxwIf DayZ and H1Z1 King of the kill had a baby it would be Playerunknown s Battlegrounds. That might sound pretty bad but I mean that in a good way! Personally I think both DayZ and H1Z1 suck for many reasons. But the concept is good!In PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds you start by jumping from a plane above the map. You can drop out whenever you like and choose where to land which is great!When you land you basically run around looting gear in buildings much like in DayZ. But you will get pretty good gear a lot faster than in DayZ and can get straight to the action in a matter of minutes.After that it s a lot like King of the kill. There is a circle in a random spot off the map that will get smaller and smaller forcing players to eventually meet in the middle and fight until there is only one man standing.PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a very exciting game that will get your heart pumping for sure! You can either focus on killing a lot of enemies or trying to hide and wait it out for as long as possible if that s how you like to play. Either way you are about to have a very exiting experience!The game looks great with high/ultra settings but the fps might suffer a bit depending on your rig. I decided to set everything on low to make the game run as good as possible. It might not look as good but it feels awesome. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is definitely worth buying! The only negative I see about it is that the fps could be better on high/ultra settings. But with a little bit of tweaking settings and such it is very playable and so much better than H1Z1! It s a great game and it will give you many hours of heart pumping joy!(Update 2017 11 22 I still love it)See you on the battleground!/ HEARTGRIND,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-18,0,0,304,True,Recommended,As of writing this review (11/11/17) I am fully aware of the bugs and the hackers that plague the game as of late but I still suggest people play this game. PUBG is one of those games that gives you an experience you really can't duplicate in other games. The panic of trying to survive in heavily populated area such as School or one of the city areas gets my blood pumping and that feeling almost never goes away for me. Depending on the terrain gun battles are just a blast to have whether you win or lose because in my expereince I never had the same kind of fight. I always had to adapt and use my surrounding to my advantage because if you don't then that's when it does become repetative and you aren't adapting. One fight I'm going in with a fully decked out M4 and other battles I'm holding on to pan waiting for a good opening to either retreat or hit the sucker with it. Playing with friends is also a great time too! With this game being in Early Access there are minor bugs that can ruin the expereince for some but for me and my friends we take bugs and laugh because some of them are just really silly and they don't necessarily break the game. In the end PUBG is a fun game. Look past the bugs and the hackers because they don't take away from the core expereince that is to be had in this game. Having played the other BR type games on the market this one is my favorite and I really suggest you try it out if you are on the fence.Update Doing this for Steam Awards,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,1,1,93,True,Recommended,Game makes your heart race everytime you enter a gun fight if you're up for some thrill. Grab a buddy and have fun making your way to the top. Although a lot of the time you'd be running and looting the game does a good job of keeping you busy with all the choices you have. Like the places you can drop to fights you can take and avoid positions to hold and a variety of weapon combinations. The only Con to this game would be the poor optimization if you don't have a beast GPU like the gtx 1080 and i7 then forget about running this game in higher settings. If your PC build is on the lower side then you might want to upgrade them first before buying this game. i'm using a GTX 970 with Intel Core i5 4670k 3.4ghz fully overclocked with lowest settings in game and I still can't maintain a solid 60 FPS. The game also has a tendency to stutter during loading and may even crash on you. Its still in EA so things should hopefully get better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This being said this game could NOT be more poorly executed. Should you so choose to buy this game god help your computer for this game is so poorly optimized that I do not think you could distinguish if you are playing PUBG or minecraft. If you have the displeasure of playing this game at a prime time you will not be able to join a game because of the disposition where the servers are being overflooded. God forbid you join a game it will take you regardless of computer specs at least two minutes to function because of the overwhelming amount of DSYNC that accompanies. The developing team is working hard at adding more content to the game with evidently little interest in fixing the true issues with this game as previously shown by prior months of patching. This game is in early access and I understand completely that it will have bugs.

2017-07-17,0,0,17,True,Not Recommended,Yes this is a negative review. But I would start it by saying this is an AMAZING game. If you are a fan of the genre you will enjoy it. The only reason I give this a negative review right now is that the last several games I have played have ended in me getting killed by someone obviously employing an ESP or Wallhack cheat. I have been lying prone in a grassy field watched someone run over a hill 200+ yards away from me and within 2 seconds of them clearing the hill they have shot me in the face. When you play for 30 minutes crawling your through a field for a chance to win a 100 person ffa falling victim to this kind of thing repeatedly is a major issue.I think alot of this problem could be avoided by instituting a killcam and review system in solo mode. (could not have a kill cam in duo or squad because it would be used to pinpoint enemy positions) It would be nice to be able to see HOW another player killed you in solo and them submit it for review if they are blatantly cheating.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-28,0,0,216,True,Recommended,I wasnt sure if to recomend it or not.I had some experience with H1Z1 but for most part Its my first battle royal game for me So lets begin.+The game itself is great.I like that the shooting mechanics are fairly simple and u wont have much of a problem to get a feel for the game.+The 3rd person animations are great and i really like them and the FPP although a little bit clumsy its definitely playable.+There is a variety of weapons each of them with different uses and there is no weapon that is OP and gives u a complete advantage.What i mean by that is that all rifles are good and its definitely a persons preference at what to use and what weapons to combine.+The graphics are quite good and the addition of weather effects adds a more realistic feel for me although some players dont like the weather effects at all.+The qeue for the game is quite fast and there is no penalties if u want to leave the game u just leave it P.+The game i dont thing it has a skill ceiling so every time u play u will definitely be better and u will accually see the progress for your self.But the players with previous FPS experience especially csgo will have easier time to get used to the feel of the game.Now as far as the bad stuff The optimization is just non existed.Its early access i know but if someones pc is not high end WITH ssd will have fps drops and even when u land the game will need 2 3 minutes to render everything and u will be stuck with 1fps or u will not be able to do anything so practically u will be afk. The rng in this game is just overwhelming.Now some of u will say ''git gut scrub'' or ''u need to think ahaid'' and there is some point in their saying but i cant remember how many times i got facked up because i am 1vs1 with a guy both behind a rock and then the circle end up with him so i have to push him or else i will die from the circle.Another problem is that the cirlcle later in the game closes so fast that u have to stop fighting in order to not die by it.In solo's or even duos the fights wont last that much but in 4 man squads if u start a fight will either end in 10 seconds or will fight for over 4 5 minutes which is huge in this game and appart from that u will have to stop fighting because in 1 minute the circle will have to close.Although the bad stuff are less than the good stuff the bad stuff outweight the good in its currect state but the game is really enjoyable even with its big flaws imo. Give it a try for yourself.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,1062,True,Recommended,Yes this game is bugged but so is every other early access game I have ever played. Anyone who puts negative comments up around that should really do a brain cell check as I think we are only up to week 22 of the game. Now all the whingers about paid content for the game all need a head check because the paid content is absolutely 100% not required to play any part of the game. It is just to change your chartacters appearance which I personally don't give two hoots about since all I want to do is get chicken dinners. Now gameplay is lots of fun. I mean who doesn't want to parachute into some old soviet island with a few of your mates try to one up each other with what loot you have found and then gho kill some players. Yes the game has some optimisation issues but the big difference is that the developer bluehole is very transparent around what the problems are and once they have been notified about any proiblems there is usually a facebook post letting you know they are working on a fix. Don't let the haters push you away from this game this is a true battle royale which isn't for the faint hearted and you should give it a solid crack.

2017-10-13,0,0,128,True,Recommended,Recently bought great game to play with friends,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-31,0,0,773,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Recieved this product from a friend for free.What's Good?1) Shooting feels good and hit registration feels correct 95% of the time. 2) Loot seems spread pretty fair everyone seems to have a chance.3) Vehicles are abundant enough if zone does you dirty you usually have a pretty good shot of getting back into the fight. 4) Peeking and crawling feels good fighting in fields crawling around doesn't feel awkward. 5) The combat is just great honestly when the servers are working no other survival/hunger games shooter feels as nice.6) Jump punching people to knock them out when you could shoot them but wanna really flex those muscles on the poor noob who couldn't find a gun is great. 7) Bombing zones are random and certainly change your thought process when inside one but are not soo damn annoying or overpowered that u can't move or fight they feel about right. The Salt?1) I'm GREAT!! *Terrible* at this game2) Camping is a very good strategy one I refuse to do but every other looooooser likes to sit in the lone shack on the hill so look in windows before you open that door since you might need to click f four times for the damn door to open only to have it somehow wack u in the face and daze you while your opponent comes out and drags his balls i mean akm across your face. *note it didn't quite happen exactly like that there were wayyy more curse words involved*3) The bomb zone is programmed to chase good players like me it's packman after blazing up with the munchies and I'm a juicy cherry. 4) Sometimes you will just die you won't know how or where from and it'll feel unfair but that's every game like this I just wish they would put a kill cam in the game with a report option if the person seems sketchy. I watched a guy headshot like three people back to back to back within about 1.5 seconds each shot with a sniper but they were in complete different areas and were not drawing attention to themselves. Obviously there are good players but im sure it being early access we also have hackers we can't escape that in an game it seems. (the good note this is experienced in maybe 1/20 games if that)The Bad (1) The servers are complete trash!! *insert 1980's rusted toaster pic here* &amp desync is crazy sometimes ill shoot at a target and they'll teleport 5 feet to the left giving away my posistion. &amp NA servers are constantly laggy bogged down by the number of players currently wanting to play this fun game it causes people to freeze or disconnect completely. &amp Playing on asian servers feels better than any servers NA that's right 45ms latency on NA but 150ms 200ms on Asia feels smoother wtf!!!! and Im in the middle of the US ..... this shouldn't be a thing so many streamers and players hop over to asian servers from the US just because we get constant lag and disconnects to NA.2) The F BOMB no not the word i mean curse word..... GOD DAMMNIT CAN'T TYPE!!!! THE F BUTTON thats right that key you press to interact with all the doors and cars and loot Doors you feel like you have your hands taped to your back and your trying to open the door with a giant erection. it's that bad sometimes you click it and wait a few seconds then click again because it couldn't have worked but then it opens and you try to run out and then it closes and smashes ur erection in the crack of the doorway and all you can do it take your computer outside and proceed to beat it with a sledgehammer. you notice I complained and made a lot of references there it's because of all the extra time I had to think about how i was going to about opening doors and getting into cars while waiting 3 5 seconds ever mother ing time u hit the f button in this game!!!!! and yeah you hit it a lot a one story house usually at least mmmmm 4 times that's 12 20 seconds of waiting loot four houses 48 80 seconds but you don't even have a helmet loot eight more and hop in a car 108 172 seconds waiting doesn't seem like that big of a deal now does it 3 minutes of a game even if u make it to number 1 it's usually a 30 min game that's nearly a 10th of your playtime just sitting there waiting for doors to open? well play ten games a day now that was 30 minutes of your very important life lost watching a door stare at you or a character sit watching a vehicle sitting still while all the ing loosers are shooting you in the back laughing at the pleb using is small to open a door and slipping on the handle. Play 10 days a month that's 5 hours lost sitting at doors. Get millions of people around the world to play your game and stare at doors .... priceless. laugh at us all you want pubg I know your doing this as an evil plot to ruin our lives I don't even want to go to the bathroom in real life because I'm afraid i won't be able to open the door after playing this game.

2017-05-13,0,0,191,True,Recommended,Brilliant game little glitchy on occassion but for an Early Access this is minimum and quickly fixed. Definitely worth the money to buy the game it's addictive and great to play single player or duo or in a group (4/5 max i think). There is some choice language in the lobby so i'd perhaps save the game for older players or people who are ok with their kids swearing and virtual killing for fun! It's an awesome game can't fault the graphics really bar a few glitches it's pretty flawless for the stage it's at.

2017-04-22,0,0,492,True,Recommended,TL DR This game is so addicting and fun to play but it lacks overall quality of matches.I've played quite a bit of this game since release and I must say i've enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. The balance of weapons armor and vehicles has been exucuted quite well however they still do have some work to do on some things.Overall doesnt seem like any particular world spawned item is overpowered which is very important in a game like this. Crate dropped items are good enough to try and attempt to get if dropped near you but not too overpowered where its an automatic win. Crate drops also create areas of intense battle at times which can be frustrating but very rewarding. Some problems I have with the game are general server issues which include random DC's rubberbanding and walking in place. Cheating is an unfortunate part of the game while this isn't the devs fault it still makes the game that much more unenjoyable. Terrain is a pretty big problem when trying to drive you might be driving on what looks to be a flat field you hit a tiny bump and your flying 90 degrees into the air flipping the car on its back. The circle is the last issue I have while it is a practical idea for this type of game it lacks the right kind of skill based mechanic I desire.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Then pull your parachute and realize you haven't thought this through and you're already hearing gunfire. Run towards the nearest house to either find full body armor + helmet and a full auto machinegun with ammo or a can of energy drink. Then if you survive that you also have to frantically battle against the clock in the mid to late game while a glorified electric circle slowly closes in on you to crush your dreams. After playing 20 games you fight even make it into the top 10 by sitting in the house you started in with a shotgun because the safezone decided to center on you. Don't worry you'll get shot by someone with the vector. Then after 50 hours you're a battle hardened veteran of the game and you win.

Everythings not perfect and sometimes when stuff gets released to a large crowd something unpredictable happens the part that makes or breaks it is the devs response to said issues. As for the ""Micro Transactions"" They put a crate out there which can be bought free (With in game points) but cost $2.50 USD to open the case with proceeds going to CHARITY and the FIRST Tournament prize pool for the game and will be removed at conclusion of said tournament. People complaining about this and saying they arent putting the time into fixing a game that gets weekly and monthly patches to improve it are dumb.

2017-10-13,0,0,147,True,Recommended,"After seeing all of the negativity surrounding the recent updates of this game and being a recent player to the game I'd like to put my point across. Firstly the gameplay mechanics are by no means polished but for an ""EARLY ACCESS"" game I feel people are expecting too much especially with having to provide servers and optimisation for millions of people playing the game at once. Now I havent been around this community very long and at the time of this review I have 40 Hours on record and I have won two games its so rewarding and I feel thats why the player base is so large.The optimisation of the game isn't the best I still get texture bugs on medium settings with and i7 and a 960 4GB and I would only recommend this game if you feel your computer can run any modern title In my opinion the developers havent taken the best approach to this game but they are developing new maps modes and mod support So your paying for an ever expanding game at this point in time and I do feel that this game will only get more popular than it already is.So finally I would recommend this game but only to people with low expectations for an Early Access title and a rather good perfoming computer I'd say an i5 upwards and a GTX 750ti 760 thats until the optimisation is fixed anyway.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-02,0,0,447,True,Recommended,This game is fantastic and has already seen some amazing improvement such as new weaponry physics and optimization coming from it's developers at Bluehole 13 updates since it's first day that was only a few months ago is insane. Of course there are some things wrong with the game such as crashes that seem to happen alot when too much of your GPU is being used by other apps but hopefully it will be changed soon. Sure the game needs some better optimization still for people with lower end PCs but it still runs fine on mine (GTX745 Intel Core I5 I run the game at about 40 FPS). Some things are still excusable because the game is still in early access as long as it doesnt stay that way forever like its battle royale counterpart H1Z1.

2017-07-03,0,0,183,True,Recommended,For a game in early development I must say this game is quite the experience. Every time you spawn into the game you have a completely unique experience whether that means dying immediately or getting all the way to 1st place.Pros Random loot spawn you never know what you'll get. Lots of weapons/attachments and more on the way. Large Area map to hide on until the force field swallows everything whole. Fresh Loot from dead bodies The ability to link up with friends in duo or Squad mode. Very few glitches i've experienced Vehicles to drive and run people over with Beautiful graphics that only keep improving Great physicsCons Sometimes you die immediately The game does lag sometimes Some areas don't spawn good loot Heart attacks heart attacks everywhere The random screaming in languages I don't understand. Those guys who can hit you from a mile away with a tiny pistol Cars flip quite easily.I highly recommend this game it has lots of weapons and lots of addons to the weapons it's always a surprise what you'll find and it's always nerve wracking when you find other players in game to shoot at.

2017-08-03,0,0,609,True,Recommended,"Review after 150+ hours. Let me start by this. I dont get why people so ing hate the ""microtransaction"" thing. Most of them are like ""Your promise was lie."". First I was little angry too but after devs explained it. I am fine with it. To be honest who the would thought that the game will become so popular and literally nothing goes to devs pockets. Other thing is that people are constantly crying that instead of cosmetics they want new stuff. There is new update every week and BIG update every month and if you didnt get the memo Dev team is really small like super small for this big game.If this is not enough for you to stop crying go play other ""great"" early access games where devs promised ton of content and it never happened. *COUGH* *COUGH* Ark DayZ H1Z1 Conan and other *COUGH* *COUGH*And now the actual review.Pros Really great game to play solo or with friends (If you have any) It is fairly competitive or you can go full casual and just enjoy ing around Guns have really amazing sound and every single gun feels good. For me its pro for some no BUT cars physics is really funny. ! Stay away from motorbike if you dont want to risk dying! Really big gun arsenal. You can choose where you want to land. You dont need to kill anyone to be in top 10 or you can go nuts and kill everyone Difference in armor or helmet not that big if you play smart You can win without even shooting once. (REALLY hard) Updates Weekly smaller one. Monthly bigger oneCons Poor optimization. You can run the game really good on low details but really bad on Hight so dont expect stunning graphics It can get repetitive sometimes. Circle can you up really hard sometimes and you need to run 70% of the match (Really frustrating) and if there is open field in late game and you are unlucky you have 80% chance to lose. (ALWAYS Have some smokes) Push back lag on start of the game sometimes. It goes away around mid gameNeutral stuff Shotguns Never fight shotgun in close combat. It is really frustrating to get 1 shot sometimes You can get easily between 2 enemies so watch out. Sometimes you will get 1 shot by sniper in head. If you want challenge try playing with crossbow.

2017-09-06,0,0,726,True,Not Recommended,"PUBG is a fun game but there are many problems. The game is poorly developed it feels like this game could have been released 10 years ago and would be good at that time. I have never heard of devs banning people for stream sniping and it happens to people who I have heard are not actually stream sniping but happened to kill a streamer. Streamers can make hundreds of thousands a year and more so it is expected that they have some difficulties with fans joining their games. Streamers can hide the server selection their minimap or simply add a 30second delay. Banning a sniper is a good look at how the devs are clearly new to the gaming community. The game has lots of RNG which is okay. I have trouble understanding why they have ""The Red Zone."" From what i have gathered from friends and streamers to put it quite frankly very few people like it. It doesn't serve any purpose other than making a ton of noise and the worst part is that it is not even random. It drops near Po i way more than any other place. I have had 6 back to back red zones in the same place. It can also kill you if you are in buildings sometimes. My biggest concern overall with the game is the lack of effort. It seem's like the devs and owners are doing a classic money grab. The game has i believe over 5m downloads which means that the game has made at least $100m. This money should be used to optimize and make the game smoother for people who dont havwe $400 graphics cards. I get 25 40 frames on this game with a 1 year old card. I also have had situations in the rain where it goes down to 15 20.It's clear that the devs are amateurs who found out that they can't handle a platform this big or simply don't want to.If a top tier gaming company made a battle royale hunger games production i fear that this company and others involved would be destroyed. This game is fun only because its genre is fun not because of the specifics or followthrough on the product.I would rate this game a solid 4/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-06,0,0,171,True,Recommended,Due to the minimal amount of actual content the game has to offer I think it says a lot (for me anyway) that I've played this game for as much as I have. What I mean by that is this the game only has 1 gamemode. Essentially it is a battle royal game akin to games like H1Z1 and you'll play as a customizable character and parachute into a large map along with 99 ish players and battle to the death using whatever you find which is mainly firearms and the occasional melee weapon such as a machete frying pan etc.The game is in early access and therefore has very limited amounts of content basically you have the one game mode in which you can play either with yourself or up to 3 other players. The game is fun whether alone or with friends and both give a different experience to the game as your playstyle changes to keep up with the pace of the game. What I that is so grand about this game is the simple fact that every single game is a new experience atleast that's how it has felt so far. Most of the time I land in a new area I've never been too and it's a always a heart racing dash to the nearest household to look for a gun to kill the guy that landed 10 meters away from you hearing his footsteps as you scavenge. From there it's kill or be killed and if you're victorious you spend the rest of the game either hunting down others and stealing their loot or taking a stealthier approach and avoiding adversaries as you wait for the amount of players to go down as they fight and kill eachother or a mixture of both. Sometimes you die early on sometimes you die at the top ten either way when the game ends it takes only seconds to get back into another one and start the whole exhilerating experience again.Now for what I feel is upsetting about this game it's essentially a gamble in the beginning. Whether or not you'll run into a building with a weapon and even then a half decent one. It is early access so I understand the lack of weapons but some of the guns already in the game are so useless that they might as well be taken out. Firearms like the UMP45 and the GMC are good for around 30 seconds to a minute in game just good enough to kill anyone in the immediate vicinity but then for the next 10 30 minutes the weapons are obselete as the assault rifles blow them away with superioir firepower and accuracy same goes for the pistols as I never use them outside the first minute or so of the game untill I find a better gun which is no hard task btw there's one in every building practically. The last thing I can think of is the fact that the shotguns are way too overpowered. They are everywhere and its as if even the game thinks they are useless hell sometimes I'll even find two in one spawn. But the shotgun us undoubtably the most powerful weapon in the game as it can outmatch any firearm in the game in a close quarters fight (duh) which happens to be every single building in the game so it is an amazing building clearer. It also has a suprisingly long range about 25 meters if I'm not mistaken and generally if someone's within that range no matter how much armor they may have on a single shot from a shotgun will instantly kill them (trust me it's how I've won multiple firefights). Right now the shotgun is the best gun in the game and is also the most plentiful one so next time you see one grab it and prepare to win every confrontation.All in all I think it's a very enjoyable game and I'm so excited to see where the developers take it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,411,True,Recommended,Playerunknowns Battlegrounds If to be a honest i've spent 7 hours in this game and i can tell about it. First of all its an early access game and as always it has a lot of bugs and optimisation is If you have weak computer dont buy it. PUBG contains 90% of H1Z1 features and other 10% ARMA 3. For me both games are cool so the mix of them is very nice. About bugs and laggs Originally posted by Developer We don't expect that early access will last longer than six months . So if you dont want to play with laggs and buggs just wait a half of year and then buy it the price after early access will not change. I have GTX 750 Ti AMD A10 7850K 8GB RAM and my average fps is 40 on low settings and due to very slow loading of textures on start i cant enter buildings. The problem of this i think is an amount of video memory. So as i said before the mix of H1Z1 and ARMA 3 has turned out good. I have no claims to gameplay but iam waiting for adding more features for example hardcore mode (1st person only). This game has very strongly impressed me.You can modify your weapons Time of narrowing of a circle and time of a match isnt huge but you have enough time to loot camp on the border of a circle to kill some running guys to the circle etc Good ballisticsOption to mute general voice chat (Team only) you will understand what am i talking about when you will start the first game.And this is just a small part of good features.DEVELOPERS FIX OPTIMISATION PLEASE!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,78,True,Recommended,First off PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds or PUBG is a Hunger Games themed type of arena combat. You drop in from an airplane find loot and kill other players. While unique In Its own way people still compare It to the other popular tile H1Z1. I personally own both but from what I can tell they're completely different This doesnt mean these games dont need tweaks I can think of numorous bugs poor optimization unfair weapons and most importantly RNG systems (PUBG is really bad on this one). Now everyone's experience with the game might be different but from my standpoint ive been ed over many times by this RNG looting to a point where I get so angry I want to jump out my own window. But when It does work properly and when you do find good loot god Is It satifying.The gunplay In this game is spectacular compared to other titles It feels like you're actually holding the gun and you can feel the kickback. That being said there are some other guns that are god awful. Like I said before there are some bugs in this game that really irritate me from people sniping with shotguns and when shotguns take 4 body shots from 2 meters away to down someone this can ruin the flow of the game greatly and drive people away like It did me for a couple of days.They could really improve on shotguns to make then better and worse to an equal ground they might want to fix a little on the optimization side of this game too. Its understandable because It Is still in early alpha but at some points no matter what cpu ram or graphic's card you will drop frames randomly. One problem I ocasionally run into Is when building don't load in their meshes if you will. this can make you wait around for as long as 10 minutes after landing.TL DR This game has It's up's and down's but Its still worth the retail price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,The game itself can be very fun but there are some fundamental problems with the game that can distract from that fun factor and make it annoying. GreifingAbout half of my matchmaking squad games end up with me dying because of a greifing team member friendly firing upon me. I believe either friendly fire should be disabled or a report system introduced. It ruins the fun of the game to wait to get into a match only to be shot by a jerk team member Menu systemIt seems that the menus are very glitchy and sometimes can take a while to load. Considering some matches can only last a few minutes before being killed it would be better to have snappy responsive menus load quickly so I can get back in the game quicker.I do have some more opinionated issues with the game but they don't effect the fun but rather the balance. Third personI don't personally enjoy third person mode being the default. Boring end gameThis might be due to the third person but usually the end game is everyone laying prone waiting for someone else to pop up. I don't think its particularly fun. TLDR I think this game has potential but some more fundamental fixes &amp systems need to be introduced before I can recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-17,0,0,165,True,Recommended,Going into this game I had no battle royale style experience under my belt and I purchased it because it looked interesting. I didn't expect it to become one of my favorite and most played games in my steam library but I was pleasantly surprised. The game is very impressive for an early access release. There's skill to the gun play and strategy throughout each match. One thing that really is great about PUBG is the ability to just jump into games over and over. Have a bad game? Oh well minimal time lost just ready up and you're back on the field in a flash. Every game brings new experiences and challenges. The game is just overall fun and feels good to play. I look forward to see what the dev team behind it has in store for the future. This isn't to say everything is perfect. There are many bugs and lag issues that happen throughout your time in PUBG. I just personally dont lose my enjoyment of the game due to a laggy server every 5 or so games although some people definitely do. Hopefully any lag or desync that is occuring now will be ironed out in the coming weeks. I highly recommend this game. $30 is a great price for the amount of fun that awaits you on the battlegrounds.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is more on the realistic side of battle royale games you can kill someone or be killed fairly easily which is awesome it makes you think about every move or drive before you make it. Attachments are awesome and something that was so badly needed in h1 but never happened. I can go on and on about how I love the revive or weapon variety but this is something i cant recommend enough.

2017-10-25,0,0,557,True,Not Recommended,The game is in early access but it has been for awhile. Plans are for full release within a couple months. Not sure I can recommend this game in its current state if you plan on taking it somewhat seriously. Need a maybe vote. The server performance and hit registration has taken its toll on my group to the point we dont play much anymore. The game mechanics are fine been playing this game type since it was a mod on Arma 2/3 but much work needs to be done. The graphics are below average but thats not why we play this game. We play this game to be competitive and best other players by using tactics and good gun play. We play for the rush of the end game where player decisions not game/server performance decide the ending. Poor registration and performance is easier to accept in quick respawn games. NOT when you wait for a lobby to fill parachute down spend countless minutes looting to get smashed by someone when you appear to be behind cover or you fire 30 rounds into someone doing no dmg and they turn around and one bang you. I dont mind getting out played....but I hate wasting so much time to just die saying WTF over and over. Frustrating!The game is still fun and all of the Dinners have been pretty darn satisfying. Its a good game it just needs so much work to be ready. Its early access and it feels like it. Will it be better at release? I dont believe so as the performance has gotten worse with every update. You can still have fun just dont take it too seriously and expect alot of bad to go with the good. Is it worth it? Depends on your wallet and personality. I would recommend this if it stayed at its current price on release with a much smoother game experience. I have a feeling it will not get better anytime soon and will probably jump up in price on releae which then I would not recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm pretty upset I don't want hats I want a good game I want a better game. You said you wouldn't then you did why would anyone support you? Is it even legal to false advertise like that?

2017-04-03,0,0,174,True,Recommended,GREAT FUN! but lacking content mainly in the weapons category (The weapons are ok for the early access but i do expect more from the full game.) only one map as of right now but i do believe there are more in the making and the server lag is really bad and the fps is not great ether and there is no sli support as of the time of this review. but gameplay is great solo and duo matches are always fun but i do not recommend the squad option unless you are playing with 4 people you know otherwise getting killed off by you team mates is a very high chance. have a 2 v 2 punch off os absolutely hilarious. but i wish there were more of a gun selection and possibly more vehicle selection.I do recommend this game to those people that loved playing battle royal on arma 3.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Servers are kinda okay ish but there are moments where it lags quite alot . At least for me and my friends. Weapons are nice graphics are nice map is nice. BUT! People intend to CAMP a lot to win so beware of that. Nothing compared with H1Z1 where theres quick action and kills. Here people camp a lot some camp for the good reasons because the game is kinda like Day Z Arma feeling so you need to camp at some points but a whole lot people just camp with a shotgun and one shot you. Other than that i do recommend it seems like it will be an excelent game if the continue to work on it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-16,0,0,309,True,Recommended,I love this game.There were a few optimization issues when I first began playing but once you get that out of the way this game is amazing. And it's in early access not even complete yet. I've played it just about every day and it's a different experience every time. I'd been dreaming of a concept like this hunger games but with guns. And the kills are soooo satisfying too. Can't wait to see what the devs are gonna do next with it looking forward to a first person only mode CTF and even zombies hopefully. So much potential.And as far as the arguments over if this is better than H1Z1 it is. Much better gameplay and much more popular.

2017-03-23,0,0,8,True,Recommended,So far I enjoy this and it looks like it will fill the Battle Royal itch I have been wanting since I became aware of the mod for ARMA. It is early access which is pretty evident but for the first day out it is surprisingly less buggy than full release AAA games. It is a very demanding game especially if using another program to stream or record but playing it without that I didn't have a hard time keeping above 55 frames on my 970/i5 build. If you want this game then I say go for it but if you are on the fence then just wait for the full release since history shows not to trust in early access games ever being more than what they are at launch!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-03,1,1,60,True,Not Recommended,This game is too big for its own good dont get me wrong it has the potential to be good but between bugs that prevent buildings from loading 100% of the way and the laggy stuttering servers its no good right now. I purchased this game knowing full well it hasnt even been out for a year yet so i didnt expect a fully completed optomized game. At first i was fine with the stuttering servers because they used to be few and far between i was also only mildly irritated with the bug that prevented the buildings from loading because i figured fixing game stopping bugs glitches would be the number one priority in future updates. So when a massive 6 or so GB update (if i remember correctly) was released i rejoiced and anxiously waited for the update to finish the content of that update you ask? Two new terrible weather variants Rain and Fog a few updates to the guns and a new rifle. No fixes. The game actually has gotten even worse as its climbed up the steams most concurrent players. dont get this game yet wait for the Devs to actually fix the real problemsRunning simulator 20 10Battle royale 8/10Devs 0 10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-18,0,0,157,True,Recommended,The Matchmaking system is incredibly fast. In most of the other games I played dying in an arena mode was very frustrating since the time spent and time ahead that I have to invest to achieve such progress again was way too much. With PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS fast paced concept losing a match is actually enjoyable. You take it as a lesson and can requeue in an instant. It takes you about 2 3 seconds at max. to find a game if not one of your friends is too stupid enough to forget to click READY every single time.In general you hop in and hop out. You build no real connection to the match as you know it could only take you 10 seconds to be in a complete new round. For me that's a super plus and a real reason to consider buying for anyone that enjoyed the Battlegrounds mods as in ArmA 3 but was disgusted by the time it took to actually participate in a match!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

COMPANY BANS PLAYERS WHOM WRITE BAD REVIEWS! I wouldn't give a company like this any more money. Luckily I've found a few new games from companies that have taken the concept and implemented it properly like EPIC's FORTNITE and Grand Theft Auto's version which I've now been playing a lot.I will be seeking my money back starting with the credit card company. I wasn't VAC banned just banned by the publisher. original review bluehole. more like I don't need to repeat what others have said but if you are playing with streamers and get in the top ten you will automatically be accused of cheating. They need to have a server just for streamers and get them off the public servers. They are ruining the game.I do love the concept of the game. Even like that it came from an indie developer. Now that it is more established really wish it was in the hands of a more professional company that knows how to balance the needs of the public vs. the needs of the streaming few.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-05,0,0,35,True,Not Recommended,This game just like almost any hyped game especially an open world game where it gets kind of boring after a while. There are definetley alot of hackers on this game. Mainly its the problem with walls. You will get a few players who have atleast either walls or aimbot. Streamers made this game famous and once that scene dies this game wont have much attention. After a while it just gets pointless. The only reason i played this game was to get points and collect items. The game is so not ready to be played. I learned my lesson the hardway. I wish i could just refund this game and play a different open world game because this once is not even fund to be honet all it is just the hype and little kids playing it just because they don't got anyrthing better to do in this life.

2017-03-28,0,0,28,True,Recommended,I have never ever touched a BattleRoyal game because i have never feeled the joy of it but after PUB released their Early Access and the explosion of streamers streamed it. I thought i NEED to read about this game stalked the /r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/ and read about how the health of the game was. Watching beginner guides on YouTube.I decided to give it a go to jump in to the BR gamestyle.After around 10 hours in to the game i'm having a blast. It's so intense it's so fun Solo or Duo.Early Access you say? How is it? The first optimization patch will arrive 14th April and it cant come any sooner. It does need to optimize the game. They are improving the servers every day but during peakhours here in Europe it do does lag with rubberbanding effect to it.It's a slight delay when opening doors or while looting it's like a small lag or not as a lagg more like a delay of the action. It does need to improve but the game runs on a UE4 engine so i'm not worried. They are doing a great job so far.It can only get better.I do recomend it! 5/5!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,544,True,Recommended,A very addictive fun to play game. Originally I was off put by the style of game (Survival) but over time have come to really enjoy it. This game really has some of the best moments of gaming when teamed with friends in squad matches and something new and funny always happens.Latley I have seen alot of negative reviews due to micro transactions. Although some people may be angry for unknown reasons I feel this is unfair to the creators. ten to one all the players complaining about this most likely do not own/run thier own business and have next to no idea about ongoing costs to do so. End point with no exceptions is that this is a business and if money isnt being made and saved for future expendature There will be no game to play. Time is money and the employees working on this project deserve to be paid for their time. And ongoing costs need to be taken care of to ensure the longevity of this project.I feel like this game is heading in the right direction although not available on OC servers yet. Applaud the implimentation of first person perspective to the game. Hopfully this will appeal more to the FPS community and bring more players to the battleground.Every round plays different with RNG being a major factor in loot spawning. But that can somtimes be half the fun with not all rounds playing out as expected. Running players down with vehicles is very satasfying equally killing full squads in vehicles while camping a major road/bridge.I give this game an 8/10. To rank higher I would love to see More base spawn weapons rather then air drop creates. More Vehicles (less FWD and more RWD/4WD vehicles). An RPG to kill room campers/vehicles easier for lolz Crazier looking cosmetics the more outragous the better (personal preference). One to two more maps * Not going to complain at all about server reliability or optimization since this is Early Access and to do so would be unfair since this is not at full release.If the game keeps heading in the right direction and at full release some of the above have been implemented into the game and it runs silky smooth may be a 9/10 10/10 game. Will have to wait and see.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-20,0,0,99,True,Recommended,Pros +Tactical intense and overall fun gameplay+Players are able to decide how they want to approach situations with different guns and attachments.Cons Buggy as WAY too many cheaters 3rd person crosshair isn't consistent with 1st person so you actually have to SWITCH PERSPECTIVES to have the advantage at sometimes which sucks since that's not personal preference Your stats and leaderboard won't update until the next day which is really ING STUPID FIX THAT BLUEHOLE YOU S REALLY limited character customization. Shotguns require SO MUCH luck and positioning rather than skill. It's actually t how I need to spend 1.5 seconds with my ak on auto fire to kill a guy when that guy can TAP ME ONCE in the ing BODY and die. WITH ARMOR. NOT EVEN A ING LEVEL 3 MILITARY VEST CAN STOP IT. NERF. ALL. SHOTGUNS. ING RIDICULOUS. So in conclusion this game is absolutely ing . but there's just something about it that pulls me towards it. Everytime I look at my desktop I see PUBG and frown... but still double click on it. Then I play a game and get to the top 10. Next thing I know I started playing at 3 PM and went to sleep at 2AM after a long day's work of updating my kd.That was a story summarizing my love hate relationship with PUBG. I love it and the potential but it's just not ready yet. Honestly all I want is for Bluehole to lay off on adding new weapons and and start fixing major and minor bugs. Hell that's what every negative review wants. This game isn't as skill based as H1Z1 KOTK which means everyone can win but holy hell it needs SO MUCH LUCK. You have to be fortunate and lucky to have a 1.5+ kd on solo and 20%+ top 10 on solo stat like I do. This game enrages me but time will tell.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,334,True,Not Recommended,I wasn't going to review the game but the recent that has happened is kind of forcing me to want to share my opinion. For starters I think the gameplay itself is a blast. However with every new update there seems to be more and more issues. First there was server lag that plagued most of the user base. Now there is constant stuttering and frame drops. The door and sound bugs aren't exactly every person's dream either. Normally I would just assume it was just my computer since I would consider mine about a mid range pc. But with all the complaints on reddit and watching one of my friends have the same problems on a pc much much better than mine it's getting harder and harder to justify recommending the game to someone. And as the cherry on top the fact that the developers are going back on their word about microtransactions and dropping the ban hammer so willy nilly is making me lose way more respect for the company itself. If they can fix the most recent issues and create a more community centric model for their company I will gladly eat my words and start recommending the game again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-01,0,0,411,True,Not Recommended,This game could be fun. But unfortunatley it just isnt the menu and group system is ing its bugging all the time and the game crashes when youre playing so often that it becomes unplayable. The game seems to be coded by some 12 yearolds with braintumors. Also gameplaywise you get punished for taking fights with other groups you are constantly forced into bad positions by the circles shrinking so fast. You cant stop for 1 min to fight another group cause youll both just end up dead by the circle. Ofc the circle system is needed for the game to progress but the way it is now just takes away the point of the game the gunplay. Litterarly 80% of all late game is rushing head on into your opponents like a retard cause the circle cucks you every time if you win its mostly because you get lucky with the circle and not cause your a better player. this Im out!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-07,1,1,73,True,Not Recommended,Games super clunky. Movement is clunky. Terrible aim down sites mechanics with the fake 3rd person ADS. Goodluck hitting any shots in this game.

Make sure you aim down your sites properly not in 3rd person and then hit shift to hold your breath otherwise you'll never know why the you arent hitting them. Never know where your getting shot from either. Aim punch is garbage. Also most useless revive system.. If you get downed by people don't expect to live EVER.. enemies can and will ALWAYS kill you instantly. They need a ing grace period to getting knocked even just 10 seconds would be amazing.

2017-05-11,0,0,214,True,Recommended,This game is lots of fun. I usually approach multiplayer games with the idea that every Euro I've payed translates into one hour of game time as a baseline. With this game I've reached that baseline so here's the review + Good fun on your own in duos and squads of three or four players.+ You're free to play as you want fast paced drops onto the military base and straight dives from the plane scavenger style games where you hunt for cars on the road to go for far out places or fly directly toward them to be stealthy or aggressive.+ The gun fights are fun there is a decent selection of weapons and attachments. Yet even more so I enjoy planning out my route constantly making adjustments to it and looting gear. + The map. There's lots of variety to be found here. Depending on the plane trajectory the games always play out very differently. One game a place might mean a massive battle and the next free safe loot.There's also a learning aspect here. As you play the game you start to recognize the towns villages and intersections how they connect to one another and their properties (i.e. sightlines) however the loot is randomized.+ The shrinking battlefield guarantees a timely endgame and makes for intense fights.+ The endgame is also varied as sometimes you'll be fighting on a level field with only trees to give you cover and other times it will be in the center of a big city or ruins. Due to poor planning or poorly timed run ins you might end up having to run through nowhere's land for several minutes straight before barely making it out alive underequiped and in awful position for the next phase. Generally there's not much feeback. It's hard to make out where your bullets end up unless they hit the target (which results in a visible spray of blood). After over thirty hours I still have no clue how to use the zoning properly or the general range of my weapons how much to lead at what distance etc. . . . A simple practice range would do the trick. It's also not obvious how Energy Drinks and painkillers work and sometimes you'll die outside of the zone because you didn't properly estimate the time it takes to heal up and the amount of damage the zone deals. As a casual you might never learn. Game breaking bugs. Had a friend jump down the stairs while I was moving up and as a result he cratered and was stuck. Lots of other bugs involving fall damage vehicles teleporting doors and so on. Poor fps and lags albeit playable. The two markers bug I'd prefer more functions for the map such as markers for spare loot zone movement plane trajectory looted buildings players vehicles directions . . .All in all it is a great game that has the perfect mix of relaxed and intense gameplay. Even in its current state it is heaps of fun and as (or if) they fix the bugs and framerate it will only get better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,298,True,Not Recommended,I've been playing PUBG for a few weeks now and while I really enjoy most of the game I can't stand how much cheating is going on. PUBG recently banned 25k players but that isn't even a drop in the bucket. If I would have known I would have not even dropped $30. TONS of players with Aimbots and ESP. Like in a given 100 people playing a match I would hazard a guess at least 5 are hacking. Even if it's only 1 per match it still ruins the game because they can practically hit you across the map throuh a building and know where you are. Most likely with a head shot.

My fiance gifted this for me for my birthday I was a bit 'eh' about it because over all it looks like a sweet game and lots of fun plus my friends have it and say while it can be buggy its a good time. Plus the reviews were all hit and miss. But since it was a gift I gave it a go. Thanks Bae.First off it is buggy as textures take too long to load there is clear server lag things glitch often and it crashes from time to time so there is still a lot of work to be done for the game. Keeping in mind however that this game is early access and only $30 (US) I let those things slide (for now). OMG the griefing and harassment though! Geez! But it is kind of excpected from these sorts of games so if you don't like to be picked on or trolled in voice chat turn that noise off. There are hackers but I only came across one so far hopefully they crack down on that further.This whole thing with killing streamers and getting banned sounds odd concerning and a bs thing for developers to do but it hasn't happened to anyone I know and hopfully they fix that cause even though I didn't buy it I don't really wanna be banned because I out did someone who just happens to be streamingWhen it does work it is a great time trying to survive to the finish escpecially with your friends and nothing feels greater then over coming all obsticles to come out on top.This game is only half a game and I would recommend waiting until a full release or at lease until they've fixed a majority of bugs and add a bit more content. If i didn't have it gifted to me that is most likely what I would have done.While I am having a lot of fun playing this game with my friends there are too many cons for me to recommend this. Even though it is half the price of major games it feels like you're getting less. If the game was around the $15 $20 price tag I'd say go for it and see what you think but until alot of things can be fixed or a full release happens save your wallets for something else.

2017-08-11,0,0,178,True,Recommended,This game is one of the most fun games I've played in a while.NOTE TO NEW PEOPLE You will see many comments regarding micro transactions and how Bluehole and Playerunknown said they will not be adding them. However these micro transactions are simply for cosmetics and the money goes to fund the new tournament being held!PUBG is not just a shooter or a PvP game it's a battle royal. I know that doesn't sound very interesting but battle royale games that are made well (this one) are full on horror games. The fact that I could walk into a house while someone is looting it scares the out of me. I really have a great time playing this game especially in the duo and squad modes. The only problem I have with this game is that it takes a lot to run well. I can run this game at 60 fps on low settings but I'd like to go higher. Although I have high hopes for this game for it has responsive devs who update this game all the time. BUY THIS GAME!! MrToasti,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-28,0,0,1065,True,Recommended,Arma+CS but better. First time playing a battle royale style game. Had heard a lot about the mod in Arma and H1 also but I was usually playing epoch or other mods. I havent been able to stop playing this game in last 3 4 days since I got it. It gives me the feel of the old cs 1.6 that I have played more than 4000Hours. Graphics or nothing shiny in this but the gameplay is Spot ON! For me this game is like the perfect blend of Arma and cs. Both of which I have been playing a lot. For me this is the game of the Year ! But wait its still in early access. Imagine where this game would be an year from today. The reputation of the developer behind the game is already well know. If you read my review this far dont think anymore Just BUY it !!Edit 1000Hours into this game now and its still fun to play with friends and with the new maps coming it will get even better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-08,0,0,470,True,Recommended,I am going to make this as un biased as I possibly can. This game is an amazing KOTH styled arena game simple as that. Are there bugs? Of course it's early access. Is it worth it because the bugs are minor at best? Yes. I've been hear and seeing people just simply go bonkers of micro transactions and all I have to say about it is this. You don't want to spend money on a charity or to fund a tournament? Then don't it's simple. It's all comesmetic and nothing is really worth buying so save your money and everyone's time with your complaint. Now that I have that out of the way here's some quick pros and cons Pros The game is fast paced and quick Guns are realistic and powerfulThe landscape is jaw droppingThe que times are so short I can't even use the bathroom in between matches Cons Minor bug issues (I've encountered 2 since I started playing)Huge learning curve Network Lag pauses match for a couple of seconds All in all it's an easy 10/10 seeing how i bought this game 4 days ago and already have 60 hours easy into the game and my friends and I simply can't get enough Now on another note. Quit giving a good game a bad rating because your butt hurt. The game is good and you should let people know the good and the bad and stop acting like butt hurt children.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-08,2,1,265,True,Recommended,Incredibly good game especially for early access games. Combines the realistic combat feel of Arma games with the hectic yet tactical gameplay a BR style game gives you. People might not agree with me but the movement is really damn good for a game like this it feels fluent allthough not being able to jump over a small wall might be annoying allthough Vaulting is being introduced in an update later down the line!Combat feels incredible getting shot at running through an open field hearing the (Incredible may I add) bullet sounds zoom past your ears trying to figure out where you're getting shot at it really gets the heart pumping. The guns are hard to handle giving them a very needed learning curve once used to handling them they can really be powerfull. A thing I personally love is that the guns don't just feel like reskins that you can attach more or less attachments too the guns feel different. A Scar feels COMPLETELY different from an AK for example. Attachments have a meaning since they can completely change the way a gun plays find a suppressor and suddenly you'll find yourself sneaking around hunting people find a compensator and don't worry about running into gunfights since you'll be able to control the recoil nicely.Sound is incredible the level of detail in every sound is very nice allthough certain sounds can bug every so often but that is expected for an Early access game. Sound is a very VERY important tool in games that try to give a realistic experience and the team did it right. It's not as easy as hearing a gunshot hearing its from your right side and turning around and spotting the enemy bullets actually fly past you and every so often you'll find yourself looking at where the bullet impacted rather than where it was fired from.Overall for 30$ this game is definitely worth the money especially if you can get some friends together to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-09,1,1,427,True,Not Recommended,I've put almost 300 hours into this game. I still play regularly but I can't recommend anyone buy it. Cheaters poor optimization desync and lag. You'll encounter all of these within almost every match. Bluehole seems to not really care about it or about what they players are saying. At this point we have to assume Bluehole has taken the money and run with it. This is solidified with the announcement that they are working on a new game. Why not finish the one you started first Bluehole?I'd say save your money until the devs fix all of these problems. Until then I'd recommend Fortnite BR. IT's faster paced better optimized and more fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,215,False,Recommended,Battlegrounds is in my opinion the best battle royale game out right now. I've played H1Z1 and can say that Battlgrounds is a lot better. There are more guns armor and overall customisation and depth. If you have played the BR game modes in ARMA or H1Z1 this game should feel familiar. The gun play is great and satisfying and a lot better than H1Z1 since there isn't anyone jumping over your shots and blasting you with a shotgun. The inventory system is basically the same as ARMA.Battlegrounds really shines when you play it with a full team or another friend. There isn't a better feeling in this game when your team has an all out gunfight with another team. Battlegrounds will also get your heart pumping which H1Z1 didn't seem to do to me as much. However Battlegrounds is not optimized very well. I play at 2560x1440 with a GTX 1070 i5 6500 and 16gb of ram and have a mix of 40 70 fps with a mix of high and ultra settings. There is a lot of lag at the starting island and when you start the game. I still recommend this game since it is the most fun battle royale style game out.

They have updates constantly There are new guns and new maps in the works from what I hear! The optimization is a little off but I'm sure they will fix that with time. I've heard people complain about hackers here and there and while I have met some very ""questionable"" opposition this game is not rife with it if it were I wouldn't have won ANY games.

I used to have a smooth ride in cars but now you can really see the framerate even after turning a few settings down. All the lag and rubberbandi g remain. The game still has its moments of fun but for a game that has brought in 100s of millions of dollars this is a pathetic excuse for a full release.Edit Game is steadily getting worse/more broken.

But this game cannot figure out how to load geometry ruining any chance of us actually playing an aggressive early game. Crashes continue to happen. Server crashes happen often enought to be annoying especially after 25 minutes of getting god tier loot but having no kills. In game ads now after selling 10 million copies. This developer has stated that he doesn't really care about games and you can tell. He made his mods then he made his game with the quality of a mod and it doesn't look like he has the skill or is willing to hire people with the skill to make this game actually work now. Total piece of crap at this point.Original review below Good concepts and decent mechanics BUT the developers dont seem to be acknowledging that their basic netcode doesnt work. Nothing like spending 30 minutes in a game then dying to lag spikes. Nothing like being in the top 5 and getting a .2 second lag spike every time you point a gun at someone making your 2nd thru 5th shots impossible to land. Nothing like getting the drop on some loser from behind only to get a fat lag spike dropped on you so hard that you lose all advantage. Seriously dont support this game right now. Close range combat is nearly impossible and medium to long range is a crapshoot whether or not you will have a lag spike. Should have known. Early access is for devs that need to figure out hownto finish making a game. Another crook dev.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-30,0,0,158,True,Not Recommended,So how this game works is.....Jump out a planeWait 45 seconds for the buldings to render and the server lag to go away....by that point everyone else has guns.Die soon after rendering buildingsRepeat.I really like this game it has so much potential to be a brilliant game. But it has 1000km to go before it is a decent game the servers feel like they're 2 lemons with some wire attached the weapon damage is so inconsistent (i have had multiple occassions of 5 or 6 hits for them to turn and shot me twice and I die). The hackers in this game toxic being shot through walls and trees is not fun.I understand this game is still in early access but enough people have bought this game they should have the money to finish it.....or at least make the servers useable.I'd love to give this game a thumbs up but there are way to many problems that need fixed before it can have it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Until these basic concepts of not treating players like special snowflakes because they want to make a career streaming and don't put something in the game if you don't want it to happen are understood.

2017-06-06,0,0,71,True,Recommended,Bought the game yesterday and I just want to get back to it over and over again.PROS 100 players matches (huge player base make finding games instand so you can play over and over again without much waiting time) variety of weapons with customization (they'll probably add more in the future) vehicles aren't indestructible and require fuel to work huge map character customization voip available (but possible to turn it off if you are tired of kids screaming in their mics) seperated queues for solo duo and groups matchs don't last too long (restriction of map happening at a very decent rate &gt low enough to let you loot quick enough to avoid having games that last 1h because of people hiding) tactical/stealth playing (noises are very important and you can get really better cuz of it).CONS graphics aren't very nice and everyone keep them low to render as less things as possible (boost of FPS and less stuff blocking your sight) alot of glitches and some lag (but it's early access right now so they'll probably work on it til full release) high learning curve (at beginning you'll never understand why you get killed wont spot much players will spend forever to understand what you looted and what you want to keep and what you want to throw away etc)NEUTRAL Rage personnally this game doesnt make me rage because there is 1 chance on 100 that I win the game... so you're not going for win you're just trying to survive as long as possible and if you take down 1 2 targets you already feel happy.. I feel less like being competitive (therefore raging) in this game than in games like Overwatch. So it's not making me angry.. when I die I usually try to understand what I did wrong laugh a bit then exit and start a new round... all this based on solo queue I have no idea how it could be in duo and group since have no friends playing yet.EDIT Me not raging could also be due to my addiction to Bob Ross that I'm listenning at while playing.. but not too loud.. you want to hear those happy little footsteps if you plan on not dying too early!Overall I'll give a positive review. The game is early access so it still has glitch and bugs and features missing. They could have a bit more guns but I'm pretty sure they'll add both guns and weapons part in future. They said they would not increase price on release so you can easely wait longer before buying and wont be penalized for it in term of price. Due to high popularity righ now it's very likely this game will end up in something good because devs have more than enough funding to get going. I feel like it'll be better than H1Z1 (this is probably why everyone left H1Z1 to come play this instead). I'm having great fun and it works fairly well on my 4 years old computer (GTX 760 and I 3350P 3.1Ghz 16Gb RAM).If you are not sure you'll like it you can also purchase try and refund if you don't feel like it's your kind of game or if it doesnt work well or if it makes you rage too much!

If they do I will recommend it but for now I'd say save your money until some of the kinks get ironed out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-04,0,0,125,True,Recommended,One of the most addicting tense games I've played in years.It's fast paced and semi fair with the Random Number Generator (RNG) being not too bad most of the times. Even if you have the top tier end game stuff if you don't plan ahead and play the odds right you'll be forced to run into the zone out in the open.Plan ahead and calculate your odds.With some team members and coordination it's too tense.Your odds of winning are low. Approximately 1 5% with basic tactics. So whenever you win it feels incredible.Have you ever played that sniper level (All Ghillied Up) in Call of Duty 4? This is that game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-15,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,"I've only played the game for 2 hours so take my review lightly but I do have some real concerns about the game.MISLEADING SPECS The system requirements only list a GTX 660 as the minimum required to run the game but I must say this is very misleading. Although 30 FPS is a playable framerate this game requires so much attention to detail that it is almost impossible to have fun in this game without a smooth 60 FPS throughout. This is a huge issue because not even a GTX 1050 could handle the game at the lowest possible settings without averaging 30 35 FPS. I found myself constantly handicapped against players that could clearly navigate better due to better framerates being able to run and gun hide and quickly adapt to a scenario without missing a beat. I found that I was not alone either as I played the ""Squad"" version online where it pairs you with 3 other people as a team and found other players had trouble quickly getting into and out of firefights. While this could be the result of inexperience with the game the bottom line was that I couldn't find myself playing at 30 FPS and having fun.KIDS SPAM VOICE CHAT I found myself having to mute everyone in the game as it wouldn't allow me to mute specific people talking in the FFA version of the game. I would say a good 30% of the community are little kids and the ones with mic's constantly spam and annoy the living **** out of me. This is also made a larger issue because the game clearly has a high learning curve with no introductory tutorial and having to play with limits your ability to learn with others.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is a lot of potential additional content with every hope being it doesn't turn into a cash grab like the other title we all know. Judging by PlayerUnknown's background and reason for development of Battlegrounds it seems unlikely that this game will fade fast. That being said even as it currently is 30$ is a more then reasonable price.There are a few gripes I have about it that seem to be shared with a lot of other players which is the lack of realistic servers(the 3rd person really needs to be taken out) and of course server stability fixes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-30,0,0,340,True,Recommended,This game is an upgraded H1Z1 king of the kill that is more tactical and realistic. The game is extremely buggy as it is brand new and in early access therefore I can't recommend this to someone looking to buy a complete game. I would say their current version is the skeleton of what the finished product will be.Stand out Pros Weapon modifications Tactical gameplay results in intense firefights (Or you die out of nowhere with no chance to fight back ) Combat (for the most part) is smooth Vehicles aren't over powerd and are best suited for traveling rather than combat Gas moves quick to keep games moving sometimes it is annoying but overall it enhances gameplayStand out Cons Losing connection to servers FPS drops and lags Picking up and switching guns is buggy half enough to be noticable Map is decent could have a much more creative design Weapons withing a class (ie. Assault rifles Sub Machines guns snipers pistols and shotguns) could have more distinct trade offs that defines what the strengths of each specific gun are compared to the counter parts within the class.Parting ThoughtsPersonally I enjoy this game and look forward to the developers improving the game.

2017-09-04,0,0,103,True,Recommended,Not sure why there are so many salty reviews considering this is still in early access.I've currently got over 60 hours in the game and I'm still having loads of fun both playing in solo and with friends. Yes the game can be improved in terms of optimisation but to be honest most games I have zero problems. The popularity with this game for me is the balance it provides based on other games I've played previously. DayZ was way too big and slow to get loot but in PUBG depending on where you drop you can be fully kitted out within 10 minutes and already have kills under your belt.Yes it can be frustrating and you might find yourself getting shot time after time but look at what you were doing. Maybe there was a better route you could have taken maybe you should have moved slower or maybe you just need more practice.For me it's the randomness that keeps me coming back. Which direction is the plane going? Where am I going to paradrop with my team? Where can I find a vehicle? Where's the circle going to minimise down to? All the mechanics make the game very challenging and also fun. I believe with more maps better anti cheat measures and new features this game is going to be with us for a very long time.Seriously if you haven't got this game give it a go.

Coming from an exlusivley almost only hardcore fps/realism shooter gamer I will try to give a fair unbiased opinion on the stated of the game so far here we go.So lets start with the gameplay for the average gamer this game should be extremely easy to pickup and get the hang of with the current game mode one jumps into a cargo type jet after screaming &amp quot "" or any other profanities at other players and puffing they're chests you then skydive at your choice on any point you choose during the flight if you don't get kicked out automatically with all the other AFK's and parachute or technically HALO into a position of your choosing on the rather large map filled with military complexes bunker systems farmlands or towns along with typically 99 other people...it is at this point you get your into gear and start checking for loot spawns which can be quite varied but overall very well done after aqquiring a weapon grenades like molotovs m67 frags stuns or smokes some clothing meds and a backpack. one then either premptively decides to or gets caught in a blue wall of your HP every few seconds or put simply a circle which closes you and any others players closer and closer at the cost of being outside dying slowly or quickly depending on the stage the circle is into the game.it is this very system which unless you are very stealthy and good at avoiding players will push you into firefights with other players at varying angles and situations.You are your decision in this game you forgot to pickup that med kit? guess what you've now gotta find one of a dead player who ran into your house wanting to put a 12 gauge shell in your face while the circle eats away at the 50% hp he took of with one hit your lucky if he had that bad a shot.The game is like so f******g gruelling and aggressive to everyone that every factor plays in in a splendid way yes luck plays a part but it is very miniscule when talking of the actual game balance and mechanics usually its you your decisions your hard drive failing due to too many porn videos or that crappy internet you've been having to deal with because your parents spike it up and down with they're 20 browsing tabs they leave open on they're phone.So the quick verdict then...will I have fun with this game?You will you most definitely will just make sure you don't have crappy connection(servers NA SA EU OC/AUS/JAP I don't f******g know oceana or what you call it ok?)and that if you have a potato of a machine that first you learn how to work with that system and that your not half clueless with how a PC can be put into optimal use for this application and that if that is the case that you don't write a bad review because your salty you bought a game which won't run on your toaster with multiple bad sectors a clogged CPU cooler and a 2001 APU or some s**t that is probably well under the recommended/minimal specs.This game will make your heart jump up to like 144bpm at some times and at some times it may make you want to throw your PC against a full speed truck but it's worth every bit of cash I payed for it and the Devs are definitely doing a f'ing A grade job and making a difference to not only the game they're making but also to the image of gamers read the latest dev blog to see they raised something around 200000$ for charity...Player Unknown...bloody well done salute!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,57,True,Recommended,First things first 100% worth the price. I've never enjoyed an alpha game as much as I've enjoyed PUBG. At first I had worried if I paid too much for the game but after a couple hours those worries went away. This game is absolutely awesome. It's everything you look for in a Battle Royale! Oh and the car mechanics WORK! unlike other games. The gun sounds are 95% accurate in terms of direction although they did release an update to give that extra 5%. Seriously reading the upcoming patch notes I can already tell PLAYERUNKNOWN and the Devs will work so hard to make this game at its full potential. It's not perfect but holy smokes it's close. I beg you all to give it a go you won't be disapointed. I love what I'm playing so far. Please Dev's dont screw this up. 10/10 more than worth the asking price,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,339,True,Recommended,PUBG is a solid Battle Royal game with survival elements. Currently in early access the game is being developed with community feedback. The game can be played in either first or third person perspective. Squad sizes are limited to four players and servers are limited to 100 players.Even in its early stages the game provides very fun and intense gameplay. The gunplay is very accurate and the map works well and is quite detailed. Everything flows together very well. You don't end up spending half of your game organizing your inventory because of their quick gear swapping system. It currently needs optimization so you will probably need to tweak the settings to have a smooth game experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you play it you know you get that feeling that the game becomes a part of you an extension of you. The more you play it the more you wanna keep on ! A lot of people actually on that game because of cheaters desync and stuff. So far I encountered 1 cheater and never had any major issue so I don't get why people are hattin on it.

2017-11-12,2,1,413,True,Not Recommended,Hackers and cheaters appearing way more recently making every game you play a hell of a time. Well at least for me it was. I was in a game where i was watching a air drop and i just suddenly got headshot with a scar which came all the way from mylta across the ocean. Only one shot was fired and that one shot was the headshot that killed me. I have played this game for 200 plus hours previouisly until recently I have only played for a few hours due to the amount of hackers making me feel playing this game is a waste of time as winning the game is near impossible with all these hackers around. Sorry Bluehole but Im gona leave a negative review and refrain from this game until these hackers are banned and removed from the game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-17,0,0,119,False,Not Recommended,It's okay but would enjoy a feature of where you are placed in games with people your skill level. For example being placed in a squad with people who are playing the game for the first time isn't the best experience.

2017-06-22,0,0,60,True,Not Recommended,The gameplay is extremely fun. Fast paced intense rewarding shooting feels good extremely fun to play with friends and it has awesome small mechanics that makes the game more enjoyable. However in the state it is in right now I can't recommend it. The optimization is beyond terrible. At lowest graphics I still have problems getting the game to run above 40 fps. FPS is important in games like these if you can't get a good framerate then it's going to fu*ck with your aim. Also if you just meet the minimum requirements for this game then you aren't going to be able to run it whatsoever. I feel as if you need a really good computer to get decent frames. Also I understand the game is in Early Access however the optimization for the game is a huge issue and is ruining my overall game experience.I'd wait until the game moves further along in development and when the dev team optimizes it a bit more before buying.

2017-07-31,0,0,657,False,Not Recommended,Update 3 So now it's out of Early Access and is totally unplayable due to a frame rate that chugs on a 1080 if even one other player is in your FOV. Oh and if the dropped frames don't kill you relax. A Chinese hacker with a 500+ ping will be along to finish the job. There's no excuse for the continued rampant hacking and lack of region lock on the servers.GG BlueBalls.Give this game a hard pass. The devs got paid and that's all they care about.TL DR WAIT UNTIL OUT OF EARLY ACCESS DO NOT BUY NOW.UPDATE 2 Game still runs like dongs. Developer is not releasing anymore large updates untill after the holidays.WAIT UNTIL OUT OF EARLY ACCESS.UPDATE For the last 48 hours game is now crashing to the desktop every 5 minutes for customers with AMD cards PLAYERUNKNOWN cannot be bothered with a fix because he's busy getting fellated by thirsty fanboys at PAX.I've got 60 hours in at this point and while it's been fun I don't advise anyone drop $30 on it at this point.Main issue being that due to shady developers with less than transparent motives you have no idea what you are buying. No idea what what the final release will look like.The game is still poorly optimized and the developer/publisher has made and broken multiple commitments with regards to features and paid cases. They seem more concerned with throwing a $350K tournament than finishing the game.Also better hope you don't get the drop on a prominent streamer because then they start crying that the ONLY way that a mere player could have gotten the best of them is by stream sniping. If that happens enjoy your ban because the lead dev feels the need to be personally involved with bans and has no idea about how to manage a community other than catering to the big name streamers. Then he'll probably make a Twitlonger about his crippling PTSD from when a stream sniper kicked sand in his face and stole his girl back in college so pls no bully.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-16,2,1,462,True,Recommended,this is a very fun game and very addictive as well but has some issues like fps and bugs that i hope will be taken out soon and somethings like knowing where u are getting hit from would be good by maybe adding better sound where the bullet was fired becuase at the moment it just sounds like the sound is in any direction. But all and all the main things like combat are amazing and the map is very well made and the amount of weapon picks is very good so is the car picks also and i do hope they keep adding new weapon and cars but altogether this is an amazing game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,264,True,Recommended,PUBG is a very fun game that gives players heart pounding moments. There are however some very big issues that the game needs to fix (I know the game is still in early access so hush child).The game is mostly well designed. The gunplay the intense moments and the duos/squads is all done very well. There are however three things that in my opinion really ruin the game sometimes. 1) The poor optimizationThe optimization of the PUBG has gotten much better since the launch. There really isn't much to say regarding this. I would suggest asking people with the graphics card that you have and see how they run the game before you buy it. The game was and still might be more heavy on the CPU. If you're in larger cities of the game and starts lagging it can take away your ability to fight and aim properly to eliminate other players. This can be annoying. 2) The serversThe PUBG servers are pretty bad. In the lobbies it can be very frustrating to not be able to see who and who isn't in your squad or the lobby UI not working and having to refresh it many times or losing connection midway throught the game. This can be annoying. (Side note They did add the feature to rejoin the game if you crash which is great) 3) RNG (Loot and Safe Zone)RNG in the game will have a major impact on if you win or lose the game. The loot on the map has chances to have better loot in certain areas (Military Powerplant etc..) this is not my problem with the game. You can go into several houses at a time and not find a single gun and another person can walk into another house with end game loot and curb stomp you. The next problem is the safe zone. If you're in top ten and you don't get a safe zone spot with no cover you will more likely have a more difficult time winning the game. These things are annoying.TL DRHas problems but very fun to play with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,408,True,Recommended,"This is gonna be a longass post. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a fresh breath on the battleroyale side of the gaming community its more advanced than at least a dozen other games in the scene that have mid range player bases it has a great open world and system to add to your liking. And they finally callobrated the game so people with higher end pcs with better cores and graphics cards dont have to be restricted by the game and have lower fps I was finally able to crank up my setting to ultra and then have 70 fps avg. Its in early access so do expect a bug or two every now and then but I only experienced a bug once while others have a dozen of times. Its obvious this game will go down as a great one the fact the game grew just on streamers alone is amazing but there two sides of the penny. The rules are very strict like private school white kid strict. Dont bother honking your horn ever. You'll just be accussed of stream evading and if you kill a streamer its a 40/60 chance you'll get suspended or banned for alleged ""stream sniping"" its really aggravating to the community. Now the bugs and glitches never take advantage of them if they screw someone else not only cause its a move but because you'll (you guessed it) get suspended or banned. Now the fact that the devs introduced microtransations is annoying to the community I myself dont mind since I will never bother with that but the fact that a skirt is $400 dollars is bs I must admit though the fact that you can EARN some of the crates by getting the curenccy is fine by me but the idea that you have to pay for a key for the gamescon crate is its already rare enough and the fact that many people expected this game to be something different since the game is so good for being started by very few people and then breaking their promise on not putting microtransactions and then doing it just pisses the community off but I do like the idea of the fact that partial money will go to charities. Like I said there are two sides and I do recommend this game but I want people to know the whole picture before going in.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,1,1,991,True,Not Recommended,EDIT PUBG team has really let me and many other people down with recent PR moves. Firstly they've falsely banned a person for stream sniping which is ridiculous by itself as it is very hard to prove. It's streamer's responsibility to hide server ID to prevent stream sniping instead of banning people for it they have to take that risk by openly streaming the game its their choice. Secondly PU promised that microtransactions won't be in the game until the full release. I don't have anything against microtransactions themselves but the way they are implemented. I think they are kind of necessary to keep the game up and running for such a big playerbase. But the way they should implement it is like Overwatch did all crates are free and you don't need a key instead u get to buy them with real money. CS GO crates prevent you from getting items at all without paying. It is too much rng. I'll change my review back once these issues are adressed.OLD REVIEW I really enjoy this game the gameplay is crisp there is no desync and everything works as intented. Optimisation is not the best at this very moment however i was able to pull 60 fps of without any problems on my system. I expect that this game has a bright future if it gets developed in 6 months as developers said. Also I really hope that it is not going to end up like other early access games stuck in development for years with patches releasing rarely.I haven't played h1z1 king of the kill so I cannot compare it to that however I have tried arma 3 battle royale and this is in my opinion far more superior both especially in gameplay aspect of the game since there are no fps issues nor weird clunky mechanics.I give this game a big thumbs up!

2017-08-01,0,0,55,True,Recommended,I'm going to CAREFULLY give this a yes. And be short about it. Pros Can be lots of fun no matter if you're the first to die or the 55th to die Always more fun with friends! Every game can be a new experience no matter how many times you play Lots of different strategies to employ and use so it can fit anyones playstyle in games Fast matchmaking wether solo duo or squad TONS of control customization most precise game I've seen with nearly 10 different sensitivity optionsCons Main menu UI is a ing joke and piece of If you NEED refresh buttons on your UI you're doing it wrong. Hitboxes can be wonky melee fighting can be a wild ride of swings and misses even when staring RIGHT AT someone Not yet fully optimized graphically. I run it on Ultra and can run steady 120 fps but dips are abound at random times On that note sometimes you need to restart your game everyother game due to artifacts or other glitches showing up Hackers not really under any control. If one is in the game you'll know Vehicles are really only usefull if you don't hit anything larger than a molecule on the ground and launch yourself into space. The timing with squads before the circle of death starts closing in needs to be longer and heres why If youre not playing solo or duo resources become scarce way too fast. ONE teammate will have A good gun with SOME ammo the rest will have a pistol or a melee and no backpacks on average.That's really my only gripes and likes about it you can jump into a new game as fast as you get KO'd of another which is nice too. Honestly watch a stream or YouTube video or two if you're unsure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-28,0,0,554,True,Recommended,Exellent game even at this early stage be it solo duo 3man or a full team of 4 friends this is a fantastic pvp battle royale game tough to learn from scratch without friends and often frustrating when you die BUT when I die 9 times out of 10 it was because of something I did wrong or could have done better and not the game and I'm cool with that when it's not something I did wrong its usually that I was outplayed or out shot which is also fine tbh. Practice practice practice! I find that unlike alot of other PvP shooters in PuBg If I'm killed I just think 'Damn I should have done XYZ instead that's my fault'. I've noticed this alot. It can be easy to rage at a game but in PuBg it's YOUR choices that shapes the game. You'll know when you did something stupid or look back and think 'Why did I push that guy?' etc.There are sometimes however when you do feel that the game really wants you dead more often than not it's a series of horrible zones to traverse or distance between them. That or landing and searching several buildings and finding nothing of use when an enemy could land and in his 1st builting be armed to the hilt that is a bit frustrating. That being said a skilled player / team can make the best out of a bad situation and still come out on top.Bad zones you can play around by being more aware of the time and distance and allowing making sure you're not cutting the time to get there fine. This can be easier in a team to begin with as there are more of you to keep an eye on the zone situation. Regarding the current game situation at the time of writing WHY OH WHY are they making the Groza 7.62 a supply drop only weapon!? When the VSS which is a deadly deadly gun is so horribly misrepresented in the game anyone who knows the specifics of the real gun or have played S.T.A.L.K.E.R / DayZ will tell you the same. Easy fix make the Groza a semi rare assault rifle with a spawn rate perhaps simular to the SKS maybe? Remove the VSS from standard spawns and make it supply drop only like the M24 and AWM but! Actually represent the weapon properly give it it's corrrect ammunition (9x39mm subsonic) it does not fire pistol ammo irl. Giving it its correct ammo but in a limited quantity like the AWM would prevent it from being overpowered you cannot upgrade the scope past its current (4x?) PSO type and the bullet drop and travel time of the rounds make it difficult to land a shot on moving targets. Surely some other players who are familier with the weapons attributes and how it currently sits in the game meta can agree? /rant.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-03,0,0,586,True,Recommended,"I've been reading through some of the stuff here and I've seen a lot of people doing negative reviews because of the developers. Now I wouldn't say that I'm fully aware of all the things they've done but I'd still like to express how I feel.First I wanna talk about the micro transactions.Is it pay for convinience and how much do the clothing help?I was actually quite suprised that a lot of people complain about this I've been running around in a white t shirt during most of my playtime. And I've never felt like I've been in a serious disadvantage. Most of the time you'll have trees etc as cover. And your clothing won't really decide if you put a bullet between his eyes or not.And the fact that I haven't really been bothered is because you pretty much get money to buy clothes for playing the game. Those Gamescon crates went for like 2 euros while they were available. I think I've been able to get like 18 euros total from just playing pubg and the camo clothes do not go for a lot of money. You can literally buy a black t shirt for 0 05 and a pair of black jeans for 0 06 . The most expensive clothing that you can buy on the market is the infamous mini skirt and that isn't more camoflagued than those 0 06 pants.Yes bluehole has been banning people for reasons.Streamsniping is obviously a problem and I can't say they're doing a perfect job of preventing streamsniping by banning people who have literally no clue that they killed a streamer. But the thing is the people that have been banned have been able to contact the developers and gotten themselfes UNBANNED. They're not s and if you do get banned for no reason whatsoever don't just get mad and quit. Contact them and tell them what happened politely and hopefully you'll get unbanned.Lastly I've read about people complaining that there's too many ""try hards"". And they gave negative reviews because they never win. And I'm sorry to tell you but the sole purpose of this game is to win. The ONLY objective is to be the last one standing. If you can't win because you're not good enough don't expect the developers to make it easier for you.You can't bring your halfassed gameplay and expect to win. This is battleroyale and if you're too casual to even compete with the rest of the community.G I T G U D .Overall I think this game is great. YES it has bugs YES it does crash. But the majority of the games I've played it's been working and It's most definately playable. I get around 40 70 fps on the lowest graphics with it being on 55 65 on average. I've been experiencing very few crashes i've seen some of my friends crash sometimes but they have been able to come back in without any problems. The core gameplay is great!

Of all the alphas I've played I've never seen a development team be so quick to respond to criticism and fix the mentioned issues. This game is extremely well crafted and needs only polishing. With that being said buy it now before it doubles in price upon full release. *Fair warning* for all of you CSGO or CoD lovers prepare to either 1) learn patience and get good at a different style game or 2) cry about ""camping"" and a plethora of other tactics that relate to this game.

2017-08-19,0,0,95,True,Not Recommended,PUBG REVIEW Presentation 4/10 Graphics 2/10Sound 1/10Gameplay 0/10Lasting Appeal 5/10Overall Score 0.4/10That was a joke but here is my actual rant essay The concept of the game is pretty good and it's something I've always wanted to see done well but the game itself so far is massively broken.. There are things that I like about the game The item and looting system is good and the map itself is pretty good. The game has vehicles. I even like the fact that the game has a projectile system as opposed to a hitscan system. The problem with these things is that they simply don't work in a consistent way.. At all. Gun fights are just broken unless you are sniping a stationary target. In every other situation it seems extremely inconsistent and broken. Every once in a while the game works you might land a few headshots or body shots and your opponent will die as expected considering weapon damage and your opponent's armor. But most of the time you will find yourself landing an entire 25 round magazine into someone's chest or shooting them in the head 5+ times with blood spraying everywhere only to get killed by a single bullet. The game is obviously based around RNG which means you will spend the majority of your time getting screwed by crap loot and unlucky circles. Unfortunately gun fights are also RNG and much more so than any game I have played in recent memory. I am not exaggerating and I feel I have given the game adequate time to evaluate its condition thus far. As someone who has spent thousands of hours practicing and playing competitive FPS games such as CS and R6 I can say that my aim spray control situational awareness etc. are all sufficient to play this game except they aren't because the game doesn't let you use those skills (unless you happen to get lucky and the game works). I play using Hyperx Cloud 2's alternating between stereo and virtual 7.1 surround sound as I see fit and the sound in close quarters works pretty well. For sound over 100m or so away however it is extremely inconsistent. You will find yourself looking in the wrong direction sure of where the shots are coming from only to die from behind because it was actually coming from the opposite direction. It also took me a little while to get used to distinguishing the sounds of bullets flying by or hitting the ground from the actual gunshots but in those situations identifying the direction of that sound is impossible. It literally sounds like the gunshot is coming from every direction around you. The biggest problem with the sound though is the volume of gunshots. There are threads out there that examine and explain this issue in great detail so I won't go into it but if you want to play the game at a volume level where you can hear your surroundings whatsoever prepare to be deafened by every bullet fired within 25 meters of you. We don't need that level of realism. I have had to use Windows 10's loudness equalization feature as a band aid fix but it makes it a bit more difficult to judge gunfire distance. The movement was the most disappointing part of this game for me personally. And I'm not talking about weapon sway or anything like that. The movement just feels like something you would expect from an old N64 game or something. There is nothing about it worth complimenting every aspect of it is really attrocious. It really hit me when I played Conan Exiles and felt like the movement was several times better than the movement in PUBG. That is a really really bad and confusing thing. I will say that it LOOKS better in third person but the problem is definitely not just the animations cameras or FOV. I can ignore all expected bugs like getting stuck in objects buildings disappearing etc. but the physics in this game just don't make any sense.. Getting tapped by a vehicle rolling at less than 1 mph will kill you. Getting out of a vehicle moving 5mph will kill you including boats... Lifting your bike off the ground will kill you. Honestly literally everything about the vehicles (especially the dualsport moto) is a mess and while bouncing around and flipping wildly to your death can be fun for a while it gets old fast. I could definitely go on for much longer about all my gripes about the game's execution but the real problem with this game along with almost every other early access title is the business strategy of the publisher. There are major issues with SELLING early access titles which has become apparent to me over the past year or so. One of these is the fact that managing and supporting a released game requires a lot of effort on the part of the developers and management and it makes actually testing and fixing the game much more difficult. Traditionally games would make it through beta testing BEFORE being released and those testers were paid to play the game (not paying to play it). This meant that adequate funding had to be raised BEFORE testing to ensure that the game was in a decent state for release. Actual alpha/beta testing is intensive and focused and probably tens of times more efficient than widescale public testing. What these small companies are doing essentially is using their sales during early access as funding for development. This is the kind of stuff you hear about in case studies in business school as a lesson on how to not go bankrupt. It isn't just morally wrong it is just a bad strategy. The fact that most people who would play this game at release have already bought it for $30 means that they have forgone nearly half their potential sales income when they could have finished developing the game and sold it for $60 like every big studio does. There is a reason the big game companies are still in business (well some are adopting similar poor business strategies and committing suicide) and that is experience. Most popular games have had budgets of several hundred million dollars knowing that they can make a profit by selling their game for a higher price and introducing microtransactions. I haven't seen Bluehole's financial statements but I don't need to to tell that they are sacrificing long term gains for short term profits which historically has led to dead games and companies. I probably don't need to mention the obvious fact that their investing in the esports realm is a sign that they are getting way ahead of themselves and spending money in the wrong areas. This game is casual entertainment. It is not an e sport and it never will be simply due to the nature of the game. The invitational was a clear indication of this. I don't even need to elaborate. No other esport is as luck based as this game and it doesn't reward player talent nearly as much as it needs to. Long term I would obviously love to see them improve this game but as someone with an education in business I can't say it looks good for them. The DayZ/Conan/Space Engineers strategy is massively flawed and you are just repeating those mistakes. Forget new content. Screw your new map and vaulting system. FIX THE GAME MECHANICS. Even Ubisoft is starting to show some promise with their strategy. Stop letting your $30 dollar sales get to your head and think long term. Sorry for the essay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-07,0,0,228,True,Not Recommended,"*I will update this review if possible (or write a new one) when I see changes...*I really want to recommend this game! But at the moment it has some issues. At first when I started playing before the last patch I had no major issues apart from the expected ""Early Access"" type stuff you get in games that aren't polished yet. (Everything is Early Access these days... So expect to not always work...) Aim through scopes Horrible De sync / Overall lag Horrible Stuck in plane Horrible UI Refreshing... Gosh I haven't even used my browser's refresh that much #_# Damage on point blank Horrible (And all the other things many mentioned... Water planks cloth and so on) Fall damage is ridiculous (You can jump off rooftops and get no damage most times but dare jump of a bike going 1mph... you dead son!) Try jumping over a low wall without a run up... HorribleSo yeah loads of horrible crap but whatever its Early Access I'm fine with that. Those are all things that are manageable... The main thing that made me choose ""thumbs down"" is the fact that since the last patch every single match I have to ctrl+alt+del and select sign out so that the OS force closes the game. As soon as the match ends and I select ""Return to Lobby"" the game hangs. No alt+tab No Alt+F4 no nothing works... The game keeps the focus apart from the ctrl+alt+del screen. This means I have to re open everything Oh and since the last patch I also have to explicitly run Steam as Administrator... Just for Pubg... End of the day this bug is really F&amp king annoying... It extends the time between matches so much that by the time I rejoin the team I don't really feel like playing anymore because death in game sucks so much more...To the devs / CEO / whatever Stop worrying about Fortnite really it maybe the same genre but its nothing close to Pubg. Fortnite for me is a kiddy version of something nothing like Pubg apart from the main mechanics fornite is a joke its nothing serious. Not once have I had any similar feel while playing it over Pubg. Instead you guys should focus on what you have. Fix the bugs that cause major issues instead of chasing after epics fornite... who cares. I don't want to bash fornite its something of its own but bleh I don't see why the fuzz... The only thing fortnite does better than pubg at the moment is it runs pretty well. Anyways...I read that you guys are busy with the server side stuff another reason not to worry about fortnite... You guys have millions of connections to handle... *facepalm* key word is millions... Instead of chasing after them and what they did and how you feel about that... Search for devs rather so they can start working on optimizations and the rest of the mid/high layer. !!! Focus on getting the application to run fine without making it literally unplayable. !!! These are things like the main bug I and others have atm.... It makes it unplayable... Not having balance or falling damage that s insane or a scope that doesn't really function In my book those things aren't making the game unplayable... it makes it more interesting... Some will disagree again who cares its early access...And fix the coloring... Geez learn something from Re shade do some tweaks on the post processing...Okay some goodness.This game is definitely a recommendation its great! Broken somewhat but great.Every single match had me in a place where I haven't been for a really long time just the right amount of ""Juice"". The sound in the game for me is Perfect for what they have it really drives the game. Hearing shots in the distance or someone walking around on the floor above you while you thought you were all alone is just an amazing feeling... Heart racing. The other day I had to beat someone to death with my fists (in game ofc) because I were to slow to get into the house I came down just after him and entered the same house soon after... While he was busy looting I sneaked up on him and killed him even though he had a nice SCAR... D The game is full of awesome moments... It makes you want to retry and retry and retry...

2017-08-08,0,0,321,True,Recommended,Here's my honest review and suggestions for you if you're going to purchase this game**DONT BUY THIS GAME**1. if you aren't willing to invest time into this game to get better2. if you easily get triggered/salty**BUY THIS GAME**3. if you're looking for hours of fun and a different situation every match4. if you're a highly competitive player or a non highly competitive player this game can be great for anyone who plays itWhether you're here to buy the game to play it very competitively or very non competitively this game is for anyone who enjoys action packed battle royale style games FPS TPS strategy skill based play and or just for fun and to try a new game. After investing almost 100 hours(at the time of this review) I can say this was well worth the $30 and I'm surely going to keep playing this game. If you can play and look past the early access stage and the bugs that are with it (the game is still extremely playable on all levels.) you will enjoy your experience. The community isn't bad at all not anywhere comparable to some other games horrible communities and you usually find nice teammates if you solo Q on duo or squad matches. I overall reccomend this game to most players who want to play a battle royale or a new style FPS/TPS game. The developers are always working on new updates even after the game being out for like 5 6 months and they respond to community feedback. Hope this review helped and leaned you toward purchasing PUBG. Thank you!

2017-05-05,0,0,414,True,Recommended,Started Playing this game a few days ago and its been nothing but fun!! there are bugs but what do you expect for early access? The game is good at keeping you tense a house? Do you forage it for supplies? Or is someone waiting inside ready to put a bullet in your head? This is one of the many decisions that will plague you whilst playing. It has its amusing sides too. Like when i chased a guy in just his underpants into a house and found him hiding in a bathroom with no weapons and shot him. Another time waiting prone in the long grass with a rifle watching a fight unfold before killing off the victor and then another poor soul who'd come to investigate the gunfire. Every game is different and this is what I love about this game. You will long to be the last player standing. I think with regular updates(which it is getting so far) this could be a great game that will be around for a long time to come. Keep up the good work!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I keep coming back to it and it slaps me down when I'm not paying attention because other players (100 per game) give no mercy. So expect all the tricks in the book baiting supply drops ambushes campers etc. But its fun and the gameplay speeds up as the map area decreases over time forcing player confrontation to push the campers out of their hidey holes and into the fray. If you enjoy a slight lul in the beginning while players gear up and then hectic firefights after 5 7 minutes then you'll enjoy this game. There is no single player or AI it's a straight up deathmatch with single or squads coming together for a full on battle royal.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-21,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,"I was hesitant to purchase PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS as I am not traditionally a fan of battle royales. Although the amassing attention PUBG was gathering peaked my interest.While the game itself is rather enjoyable I believe Bluehole it's developers are doing a terrible job at administering the game under all the publicity PUBG has gathered. For instance Twitch streamers are seemingly being valued by Bluehole over the majority of the user base as evident by the recent ""stream snipe bannings"". To place this into perspective a Twitch streamer could die and claim ""stream sniping"" on a completely legitimate kill and the other player would be completely defenseless to argue otherwise. This isn't just a hypothetical scenario as it's already been reported to have happened multiple times now. PUBG should respect it's Twitch user base yes but they should also stand by their common user base rather than favoring Twitch players.I'd also noticed a ""PUBG Rules of Conduct"" notification in game and after reading through it I'd found myself almost baffled. It's good that the devs. are attempting to keep their game as non toxic as possible however these ""Rules of Conduct"" were horribly vague and simply ridiculous. For example one rule if I recall stated ""do not stalk or harass other players"". If I'm to understand this correctly you are not to stalk/track enemy players in an attempt to kill them or other players that might be drawn to said player's movements? These ""Rules of Conduct"" appear to contradict the very nature of the game.Regardless the game itself is rather enjoyable and had it not been for Bluehole's actions I would've left my review positive.

You can play it out different eject differently use a more efficent strategy to survive longer etc. Once you get into the top 10 people remaining alive and the map keeps getting smaller and smaller... theres few games out there that can deliver adrenaline and excitement like this game does.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-08,0,0,343,True,Recommended,Having only played a handful of games I can only warn you that this review may not be as accurate as some. As some one who generally detests fps (bought battlefield1 and hated it lol) I can tell you now that this is immense fun!! I have never enjonyed being killed by other players so much haha. The graphics are on point as is the sound both allow total immersion and really convey the feeling of fighting for your survival. Running around desperately trying to find the kit needed whilst avoiding getting your head blown off leads to some real edge of your seat tension. Gun play is enjoyable without feeling as if you need to treat it as a job you dont have to spend hours practicing your 360 noscope to be competitive. This is essentially an 18 rated hungergames and all the better for it. The game is not without it's faults there seems to be bugs applenty but not in a game breaking way and will no doubt be dealt with in upcoming updates it is early days after all. i have no idea why people are throwing their toys out of the pram re. micro transactions you can buy cosmetic items which in no way give you an advantage? Oh no! somebody call the police!! Seriously though complaining that the devs have added another way to earn cash (irrespective what they are using it for) is pretty juvenile and niave. If you want to support a fun and high quality product buy this. Or becoming one of the growing masses of sjw's who down vote the game because the devs havent done what you think they should do. Bottom line this game is fantastic fun and i would be suprised if you were dissapointed by the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-20,0,0,705,True,Recommended,After being thoroughly addicted to this game for the past 2 weeks reaching roughly 100 hours on it I believe this game deserves my effort on making a review for it. I will say this I have never made a review for any other game in my library nor will I if it can't reach the same standards this game has raised and set. First off this game is not made for everyone. Some people may not like the whole genre of 'battle royal' and I can understand that it gets frustrating because there are so many variables to consider and one can easily become overwelmed with the amount of things to keep in mind to survive. To those who are complaining about those issues I wish I could do something to help alleviate your situation in game because I believe this game should be enjoyed by all. There are also those who complain about the performance issues. This game is early access. I repeat EARLY ACCESS. You can't expect the game to be running smoothly with opitmized settings when it was just released a couple months ago. Its like expecting a 2 year old child to be able to take apart and put back together a handgun blind folded. So what do I enjoy about this game may you ask? Its simply the utter turbulance and exhilarating nature this game can produce. If anyone has ever been in the top 10 they know how nerve racking things can get. No two games are every played the exact same with the same items in the same place well not for me yet lol. Each match holds an infinite amounts of routes and decisions I can make to win. One can play sneaky or one can go guns blazing into the cross fire and somehow make it out alive. This game does take abit of concentration and understanding. One must know their location and the sounds of gun shots around them to make an educated decision in order to survive. Do we engage the enemy team or do we let them pass by undetected of our presence and ambush them later? This free range of decisions with the size of the map lets one take hold of their own fate every match. Another thing I like about this game is not needing a team to play with but if played with friends it is a ton more fun. Playing solo in my opinion is alot easier since you don't have to worry about your team mates going down and having to go back to them. Playing solo also makes one more apprehensive of their decisions making one think of their next move more carefully rather than to 'Call of Duty' the situation lol. However playing as a team can make you more of a formidable force on the map if the group is well coordinated and has a good shot. Is there anything I don't like about this game? None. I have no complaints in this game just yet. Everytime I have died in this game was not because of hacking or for trivial reasons it was all because of my own decisions in the game itself. For instance neglecting to close the door of the house I just entered behind me which resulted in me being shot in the back of the head. Another being gunned down while running through an open field when I should've stuck to the tree line for cover. I believe the developers of PUBG hit the nail on the head of this genre of 'battle royal'. They incorporated a strong sense of realisim from the bullet drop to having to revive a fallen team mate who needs help to survive. I am looking forward to the development of this game and I hope the dev's put their hearts into this project. Thank you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-10,0,0,673,True,Recommended,This is my first survival battle royale styled game. I have always thought they were fun to watch. Once I bought PUBG after watching it on Twitch I was glad I had done so. The game itself seemed overwhelming and tough at first but you pick up pretty quickly. I myself am not that great and have only won 1 match so far but even if I die to some lame BS I find myself ready to queue for another and go back at it. It is early access which comes with its flaws but the devs seem hard at work to keep things running smooth. There is still a lot of kinks to work out and the game is still fun so thats a bonus from me. Hopefully once they implement more maps/gamemodes this game will really hit its stride.Worth the $30.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-03,0,0,95,True,Recommended,"I'll preface this review by saying Battlegrounds by no means complete nor well optimized in it's current state. However that does not mean it is unenjoyable or unplayable. Despite my short amount of time in game I can confidently say is much better than it's counterpart H1Z1 King of the Kill for a number of reasons 1. Its weapon variety is much healthier and (somewhat) balanced in customability strengths and weaknesses (and will evidently grow in number).2. Some central mechanics of the game are much more realistic and less buggy in comparison to its counterpart (you can't jump out of cars that are flying at the speed of light and live weapons actually hit where you aim at least along the vertical axis bullet drop is a thing!). 3. There are tons of servers already and they are more often than not at least playable (I've only had one account of having to leave the game due to horrendous lag).4. Graphically it's a beautiful game at its highest settings although it is nearly impossible to play with said settings effectively due to poor optimization and thus FPS issues/inconsistencies.5. The Steam Market already includes the game's in game skins and items available to characters another thing worth noting here is that it's relatively easy to earn ""Reward Points"" from simply playing the game. With this you can gradually purchase crates which will randomly drop said skins.6. The game actually feels fun and fair to play. There are a minute number of instances that feel like I was killed due to poor game design or exploitations. Again this game is by no means complete or the absolute best thing I've played thus far but it's shaping up to be extremely promising. The Battle Royale in the Arma series were extremely fun but just a little too slow paced it seemed H1Z1 had and has a number of problems that are fundamental to a game's success and playability Battlegrounds appears to be setting a new standard in battle royale type games.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You can run or maybe find a vehicle.After 2 4minutes the circle will shrink and again you'll have to get there. If you don't reach the circle in time you'll start to take damage. The damage is low with the first few circles but will increase each shrinking circle.

2017-05-14,0,0,492,True,Recommended,Ive never laughed so hard in my life. This game is able to go from dead serious tactical and intense suspense to out and out balls to the wall hilarious. Playing in a squad is this game at its very best but all modes from squads to solo are an experience not to be missed.I always tentatively purchase alphas &amp betas but this has been worth every penny so far. It has that one more game appeal that will have you fumbling through your daily life like a zombi telling yourself that 3hrs sleep a night is in fact perfectly healthy. Its when your out walking in real life and you start considering what loot might be in that house over there and where the best cover is that you know you have a problem.Anyway not going to talk about optimisation and crashes its still early access you have to expect that and to my experience I have had hardly any issues and when it did freeze a quick relog is the solution.Gameplay wise the combat and mechanics are all responsive if a touch clunky (ala arma) but combat is fun and kills are highly rewarding.I highly recommend this title and when you get your first win the sense of acomplishement is on a par to losing your virginity.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Competitive mode is well.. competitive.. for the most part. Unfortunately there're a decent amount of throwers and leavers since I got into master it seems like in every game whichever team doesn't have the thrower/leaver just landslide wins off the bat. There're always some heroes that feel overpowered like pharah symmetra's and her beam sniper (that actually isn't that good but everytime she kills you it feels like t) D.va's defence matrix that never seems to be out and scatter arrow from that head you know the one I'm talking about..

BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER A GAME THAT ACHIEVES THE ADRENALINE RUSH YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS finally a game with this genre of gameplay has sucssefully produced a tense fun and addictive game that will keep you up till 3 am saying ""Just one more round"" Yes development is not complete yet and no game is perfect I believe that this one comes pretty damn close. You can play alone or with your friends in a single double or quadruple team. In a multiplayer match you can either play well and have a great sucess story with your friends or goof around and see if you can land a supply drop on your jeep. Either way youll be smiling by the end. I cannot reccomend this game enough and if you have 30 to 40 bucks to spare as well as a nice pc take a spin at this game i promise you wont be dissapointed!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-10,0,0,15,True,Recommended,One of the most intense gripping games I've played in a long time! The way the game is built to directly facilitate interaction over what would otherwise be a monstrously huge and complicated map really demonstrates the care the team put in.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,0,0,348,False,Not Recommended,Don't buy this PoS game until it's optimised and polished. Most of the time it's a lobby simulator...22/11/17The patches to the test servers show progress is being made I played a few hours on it and my fps has increased and the QoL changes to audio and ui are a great improvement.24/12/171.0 Released still crashing and silly UI popping up after I die in a solo asking if I want to rejoin. Ok Mr Greene ) Enjoy your winter sales,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-15,0,0,448,False,Recommended,The game is not finnished. I get some stuttering I get ocasional crashes I get weird bugs and sometimes my car hovers in the air like it's from another world. However I havent gotten this wrapped up in a game this fast since I was young. This has everything I've always wanted. Massive map customizable weapons and a huge group of players. This game gives you the most tangible feeling of anxiey and fear. Even pros will sometimes find that they die almost instantly. Its great. As long as the improvements keep coming I reccomend this game.Edit RIP this game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-27,0,0,261,False,Recommended,PUBG is not without flaws but the overall design is traveling exactly in the direction it needs to go to keep me interested in the game for a long time to come.As a fan of DayZs gunplay PUBG feels right at home on creating a mix of satisfying looting sneaking and midrange combat. The only issues I've had with combat outside of the occasional server lag comes from melee where especially in the early parts of the game where it matters you are unable to hit other players and often be hit yourself. It seems completely random whether your attacks will register with a target. On occasion I'll punch someone in the head and down them while other times I've been in a point blank fight with a player for over a minute with neither of us landing a hit. It seems the best option is to just run.Many players have voiced their concerns on optimization and I can say I'm in a similar boat. Despite having a GTX 1080 the game runs around 80 FPS on low settings at 1440p with drops down to the 40s in large cities. Optimization is at the top of the developers list but be wary for players with older graphics cards or CPUs.If the game looks fun you should look into buying it. It's a great value at 30 and you can refund it if you can't run it. Try to play duos as it's the most engaging mode in my opinion. It will take a while for you to get used to leading shots and looting quickly but once you've spent a handful of hours in it the game is rediculously fun.I have high hopes for the future of this game.EDIT I'll leave my initial review up but I feel PUBG degraded in quality from where it was initially to the point where I can't really recommend it anymore.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
