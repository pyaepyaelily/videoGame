2018-11-26,0,0,448,False,Recommended,This game's history for me has been a wild and long one. When I first got this game for the PC I immediately started installing mods. If you have never installed mods on GTA before then you're missing out on something big darling. If you have trouble not knowing what to do after downloading mods (like I did) then just search up a guide. Once you have installed mods this game is a blast!!! It's the most fun I think you'll get out of this game. Now let's talk about online.. how should I put this??? If you're not making a private lobby then don't even bother trying online because it's pointless. Every and I mean EVERY online lobby has A hacker or a bunch of hackers in it trying to drop you money (which will basically guarantee in a ban) or just troll the hell out of you until you leave. Also the cars in online are expensive AF. I do not recommend buying shark cards since their just a waste of money. Actually... everything costs alot online. All in all I still recommend this game because of the wide range of mods. But I do not recommend going online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-10,0,0,86,False,Recommended,the realistic gameplay the precise (and real world accurate) graphics the release of pent up anger via throwing hot lead at the innocents of los santos and stealing their lambos are the founding principles of any GTA game. this game delivers that in online multiplayer gameplay. the missions jobs and heists are fun and there's a decent variety. however the UI and matchmaking and overall connectivity of the multiplayer facet of this game can make the happy experience turn cancerous when you can't get your damn friend into your heist or something glitches or you can't find the options/buttons you need. if you can learn these and overcome these glitches and bugs...then it's a fun game solo or multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-22,0,0,518,False,Recommended,After having played this game for over 300 hours and completing the campaign I can say that the singleplayer campaign is just awesome one of the best storylines in any game ever made. When it comes to online there is so much that could be improved for example End modding Make it less pay to win just so it feels more enjoyable right now it feels way too grindy And lots of small improvements all over the world of GTA Online to make it overall more friendly not encouraging griefing and bad behaviour from players which would also help the community be less toxic than it is right now.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-09,0,0,575,False,Recommended,Single player is great and took loads of time to complete. There where many missions to do and the collectables took a long time to find. Unfortunately a lot of the collectables where put in the oceans encouraging players to explore the ocean. The problem is that there is not fast way to explore the ocean and you will waste many hours attempting to 100% this game while traveling slowly in the dark. Not the best gameplay. Rockstar should have spent less time developing the oceans and more time creating interiors that you could go into and visit.The online side of the game is a bit mixed. Sometimes you will come across hackers that will ruin it for you. Spontaneous explosions and launching your car into the sky as you are driving around. Mix this with people whose only goal is to slay other players and this leads to what isn't exactly the best online experience. However you can host private lobbies by yourself or with friends if you do not wish to deal with those types of players.Overall the game is a good purchase and I got plenty of play time from it.Edit They have added loads of content including interiors for buildings and new vehicles since this review was first written. Unfortunately most of this content is hidden behind paywalls that require hours of grinding to access. Or you can buy in game money with real money... typical Rockstar...,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-07,0,0,283,False,Recommended,I congratulate a fantastic effort from Rockstar I thankfully didn't have the same troubles with GTAV that I had with the highly unoptimised GTAIV the creators do seem to have put some effort into making the PC version.Game The story mode is a fresh take on the GTA series with the control of three very different characters in the setting of the alive and vibrant San Andreas city and its surrounding areas which always has something to see and do.Graphics As expected the graphics are great and look wonderful pushes my card and machine to its limit which is refreshing to see a game that doesn't shy away from using up memory.Audio I don't know if it's just me but the radio stations seem shorter than previously I sometimes feel I've heard the same track/talk several times during a play session. The other audio around the city is very immersive.Online A new and very welcomed feature does need a bit of ironing out as even with an SSD in my system the loading times are LOOOOOONG and sometimes frustrating especially when you sit for 5 mins waiting to join a game then it times out and kicks you back to the normal game without so much as a retry? question then you have to begin the whole process again irritating!Overall I'm enjoying my time with GTAV and not feeling the sting of paying so much money for a game (first time I've paid a full price like that in a long time!) it's just a shame that Rockstar didn't show the PCMasterRace some love and release the same time as the peasants!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,2564,False,Recommended,"Ok first I have to say Why don't you already have this game? And secondly if you do own the game and are just reading the reviews for chuckles hello!The city of Los Santos lays spread out in a low lying basin of southern San Andreas along the Pacific Ocean. Smog ridden streets are ripe with crime from small time drug dealing to upscale corportate and even intragovernment illegality. The city wastes away in a unique bath of bitterness regret paranoia fear and loathing.This is where the action film was born. The romance. The drama. The tragedy. And this is where they've all come to die.The Overall ReviewGTA V and Online make up the 15th/16th installment of the GTA series that began back in 1997. Holding many records awards and controversies GTA is no stranger to anybody anywhere near the gaming culture.There's no real backstory or major inter game plots that are need to know. Pick any title up and go it'll all unfold itself quickly. GTA V is no different.GameplayThe open world is massive and fun to explore though not with the interactability of some other popular open world titles. Plenty of area to drive fly and boat around in.Vehicle handling is weighty but not too uncontrollable unlike previous GTA installments. Each vehicle handles differently depending on build bigger cars are slower in speed and steering response some bikes can't do wheelies high wing planes handle differently from low wings. Mods can be purchased for smaller vehicles that improve statistics as well as cosmetics.Gunplay is satisfying if a little finnicky to get used to. Drawing and cover based fire are sluggish aiming can be bothersome when switching between different weapons. Plenty of variety in weapon selection though and the way it's handled is more streamlined than previous GTAs. There's a central weapon wheel and the player may carry any weapons they own at all times.Player movement can feel sluggish weighty. Moving a player character can be a real chore at times due to the way the game reacts so snappily to input but is slow on actual movement. Combat rolls and climbing over objects of reasonable height make for fun exploration and interesting tactics.StoryGTA V's story is solid. Three protagonists all controlled at will by the player play as major agents in criminal doings all around Los Santos and Blaine County. Heists that can be planned are a high point while there are plenty of diversions of both legal and illegal varieties available beyond the main plot. It can grow weary at times like most Rockstar titles in the way each character is led around and forced into plenty of situations that just aren't fun and this can affect the player's own experience.The plot borrows from many popular action films and so many tropes occur. GTA is nothing without satire and parody but it will still glorify all the explosions and absurd amounts of violence it's inspirations portray. Be prepared for lots of shooting and driving.GTA Online's story is... is there a story? Sort of. There's a meaningful chain of missions around the lower levels linking characters from V to Online but this fades out later as the CEO VIP MC and other ""occupation"" systems come into play. It's very much the same as V though action movie made interactive.VisualsTo be honest for a game now in it's second generation after having originally released in 2013 GTA V is still very beautiful. It remains true to the slightly surreal but oh so detailed art of previous GTA installments so everybody you see in the game is a little weird looking but it's all very well modeled and thought out (except for maybe the engine models for most cars).There are some problems with the graphical settings mentioned below. The majority of the game is very pretty even at low settings and at the highest settings it can be stunning. Smaller details regardless of the graphics can be found in sound effects or animations metal cooling in cars after they're shut off little twitches and subtle shifts in body language of character models to create a heavy layer of reality overtop the zany satire ridden world.Online InteractionsThe most hit and miss part of GTA V/Online. As with any online multiplayer game the quality of fellow player is going to be across the board. Most of the time playing missions or heists players will atleast be competent enough to get the job done. Trolls will appear.Online's playerbase also suffers from a huge amount of cheaters exploiters and otherwise manipulators of the game to ruin it for other people. Do not be surprised if a whale falls out of the sky onto your shiny new super car then you get teleported into a room with everybody else on the server and are gunned down instantly by an astronaut with a minigun.There are different types of sessions for solo friend only crew only and invite only play to avoid the general community but the usefulness of these lobby types have diminished as updates have locked away more and more content to public only lobbies in an attempt to force a challenge upon players.Money is always a huge part of GTA but in Online it's what makes the entire world go around. Cars guns houses and even playing most jobs costs the player cash. This has ratcheted up since the PC release as prices grow higher and higher as more ways to make money are introduced. At the same time however for a casual player this typically means they'll never use many of the features later updates have included. For a new player it can be very overwhelming and rather negative to their experience as a whole.Problems Bugs and HeadachesOh yes. GTA V and Online have... problems. Singleplayer is typically sturdy but as any game does some issues persist. Mostly with the physics engine sometimes having weird hard stops or ragdolls and bodies not reacting properly to forces. The anti aliasing is unreliable as well as the anisotropic filtering.Online suffers from random bad connections timeouts and the aforementioned lack of anti cheat. Players report lots of abrupt disconnects annoyingly long loadtimes and weird transaction problems when it comes to in game purchases. Aaaand of course lag! Since its all peer to peer most connections with other players rely on the strength of one player's own connection and if this fails it can cause lots of drop outs.The VerdictGTA V and by extension Online are lots of fun. Worth thousands of hours of playtime just for how much fun it can be doing anything from playing the story to goofing off with friends to just hiking around the map alone.While it's definitely true the overall experience can be dragged down to an absolute stand still by jerks in Online or the tedium of doing a mission over and over after you've died the sixth time there's lots more to be doing in a game like GTA V. I recommend this game not denying it's faults but deciding that they are outweighed by the greatness all around.My verdict? Get GTA V if you haven't already. And really why haven't you?",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-27,0,0,1350,False,Not Recommended,Fun while it lasted but after 1300 hours playing I have hit my limit. Why? The Oppressor Mk II. It is all anyone plays now to PVP. It comes down to timing on the fire button and that's about it. The game would be better balanced without it. The first Oppressor was already a killer and took finesse to get it to work right. The Mk II is overkill.As far as the rest of the game goes it's a huge timesink to get a few toys that are great fun. It had it's charm for a while but they put far too much time into this new dance club that doesn't make you much money and is more geared towards recording your dance moves. Oh joy.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story is good the graphics are nice and the attention to small details are amazing. This is a huge sandbox where you can mess around for hours even when you are not actively following the main story line.If you are someone who is looking for a decent online game I suggest you look elsewhere as what you have heard regarding this game is probably true.

2018-11-22,0,0,1865,False,Recommended,Great game but unfortunately Rockstar lost in the middle of the game the root of old GTAs. They focus unfortunately too much in the Online part and we end up with a small single player experience feeling lucklaster and with an even emptier Online experience full of exploits overpriced items and nothing to do except grind the same missions over and over again. They focus too much on how to make money from Shark cards and no focus on how to make the game enjoyable for the player base.,Grand Theft Auto V

It really looks like Los Angeles in a way Theres Character Costumisation and an in game internet which you use to buy stuff or view websites Theres a ton of funny phrases npc's say The Radio is AMAZING. It has alot of great songsBAD GTA Online is Pay To Win Rockstar allows hackers on GTA Online The PERFORMANCE is terrible after playing GTA Online GTA Online has crashed my Computer giving me Blue Screen of Death The High End Apartments and High End Vehicles are too Expensive. I get it irl they are more Expensive but this is a game Griefers Griefers Griefers. No one can escape them Theres no Anti Cheat Heists Require 4 Players Loading Screens are ing Terrible GTA Online has to have calls coming in from characters telling the ing player to buy something EXPENSIVE If GTA fails to find a session you're sent back to Story Mode Online all but sudden dosent show up in the main menu? what? The Recent Update is TERRIBLE. We've got a new Freeze Bug that causes the game to freeze and everyone are sent to empty Servers in the same place and position.

2018-11-23,0,0,278,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. (""Product Recieved for Free"" I was gifted the game by another steam user.)I've played GTA V a lot since I was given it and with the steam awards I decided to review the game.TL DR Singleplayer is great online is a mixed bag get the game on saleThe graphics are great even decent with a low medium end computer.The singleplayer is excellent I'm not done with the story but currently I'm enjoying it.Although something I do have to cover with this review is the online mode.Online is very different from singleplayer. There's a bunch of high tech veichles some examples include a DeLorean hoverbikes solar powered trucks that can customize hoverbikes and many more.The online communtiy is pretty bad imo (of course there's good people but...) there's a large grinding mechanic in the game that these tryhards and straight up trolls abuse to ruin other people's days you can be waiting for 8 HOURS for something to produce only for it to be blown up by a guy in a fighter jet. Lower levels are killed over and over again because people think that their K/D ratios actually matter thinking that they're playing Call of Duty Black Ops 4 Battle Royale mode and want to show off to all their friends that they're decent at the game.Quick word of warning also The rockstar team will actually ban players that get DROPPED money BY hackers without hacking themselves. I haven't experienced this myself tho.Online is also a grind fest if you are not into that you may not enjoy it I myself enjoy the grinding (as long as my stuff doesn't get destroyed by tryhards).Get the game while its on sale is my opinion the game never really goes below 34% off.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-25,0,0,1110,False,Not Recommended,I guess rockstar doesn't really care what's happening with the multiplayer anymore... The SP remains good as it was made by competent Rockstar. But the MP got ed up beyond repair. It all happened somewhere around 2017 when they started adding crazy vehicles that didn't belong in GTA at all. Now you're at the point where you're trying to collect cargo from a misson where normally no other player should be involved but you're being chased by multiple flying motorcycles which can shoot large amounts of homing missles at your unbelievably vurnurable and slow moving car. I don't know how it happened but somehow everyone has the flying missle shooting bike now. You're at the point where you're just looking for an online server with only 5 or less people. Way to go multiplayer. Rockstar tries to keep a large playerbase by giving you free money on certain moments but the reason everyone leaves this game is because of the dull missions and the crazy overpowered vehicles that kill you over and over and over AND OVER again. The multiplayer has become an unbelievable game of pay to win (or cheat to win) and it's annoying as . If that isn't enough there are hackers in every server. If you're not getting griefed by O.P. vehicles you will spontaneously catch fire or explode by hackers. It's like Rockstar doesn't even care about this. No actions are being taken to reduce hackers. It's really bad. The multiplayer will leave you frustrated tired and probably pretty angry too. Maybe even so angry that you start writing a nagative review. off Rockstar. You ed up one of the best games out there and instead of learning from your mistakes you make things even worse. It's insulting to the entire gaming community.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-26,0,0,315,False,Recommended,While the game is definatly good there are bad parts to it (focusing on Online). There is a large grind and more veteran players will easily destroy you and there is little you can do about it as a low level no matter how skilled you are. Then there are hackers who are pretty much the same situation but nobody can really defeat them if the hackers care enough. My advice is to try and find a session with only a few players and whenever something gets sketchy in the slightest switch sessions. This will avoid most hacking since this prevents giving them time to mess with you. Overall a fun game especially with friends but be prepared for a grind and some dissapointment or frustration. Especially since the AI seems programmed to get in your way by doing completely random and nearly unpredicatible things constantly. At its now reduced price it is more worth it than before but still beware of what you are getting into.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-08,0,0,122,False,Not Recommended,Bought this on sale for 19.99 it's alright... After review and many many hours spent testing here are my results and summary. The pc verison does look great however for some of us friendly modders who want to make story mode awesome (cause forget online) Rockstar doesn't seem to agree. Updates. Updates Updates they are still havng the smallest updates kill every mod ususally config built. The latest to 1.4.xxxx blah blah. Installing cars skins houses boats enb graphics and what knot mods can crash. You can get error messages from having 3 mods or 30 installed after small recent update I was closer to 50 overall mods(took a long time to get this collection) yet issues after the updates. I've spent a well 50hrs trying to get everything to play nice. Storylines still stable testing(most stable I've had it). Rockstar needs to get right off that high horse and understand what kind of possibilties they could have here if they allowed strong modding to take place with a creation kit or more offline support. Because a vanilla GTA is just boring as hell like shoot Rockstar how many years and no actual chop shops bank robbing on story mode? I have two key mods installed low life crimes that makes people drop their wallets and crack safes put a safe in every robable store and another mod to mark those stores like..... WTF ROCKSTAR. WALK AWAY FROM THIS FRANCHISE. Terrible job Rockstar and most big league games now a days. You should pay 14.99 for this...or less.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-15,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,"I bought this game to play GTA Online with a friend so I'm going to review it for GTA Online. Got it on sale for $20 but given the aggressive monetization it could almost have been f2p. Rockstar wouldd just need to change it to have a premium currency and have a few things purchasable only with that premium currency and then it would be indistinguishable from a f2p game. There's a big grind for anything and the only way I got a good amount of money was from Rockstar giving free handouts. The main things that got money were jobs and heists. Jobs give more than nothing but not much at all and hard heists give more but still not nearly as much as I'd like. There are evidently other special things that are the best for grinding money when you have a nightclub or some other high level building but I haven't tried those since the initial investment is so expensive. One other thing is challenges where you compete with others in the session to do challenges like ""drive the furthest without hitting anything"". You don't get much from them but considering how much time it takes and that it doesn't take a loading screen I actually like it compared to jobs and heist pay outs. Compared to buying something expensive it isn't much though. Aside from that you could mess around but you don't get money for messing around pushing you to do jobs or heists. Then when you do a job it sometimes takes forever to get a good amount of people though heists are fine for people since you just need 4. Loading times are absolutely horrible I've heard it might be syncing the open world but that doesn't change the fact that the loading times are painfully long. Besides loading for jobs and heists are also bad and I can't imagine they require syncing anything. Specifically loading in heists is bad because in hard heists if one person dies everyone has to start over again which I also don't like. I would much prefer if someone dies the rest of the team contines on until they win or lose. It would clash with some of the design of the heists since it will designate people on a certain team with a certain objective but I'd also like to do away with that too. The cursor is painfully laggy on menus when using mouse and keyboard though I haven't tried messing with settings to see if I can make it better. And on the subject of control your character in GTA V controls quite realistically. So in other words you don't have much control over your character. The ragdolls are fun when you are alright with it but many times the game just doesn't feel good. Some people might like it but it's not my style. My favorite TPS controls are from MGSV. Best way to have fun is when a friendly cheater comes in. Then you can try out the vehicles that are insanely expensive and also any car that is cheated in to have max acceleration and speed is wonderful. Overall there's not a whole lot that's fun. If this game had custom servers and modding support for those servers it would be very worth $30 though it does not. I would recommend buying this game only for the singleplayer though I haven't yet tried modding the hell out of it. At least to me it does sound enjoyable unlike GTA Online.Edit Also I'd highly recommend NakeyJakey's video on GTA V called ""GAMES THAT SHOULD BANG Grand Theft Auto V &amp Metal Gear Solid V""",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-17,0,0,560,False,Recommended,"There are so many things you can do in GTA V it's transcended to another level. With the introduction of heists to organizations and motorcycle gangs to aerial combat and support this game just keeps evolving with the times to keep people interested. Couple that with all the online content Rockstar keeps pushing it keeps the game enjoyable and still relevant despite it's release a few years back. This games has changed its face so many times over while continuing to keep everything competitive and fun.

2018-12-13,0,0,690,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V is a very well put together game. The team keeps the game up to date and is constantly releasing new amazing updates to the game without infamous ""DLC Charges"". The cars are great the game runs Mostly smooth and the game modes/updates/NPC voice lines are very thorough fun and immersive. I could go on for about an hour talking about all the great things Rockstar is doing with this title. This would be my single favorite game of all time if it weren't for 1) Constant Server Disconnects when loading into/out of missions2) ""Grief Theft Auto"" The MKII Oppressor along with other similar vehicles result in constant griefing with 0 Player Skill required. Just get into a ridiculous over powered vehicle murder everyone and go into ""Passive Mode"" after you're finally shot down so you can get into another one.Side Note GTA Shark Cards are way overpriced. While I don't buy in game currency for hardly any games theyshould at least attempt to find a more generous price for in game GTA cash. Hardly anyone is going to buy a few heists worth of in game $ for $20 USD. Overall 3.8/5 StarsReasoning The server loading issues are such a frequent and prevalent nuisance that this has dropped my rating of the game by roughly a whole point. Update the servers and turn (HOMING MISSLES) OFF when targetting player vehicles and this might just be the best game on the market.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-24,0,0,148,False,Recommended,Ohh GTA oh Rockstar where to begin... Alright I figure I ll let most people know that I am a single player oriented gamer. Not that I don t game online all the time but an immersive single player mode is what matters the most. This is GTA V s saving grace for me. We all know the epic story of Trevor Michael and Franklin and we all know that the game offers an immense amount of content still considered almost overkill to this day. It is the closest to life simulation we ve got with added drugs money theft murder gangs hookers YOU NAME IT! . All of my hours on Steam aside from maybe 10 minutes are all offline play. This is why I still recommend the game. Also because I got my copy for $15 which seemed reasonable.Now years ago when GTA V first game out I was an Xbox 360 player. When the motorcycle bug blew up I was not one of the players who found out and I steady worked for a couple weeks to earn a few million or so. I was also amongst one of the players who had all of my money taken away from me because of Rockstar s up. That was it for me. I stopped playing online and never looked back. Since then I have heard all of the horrible treatment online players have gotten from each other and Rockstar. I would be disgusted with this title too and can t blame anyone for giving a thumbs down. But I think if you can grab the game at a low price and you decide to give up on GTA online and decide to not spend your time or money on publishers or devs who don t care then you won t find yourself that angry and you won t find yourself on the verge of sending a pipe bomb to a certain CEO. And the devs will give up because it will be a waste of their money just like it was a waste of yours.For instance at this moment Rockstar is offering around $1.2million supposed for just logging in every day for this past week. Some people are worried Rockstar won t pay. I m not. You know why? I don t give a .,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA Online is unbalanced and filled with hackers modders and glitchers because Rockstars security system just sucks. The updates kinda contain the same stuff over and over again just with other facades. At least the missions aren't too bad and you can enjoy GTA Online if you have enough money. If you accept getting killed by cheaters over and over again boring supply missions for your bunker nightclub office or Bikeclub annoying players and not getting enough money for painful missions you will like GTA Online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-01,0,0,192,False,Recommended,To review GTA 5 one has to review 2 games GTA 5 (single player) and GTAO (online).GTA5 8/10 one of the best worlds created in the GTA franchise with stunning levels of detail and great game mechanics. the story is ok (starts out great but the ending seems a little sloppy)GTAO 5/10 creates sessions with 10 20 players in them and takes ages (1 10 minutes) to load (I can't understand why if you're connecting 20 players). The freemode map is mostly used for getting to missions or grinding repetitive tasks. The missions heists reaces all happen in 'private' sessions with the players that participate. The issue is that for every switch between freemode and missions you will lose 1minute on loading screens. the best part of the game is joining a crew to perform heists however 75% of the time one member of the crew will mess up (die disconnect or just play to annoy others) which will block all the crew from progressing furthermore it takes around 5 minutes to even get a crew to do a heist so you're wasting 5 minutes for a 25% chance that everyone who joined wants to play there are many other mini games which can be fun (races arena war etc) but I suspect players only do those to make game money not just for fun. finally there's a lot of content you can buy with game money like owning a business clubs bunkers etc. From what I can tell these are seen as good ways to make more game money by doing boring and repetitive tasks (move stuff from point A to B while getting attacked). I am quite sure players only do this to get more game money. why does everyone grind to get game money? Because money can be spent on buying all sorts of supercars boats outfits and ridiculous items (flying cars and bikes) to troll others. So players struggle to make some money in order to annoy others who struggle to make money.Overall I am most annoyed in GTAO by the loading times to do any fun thing and the ridiculous items added (flying cars etc) which destroy the amazing world that was created for GTA 5. But if you are persistent you may have some fun in the game. I can recommend this product on Steam even if only for the offline story mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

Grand Theft Auto 5 is a fun and agreeable frolic through Los Angeles as you play out various dangerous heists and dig into every one of the 3 heroes individual issues. A standout amongst other amusements in the open world class and certainly justified regardless of a play. Offline Game Truly it is an extraordinary diversion with an awesome storyline. It is fun and connecting yet in the meantime it enables you to investigate the gigantic guide which without anyone else's input give you hundreds if not a large number of hours worth of ongoing interaction. By and large the disconnected piece of the amusement is extraordinary and offers a great deal of fun and replayability. Online Game It is an extraordinary mode that the amusement offers and it is the fundamental motivation behind why I can spend numerous more hours playing. So far I've invested the majority of my energy on the web and it's been incredible. The general population can be harmful now and again (i.e exploding everything causing unimaginable slack) in any case you can simply run a welcome just server. I've known about arbitrary prohibiting and so forth yet I haven't encountered this up until this point. End A decent diversion and ought to be on the rundown for any PC gamers.

2018-11-14,0,0,75,False,Recommended,Review will be based on two different subjects GTAV and GTA Online.GTAV Its a wonderful singleplayer experience. Characters are charming attention to detail is crazy gameplay is fun and the whole experience is good. Campaign takes quite a few hours and I only had a few missions which I disliked. (Namely the tow missions.) Solid 9/10 pick this up for singleplayer.GTA Online Its a hit or miss pun not intended if you play the game for the online aspect. Lots of cheaters which usually ruin the game and you also run the risk of getting banned for jack Also no mod support anywhere because Take Two is ing . Online is also very p2w I'm talking DarkOrbit levels of p2w. Shark Card advertisements are everywhere and everything IS SO GODDAMN EXPENSIVE. You will save money for a month just for a single vehicle or building only to regret the purchase because you will use it like two times. Online is like a 5/10 all things considered.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-13,0,0,939,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I was gifted this game by a friend whom I love to game with and for a few months we had some good times. I've bought the DLC a few Shark Cards (hey I work full time so don't give me crap about being a whale) and have put many hours into the game. However I cannot recommend it in its current state.There are two glaring problems in my view which Rockstar has complete control over and yet apparently refuses to address 1. Online play is completely ruined by so called ""modders"". These hackers are in nearly every lobby able to do all kinds of neat things to ruin your day like spawning in a Kanjali and then warping to you or forcing you to accept an invite to their apartment and blowing up the whole lobby or placing objects on your character which don't go away without a game restart. There are many other issues with this but this is just the most recent exposure I've had within the last 2 days.2. Online performance is garbage. Despite being ""peer to peer"" it is still heavily reliant on servers which are apparently potatos connected to the internet via a dial up baud modem. I know this reads like hyperbole but it's absurd. I have a pretty stout rig and I'm convinced the Cray super computer would choke trying to load this game or a new lobby for that matter. If these two issues were addressed by Rockstar I'd be a far happier customer. There would be other issues of course the Oppressor MkII which is so totally broken it is hard to believe any thinking individual would have green lit it as a vehicle in game griefers who hammer their angrily while blowing up your cargo for a measly $2000 or numerous other fun exploits that have existed in some form or another since the game was released. But really those top two are in their control and Rockstar apparently aren't doing a thing about it.Hope this is helpful to someone.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,556,False,Not Recommended,After spending 5 years (more like 4.9 since i originally got this game on 24/12/2013 and today it's the 22/11/2018) playing this game and its online mode which is gonna be your main focus after a while i just have to say i'm disappointed.I'll just start with the singleplayer The singleplayer story is fun but worse from a storytelling perspective in comparison to GTA 4 but nonetheless it's still engaging to a certain extent adding mods will help your experience and all of that as usual.And if you're looking forward to using post 2015 content in singleplayer you're out of luck unless you mod the game (but every new big update breaks the mods that let these vehicles in so have fun).Now the bad part the Online.I remember playing with my friends 5 years ago on Xbox 360 when if you had a normal 300k high end apartment and an Adder you were an absolute king among men. Fast forward to 2018 you leave your house and you get bombed by a flying bike which is locked behind 2 paywalls not to mention that literal Lada costs 180k which is now easy to get i should add. But still 100k gets you a normal sports car.Ever since Rockstar fired the original guy who had the vision for GTA Online and GTA 5 it's all just become a bad microtransaction induced fest. You can buy them to get in game money but you really shouldn't. There's no point in fueling this mess anymore.If you do have some friends though feel free to screw around in the multiplayer. The greatest fun i've had on this game is just messing around rather than doing whatever spectacular heist there is. Better yet buy this game to then play on FiveM (unofficial online client with different modes like RP or mini games etc) it's limitless there.Before i get to my final verdict i wanna talk a second about the mythical Chiliad Mistery.Rockstar what the .Why did you scrap the work of a dedicated community for money for your Online? There's people that looked into every little detail trying to get behind that mural or just at least crack the meaning behind it. All we got in the end was an overpriced (as in overpriced in game content that can be bought with in game money) DLC.Final verdict It's not as good as you think it is. When a modder burns the entire lobby or an Oppressor MK2 blows the living out of you you won't feel the need to play anymore.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar does not care about fixing online which i mean banning modders.Recommended due to look at all those ""i did nothing"" modders in comments online was fun game back at the consoles beginning now its just 98% toxic community that kills others for fun GTAV is nothing special yes it was cool and wow and vista effect but ... story is dull.

It's fantastic to go online and build you're characters identity and reputation through crime and community events. Not only does this game pocess an amazing online mode it also has an amazing and dynamic story the fact that you can switch character in the middle of a story heist makes the story much more detailed and lively.

GTA Online died when you morons decided to make it P2P (peer to peer connection) instead of dedicated servers where ANYONE can use mods and cheats without consequences. You literally have around 10 20% of the people using mods who just mess with you when you try to do missions (putting you in cages killing you over and over again with their godlike/teleportation mode on etc). I would have bought in game money for real money if it wasn't for the cheaters. Why would I spend one dollar more on this game where other players can just download cheats and give themselves infinite money? GTA Online could have been one of the biggest if not the biggest online game if your management weren't absolutey morons. Happy you guys never became as big as Fortnite you idiots don't deserve it at all.Edit To make things clear I hate Fortnite lol. I've tried it twice uninstalled both times within 30 minutes. You can go check Twitch movies shows everyone is streaming/talking about Fortnite. Never said it was a good game but at least they try and they put out a lot of content and deal with cheaters which is why they've had big success. You can't argue against their success no matter what you think of their game. Rockstar pretends like nothing while so many cheaters are running rampart ruining everyones experience. Real shame because I really loved the game itself but I'm tired of cheaters messing with you for NO reason. Just for the attention because their life have no meaning and no one cares about them in real life. """,Grand Theft Auto V

Story Franklin Clinton works for a corrupt car dealer. When he has to bring a car back because the owner did not pay for it. He meets Michael. Michael is the dad of the car owner. Michael catches Franklin stealing the car back. Micheal almost died a few years ago while robbing a bank with Trevor Philips. Trevor now lives in a trailer park. Trevor sees on his tv that the car got stolen back and he thinks that must be the work from Michael. He starts looking for Michael and meets them. Together they go rob banks and more. Multiplayer The multiplayer in this game is quite good. There is a lot to do a lot of purchaseable apartments companys and vehicles. There are a lot of fun jobs like races. The multiplayrer gets updated often with new content. The multiplayer does not get bored. Mods. There are a lot of good mods with a lot of variety. Better graphics mods like Redux and NaturalVision but also zombie mods new gamemodes new missions new maps new vehicles and LSPDFR if you want to be a cop.I usually get my mods from here. gta5 mods.com Important things.

The map of Los Santos is still pretty big almost 6 years after release. I played this on consoles as soon as it came out and as of now I own 3 versions of this game. You control 3 characters in the main story mode all with an intertwined story and seperate side missions. The characters (Michael Trevor &amp Franklin) have a great chemistry and are really likeable by the end of the game despite Trevor being a psychotic . The online mode GTA Online is also 100% free when you buy the game a welcome addition to someone who used to pay for Xbox Live making the game more replayable than ever. 9.5/10 no waluigi what the sakurai,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-04,0,0,542,False,Not Recommended,Hello and if you are reading my review I hope you have a wonderful evening.Shall I begin? Alrighty! So! Rockstar.. hmm Rockstar is a complete idiotic company who strives to earn money regardless of what it's customers view. Think of Communism. You don't have any say in any decision they make and they want to always be rich and in power. Which is sadly to be expected with this type of game.I had a friend I played with online all the time we worked together to gain hard earn cash from doing heists games and other fun stuff. However he got banned. Why? because a modder came and spawned cash onto his account. He was banned for 17 years and now I work alone playing this game.I got this game in around 2015 and I loved it. Despite my terrible computer I was able to tweak this game to look good and get 60 80 FPS on 720p on an Intel HD 4600 computer with a AMD Radeon R5 M430 graphics card. Shocking! This game is awesome the story mode is amazing and its just a great game if only Rockstar cared about its customers.I still play online to this day and I would NEVER put mods onto my account it's not worth it. I've already purchased 500 000$ dollars from shark cards and sometimes I regret doing that because I don't know if that much money coming in so fast will get me banned.Just be careful. If you're new to this and want to buy it Go ahead but there are SERIOUS I mean SERIOUS things you need to consider it's a huge possible chance you may dump 30$ down the drain.Good luck mate it's all that I can say.,Grand Theft Auto V

Ruined by the community and poor cheat detection GTA Online is not a masterpiece however it isn't by any means BAD. I still have fun in GTA Online when I play it but more times than not a modder will join the lobby and turn it into his personal playground spawning in anything to his or her wishes.To sum it up you should buy this game and when you do you buy it for the single player open world sandbox.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-13,0,0,1094,False,Recommended,"Worth it for single player but GTA online really should be free. They seem to think that lazy content updates are passable as ""Free DLC"" and they trick their players into thinking they are treating them with respect when in reality Rockstar knows good and well what they are doing. The single player is amazing probably the best GTA in the series seriously. The story is pretty cheesy but I think that is one of the charms of the game it is like a bad 80s film but for modern times. It also runs like a dream and still looks amazing despite being released like 5 years ago 3 for pc.I would not advise buying this game just for online because of the serious problems that have plagued it for a long time. I already mentioned the really good marketing that rockstar has used in order to trick the fanboys but I think it is equally as important if not more so to mention the insane amount of cheaters in the game. Most of the online activites are done in freemode and usually that means that you have to play with others. Honestly that is the best and yet the worst aspect of the game because open world gta pvp is amazing... when the other players aren't using jets miniguns explosive snipers flying bikes with missiles and etc. As you can see there is an extreme balancing issue in freemode and it doesn't help that ingame money can be bought with real money.The end result is boredom because open PVP is impossible and to me that ruins the whole experience. The freemode is designed around pvp but it is has been ruined by pay to win and people who have to use cheats because they are that bad. This is all said without mentioning the faulty anti cheat that Rockstar uses I have heard stories of people being banned for doing nothing luckily that hasn't happened to me yet. Overall i'd say try it and have fun but don't buy the game just for the online mode.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-26,0,0,120,False,Recommended,So I just finished GTA V today 75% complete the game after beating all the main missions and most side missions. 68 hours playtime according to Steam.GTA V was a game I was waiting for since it was first released on the 360/PS3 in 2013. I had watched my brother play a good chunk of it on his 360 and was blown away by the world design and direction but just have never been able to bring myself to play consoles regularly enough to complete any game besides the latest Zelda or Mario on Nintendo consoles.I am and have been a PC gamer for over 20 years now starting with Biomenace Wolf3d and LucasArt/Sierra adventure games in the early nineties and continuing along from there playing anything I could get my hands on my favourite experiences being immersive first person games of all genres.I have played every game in the GTA series since the beginning but really started to enjoy the series at Vice City and San Andreas.From the first time I played GTA3 I knew it would be a thousand times better in first person. This was much later confirmed for me when I played through the fourth game in the series almost entirely in the first person using an amazing mod. I even managed to play through San Andreas recently with a first person mod a few months prior to GTA V releasing on the PC it translated to the first person surprisingly well.As good as those modded experiences were they feel like tech demos compared to GTA V which I played through entirely in the first person.There are plenty of reviews that explain the story and general gameplay mechanics and in all actuality very little has changed from the early roots of the series. Missions are still started by driving to mission markers separate from the sandbox experience to some degree and involve a variety of gameplay loops that include chases shootouts or a large number of mini game activities. The story is pretty much a riff on the same notes they've touched on throughout the series with the same tired parody thrown in for good measure although it is well directed with mostly great dialog and does actually have a series of really good laughs in addition to plenty of jaw dropping action set pieces throughout the missions. Each cut scene is presented with cinematic grace that most of the time does not draw on the parody of the world you are in. In fact although all the radio adverts bill boards and brand name gags are still there they seem to play second fiddle most of the time to GTA's more subtle and real world aspirations.The first wow moment for me was when I was up near the Vinewood sign and looking off into the distance at night seeing the buildings and tiny vehicle lights in the distance and knowing that it wasn't a sky box. Knowing that at any moment I could drop what I was doing and walk or drive in any direction.Other moments include walking down an alley way and spooking a cat seeing it dash by in front of me while I looked down at the trash it had slightly disturbed settle in the corner from where it had come from or waiting for the crosswalk light during a downpour looking at the reflections in the puddles of water rapidly being disturbed by the heavy rainfall and feeling relieved when I was able to jog across in front of the slick cars lined up to my left and in front of me.Moments like these were as impressive as the actual story based gameplay moments which are as fun as ever. The mission design is heads and tales above every other open world sand box game released in the last ten years. But with the addition of a first person perspective there is a divide between what it is right now and what it could be in the next few iterations.Currently the first person perspective does nothing but provide an immersion factor to a really good action game. It is well designed and creates a feeling of solidity that almost no other game has ever felt like at least for me. The world feels random and hand crafted at the same time however the limited world interactivity leaves the game feeling plastic at times. It is worth noting that the violence does feel more impacting in the first person and often times left me feeling exhausted after missions wishing that stealth and non lethal mission alternatives were always an option instead of just a few sequences spread throughout the game where it worked for the story.There is a feeling that this could be a bigger experience a more interactive experience a less scripted experience. The world (despite not having full interiors) feels big and real in a way that most Bethesda open world experiences have felt like in fact it feels bigger because the city scale is more real than anything in the Elder Scrolls/Fallout series. This however makes it feel like I should be able to enter any building or talk to any NPC as if it were a player character driven role playing game instead of an open world action sandbox game.These are not major issues but I feel that this game is the first step forward for a modern day immersive simulation game set in a big city where you truly do have the whole city in front of you to explore and where one day maybe the story won't be a scripted narrative but a game world where the story unfolds as a consequence of player driven choice a world where violence and reckless behavior would carry weight and consequence to a degree where non violent alternatives seem like a viable option.I really do hope that RockStar try and take the first person experience further and into more interactive territory than the GTA series is traditionally known for and maybe they'll even ditch the make believe parody world and start writing stories in real world locations where attempts at satire instead of parody play into a more subtle narrative. As it sits it is a fantastic first person action experience and worthy of every hour of gameplay I put into it.Score 9.5Technically this is a brilliant game and accomplishes everything it sets out to do with incredible polish but the lack of true player choice hurts the first person experience a tiny bit. The parody humour also hinders what could be a real gritty story as it feels like a tired leftover from the series roots. Though I do have issues with some of the story and with the lack of true choice I can't argue against this being one of the most important games to come out in the last decade. It is also the first game in a long time that legitimately earned every hour of my play time as literally every minute felt fun.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-11-22,0,0,95,False,Recommended,The single player part of this gsme is amazing. Rockstar yet again creates an amazing atmosphere with plenty of side content to keep you busy after beating the main story. The environment is well done and immersive and the characters are interesting and funny. However the online portion of this game is slighly toxic. It's riddled with griefers and microtransactions.

2018-11-12,0,0,328,False,Recommended,I recommend this game to those people that love to grind. This game really needs a lot of grinding if you do not want to spend money on shark cards which is also not worth it because even the $100 shark card could only get you like a cheap jet and 2 cars if that's how you spend your gta money on. The grindy aspect of Online is what keeps me hooked though as grinding is fun and entertaining for me. Story mode is great if all you want to do is screw around with mods and stuff. Overall though I would not recommend buying this for the full price just wait for the sale since Rockstar is a rip off. Additionally terrible customer service for me and my friend at least. He got banned for absolutely no reason and when he appealed they told him he was banned for modding which was completely false.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-11-13,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,*your when the game already has been occupied by horde of kids and you still have to write a ing review*well that was kinda cool but i have been banned after like 5 years of playing this on playstation 'cause the game just doesn't deserved to be played without usage of mods/hacks/cheats or whatever you call that...damn it's just so boringtens of hours must be spent on walkthrough of similiar levels and heists to just reach anything in this piece of br&gt OR you (of course) can spend real ing money to get some money to your character OR you can spend real money to get money level n stuff but you would have to give your account data to some guy who will probably boost your account (but there are no guarantees of success and you will probably get a ban)OR you can download a menu and use it to get your character boosted by yourself but in that case the chances of catching a ban is like 50% (it depends on the state of servers)and that's the ing point after killing a lot of time on this i can totally say that if rdr 2's online mod will look like this then i won't buy it cause it's not worth your money/nerves/timeyou will get r3kt by some epic gamers who played ing hundreds of hours killing newbies like you and getting a pleasure from this you rockstar you made a great single player game but you ed up the whole damn concept of online modewhy do creators of online games still can't understand adding a lot of new worthless content to your game won't make it more poular if it's main problem is that's just broken and needs to be fixed in many waysbtw graphics are pretty cool if you are blind can't forget the nights i spent with these polygons (ultra ing setting and 8x msaa) you know what i'm talking about?( ʖ ),Grand Theft Auto V
2018-11-11,0,0,410,False,Recommended,"Alot of people complain about the games multiplayer which I understand but the story and base game itself is really. This shows character development and forces you to make game altering decisions which I will not spoil because I am not a giant bag. You take the roles of Franklin Clinton who is just a CJ but never left LS and there is michael de santa who is a retired theif and there is trevor phillips who owns trevor industries and is a phycopath that likes to kill rednecks in blaine county. The story is one to play however the online features are not in it except for a few cars and the only way to get the cars are by modding them in which can sometimes be a little dangerous. Some of the story like the mount chiliad drawing thing is a cryptic drawing that people car far to crazy over jsut for soem views. Ok so to online...Online is pretty not gonna lie but you can also have alot of fun but screw listing the fun stuff because theres not that much.One of the first real problems that you may encounter are IGN or other crews that are infested with tryhards. for anyone who doesnt know what a gta 5 tryhard is then you have not met the worst players ever who resort to the finest military technology to kill you and yet you still beat them cause they suck. Another problem is the random banning waves. rockstar doesnt really care about anything else except the transaction log. my friend got banned for a modder giving him modding without his consent so they went to court the next day and my friend said ""hey im gonna kill you"" lyrics coming at you with super fast speed i summa lomma do whart i got to do i forget the rest but yeah its pretty entertainging escpecially if you dont have a clue as to whats going on andnow i am just typing random stuff just to ttype thank you all for reading this comment and its entirenty )",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-21,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Overall very fun but online is a letdown.Single player is enjoyable. Fun missions active world. It's nice that your actions in the world have an effect on things like the in game stock market. That said you have to rely far too heavily on the stock market if you want to make money as the purchaseable properties offer very little income (often taking hundreds of in game weeks to break even). The amount of money you get is also not well distributed throughout the missions. You get a trickle here and a trickle there then complete the final heist and get more money than you really need only to find you don't really care because you've done all the missionsOnline was a letdown. The heists and jobs are fun and varied but the world is generally populated with people who only wish to blow you up with the rocket powered bike or armored van that they spent $20 to get. That wouldn't be too bad except the load times for basically everything are insane. Something like 7 minutes to join an online server 3 minutes to load into a lobby for a job or a heist 1 2 minutes to load the job or heist... You have to spend 15 minutes just loading to get to a point where you can do the thing you want to do. Couple that with the not infrequent lockups after jobs (which force you to alt+f4 and spend another 10 minutes loading the game) and unnecessarily long transitions between in game rounds and in lobby jobs and you're left with a sour taste.All in all I'd recommend it but for a AAA title from a wildly successful developer I expect better functionality from many of its core elements.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-05,0,0,2054,False,Recommended,Firstly the game is brilliant aboslutely love it well worth the price loads of content people say the prices can get stupid which they can but all it does is add time to get said content i paid 40 when i first got it never bought a shark card and from my hours i have well worth it made that 40 back in game time and then some. I have pretty much everything and am level 350 this game is not about getting everything it is about the things you want you will never get everything until you are a stupidly high level. I think its sad people won't get the game off the basis they won't get everything in the game. Now to the good stuff.Pros Stupidly High replayability (Singleplayer and online) Looks decent considering how old the game is Loads of content (Singleplayer and online) Really good singleplayer story Brilliant game to meet new people i have met loads of other gamers i now play GTA with and other games Easy to make your money back gameplay wiseCons Modders and hackers are still running around the place not as many but still there Does take time to get stuff Crashes without warning no matter what you are doingOverall i cannot see why i would say you get banned for no reason because i have had plenty of time to get suspended banned etc and have never been never had an issue never had cars business etc disappear so i cannot say that is a disadvantage however it is best to look at other reviews. In my eyes the game is well worth it really fun and great place to meet new people.,Grand Theft Auto V

I still feel the same as i did before. Do or have i used mods on GTA V? No. But i use mods for other games in single player and have since the early 80's. You could say my mach II for the c64 was a moded hardware since it would let you load games up easyer. They can say there decision at first was againts Open IV and how it could be used on multi to cheat but you can do that anyway if your determined enough without Open IV.

2017-06-15,0,0,1736,False,Not Recommended,Alright it's time to change tunes if only because it's taken me this long to see I'm still recommending this. GTA is a game with heart but a heart clogged by the ever increasing pull of Online. The singleplayer remains a hallmark of storytelling and were this game only that I would still recommend it. However GTA has become in full form Online and it is in Online that it has died. Due to P2P networking the game is easily rescripted by any aspiring modder making it a hotbed of money drops player cages and random explosions all brought by people with menus looking for a power trip. These skids are not wholly to blame for their downward spiral however as the moneymaking system in GTA has continued to slide further into uselessness due to shoddy payouts and enemy player incentives it becomes almost necessary these days to acquire a mod menu simply to skip the pointless grind and stop other menu users. To top off this torm R* has enacted a zero appeal ban policy based entirely on computerized selection resulting in ineffective banwaves that largely miss actual cheaters but strip cash and even character data from legitimate users. I enjoy this game immensely in the slim moments where I'm socializing with decent people and having fun driving flying or any of the activities left over from when GTA was made to be fun nowadays these moments are dying and the game is suffering for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

The Graphics at highest/ultra settings are really beautiful and its pretty cool to watch the sunrise lightnings or the nature. Yeah and the cars for sure. The Sound is well done all the different cars and horns and the urban feeling really cool ! Im honest im not a fan of the Singleplayer probabley im just the Multiplayer/Coop guy but im fair and the Singleplayer was definitely hard work and at least better than many other Singleplayer i played so far! Multiplayer in my opinion the best part of GTA V fascinated me really! It's important that you dont play alone thats boring and the long term motivation is not given but if you have some friends or just a community/crew playing the heists/missions with you its amazing. I bet you gonna have so much fun! All the opportunities insane! Yeah the long term Motivation is connected with playing the Multiplayer after the Singleplayer and the Requirements for having fun with the Multiplayer alre listed above ) UPDATE Nov. 2016 Rockstar is still realeasing huge Updates for GTA V and has effectively built one of the biggest communitys on Steam UPDATE Nov. 2018 Regarding the fact that my first review was from august 2015 its truly impressive how many thousand still play the game.

2018-09-01,0,0,227,False,Recommended,Was skeptical about buying at first due to the reviews on many that got banned but it wont happen so long as you avoid hackers or modding the base game. Although that might take out some fun aspects of the game the online mode is already worth it since there are so many things to do (from heists to play mini games like adversery modes or simply participating in a race). It definitely is a grind for money but if you have a bunch of friends to play heists with and wait for sales to buy ur ceo and bunkers you should be raking in millions in no time. Would strongly recommend to anyone that likes open world games and doesnt mind grinding for stuffEdit been playing this game for more than a 100 hrs and i still find stuff to do keep things fun. Grinding money is also easier if u make use of the x2 bonuses and build up ur businesses first.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-11-22,0,0,525,False,Not Recommended,From what I've experienced I'd say my experience is pretty mixed. Some of the positive of the game is the story mode which is already good by default the rest of the good things depend on how you play. The mod menu players are very high there is at least a 75% chance to run into a modder if in a free aim lobby. Tryhards are around too but the really annoying ones tend to stay in the free aim lobby. I'd recommend staying in the aim assist lobby even if you dont have a controller. This way you can reduce encounters with the more annoying types of players. Besides all the tryhards and modders I must say that the community is pretty nice compared to the console community. People are pretty helpful when it comes to making money cuz most people realize how tedious it could be when doing it alone. Another thing about this game is making money. The money in this game is way too grindy and most of the items are very expensive. If im honest if you play this game legit it'll take a while before you can have a steady income for the things in the game. You can also see a reason why people in the pc community use mods to get money since its too much work. I was only able to make good money when doing doomsday exploits that gave me 1 mil every 15 minutes without it i probably would not have much via properties or vehicles.Overall I think the only way to have fun with this game is if your not fully invested into making money and more into just messing around. Of course you might need some money to have fun but don't be too materialistic or the experience overall will be pretty negative,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-23,0,0,1863,False,Recommended,"Got this game 2 years ago to play with my friends and honestly it's been soooo much fun. With R* continuing to release new content for Online I even nominated it for the ""Labor of Love"" award C Note GTA Online is really fun if you already have friends who play it. Getting money is quite difficult especially if you're playing alone. Along with the difficulties of making cash comes modders. These players tend to ruin the experience for everyone in their lobby with blowing up cargo missions players &amp money dropping. (Money dropping isn't as good as it sounds. If you collect to much money from modders you risk the chance of getting your account reset by R* so it's best not to accept any at all.) R* has currently stepped up it's game when it comes to modders. Taking even legal actions against mod menu developers so hopefully with time modders will be something of the past. Overall GTAV is an amazing game and I definitely reccomend it to anyone who wants a game to play with friends. You can hangout in freeroam race around Los Santos in the many cars R* has released since launch make some cash through the R* created heists &amp missions and building your criminal empire as a CEO or the leader of a Motorcycle club just remember this game is REALLY grindy due to in game purchases for vehicles businesses clothing weapons &amp properties are steep in price.

It's not worth it. 1) Connection problems almost every day and instead of fixing their own servers once and for all they give a ""solution"" which basically says that it must be your PC's or your internet connection's fault not their fault.2) You think shooting through walls and God mode is bad?! In GTAO it's far worse than that and they refuse to do anything which could stop that awful cheating.3) Support in overall is bad. Can't or don't want to solve even small problems.4) I should be able to steal and keep any car I want but no. I can only steal and keep some cars in GTA online. The rest of the cars I have to buy. So much for Grand Theft Auto. It's more like Grand Buy Auto!5) GTA Online isn't really a game. It's more like a second job. You need to earn a lot of money if you want to buy something in this game and to earn a lot of money means playing at least 3 hours every day. That is if you want to buy at least 1 2 things in a month.P.S.This is just my sugesstion.

2018-11-23,0,0,37,False,Recommended,"Grand theft auto 5. A masterpiece quietly turned to a horrid money grab. I've spend over forty days on GTA Online on the console version of the game. I've beaten campaign twice and had a really enjoyable experience doing so. GTA Online is the main part of this. From the beginning it was very fun had a ton of friends play it with me doing all sorts of stuff from street races to stealing cars for simion. I've had this game since the release of the game on Xbox 360 around 2013 2014. Played for a long time and it grew a lot. More missions were added more cars. Free DLC. Really above and beyond what i've ever seen for a 60$ game. Later it released heists and other things. Still super fun to play but cars and apartments are becoming more expensive. Ill skip the boring stuff and move on closer to 2017. The game has turned slowly toxic as you can no longer play on xbox 360 and ps3 because of bugs and exploits. People on GTA Online will spawn kill you for no reason and there are more hackers than ever. The new racing game modes is the only thing being released (asides from 5 million dollar cars and jets). It isn't as fun the game is way too complicated now. ""Money isn't an issue"" is no longer a statement. (sorry jimmy). missions can only give out 20k roughly and heists are boring and a waste of time. (most players dont know how to do it somehow which bugs me) people in lobby's will also troll. But the game can still be enjoyed if you play with friends.Heres a simple list of pros and cons Pros Very detailed and enjoyable campaign Characters have deep and really relatable meanings Multipule endings (very choice relating / open ended story) Many Many things to do off of campaign missions / quests GTA Online can be very enjoyable Open with up to 32 friends! (GTA Online) Tons of things to do in GTA Online Very expansive customization (Online and campaign) Realistic graphics Suits very many playstyles (FPS players Driver players Flying and boating players etc.) User FriendlyCons Very long loading times (sometimes) Campaign has its moments with bugs (mostly fixed though) GTA Online can be and will be toxic Decently demanding game (Need a good PC) Can sometimes be laggy or buggy They want you to buy Microtransactions (GTA Online but not required)Overall I think this is a very good game and I hope they continue the series. Next time please don't ruin the online by making it very relying on microtransactions. also loading times can become a problem. Thank you Rockstar for this game.If there's anything I missed let me know hope you liked the review.(This review was written a long time ago I just posted it recently because I actually bought the game and could submit a review sorry for bad grammar)",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-25,0,0,579,False,Recommended,I did have fun in this game spent more money than I would like to admit i recommend with a big asterisk attached.TL DR Single player is great fun online could be fun in a closed lobby with friends pubs feel yucky like you got dropped in the middle of big cage with a bunch of monkeys slinging their own poop at each other.PROS This game has the most content out of any game i've played. Beautiful vistas and environments. Everything is thought through every company name or store or brand of soda is a pun or a joke if you don't think something isn't a pun then you just don't get the pun. Cars are a great fun to drive incredible amount of planes to fly bikes to ride and places to go. Always different activities and events online so you never have to grind. Arguably you kinda have to but more on this later.Single player is a solid game everyone should do this first before going online. Or NEVER go online because unfortunately that can ruin it for you.CONS Online game is ruined by modders/cheaters/hackers who glitch almost every lobby. The devs are money hungry for microtransactions so everything is insanely priced you make 5 10k per mission a cool car costs 6.5 mil you do the math how long you have to play to buy one car. Same thing with businesses but they have a constant upkeep on top of the millions of dollars you spend for set up and when you try to sell a product from that business to make a profit some hacker just blows you up from nowhere. So now you don't have money or product that you spent several hours grinding its gone in a second. Every lobby has a modder i feel thats how they arrive. And you can't report the hacker because you have no idea who does it. Businesses in general are a huge grindfest that gets old fast and the rewards are miniscule.Load times for everything take a while. Not as bad as it used to be but still. TL DR Single player is great fun online could be fun in a closed lobby with friends pubs feel yucky like you got dropped in the middle of big cage with a bunch of monkeys slinging their own poop at each other.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-11,0,0,571,False,Recommended,Pros Constant free updates. Content of each update is DLC sized. Shark cards optional grind or simply login to collect weekly bonuses and sales. Developers are clearly passionate about the game. The cars weapons and outfit variety is outstanding. As above the devs are so devoted that they put in a graphics overhaul a while ago. For an aging game it looks brilliant. Lag compensation means that I can play fairly well with friends across the world.Cons When I start up the game it logs me into Saints Row or something. Wait there's a single player mode?,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-12-11,0,0,802,False,Recommended,Gta 5 if not the best one of the best imo. It has very good story mode and free dlcs online. I think this game should be recommended for everyone. It is totally worth $40.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-12-11,0,0,197,False,Recommended,The best open world game set in our time. Whether it is better or worse than Skyrim is debatable. In Skyrim you can enter the world's buildings. Not in GTA 5. But the world in GTA 5 feels bigger its city like an actual city in size. In Skyrim the 'cities' are like small villages. Its 'towns' are tiny communities. You get more interaction with most NDP's in Skyrim though. Yet GTA 5 is much more populated. Skyrim has a large very active mod scene. Skyrim also offers a lot more content. GTA 5 offers an offline mode (with plenty more to do there.) Modern city vs. medieval setting.For me GTA 5 is more fun.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-12,0,0,1139,False,Not Recommended,I approach women and they insult me and run away just like in real life!Hillarity from the singleplayer campaign aside let me review the online with pros and cons.Cons In game microtransactions in a 60 dollar game100 dollars gives you 1 I repeat ONE vehicle!Rockstar made things like car upgrades and ammo more expensive to make you more likely to spend money on the game.Rockstar made it so you randomly lose your ammo throughout activities wether you die or not so you will have to buy more of it have less money and be more likely to spend money on the game.This is a load screen simulator.If you wanna join a heist the game will make you unload THEN check if there is actually room for you and if there isn't THEN you will have to LOAD back into the session you were already in. Why do we have to load twice? Why do we have to load before the game even checks if there is room for us???Rockstar hates fun and removed your ability to replay missions so now you have to go through THREE loadscreens if you wanna play the same mission again instead of just 1.Rockstar desperately wants people to spend on their price gouging microtransgenders and will therefore make the game worse. They have the option to maybe balance things to make them less profitable but keep them fun but this is Rockstar and they have chosen to fall.Griefers ahoy.The game always displays everyone on the map.You can be killed in passive mode.Forced PVPMany activities simply don't pay enough sometimes not even enough to cover the ammo cost of doing them!Many of the more expensive things in the game are either useless on their own or completely outclassed by cheaper ones.Some missions that shouldn't encourage players to kill you actually do encourage and reward them for doing so.Many missions' ending zones and objectives are known to griefers and they will camp there for hours to at least annoy or stop players from being able to do their missions many players do this even for missions that do not reward griefing.We can't allow mission/heist members into our vehicles? wtf is this? We can either lock our cars to everyone friends friends &amp crew or no one but not lock it to the people we are actually on a mission/heist with.The game can just never sync with the cloud. My game has been trying for 10 days now and hasn't succeeded once.The servers are unstable and may disconnect you at any timeThe game has big issues with alt+tabbing or pressing the windows key leading to major lag which leads to your game unloading you from your current heist/mission/session/online. I found that my issues disappeared if I stopped running wallpapaer engine but others are not so lucky.If the game freezes up for just a little bit it will disconnect you just to with you.If the game loses connection for even a short time it will disconnect you instead of trying to reconnect you like other games.When you receive a message on the social club there is no easy way to check it! You open social club and there's nothing there. You go to social and there's nothing there. You go to message the exact guy who just sent you messages and there's nothing there! Instead you have to go to social club open the option wheel??? and then you will find your messages hidden there. Why the hell was this done?Missions from NPCs reward you less money the quicker you do them. This makes no sense. You'd think they'd pay you more for express delivery but nope! Instead the slower you are at a mission the more it pays you per mission but somehow you at the same time get paid less per minute. This system is just screwed in the head and doesn't make sense. Then again R* wanted to make the game more appealing to the masses and that means making missions easier and paying more for doing less.There are no significant punishments for bad players within the game.The game is almost a griefer's paradise making legit play online worse than it needs to be.Cheaters ahoy!Tanks can blow themselves up because sometimes the projectile collides with the barrel of the tank. This is unacceptable from a AAA developer.Buildings do not render properly when in vehicles. This is especially apparent when idling in a chopper on a rooftop as things chaotically render in and out on their own.Lowering the suspension makes wheels clip through cars.Griefers can join your session blow up or not blow up your stuff abuse the vote kick system make your mission fail by abusing said system and then the game itself gives you negative rep for this ontop of you already failing a mission by getting kicked and losing your hard earned resources by griefing. Rockstar reminded me today of how they are at making games. In a 2v2 game that turns into a 1v2 during the loading screen you will have 1 life vs a team that has 2 lives by default. This makes no ing sense.Rockstar is garbage.Pros Good graphics.Nice cars.Cool helicopters.Cool planes.Voice acting!Gradual progression.Mission variety like assassinations racing stunt racing transform racing theft espionage and a few others.You can own a business.You can have NPCs working under you that will take your bought or stolen goods and produce wealth for you to enjoy.Clubs!Illicit drugsSexViolenceStrippers!But most importantly GUNS!,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-12-12,0,0,221,False,Recommended,GTA franchise has been the trademark of realistic criminal life simulator but I just have to say the value of the contents are dropping. The game is just full of Chinese hackers and its endless hours of grinding and grinding and grinding and grinding and by the time you meet a hacker you lost part of your grinding.This really sucks.Not to mention the updates are more and more pale it can't keep my interest up I and my friends decided to give it up because of this.Score 5/10It's boring now but you might find it interesting if you like grinding.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-22,0,0,40,False,Recommended,This game has alot of pro's and con's. It's up to you if they are deal breakers or not.Pro's Awesome for casual mindless fun. Great with friends I would strongly suggest playing online with friends. Strong singleplayer with a great story and interesting characters. A MASSIVE amount of content to explore (although a majority is online exclusive and costs alot meaning a lot of grinding or microtransactions). But the content is there and it is fun to play.Cons Price (Although it is a full game it still takes money from your wallet and that IMO is a con) Community. It is possible and likely you will meet nice people on here. But online has a lot of people who kill everybody they see. This isnt an issue on singleplayer however (obviously). Price of content in online. There is substantial amount of content in this game. But your ability to access it depends on the time or money you are willing to commit and either way it's alot.These are my main Pro's and Con's I have experienced with this game. At this time i would recommend getting it if you enjoy casual games that you can muck around in. But if you cannot stand grinding and don't wish to pay for content in online then avoid this game.

2018-12-22,0,0,1151,False,Not Recommended,The story mode is amazing and well worth the game. However beyond that in Online and a lack of story mode DLC makes this game horrid. The online mode is structured in a Pay to Win format. Players can either purchase shark cards or a mod menu to gain access to stronger/over powered equipment/vehicles instead of playing the game and putting in hours for the rewards. Rockstar will patch and fix any money glitches or clothing glitches but won t fix game breaking hackers. In a game that gives players the option to spend REAL money on in game items but doesn t have an active anti cheat or hacker/mod detection software it gives players an unnecessary risk to run because some mods have the ability to take money from players. If I purchased a $100 shark card only to join a lobby with a modder who proceeds to take said GTA$8 000 000 from me they d be stealing that $100 straight from my wallet. Yet Rockstar is happy to continue making sales on their microtransactions while rarely listening to community feedback sending dodgy support ticket responses and extreme lack of anti cheat in online play. It s an amazing game with great detail and endless hours of fun but the all little things show the true intentions of its developers Money first only expensive online content second community when we get to it. Let s hope GTA 6 will show a different side.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-28,0,0,297,False,Not Recommended,"Shame. If there's one word to describe GTA V that is the word.Sadly it is. It has many many tons of contents and what i mean tons is literally TONS you can do heists small jobs run your own companies motorcycle club clubhouse etc. You car guys may even fall in love with this game and spent lots of time creating your own dream garage in this virtual game. Do you ever want to be a boss with your own bodyguards and skycrapers and multi level garage? This game got it for you. Do you want a high tech facility for your own biddings? This game got it for you. Do you just want to enjoy a beautiful scenery with your friends? This game got it for you.But sadly most of them are behind a big paywall. And yes i am familiar with grinding so i am quite okay with it. But this game has the level of grinding which for most people is unbearable. Thus forcing you to buy the so called ""Shark Cards"" or in other word microtransaction. Yes a pay to play game with freetoplay elements. Which is a recipe for disaster. Even it's a grind but with all these heists and other stuff it must be atleast enjoyable right? ....No. A big gigantic NO. You will spent maybe half of your playtime staring at loading screens. And if that wasn't bad enough connections are kind of garbage in this current state which is Peer to Peer. AND if these wasn't bad enough there are lots of hackers griefers and just overall bad people. Just like almost every popular games out there GTA V has a very bad community.It's a great game. It is. But the executions are just...horrible. I can't stress you enough that it's such a shame on how this game became to be as it is right now.In my opinion full price is an absolute No absolutely No No NO. Buy it atleast while it's on discount you can play singleplayer and mod the hell out of it when the story's finished. But stay out of online if you don't have other friends playing this game. It can be tons of fun with your friends even with the cons i've said above. But if you insist to play online on your own just expect a huge amount of frustration.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-20,0,0,40,False,Recommended,I dont want to write a review on the online. So i will give a brief on the online mode. it is essentially endless and still being updated. The fun is in the grind if u do not enjoy the grind you will not have fun. Now then back to Singleplayer. The game tells the story of somone who has made alot of mistakes in his time try and make some rights. After being inspired by the son he never had and some help of secreat govrnment officials working on the down low the story shifts over to where his own past comes to quite literrally haunt him. He then solves the issue the onyl way he knows with crime. Its a good story not perfect not a normal story either. Its good. The gameplay is extremely fun and the world is similar to skyrim where it is just one big engine in the form of a virutal playground. Once you install mods you literally make the game what you want. I can recomend the game alone based on the mods there are for the game. There quite well made aswell. Want a zombie apocolypse while surving ina snowy city. theres a free mod for that. Want there to be a world disaster like a tornado raveging through the map destoying everything easy peasy. maybe a tidal wave ingulfing the entire city as you try and survive on a roof of a skyrscrapper. the game is quite liuterally what you make it.,Grand Theft Auto V

I would highly recommend this game to anybody who has never played it before but it is not really worth the purchase if you have done everything. One cool thing about it though is being able to download mods like LSPDFR or go on the external mod FiveM and play on roleplay servers.

About the story mode well the story is interesting and exciting and you can do a bunch of things in Los Santos. And then about the GTAOL it's really easy to be addicted to it. I played for over 600 hours in the online mode busy earning money. To be honest in OL you will first suffer a long time being a new guy in Los Santos. Your rank is low you can't buy those powerful weapons yet and you are always kicked when joining a heist by those high rank players. It's quite surprising that I don't have much suffering memory about my noob experience. Also it's quite an arduous job to earn money. As a nice little player I was always doing a heist stealling cars as a CEO resupplying for the bunker and drug farms importing cargos and so on. And because every coin doesn't come easy I carefully manage my money only to buy those really necessary cars (and only when on sale). But still until hundreds of time spent on it did my manage to buy all the basic stuffs. Of course you can just be a modder and earn billions of dollars in just on click but I think in this case you'll soon find the game meaningless and boring once you easily buy every car and house and plane. Oh and speaking about modders and hackers I don't blame them for using the tools to get money since they don't bother anyone but sometimes they get really annoying. Some modders will suddenly teleport to your and give you a big friendly gift and blow you up or glitch some textures on you and make you have to quit the game or spawn fire right under your a.s.s or kick you out of your cars or planes or blablablablablabla. But at least these are still bearable. SOME of the modders will even get yourself BANNED! They can spawn millions of cash in front of you and wait till you take the bait they can kill every player and make the system says that you have killed all these players...... Well if you ever see a modder just quit as fast as you can. You'll never know their capacities. And when you do it's already too late. Oh and there is another important thing you need to know if you want to begin your GTAOL life. R* is REALLY REALLY REALLY bad at distinguishing normal players and modders/hackers especially when R* decides to suddenly check thr server really hard randomly in a year. During that special period you'd better not go online. Because if one modder is banned during that time there must be many normal players get fcked as well. R* will delete your characters alone with all your effort and time spent on it. Well last time when R* started the big catastrophe I just lucked out playing Dying Light and avoided the risk. Anyway GTA is a good game although it may have some problems the really glowing points won't be blocked. It's worth playing.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-25,0,0,476,False,Recommended,Fun game solo or online. Played through story mode twice. Online mode is grindy for my taste but keep in mind I am a casual gamer with limited game time. In game currency can be earned farily easliy with some work. Items online are rather expensive though. Lots of griefers online but there are ways around that. Game still looks good in 2018/19.Pros Fun story mode Fun online mode playable in both FPS and 3rd Person graphics.Cons Online mode enables griefers. I don't like that.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-02-19,0,0,1154,False,Not Recommended,"1100+ hours played and most of them on Story Mode. I bought this game twice for two platforms.The online service of this game is full of hackers and cheaters the only way to purchase all the things they provide is in buying one of their ""Bull Shark Cards"" priced at 60 dollars (Yes more than the game itself). The hackers drop money in top of you even if you don't want it and of course you get banned.So the only great thing about this game until now was the Story mode with mods. But they had the great idea to ban Open IV (A tool for modding). Disappointed.EDIT After what happened Open IV it's now available for modding. Apart from that the online mode is still the same",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-29,0,0,448,False,Not Recommended,GTA V was the best Open World game if not the best game in recent times thanks to its unique take on the real world and the superficial and active city of LA while seemlessly integrating some goofyness and wackyness that still kept great immersion. Whether it be a tense shoot out with police or a executing that perfectly planned heist or even just the mundane like driving and exploring the city the game strayed away from reality however it was never a ridiculous as future content for the online portion of the game.Throughout the last year or so the addition of flying vehichles car submarines and pay to kill laser beams have stripped away the initial charm and captivation the game once had the latest update however almost completey takes away what made the game what it is. The latest update features a car arena game mode which is accompanied but a new way to customize cars. The car are take on an almost 'Mad Max' aesthetic which seems out of place and out of character for GTA V and its setting however my major gripe with this update are what these new cars can do. Lauching cars in traffic by tapping npcs with your car and guns that shoot laser beams just doesn't make me as a player feel like im a criminal on my way to success the original path the player was put on at the start of GTA Online.GTA V was once the gold standard of a new open world game.Now its a glorified Saints Row.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-04,0,0,273,False,Recommended,"This game is such a mixed bag. Im going to start with the negatives. Also i only play online. The city is usually a war zone which can be fun unless modders are on your server. This game has a serious cheating problem but Rockstar doesn t seem to care. They speak freely in chat about what they do &amp offer money drops to people. Stay away from modded money because you can get banned. Rockstar needs to protect their micro transactions. People say if you spend it right away you wont get banned but I wont take the risk. Microtransactions ruin the game. People who spend lots of real money on shark cards (or modders) have an unfair advantage over everyone else. They can buy over powered vehicles like flying cars with lock on missiles that would take a normal person forever to make enough money for. These OP vehicles all go for over 1 million in game dollars. Plus you need a special garage to store them which is another 1 mill or more. The average in world job pays 5k 10k. Yes you can make more money doing Heists &amp dispatch missions but i have a hell of a time with the matchmaking for that. When i do get into a heist someone will die over &amp over or just leave giving you no money regardless of how much time you spent in the mission. Once after the few heists i managed to complete my former teammate killed me &amp took my cut. Depot any money you have in the bank ASAP because deposited money cant be stolen. Dont bother buying a motor cycle club because if you die during a MC mission the game glitches &amp thinks the ""contract"" is still active. Even days later i cant accept a new contract. Total waste of money. Now for some positives. This game can be a lot of fun under ""normal"" conditions which is why im giving a positive review. The game does give you one free sports car which you have to claim from you phone but you need to own a garage first to store it. Your best bet is to find some friends to team up with. None of my IRL friends play anymore presumably because they are tired of the modders. That said I've met some cool people in game that i team up with to do jobs. Higher lever players can hire you to to guard them or do runs with. You get a lot of XP from hanging out with a President or CEO. Just make sure they give you a good pay rate or it wont be worth you time. This is the work i do the most. Even still i can only manage to make 100k in an hour which sounds like a lot but isnt. While you can buy a property for 50k they suck. All the good properties or 1 million or more. Speaking of properties you are limited to the cars you can store. You are only allowed to keep cars that are valued at under 100k in the ingame store. The only reason i can think of is to promote microtransactions. I can understand not being able to steal another players vehicle but you should be able to keep any random car you find. Inconclusion i am mostly happy with this game for the $15 i paid on steam. If you can accept the faults that i laid out you'll probably like it also! I forgot to mention that if you are being killed over &amp over by a player you can change the server you are on. If you need someone to team up with feel free to message me.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-22,0,0,6260,False,Recommended,Rockstar Games really nailed it financially nailed it with innovation and most important nailed us gamers with their long loading times matchmaking issues player drops no logical solutions from R* support when having issues from their end sometimes it just wont even load the next heist screen after you finish a setup having to restart game and see it has not been completed for example which is sadly what made my rage o meter peak and write this damn review. Since launch I loved this game breathed it grinded it so long with my crew but the love is fading away as Rockstar Games never really focuses on fixing the core issues and keep unbalancing the racing aspect of the game.

2019-01-01,0,0,25,False,Recommended,The single player version of the game is absolutely brilliant. The game is very well made in terms of graphics and compared the previous title (GTA IV) it can run on PC s with lower performance. The storyline is another strong advantage of the game. Relatively quickly escalating story of three main characters from different social classes will surely catch heart of every gamer. The game mechanisms and features have been moved to a new level allowing the player to do more crazy stuff ). The only weak spot of the game is its multiplayer campaign which is full of salty kids and hackers who together make impossible to fully enjoy it.Rating 8/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-11,0,0,70,False,Recommended,"Still one of the best games ever made. Single player has an incredible narrative great characters and top notch voice acting for everyone line of dialogue (and theres a lot.) Incredible open world Los Santos still feels like a real city and its level of immersion still holds up years later not many games can say that. Owned this on console when it launched but bought it here for GTAO (mistake.)GTA Online is a different matter. Its a cool multiplayer sandbox where you can build an empire buy cars and houses and start businesses. But the grind is real. I read reviews talking about it but didnt appreciate just how intense the grind is. After playing GTAO for a few hours I had finally earned enough money to buy... a shirt? Seriously? Clothing is like 5 10k weapons are 15k+ and I dont even want to think about how expensive the cars and houses are. I can appreciate somewhat a grind that elongates progression so the game lasts you awhile. But at such an egregious and painful rate it makes playing the game feel defeating and futile.After playing Red Dead Redemption Onlines beta I was looking for a similar sandbox style online game. RDR2's online beta has only 6 missions and is really light on content but even that was better by comparison. They are similar in mission structure you start a mission and watch a short cutscene for some light story exposition on the job then set off. But the missions themselves feel like pointless filler. One had me go to location A to acquire item 1 (drugs) then go to location B. Another had me go to a gas station point my gun at the clerk to rob it then leave and mission complete. Really thats it? Ill assume the missions get better but Im not sure if itll hold my interest long enough for me to see that.So far Ive gotten those 2 missions and nothing else. Im assuming there is more but nothing new comes up. No jobs no emails no texts. Maybe its a glitch either way it leaves me in an open world with nothing to do save the generic deathmatch/race/etc multiplayer matches against people who are hundreds of levels above me and multi millionaires.Some ""side"" activities in GTAO are poorly executed. Bounties where you go find a wanted person are frustrating. They have you go to a huge circle location that the target is in but dont give any details on where to find them. I searched in the zone for about 20min went through every nook and cranny multiple times after I couldnt find the guy I just gave up. Not sure if it was a bug or if the missions are just crappy by design.Another was a treasure hunt that shows you a tiny little picture in your phone and a giant circle area to search in. Needless to say it was completely boring and a total slog combing through a vast area looking for a landmark I could barely make out from the pic. Again after about 15min of searching I gave up.There are griefers in the online mode but I havent run into hackers. Some dude decided he wanted to gank me multiple times for no apparent reason. I have a low tolerance to trolling and griefing so I had to quit the session and join a new one. Compounding this issue is that bored billionaire players with jets attack choppers and maxed out stats and gear can wipe the floor with you and there wont be a thing you can do.There is a ""passive mode"" to alleviate frustration from griefers but its borderline useless. Other players cant shoot you but you cant shoot ANYONE even NPC's I couldnt do the missions because it was enabled the mechanic is poorly designed. The option is buried deep in the options menu and is a hassle to activate/deactivate making it feel even more useless.There is are microtransactions to alleviate the grind which many people take issue with. I appreciate the option however and its nice to know if I stick around in GTAO I can speedup the grind process.Overall 9/10 For $30 the SP is worth it. For MP I wouldnt recommend at that price.",Grand Theft Auto V

Cops Spawning way too frequently when i gain 1 star theres atleast 3 4 cops spawning 5 meters infont behind and in all angles possible to shoot me down with their overpowered aim. Once literally just walked around on the sidewalk not even a weapon equipped got 1 star and was immediately shot down by an army of cops currently attacking a tryhard who blew up half of the city (also fps is usually ed because of them).Loading times Pretty sure everyone knows this one youll probably get to play unturned 4.0 before this loadsPrices Everythings terribly overpricedAlso a side note you know you can call lester and pay him 5000 to call off the cops for 3 mins right? Well the CEO version of this costs 12000 and gives you 2 minutes. Because rockstarBack to money (actually this is more of a police rant) now paying 60 (now 25 ) to basically spend 90% of the time avoiding the police who by the way spawn everywhere when trying to escape its just one of those things that makes you wonder whats the point of even playing this game. You walk on the sidewalk you get a star youre dead. Have fun with some cool space alien tech get a star get killed pvp with your friend get a star get run over by a tank get a star because you attempted to defend yourself before that tank get killed.... Also sometimes just driving pass the police station will get you a few stars immediately because why not?Basically everytime i try to have fun and actually enjoy this overpriced game i get shot down by the police for literally anything.Spent millions on just calling the cops off while pvping because they seem to have a better aim and deal more damage than the tryhards youre fighting.Oh also theres this great deal on a car you can buy for 2 million dollars but before you do that you need to buy an arena for like 2 million dollars so then you can upgrade your car so you can customize it as you wish but wait one bumper is worth 500.000$.Have fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can never be bored since it has also various businesses which you need to maintain after buying one. The GTA Online is also updated I also love their Winter Theme in game. There are various of players that also makes the game interesting since you don't know what they will do. They can interrupt in your business missions steal supplies etc. You can also team up with your friends while doing the heists which makes fun. The new dlc (Arena War) is a good one. Once you purchase an arena war workshop you can customize almost all cars in the workshop. You can change the colors of the lights and it also provides a FREE wheel types of Chrome.If you want peace then you can also activate Passive mode which players can't kill you.

2018-11-21,0,0,114,False,Recommended,Overall very fun but online is a letdown.Single player is enjoyable. Fun missions active world. It's nice that your actions in the world have an effect on things like the in game stock market. That said you have to rely far too heavily on the stock market if you want to make money as the purchaseable properties offer very little income (often taking hundreds of in game weeks to break even). The amount of money you get is also not well distributed throughout the missions. You get a trickle here and a trickle there then complete the final heist and get more money than you really need only to find you don't really care because you've done all the missionsOnline was a letdown. The heists and jobs are fun and varied but the world is generally populated with people who only wish to blow you up with the rocket powered bike or armored van that they spent $20 to get. That wouldn't be too bad except the load times for basically everything are insane. Something like 7 minutes to join an online server 3 minutes to load into a lobby for a job or a heist 1 2 minutes to load the job or heist... You have to spend 15 minutes just loading to get to a point where you can do the thing you want to do. Couple that with the not infrequent lockups after jobs (which force you to alt+f4 and spend another 10 minutes loading the game) and unnecessarily long transitions between in game rounds and in lobby jobs and you're left with a sour taste.All in all I'd recommend it but for a AAA title from a wildly successful developer I expect better functionality from many of its core elements.,Grand Theft Auto V

By removing the opportunity to mod their game they are basically slapping people in the face.... people who probably bought the game on PC mainly because you had the option to mod the game.With them sending a cease and desist letter to OpenIV they basically said "" you"" to all of us. Well Take Two can stick it where the sun don't shine. I've uninstalled the game and even though I was anticipating Red Dead Redemption 2 I guess I'm gonna pass on it they don't deserve my money !Bring back modding you dumb !!Edit Modding is back thank God !!

But Rockstar's (actually it's mostly Take Two's fault) actions against the modding community have ruined this game entirely on PC. With the most recent update Rockstar has made it extremely difficult to mod online cars into single player at all. These anti online content measures were implemented years ago but the most recent update makes almost any attempt to get around their anti spawn crash the game completely.Rockstar also effectively shut down Menyoo the most popular and useful mod menu for GTA V single player. They do this to get more people online to buy in game currency and make preemptive purchases. Thing is I'd be more happy to play the online if I could play with the things in single player first.The game itself is amazing. I miss the days when I could play it without being badgered for my credit card number.I'm sad now.

2018-08-04,0,0,40,False,Recommended,Too much grinding,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-12-21,0,0,207,False,Recommended,This is a very fun game with as many hours of gameplay as you desire. Saying I recommend this game because of all the fun opportunity's to be had. First of all the single player is very fun and makes you get to know the characters. By the end you will be very satisfied with the story. Making decisions to decide what happens in the end. But online is where it can get interesting. Unless you have multiple friends you will have a lot of struggles getting the things that you want. It will take countless hours to get anything. When first starting you will be making 100k an hour if you are lucky. So you assume it will take 30 hours just to get 3 million. Which a lot of things are this price if not more. In this game you will also need money to make more money. So the start will be very hard to rank up and get on your feet. When I bought this it was on sale for $15 and a bundle for $20 for both the game and the starter pack. The starter pack includes 10 million dollars worth of stuff which I would recommend buying it if it is only 5 dollars more. It will save you a lot of time grinding to start making lots. But there are still a lot of problems with the game including loading screens that don't load. Also you about find a hacker in every game. Trolling or just in god mode which is very frustrating. If you are not one that will buckle down to this game and put tons of hours in the game I don't know if I'd recommend the game for the online. But if you are willing to put up with the countless hours of grinding doing the same thing over and over just for one item then I would recommend. But if your one that gets frustrated at people I wouldn't recommend it. Hackers will frustrate you and ruin gameplay. But I would recommend this game at the end of the day.,Grand Theft Auto V

Voice acting is top notch story is fantastic and the guns and cars all feel smooth to control and are fun to use. Rockstar has yet again created a living breathing world to explore and be apart of. Now how good is the PC version? GTA IV had a not so great PC port so some of you may not expect much but this port is fantastic. I would say it is the best way to play it with the inclusion of the developer console and mods of course.

If you like games where hackers run rampant and good behavior is considered having your vehicle destroyed constantly while people flame the chat with racial slurs and the only competant way to get anything done is on a private session with less benefits this game is for you! Do you also enjoy having hackers place cages across your apartment and setting you on fire during missions blocking your movement and killing you? This game is for you! I aactually am having a lot of fun playing the game but there seems to be no regulation for any of these hackers destroying gameplay for legit players. If you do not have friends you can play with or enjoy playing with have fun connecting for 10 minutes to one server only to find hackers and connect to a new server for you guessed it another ten minutes! The game really needs love it isn't getting at the moment or at least needs its problems brought to light and acknowledged better than they are. Thirty dollars is not a good price to be coated in hackers this late in the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

However Rockstar actively promote griefing via certain missions (intercepting other peoples sales) if this is not your thing you may find yourself changing servers often.While I have had some bittersweet experiences with the support usually if you can submit a ticket they will sort your issues out.

Problem is that it is not worth the time or the money for a game focused on forcing you to do micro transactions as opposed to grinding for literal years to reach end game assets. Especially after years of playing your account gets randomly accused of hacking and whiped because you fairly shot the wrong 12 year old too many times. So by all means pay full price $60 for a game and then have all the time and money spent be taken away from you by a whiney child who has no problem false reporting people he cannot socially get along with. Years wasted...will only play 5m servers now that have actual anti cheats and don't go on the suspiscion's of children.Keep giving RockStar money they need it for R&amp D to figure out what they can legally make people keep paying for over and over until they figure out the game is strait pay to win or grind forever until you quit from being trolled by hackers and deathmatch kiddies.

I feel almost like it needs a sperate review. I hate it. It's boring 80% of the time and is complete bs the other 20. You either run around for minutes looking for anything to do or you get sniped the second you spawn. No one wants to like DO anything. It's impossible to pug anything as everyone just kills everyone on sight. Also pressed to mention that the shark cards that are included in this are a constant pull on your wallet.""oh whats that? you want to buy this apartment? great! you can run 500 races that may or may not be doable because of lack of populaton. or when you get into them who KNOWS if someone is cheating or not as we don't do anything about them. OOOOR you could spend $15 on this shark card and buy it now"" It just feels grimey.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,327,False,Recommended,"OLD REVIEW People are finding out that Take Two sent the cease and desist order to OpenIV which is well known and is BS. What I JUST found out makes me even more mad.The closing of OpenIV subsequently shut down various major modding projects. Some of these projects include mods that were bringing Liberty City and its entirety to Grand Theft Auto V. Not only did Take Two bring unwanted shame upon Rockstar but upon themselves. Take Two also didn't only shut down OpenIV they personally sent letters to the OpenIV team requesting them to stop zerolives.com development of the GTAV Liberty City mod after YEARS of hard work on a mod that they wanted to roll out purely for consumer enjoyment . Here is the link to a petition being spread around here in hopes to save OpenIV www.change.org . Sadly while I do not think this petition will change anything (regardless of the backer count) it still never hurt to try.I'd kill for Red Dead Redemption's New Austin/West Elizabeth map to be ported over to Grand Theft Auto V but sadly it doesn't look like it's going to happen.EDIT The OpenIV fiasco is somewhat over with modding slowly but steadily returning to GTA V but Rockstar still has too much pressure on buying micro transactions. The ""free"" DLC is totally bogus. It either requires a two weeks worth of heist grinding to buy one crap car or 5 seconds with the the authorization of a shark card purchase.Therefore this review will stay negative.EDIT #2 drove around in a car worth 50 real US dollars and made black people fight each other8/10 hundreds of hours of fun",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-29,0,0,596,False,Not Recommended,Not worth it it was a great game on old gen (ps3 and xbox360) taking in acc its limitations but the game feels completely driven by the campaign (which isn't different in any aspect to the old gen one) and once you complete it there's nothing to do on single player besides secondary missions that get repetitive really soon.The online mode (which is way more enjoyable) has a lot of different gamemodes activities events and challenges and they are all fun but the players won't join as they are doing a more important activity grinding money. The whole game progression depends on a massive grind and you can't do anything else as nobody will join to any activity. Also the only profitable ways to obtain money can be easily griefed by other players which will probably have better stuff than you for doing so. By the other hand the online mode is really enjoyable and grinding is way easier if you have plenty of friends to play with you (at least 3 active friends). The most profitable ways of grinding depend on other players and most activities require at least 4 players to play so your game experience can become far better.I do NOT recommend buying this game for the full price as it is not worth it but you should consider buying it on sale if you like open world games specially if you have some friends to play with.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you find it on discount for 15 dollars go on but for normal price it ain't fair.Multiplayer has it's story of PvP that people say exists. but honestly does not appear to posible with literaly every person that attacks you is either using some kind of spamable vehicle using MC or mods. I also don't see the point of not being able to go to previous session you have been in or not being able to join any person in a online session. Not having those two stated above is basicly game braking as someone can just kill you and quit session leaving you without any posibiliy to have a decent fight (whcih is also ed up as either they go in passive or use explosives using argument as its in game but honestly lets not lie they just dont have a chance to win when its fair and want to still outstand you). Im giving it positive just beacause their support has improved and updates are still coming,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-24,0,0,742,False,Recommended,"While this game can very frequently kick you in the face it can also reward you if you can get around the annoyances...There are many aspects of this game that are great Rockstar has managed to make it a sort of all in one kind of game. Freeroam racing flight fighting the basic stuff. There's some fantastic car customization property ownership and weapon modification to personalize yourself beyond the outfit you wear. It's even grown to the point of you managing a one man criminal empire (although bringing as many friends as possible helps a lot) within a couple of disciplines. There's bank robbery drug production and sales weapons R&amp D and more...The problem is that Rockstar unnecessarily forces how you can use the things. First of all you MUST play in a public lobby to resupply your businesses or sell your product to make your money. It's easy if there's not a lot of strangers roaming about but if others are around they're bound to sniff you out and destroy you for no reason besides their K/D ratio and looking badass. There's also logic problems that I personally find that make me feel like ""I have the money why can't I just pay more to have this as an added bonus?"" or ""With everything else I have why can't I just do this or that?"" or ""If I'm allowed to have / use this here why can't I use it there too?""Generally I can have a good time on this game but it is unbelievably annoying sometimes to the point where I can't accomplish something that sounds quite simple.",Grand Theft Auto V

Committing crimes you never would do in real life is an interesting concept and brings the worst out in our virtual selves but manages to be a blast in game. Along with this an active online community for this game exists so if you get bored of offline you can always do a heist or a race with some randoms. Along with this the modding in this game is very nice and just grants the player with an insane amount of freedom beyond the status quo. This game is fantastic and by giving the players full control of their actions in game it creates a dynamic environment that makes this game addicting.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-29,0,0,471,False,Not Recommended,It's a free to play game that cost me $60. If you're going to completely ignore the multiplayer then I would definitely recommend the story mode if you can pick this game up for $20 or less. There are a multitude of problems with the online portion of GTA. First off is the loading times every loading screen in this game no matter how good your computer takes an average of over a minute. For a game that requires a loading screen every time you start it and join a mission this is unacceptable. Secondly the game is about 4x as grindy as it should be. Every mission you complete should give you twice the amount that it does and every item you have to buy should cost 50% of what it does with a few outliers here and there. The missions that give you good payouts are mind numbingly boring. When the only reason to play a game is for the rewards at the end that says a lot about how awful the actual gameplay is. There are also some design decisions that make you think about the IQ levels of the developers. For example there is a mission that requires you to go out to sea and collect three crates. However one person can only collect one crate at a time. This is no problem if you have 2 other friends to help you but as a solo player you will have to make the same boring trip 2 more times after your first. And you can't control when you get this mission so everytime it gets randomly selected I let out a deep long sigh. While I'm nitpicking I'll also complain about how the heists are nearly impossible if you aren't in a group of 4 with communication. The mission where you have to sneak into the merryweather base without being seen at all is literally the opposite of fun. And why does the whole mission end when one person leaves? Why can't the mission spot just be filled or done with 3 people? Some missions require 4 people when they could be done solo it's absolutely ridiculous. I'm just upset because this could be one of the most fun games if rockstar and take two weren't so lazy and greedy.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-22,0,0,149,False,Not Recommended,Great game that lives up to the Grand Theft Auto series... However the only downside is the obscene amount of hackers and poor online server options that make this game quite unpolished. Update No attempts by R* to stomp out hackers and botters. In regards to how fun the game is now is very mixed. You can get enjoyment out of the game either 3 ways.1. Long hours of grinding the same content for little cash or RP rewards while everything costs very high. Such as mission completion is based on time spent on it versus just completing it. Me and a few friends determined that spending 16 to 20 minutes on a 6 player mission will only give you roughly 60k cash and 10k RP? while everything in the game will cost you $1 million and up.2. You can opt in to purchase shark cards and pay to win by allowing you to access vehicles and weapons to your arsenal. Great for those that don't mind spending real $$$ for digital goods. Terrible for those that see spending $50 on a shark card just to buy 2 cars or 1 building.3. Some subreddit discord servers do offer money drops but this is where hackers come in and put people in risk of account bans.Although this game is no longer interesting to me or my friends. Especially grinding the 4 player missions over and over again for 100+ hours. We determined that this way of grinding money is not efficient anymore either.If you are a group player you may find this game fun playing with others like any open sand box game to mess around in.If you are a solo player. This game might not be the one for you. RD2 might be another alternative for that.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's a shame that they have added so many ridiculous vehicles to the game the online sessions are full of people going about with flying bikes that shoot missiles and futuristic tanks. Most of these people have hacked in money or bought shark cards as grinding in this game takes a longgggg time.The online sessions used to be more fun as it was somewhat more balanced. There used to be maybe one flying about in a hydra now everyone is on missile bikes. However they have also added lots of new things to the online sessions which make the game more interesting. There's lots of things to do in GTA lots of heists and gamemodes to play. It's also super fun with friends.The Premium Online Edition isn't a bad deal especially on sale as it will give you a nice start in the game and save you some of the initial grinding.

2019-01-04,0,0,238,False,Recommended,Single Player is fun and overall a great time! Most online DLCs are also fun and are able to maintain my interest but they are a bit expensive which attempts to make the weak willed buy shark cards or cheat. (Therefore getting banned and forcing them to spend 60 at one point to regain access to online.) The game runs great on PC but the graphics are partially lacking in some areas. (But my monitor is from like 2007 so it may just be a lack of anti aliasing) but buy this game on a current gen console. I'm on my 3rd PC account now because the temptation to cheat is far too high. Buy this game on console and make it impossible to cheat and it's 10/10.but the game is good i guess,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar clearly doesn't care about anything that doesn't make them money off of microtransactions. Singleplayer doesn't get updated ever with new content and all the multiplayer updates are just new ways to compel their players to buy Shark Cards. While on the topic of updates let me just say that I cannot stand the new ones anymore. They are starting to distance themselves from reality in the name of new content. Heists? Hell Yeah! Biker Bars and Office Buildings? Sure why not. Flying bikes with rockets on them? Uhhh... Doomsday bunkers jet packs and orbital cannons? Alright I'm out.

2017-06-15,0,0,1403,False,Not Recommended,"If you asked me what i thought of this game before I probably would've said the following. ""The singleplayer is alright. The multiplayer despite some issues is pretty good!""Let me adjust that. The single player is okay. not much of a change of opinion there. It's an average gta singleplayer with about as much replayability as one of those japanese switch machines that keeps switching itself off everytime you turn it on. Mods enhance the experience like they do with any other game.The multiplayer? where to ing begin. Load times are as unbearable as ever. But where the true monster that is this piece of garbage is the stagnation of the gameplay. Let's start where the ridiculousness began to pick up. Gunrunner's arsenal introduced several new things to the game. It introduced a whole bundle of new vehicles missions and the bunker which could make you money through selling arms stock. I won't go too in depth on this but what you need to know is that this is where things begin to pick up. A bike was introduced in this DLC that you could buy for 3.6 million undiscounted (2.7 discounted). This vehicle was the oppressor a bike capable of taking to the air with a boost from the ground that could glide around after the boost. The most notable thing about this was the missile upgrade. This allows you to shoot homing missiles from the bike while in the air.While OP there were some balances made to make sure this wasn't entirely OP. It could only stay in the air for so long the missiles were limited (negated if you were an MC president) and the missile's tracking wasn't extremely accurate. Despite this people began to notice that the game was starting to up the ante in terms of the ridiculousness of the vehicles.Two updates later and rockstar had done it again. A new sportscar was added to the game called the Deluxo. It's basically a flying delorean. Didn't think the oppressor was strong enough? Well evidently rockstar decided that was the case. This new vehicle knocks off two of what balanced the oppressor right off the bat. First off it can maintain altitude instead of having to glide like the oppressor. this means that if you just position yourself correctly you can just hold onto mouse 2 and never let go. However more importantly This Deluxo had perfect accuracy. missiles can turn on a dime if they need to. Despite all of this You could maybe somehow probably make the argument that ""because it's a bigger target and moves slower it needs to compensate with better accuracy!""Okay fine then. Your stockholm syndrome has taken full effect but you know what? I'll happily entertain rockstar one final time for the final DLC of the game. Surely they've learned there lesson haven't they?... ING HAVEN'T THEY?!And so the final DLC came around. And on this unholy release came rockstar's final you to the fanbase that stuck around from the early days of vanilla to the games final days. One final knife in the back that will the game up (because we're going to read dead who gives a .)Enter the oppressor mk 2. So remember how i talked about how there was still a reason for the Deluxo to exist yeah? well Rockstar in their infinite ing wisdom decided to create a vehicle With some of the worst counters.Let me explain. The oppressor mk 2 is a bike sized deluxo without machineguns. it is the size and speed of an oppressor mixed with the missiles of the deluxo that can also use chaff/flares to stop incoming missiles. What this means is that the original counter to the deluxo don't matter for when you're trying to hit a target that is constantly bobbing up and down that is the size of a flea on your screen. The missiles also have perfect accuracy so all they have to do is lock on to you for just a moment and fire at you. Good luck countering them on the ground. Want to try and gun 'em down with a minigun? Again good luck trying to hit a target that is the size of a flea. Homing missiles? Dodged or counter measures stopped them in their tracks. And if you weren't killed by the looney on the flying bike he'll probably just use a hack to crash your game (because when you have an anticheat constructed from quality street wrappers it's surprisingly easy to find cheaters who just set everyone on fire.Sure you could invest real time and buy your own oppressor mk 2 but then you become part of the problem. And there you start to see why this all is. The only good and consistent counters to these bloody things is to grind and grind for hours and hours until you have one vehicle that you can use to barely counter it.Or you could just buy your way there! Spend titloads of cash on shark cards and get there instantly! Rockstar wants you to spend loads of cash just to enjoy the multiplayer.Do i recommend this game? Absolutely ing not.Do you own this game? Do yourself a favour uninstall that and get a better game. If you have below 500 hours you might just be able to get over it. If you really want the game that badly pirate it so Take Two interactive (Rockstar's publisher) can lose out on your custom. this game. Thanks for taking away 1 400 hours of my life.TL DR Singleplayer is okay. Multiplayer sucks huge because of very little balancing and being ecouraged to buy microtransactions all the bloody time. Don't buy. Pirate if you absolutely have to.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-29,0,0,45,False,Recommended,"Polished beautiful funny and just plain fun GTA V rekindled the love I felt for the franchise when I played San Andreas. I found the player characters diverse comical and endearing. Switching between them kept the experience fresh and engaging. This is the first game that really tested my rig though I still managed to stay north of 60 fps with nearly all settings maxed. Graphically GTA V dropped my jaw and gave me several ""The future is now!"" moments. Even my artist wife would stop to gawk and admire what was on screen. A great balance between mostly linear plot and sandbox rampage I found driving and combat to be smooth with the right amount of challenge. My one game play gripe is the clumsy feeling pedestrian experience where it is all to easy to accidentally jump face first into a wall that I intended to scale. I found the plot to be engrossing through the final scene and can see myself retreading the story in a month or two. I originally was going to wait for the first price drop to purchase but a couple videos of gameplay graphics at 1080p was enough to persuade my wallet to open. I have no regrets. This truly is my favourite video game of all time and certainlly the best game ever in the 21 century.10/10 It's a MASTERPIECE of gaming design!",Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-05,0,0,2,False,Recommended,"After the hype has moderately died down it's pretty boring in the grand scheme of things. As is such with other GTA games well some would argue that GTA San Andreas still holds its own in the modern day along with GTA IV but that is debatable. Anyway the only real reason you would get and play this game now anyway is maybe GTA Online? I am unsure because of Rockstar essentially is just keeping it on life support for the most part with semi annual content ""updates"" that albeit are ""free"" half of them in general are pretty lame and uninspiring and nothing that couldn't have already been achieved a while before with modding. Speaking of mods Rockstar is very ironically subjective against modding which seems like a fair point until you take into account how a large majority of people can and have multiple times modded in cash and weapons and got away with it if they were in the right place at the right time. Which in a way defeats the purpose of any attempt to try to prevent abuse of modding to insert cash vehicles weapons and so forth. Even in singleplayer it has been documented that it is possible to be banned from playing online even if you aren't planning on or haven't even gone into GTA Online in a long period of time (why would you anyway) what with FiveM being a feature and all.Anyway in conclusion it's an alright game car boat and plane/helicopter physics leave a lot to be desired compared to GTA IV's (well except GTA V has planes GTA IV didn't because *cough*9/11*cough*). Story is slightly above average but absolutely does NOT come any close to being as good as GTA IV's story and GTA San Andreas's.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-03-20,0,0,516,False,Not Recommended,"This game is astonishingly annoying. How about make a game where you can actually play and have fun rather than sitting there and doing the same damn thing over and over again for HOURS just to make enough money to buy a car you could get easily off the side of the street. And this car you now have that you wasted your money on just sits there in the same spot no matter what until you spend ANOTHER 7 HOURS doing the same mission over and over again to buy a garage that holds 2 cars (if you're even lucky enough to afford two). Theres heists that can make you lots of money but those also take time and the NPC's you fight in them have perfect aim which makes it really difficult to complete them. Don't get me wrong this game has great content and im glad that rockstar adds new content still. But the fact that a reliable car costs you hours worth of grinding is ridiculous and it's getting on my nerves. If you want to be able to afford anything in online mode look for a modder because it'll take you weeks to afford some of the essential items in this game.The Online community in this game is THE WORST i have ever experienced in my entire life. Good luck finding a lobby that doesn't have some toxic 12 year old who gets amusmant out of off everyone in the lobby and then says ""XD kid ur so bad LOL"". I have never played a game with a more toxic community and it really ruins the game. I've spend the majority of my time in that game looking for a lobby that i can actually play in without being shot down by a tryhard in a hydra every 30 seconds.Story mode has some issues too. The story is just you running around killing people while listening to lester or whoever it is tell you where to go if you're too lazy to look down at the minimap in the corner. Modding singleplayer is tricky and you risk breaking the game quite a bit. It's not simple like a lot of other games and it requires a lot of digging into the files. It would be much easier if rockstar just made their own modding API.This game is alright if you can afford things and have fun with them in online mode and if you know how to mod singleplayer. If you can't do either of those then don't waste your money.",Grand Theft Auto V

Multiplayer is another story.It's fun if you have a group of friends to play with but if you join a random session full of strangers it can get quite cancerous. Half of the online session are littered with modders/hackers and Rockstar doesn't seem to give a damn about them You could just do a solo multiplayer session but where's the fun in that?

2018-12-27,0,0,47,False,Recommended,This game is a must buy for the PC version of this game even if you bought it on the 360 and the One and now the PC like I have. This game feels right at home on PC and runs very well. It's a big beautiful world that you should experience. Probably one of my favorite open world games of recent years.But how is the performance of this game? Well I have a GTX 1080 so you would expect it to run well but it's actually super optimized even if you have a weaker GPU. If you have Intel HD Graphics though I say you should not buy this game because I heard this game won't even launch if it doesn't detect a graphics card. But I may be wrong so do so as you please and then request a refund from steam. But so far I haven't had any frame drops but have had crashes. This game doesn't crash all that often but if you have mods it definitely does. (Make sure you only use mods in singleplayer)Overall I say you should definitely buy this game if you never tried it or even if you have previously bought it for a console. The price tag is worth it just for the story mode alone and online is pretty fun with friends. Overall I say this game is a 9/10. Knocked a point off because online is screwy with modders and the overpriced items. Also they got rid of account transfers some time ago so you will have to restart your online character.

When ever I get fed up with _________ personality trait I'm able to switch to some other character and see what's going on in their world. Finding Trevor in an unusual / comical situation and listen to his reaction is simply priceless.Doesn't matter what type of player you are GTA V has something there for you. But heed my word of advice take it slow! Take your time and explore! Go interact with the different groups! Explore the mountains!

2019-01-02,0,0,236,False,Recommended,Let's be serious here GTA V is worth it nowadays. For games like these steam should let us give two grades one for MP and one for SP instead of doing this in review and having people potentially not read them.SP 10/10. Great story good voice actors and excellent graphics and story telling make the SP experience alone worth it for many. Really nothing to say on that front.MP 5/10 Now this may seem a little bit high for people that played the MP but let's summarise it.Cons Loading times modders grinding(depends on person).Pros You have content for days(heists+missions) the grind(for me it's a positive thing) and community(limited cases only hope you find a good crew like SAFE and stick with them)So in total 15/20 if not on sale and 20/20 buy if on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

Additionally logging in weekly will reward you with lots of free or discounted in game items. One thing many people dislike but i dont mind as much is that it is really grindy. And if im being honest the payouts for misiions could stand to be higher cuz 15k towards a 1 2 million dollar car isnt much. THe worst thing about this game is load times. It would also be nice if the heists were soloable. In the end its a great game in terms of hours to cost and at 15$ on sale it's a steal.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-06,0,0,22,False,Recommended,"AN HONEST TO NO GOD REVIEW!!!Keep in mind this is a SinglePlayer review using keyboard and mouse only! I refuse to play online and don't want to use my XBox controller (sue me plebs).Also a review of only a 4 hour gameplay (but it's worth it dannit!...cause I've seen so much in those 4 hours).The singleplayer is fun don't get me wrong. I waited a long while before buying it...and this is the first GTA game I've ever played...just want to throw some pros and cons out there for the single player prospects trying to decide if the game is worth their time.I have what's called the ""Pros cons and peeves"". And here are the peeves first...(negative to positive...cause that's how I roll)...TL DR See ""PROS"" at the very bottom. Everything else is for laugh factor albeit true at the same time but in no way will affect your enjoyment of the game.PEEVES You can't just simply RESTART a mission. It's like some backasswards menu configuration. You have to LOAD a save then start the mission again. I'm trying to get the proper ""checks"" on each mission. One time my car flipped over while trying to 100% the first mission and I wanted to restart and it said ""cannot restart mission while currently in a mission"". That's what the d(f)uck a RESTART option is for!!! I feel like I'm the only one NOT taking crazy pills here. I simply talked to a female cop and she and her partner wound up arresting me. For what?!...I didn't do anything else. First of all I kinda see the ""struggle"" here as a black man interacting with the world (sarcasm) but second of all come on!...don't tell me that my character saying ""What's up wit u?"" deems an arrest. If this game taught me anything it's don't talk to the cops...fr fr (more sarcasm??? IDK). Politics aside it's the honest to god truth with this game. Can't even talk to a woman on the street corner without her calling the cops on you so don't bother (#metoo) (#truestory). After you get wasted or arrested your clothes change when restarting (at least mine did...EVERY TIME!). And where's my d(f)ucking car afterwards? Spent 30 minutes (no joke) getting chased by the cops while trying to avoid them and get to my safe house after getting arrested from talking to that feminazi female cop. Went to get my first haircut and accidentally selected an option I didn't want for $200 and never got a confirmation message. Lost $200. ""ARE YOU SURE?""...is that so hard to include in the game? You give me a confirmation for everything else...inclucing exiting the game. I'd think you can give me a confirmation for a d(f)ucking haircut! AND HERE'S THE BIGGEST THING THAT PEEVES ME OFF!!! If you beat someone up cops SWARM you within seconds. But when you're driving crashing into other cars running people over and running constant red lights...no cops to be found? It just doesn't seem right to me. Unbalanced?CONS I feel like I moved to a new city and still trying to get used to the environment. I don't want to move again ( Driving mechanics on a keyboard and mouse are actually pretty good but don't expect to master them right away. It'll take time to get used to it. It's a bit confusing controlling a vehicle and viewing your perspective with the mouse at the same time. Would be nice if the mouse controlled steering (this is why it's my CON). Some key bind specific mission objective messages dissapear too quickly. I had no idea how to tow the car in the second or third mission and had to restart just to see the prompts again. I am NOT blaming this on me drinking! It should be available at all times during the mission! Where do you go to rob a bank? I need money for my strippers dannit!!! I'm rollin' with $38 dollars right now (and that's due to me spending that stupid $200 on a haircut I didn't want). And in the 4 hours I've played so far only 1 person I jacked gave me money (and it was that d(f)ucking $38 I have!). Don't tell me nobody carries cash anymore. Every mission seems like a driving simulator. Drive here. Chase this guy down. I mean I get it's an open world environment but couldn't they do something different every now and then? Mix things up a little?TL DR...PROS Great voice acting. Great story. Strip club does not charge a cover. Fluid controls! Whether you're playing with a K&amp M or controller you can't deny the controls are good...either way. With K&amp M you might have to get used to the mechanics of driving the various vehicles but I think it's a disadvantage that's easily overcome.SUMMARY...GTA V is an awesome singleplayer game with LOTS of content based on the decisions you make. It's definitely worth the asking price (I bought it on sale for $15.00).Despite it's flaws I would still reccommend this game as a much have purchase. The flaws are not a big deal...just a slight inconvenience to people like me who complain about everything. I basically just expressed to you all my frustrations because I have no outlet in real life /",Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-03,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Grand Theft Auto was one of the first games I played when I was young and was my favorite series and is still till this day. The storymode is long amazing and fun. I have only 40 hours on the game (mainly on storymode) and I still havent finished the story yet. I would recommend this game it's beautiful and have a fantastic story. I may not be that active on online on pc but I am sure it feels the same as on console (i own it on console too). The only negative thing I would say is that it takes a while to go to online and sometimes (or most of the time) kicks me out of online for no particular reason but from what I know it might be relating to my NAT Type but everything else of this game is brilliant. I recommend it. Also all the DLCs are free unlike other games where you have to pay for the DLC. Good stuff just my connection to online servers have issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-05,0,0,609,False,Not Recommended,The game is good but I don't like the fact that sometimes buying vehicles actually made you stronger. For people who don't like to pay money this is a disadvantage for them. It costs time to grind for money and when you buy something you just gotta have to do it again and again. Wasting money on businesses to make more money but you just receive very little amount. And the amount of hackers gosh! I hate them so much. Rockstar you need to do something. Like every single server has them and they messed up my game everytime. I got put into cages where I cannot move. I got a toilet put on my head. I got a ferris wheel stuck in me that causes lag. I got tossed around. I got killed for whatever I do. Even when I do missions they will always annoy me and causes me to fail that mission. By the way the game lobby is just horrible. You could literally wait for hours and hours but nobody would join. I've got many heists that people never joins. Not even a single person. It almost seemed like if the missions are no longer fun it gets forgotten. So please if you would consider to buy this you would regret it or enjoy it. I have been playing for 500 hours but it is just mostly AFK and doing Missions all over and over again just for some little amount of money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-24,0,0,42,False,Recommended,This game is a triple A game and revels in that fact. It's proud of its glamour and it still holds up to this day especially the physics which are the best I've ever seen in a video game. The first person mode is also a great addition and for a 2013 game it looks fantastic. Finally the game has some minor RPG elements which I also appreciated. The stat gain is a little pointless and unnecessary but the ability to choose your heist members and have them effect the outcome of your heists is AMAZINGLY well done and adds a lot of replay value to what is for the most part a linear game. All in all there's not as much to actually do in this game as it seems at first but there's still enough for this to be a decent 9 for me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-22,0,0,12,False,Recommended,At first i was stunned by this game its huge and very detailed. There are puns everywhere many of them simple jokes but some of them realy touch on issues of nowadays.So first ten hours was like doing some mission then just drivearound and having field trip. Looking at pedestrians listen to their mobile discussion. Then the next 20 was the main story with most of the side missions. It was good sometimes the dialoges are too much but all in all i had my fun out of this.So after this i tried multiplayer and damn it is bad. Its the worst kinda multiplayer where you have to pay to get stuff that makes you more powerfull then otherplayers but doesnt realy give you any goal to achive. So most of the time peoples just fliyng around on the maps on some sort of a motojet and killing other players becouse they payed for that motojet and they will rubb it under everyone noises that they are pathetic. There are of course missions in multiplayer and you can buy buildings go racing and stuff. But this s with there toys will try ruin your fun so you might feek just as miserable as they are. I would advise against any money spent on multiplayer stuff its just a joke.But all in all the game is real good if you liked san andreas go get it.,Grand Theft Auto V

But keep in mind you'll be paying for online too and i would recommend never touching that part!And if you do DON'T pay for their 'sharkcards ' to buy ingame money because it's a complete waste.overall i give this game a 4.5/10 ONLY because of gta online!,Grand Theft Auto V

Adding to that my second day of playing the online mode resulted in gaining a condition called ""Bad Sport"" where you are unable to play with anyone except for other people with that label for 2 days on your first time recieving this condition. This is designed to prevent griefers from disrupting other players which would be fine but there is no way to appeal this and rockstar's own matchmaking system promotes gaining this feature. There are two ways to gain this feature griefing and being voted off or leaving jobs. Rockstar says that this is supposed to be in the middle of the game but I have been voted out of lobbies twice in two days and left only in the lobby screen. Other than that I have had internet trouble once whereafter I recieved the affect. This game needs significant work for one that's been out for so long there is no easy way use certain featues as well.

2018-12-22,0,0,1,False,Recommended,In regards to modding single player Modding this game is a real chore for some mods. I have been experienced in modding for a while Fallout Skyrim DoW half life you name it. But damn nothing could prepare me for how complicated it was to simply add a custom made mod car to the single player. The program you have to use the way you have to change your files was so overwhealming i just couldn't do it.I ended up refunding the game because through tryign to install like 3 mods i went down such a rabbit hole undoing all of the mods i had put in place would have been an absolute nightmare. Meaning I couldn't play online or I whould surely be banned. So unless you have the patience of a monk you're going to have a bad time modding maybe not so much if you are patient and you get the hang of it and know where everything is/goes. Not to say the mods for this game are bad the custom cars weapons and scripts rival the made my proffesional game companies.This is just my experience with modding. Yours can be diffrent it just depends oon how far you're willing to take your mods.The base game is pretty good I played it for a while on xbox and then on PS4 and I remeber enjoying it very much. The online was a mixed bag on one side there a lot of stuff to get and you want to get it/experience it all. But on the other hand it an absoulte grind to get even some median stuff. Unless of course you're willing to shell out mad cash on shark cards. Anyway overall i'd give GTA 5 a 7/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,0,0,735,False,Recommended,GTA V may has the most variety of possible gamemodes within it's online mode. The singleplayer mode ist quiet good but the core of unlimited fun is deep in the multiplayer. You can do nearly everything with your friends. After some time you will notice that there is a very good playtime to spended cash ratio. I highly recommend this game! UPDATE I purchased this game for the PS3 the PS4 and the PC and I am sure there are more people like me. In total I have a couple of thousands of hours on record and always loved spending this time in GTA Online. But as years go by one can feel that GTA online slowly reaches the end of it's lifespan.The economy transformed into an uncontrolled inflation where multiple million GTA$ won't be enough to buy basic things.Playing this game feels like working for the money at some points.Don't get me wrong! I sure like playing GTA even in these chaotic times. If you got some friends with spare time to play GTA you will explore insane scenarios story driven missions new characters with own storys and much more. You could even build your own criminal empire from scratch. Despite tha fact that you get a petty black haw down like situation every time a modder enters your session...All in all you can get a slightly aged game with decent performance and a lot of fun. Just keep in mind that GTA is in the race for a couple of years now and you will face plenty of oldtimers with a whole arsenal of stuff to keep you annoyed,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-23,0,0,337,False,Not Recommended,"EDITED ON DECEMBER 2018 tried this game again. beautifully enchanced gilttered with CHEATER. Went on a room with 20 players ish waiting for turn in arena battle. Suddenly everyone dead and game did not proceed had to force quit. Either bad UI design (no explanation) or cheater.This game actually a good game but in the end you'll need ingame money which will take hours of gameplay to get medium amount of money. And in this game you NEED lotsa money to enjoy more content. Why? Because you wanna look cool and rich after spent lots of hours in this game.EDIT ON APRIL 2018 Here's the truth of the game that I'll show to you.Never played this game again.This game has led into circle get money/grind hours on it &gt spend it on items &gt need more money for new update &gt get money and grind again &gt repeatCheaters/hackers ROAM online. A friend and steam user told me this Cheaters got banned they will re buy the game and guess who got the profit? You guess it yourself. Real/original cheaters also get the real money from non cheaters player that buy the cheat/service to get in game money. Repeat the step to get infinite money. Who in this world wants to grind for 1 2 hours just to get VIRTUAL money? Even in the store page says ""Money is king in Los Santos"" so you definitely need in game money. BUT... (read more below)Definitely not a game for those who has a steady work hours/full time job (like 7 hours a day). You grind money in real life then you grind money again in GTA Online (definitely not worth it).Where's your time for doing fun in this game (I'd rather get twice or more the fun in playing other games rather than this frustrating game where loading times are slow as heck and disconnected players that can ruin the fun) ? Or time for family that gets older? Or find yourself a lover and invest time and money for the future? How about rest? Sleeping? Exercise? Finding balance in the life? You can't get that if you play for grinding. Yes sure you can have fun in game without collecting money and just play games casually (which I can do it in another game that gives moar fun and no more loading simulator!) but in the end you will at some point decide to get some money just because you want to look cool (like having that new expensive bunker or yacht) but that's all.After so far playing this game it has come to that point of cycle I mentioned above. So I decided for now I will stay away from the game. Seeing this game has bad reviews now shows the truth of what really happened. Players got power and dev's cant just do whatever they want. It WAS a good game but if you indulge deeper and experience more you'll know and experience something others may not (eventually you'll find yourself in that circle). Check the other reviews to see what I meant.Oh! And the crew. Finding a good solid crew is a major game changer. But a good solid crews require your attention on the rules and time in the game. Example you need to report to them and ROCKSTAR everytime you get hacked/cheated on. Why? BECAUSE IT'S THEIR RULES and if you want to keep playing on the community you need to follow on. Come on who wants to follow super strict rules and not having fun? That's no my style so I left the crew.Other example you need to be online once a week or once a day and play with crew. Most time I encountered with crew needs more than 2 3 hours. Spend at least 1 hour waiting for heist crew ready by doing other activities 1 hour for serious profitable heist (not including disconnected players and long loading times) and 1 hour for screwing around having fun. Point is you need to spend a lot of time in this game to get the content of the game (cars house bunker etc) and to reach that you need a frustrating way up top. I have no crew left because all of them left the game because of technical issues and grindy gameplay. When I got new crew they got super strict rules that limits my gaming experience. Next I got a more casual crew but none shows up. I'm stuck in a loop again. ROCKSTAR needs to review their grinding thingy and make money MUCH more easier to earn money ( by easy I mean 10 minutes game gets you 1 5million) then I bet players will come back.ORIGINAL REVIEW Where should I start? GTAV has everything. FPS ? Got it. Racing?Got it. Heist? Got it. Stripclubs? Got it.Fun mission? Free roam? Crazy stunts? Aerial stunts? Parachute action? GTAV has it all.Grab some friends and go crazy!Pros +Free to do anything+Has lots of stuff (racing shooting closed room missions melee combat aerial combat your own mansion etc)+Constant updates+Detailed missions and environmentsBIGGEST Cons Loading simulator (so slow). Appereantly everyone has this issue and nothing to do with SDD and internet connection. Game is totally frustrating if you try to finish a heist/mission and have no known friends (or playing with random) where you gotta find player for several minutes. Then get into the game. When you almost finished the job a player can left the game (restart the mission) dies (restart the mission) disconnected due to error (restart the mission) trolling and killing others (restart the mission) and so on. When a player disconnects on a mission the game is abandoned/failed. Developers need to learn from DOTA 2 mission kept going and lost players can reconnect. Or simply make other players able to join the session like Killing FLoor 2POINT IS It is totally frustrating to play with RANDOM to do a serious heist missions. Yes there are some good players but kinda rare. Go get a crew (preferably known friends) of more than 4 and play with them. Play with REAL FRIENDS not RANDOM. The UI still can be fixed. Some weakness I need to press several buttons just to access a bank and store money (MAKE IT SIMPLER PLEASE). Until now I dont know if we can add favourite in game web link to the homepage or not. Rockstar try to hire someone who specializes in HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION and see what you guys can do to cut down menu selection (it takes couple of steps to do some action which should be simpler.) Let them play for several hundreds hour and take note of their feedback.OVERALL SCORE GAMEPLAY 90/100 GRAPHIC 90/100 OPTIMIZATION 70/100 (well known as FOREVER Loading Simulator)STORY N/A (did not progress far in offline game)",Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-20,0,0,654,False,Recommended,This is one of the most fun games I have I have never had so much fun in a video for a very long while.I do not see why there are any negative reviews in general on this game to be fair I think lowering the price to 29 99 was not needed I do know that they lowered it because the game is getting old and they need to make money. I have bought the game on Xbox 360 and pc and that's 110 I do not regret buying this at all I have spent so many hours into this game and I have never been thinking about a refund.It is so much you get from the game it is insane first of all you get the main part of the game story mode (singleplayer) and there is a lot of work put into the story and the design and there is nothing to say about GTA 5 story mode that is bad. When you get tired of singleplayer you can search up cheat codes and that is a fun experience you can go immortal skydiving to spawning in an attack helicopter!The GTA 5 online experience is awesome all though there are many things I don't like about online.Just GTA 5 online is awesome but the community is not the best there is way too many moders and people that hack to get money. I find it is unfair that most of the people are just money dropping and me and other legit people are trying to grind for money. In 2014 when I started to play online (on xbox360) I was having a great time! There was a lot of stuff to do heists missions and races I mostly did missions and heists because I thought they were the most fun ones. I would say I spent around 1000 hours on xbox360 and I was over rank 100 and I was getting to the point I was stopping to play the game. But after 8 months I buy GTA 5 on pc in 2015 and oh boy the game was improved the graphics had never been better than before. The game had first person now and I thought that was amazing I always wanted it on Xbox. In 2017 i think Rockstar Games got way to excited and made to many unbalenced vheicles. When you go onto GTA Online today there will always be someone in a overpowerd vheicle dont get me wrong i think they are awsome but they just are way to unbalenced for new players. Many people who owns these havn't even worked hard for them when someone spawn kills me with a opresor mk2 i often look at their playtime and it is often 50 hours only meaning they have gotten money dropped and i think that is bad game design that new players are just cheating. Reason i never fall for money dropping is because i feel like there is no point of the game is i own everything. That's what many new people think about and rockstar should really get a better anti cheating sytem. But at the end of the day i will always like this game I have had so much fun with friends on GTA 5 Online.In general i think the game is amazing.9/10Pros.Great storyAmazing graphicsSo many carsMassive open worldOnline Missions HeistsRacesCar physicsAdicitingCons.To many modersUnbalenced vheicles and weaponsBest way for me to describe this game.There is so much in this game it would take days.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-23,0,0,251,False,Recommended,Theres much to talk about well the gamr in general is awesome and every game has bugs 'n' boring stuff like loading take a bit long game sometimes freezes into the lunching a mission. But you can have so much fun online solo or with friends. Its a must have game and everyone should play it There are plenty of things to do like if you play it singleplayer and try it online you won't want to play singleplayer anymore. I dont really like the waiting on lobbies foe players and there should be some amount of cash on the setup for a heist since nobody wants to help you on a setup for free they only want the finale to get the big cash and then they complain about their cut l. Thats how it works but anyways I would really suggest some kind of amoumt of cash depending to the tike and difficulty of the setup so players won't leave the lobbies. As I mentioned above there's much to talk about this game. Play it yourself be friendly and enjoy it. I do highly recommend this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-24,0,0,207,False,Not Recommended,"I really really really regret buying anything from this Garbage company. They have not shown any respect to PC owners for a decade now and it started with the first Red Dead Redemption. Apparently GTA IV had been sold across regions for a very low price or something and had been pirated a lot (which it may have been because it was a filthy port which never got fixed by Rockstar? and as for regional pricing it was new back then) No matter what the reason the head of Rockstar lost his and said something along the lines of ""PC gaming can burn in hell"" and we have been seeing the direct result of that attitude in how Rockstar releases its games. The first Red Dead Redemption game had a very troubled development cycle but many games through that and still manage to get ported on multiple platforms. Their excuse that code for RDR1 is very messed up and would be a pain to port on PC is BS at least as far as I am concerned. Many games even have seperate builds for PC's and Consoles but Rockstar never wanted to release it for the PC because hurr durr piracy and thats the simple reason it didnt come on the PC!Next it was GTAV's turn to not be released on the PC but this time they had a very profitable online model which they realised would be what would make them the big money and because its a perfect fit for PC it was after more than 2.5 years of begging and groveling by PC gamers like yours truly ported on to the PC but only after the new consoles were launched and they could time the release with the release on newer consoles.And now its RDR2's turn and once again they have done what virtually no other third party developer does in this day and age which is to develop a game for both consoles but not on the PC and once again PC gamers (this time not me) are begging them for a port and it sickens me that despite them not having any respect for us we still beg them to throw their scraps at us!!It may or may not come on the PC but that depends on how well the online mode does for RDR2 consoles and weather they feel that they can make enough money with it on the PC BUT the only moral thing to do as a PC gamer is to not buy the game as a screw you to Rockstar for treating us like ! That doesn't mean you can't play it though cuz its completely ethical when it comes to a greedy slimy company like Rockstar (wink wink)P.S making people buy multiple copies is not something they care much about imo... they can ban cheaters hackers etc all year long on PC and they keep buying new copies to play... Its really the sweet sweet recurrent spending on mtx money they are really after and they may decide that RDR online will not generate enough $ on the PC and still not worth it and I hope it doesn't!!

2019-01-06,0,0,240,False,Recommended,"Lots of text.Firstly cons. After playing the first month in GTA 5 Online in a solo (!) I can write my subjective analysis. The game becomes boring for 2 weeks. Passing the same missions every day inadequate players modders and so on start to get annoying. As for inadequate players and modders read later. In my experience at the beginning of the game many players are not quite friendly to beginners so who is going to buy it immediately I warn you that criticism of your actions will be almost constant until you understand what to do at all. However if you will find a crew or some friendly company/friend then I think that you will get around these problems. Also with regards to financial problems. I can write only one thing you have to constantly save on everything. If you will buy any expensive objects (cars apartment office club etc.) at the beginning of the game then you will simply become bankrupt in the very first days. Therefore you need to spend a lot of time in the game to get enough amounts of money (ie as many have already written grind) however if you are willing to spend real money then everything that was written above does not make sense. I did not ""blow up"" due to the lack of fancy and expensive cars airplanes or any vehicles therefore I spent the minimum amount of money on it and I had enough with free cars from Rockstar so I don t complain about it. Returning to the text above about modders and inadequate players (killers) it will be obvious in the first week in the game that there are a lot of them. Be prepared that you will be disturbed and killed everywhere even in places where you do not expect that you will be killed and you will get angry (prepare your nerves). For example when leaving home or entering during the missions in stores during a calm purchase of something after missions (past teammates) during a riding somewhere (the probability of a vehicle blowing up with you will be 80% depending on online) unless you decide to change session. Also do not forget about modders since they have a great mission to mock the players with any methods that you ever had in your brain. Although it is possible that UFO lovers might like it.About the pros. Lively and funny character dialogues different missions fun with friends (if you have) and a story mod gives you an immersion into the universe of GTA 5 where you can enjoy the whole gameplay by yourself and decide for yourself whether you want to continue your adventure online or not.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-22,0,0,661,False,Recommended,Warning LOADS OF READING TO DO There are times when I look at Los Santos and think 'why would you even think to build that?' This is appropriately a thought that I often have about Los Angeles. In GTA 5's case the tone is different baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled y'know despair. Rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit. I look at it and I wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so. I marvel at the care evident in San Andreas' gorgeous sunsets in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world in the artfully chosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience. Everything about Los Santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years. The abiding irony of Grand Theft Auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in Los Santos hates it there.Specs Minimum specifications OS Windows 8.1 64 Bit Windows 8 64 Bit Windows 7 64 Bit Service Pack 1 Windows Vista 64 Bit Service Pack 2(NVIDIA video card recommended if running Vista OS)Processor Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q6600 2.40GHz (4 CPUs) / AMD Phenom 9850 Quad Core Processor (4 CPUs) 2.5GHzMemory 4GBVideo Card NVIDIA 9800 GT 1GB / AMD HD 4870 1GB (DX 10 10.1 *11)Sound Card 100% DirectX 10 compatibleHDD Space 65GBDVD DriveRecommended specifications OS Windows 8.1 64 Bit Windows 8 64 Bit Windows 7 64 Bit Service Pack 1Processor Intel Core i5 3470 3.2GHZ (4 CPUs) / AMD X8 FX 8350 4GHZ (8 CPUs)Memory 8GBVideo Card NVIDIA GTX 660 2GB / AMD HD7870 2GBSound Card 100% DirectX 10 compatibleHDD Space 65GBDVD DriveIts your choice if you want to get this game but i highly recomnd it add me on steam if you want play togther Rank 505 in Online,Grand Theft Auto V

If you own GTA 5 on the PC get FiveM! If you want to play GTA Online get a PS4 or XBone and play from there. Singleplayer on the other hand is also better on PC with OpenIV back up players can download any mod for the singleplayer without getting banned!

2019-01-09,0,0,509,False,Recommended,The Story Mode was a fun experience when i played it back on the xbox 360 in 2013 however after buying the game on pc and replaying it you kind of realise that the story wasn't actually that good out of the three characters only one feels like a genuine piece of writing Franklin whereas the other two Micheal and Trevor feel like social commentary rather than GTA characters which describe two sides of what is wrong with the American Dream. However if this games on discount for under 15 then I would say that it is worth the spend if youve never played it if not then not much point. The online is semi cancer with every lobby having a hacker and being such a grind that after 400+ hours of what was very fun i started to question whether i had wasted my time but tbh i love the idea of creating my own gangster/ criminal overlord so the online does fullfill that aspect very well which makes the online a little bit more worth it.7/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

The gameplay is quite easy as you just follow clearly written out instructions 90% of the time and shootouts are extremely easy since this game was made for a console. Sadly it also has a lot of filler missions and plot strings which don't really go anywhere.GTA Online is awful. You grind money for cars (or pay up to $40 for one single car at a time) hoping to god people don't blow up your stuff because the game is designed to encourage griefing in order to bully people into purchasing shark cards.I take particular umbridge with the game world as about 60% of it is lifeless desert where there's just nothing except for a bunch of shaped cactusesI'd say get it on sale for the story and avoid GTA Online at all costs,Grand Theft Auto V

It s unbelievable to think this game was released 8 years ago cause of how good the graphics are and the fact that it s still sitting on the bestselling list despite being so old. The graphics of this game are incredible and the single player is outstanding. The story is so rich in detail and you can choose to play between three players instead of just one. The soundtrack is also astonishing and the voice acting outstanding.However Multiplayer is an absolute s**tshow and Rockstar should really fix the issues that plague Online. The only good thing out of Online are the heists. But even they suck in single player you do everything solo so why do you have to team up with 3 other players in order to finish some silly heist setup? It makes no sense.

Response times are long and they often can only reset accounts rather than actually patching bugs.When I first logged into the game I enjoyed the begining of the story mode and was excited that I decided to buy the game.The following happened 1 hour into my game when I attempted to go to GTA Online.1. Created a character and started up GTA Online.2. Game froze and stopped responding.3. Upon relaunching the game I was informed that my character was corrupted.4. Attempted to overwrite corrupt character game threw out a failure notification.5. Looked online for tips to get around the bug saw threads from over 2 years ago and realized this was a longtime issue.6. After hours of research finally decided to send a support ticket.7. Rockstar's site crashed as I attempted to send the ticket.8. Requested a refund through steam.Waste of time support is a joke bugs are never resolved.0/10 would not recommend.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-09-13,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,I Used to Recomend this game and love this game but im Sorry. Unless your buying this game to play it on Singleplayer and only ever on singleplayer then dont buy it. The multiplayer is full of hackers and regardless of what Rockstar say they are doing. They arent. The hackers can now Stop your reports and Ban you on will without fear of rockstar because rockstar have failed to create a functional report system instead they leave it to AI. The Hackers have access to your IP and unless you are using a VPN then your in danger of being hacked. I watched a Hacker tell everyone where they were living in the first lobby ive joined. I thought they fixed this from all the comotion however they havent.So unfortunate that dispicable people ruin such a good game. IT could have been like Cod where you have to buy every expansion but no its not they give out free expansions.

2019-01-12,0,0,222,False,Not Recommended,Story mode is amazing. Online is just you trying to get on with your whils an taht has bought a jetbike that has got heatseeking guided rockets that cannot be avoided unless you are equiped with flares(that you dont have in most vehicles) the bike has got the flares so you got no way of killing them apart from killing the player he respawns and just calls his bike next to him(that's a feature of the game not a cheat) takes of and continues spawnkiling you. Such fun much wow. Very balanced. Rockstar just added something that they haven't balanced a bit that breaks the immersion AS since having a bike that handles like a jet has got heatseeking missles and flares is something you'd see everyday. (They added flying vehicles with rockets as well.) Such thing never should have made it to FREEROAM. I am fien with these things being in missions where the odds are even or where you use it in coop. But getting constatnly spawnkilled by a kid that just doesn't have to do anything(you just aim the bike in the general direction and press the button to launch a missle it will target and seek the target on its own) is stupid.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-16,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,I explained my stance on singleplayer in my first review. Short version Its pretty good. Rest of this is about onlineWhile new content has been added I still see the same issues with this game. I've owned this since it launched on console and honestly the most glaring issue that I seen with it since the start is the ever increasing difficultly for new players to make it in the game.The problem isn't that players can get access to god tier equipment but that said equipment can be instantly accessed for what is essentially no cost/effort after the inital cost has been paid. Want a tank/jet/apocolypse on wheels? Call it in on your phone. Did it get destroyed? Call it in again... immediately after.Basically high level players get the rewards they deserve but have no limits on how much they can use them. This results in many cases where a low/mid level player will be unable to deal with a high level player even if they manage to kill them.High level players put time/effort into this game and should recieve rewards for such however the current system elevates high level players to a point where it essentially makes them untouchble to those who are not of the same status making online difficult to enjoy for those who are not high level.,Grand Theft Auto V

End rant about GTA online The singleplayer story have some fantastic moments but are centered around heists. Mechanics used in some heist are seldom used elsewhere. It can be a bit hard to bond with three characters simultaniously unlike GTA4 which you only had (one) Niko. The vehicles are way to easy to control which makes vehicles pretty boring to drive even though there are a slight difference between different vehicles.

2019-01-31,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,I was expecting a lot when i got this game recently i was expecting a lot and only was surprised with very little. The story mode/single player is alright and the online is meh at best for me at the moment. My biggest issue is that yet another online game that has CRAP for character creations. All female characters look like masculine body builder types even after literally spending 3 1/2 hours in the creation screen. Their stats do nothing on their looks and thought I can get their faces to look less like a nuclear accident to a somewhat plausible woman I watched twenty character creation videos and unlike them my character looks fubared even though following their guides 100% so makes me think that they are using some sort of mods if that is allowed. I know the devs can create some nice looking characters but they force the player base to get the crapfest of a character creation. THey need to take a look at games like Dragon Age Inquisition or Fallout 4 look at how in depth the character creation screens are you can litterally SCULPT the faces or teh character and modify the bodies before accepting the character. IF I was able I would rate this game wiht a negative 5 stars just for crapfest character creation for online,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-28,0,0,1410,False,Not Recommended,"I am someone who used to love this game but I don't anymore and my reasons are just the tip of the iceberg so here's why... I'll try to keep this as short as possible but write it so that you can grab something useful from it.First of all I worked as funny as it sounds I worked for 2 years to afford a PC and this game I bought along with it. At the time the price was understandable but now this game should be free to play in all honesty after all they care about microtransactions more then people actually buying the game. This one is the worst one of them too sadly from masterpieces nowadays companies make what was once good back into trash or even worse. Rockstar Games just steal stories from negative stories that they make into theirs from stealing it and make it even worse then it already is. Of course the goal is to make it as fun evil and make the characters seem like they're all superheroes in human form. No wonder the customers become the robotic slaves that Rockstars are themselves. However let's talk about Storymode Online and what I got from this game First a basic overview.Although online mode isn't even worth talking about all you have to do is look at the other reviews and you'll see that Rockstars would grind anyone's knee for real money. Luckily I never fell into that trap but I am here to feel sorry for all those that keep purchasing them. The company finds it funny when people go bankrupt they even show jokes like these hidden in they're hardcore games that are grabbed by idiots like me who just want to have openworld fun in a ""limitless world"" but no more am I spending money into they're garbage. You just have to look at it a bit more spiritually and you're eyes are opened.Storymode Is worse then any other GTA before. Yeah maybe the experience for the first time can be nice when you blow up someone something or there are nice cutscenes and a criminal dialogue but that's about it.First of all you'll notice that the gameplay is just repetitive it can be fun killing cops for a number of times but even the crouching system is just Instead of being able to hide where you want you are locked to close by objects and instead of hating it people worship it like it's godlike.You have only 69 missions (+ strangers &amp freaks which are even shorter) Along with that although you have 3 characters however 3 characters in only 69 missions doesn't go well but nobody could have known that at the time... You don't have enough time to get to know the characters but in all honesty who would wanna get to know the monsters that are lurking inside not me at the least. Now back to the missions even though they put at least some work into them? Well you'll end up having more questions then answers where people make stupid ""What happens"" or ""Myths"" about certain things. Myths is another thing instead of making it as hidden as in GTASA they just end up revealing the whole thing where in GTASA this game still has unsolved mysteries and findings waiting to be solved even today. Sadly masterpieces won't be made anymore from Rockstars and we can prove that by comparing the new games with the old where those always win because the gameplay is simply better.Online Spare me please this has to be the worst online experience I ever had in a game so far first of all the foverly too futuristic vehicles that are in the game are in reality vehicles like that are yet to be revealed to the public but GTA had to of course take one step ahead and cause a war between the players where vehicles is one thing but cooperating and making profit together is a problem too for instance in Facility Heists which is the most nerve racking experience I have ever faced and the most I have ever swore in any game yet literary causing me to go psychotic simply because they made it beyond hard to make any money in... and if you wanna know how then don't forget to play 12 hours a day just to remotely get to where you wanna get... I am not someone who knows how to scam or abuse the system. I am someone who works hard for the money but then the is so expensive... I'll stop there with that because I'd have to blow someone's face off to express what I mean.Don't buy this game at all cost and don't even get it on discount. In fact don't even get it if it becomes free to play this game is garbage.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-31,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE These idiots sitting in a cubicle banned my account without offering any evidence whatsoever and then have the nerve to tell me I can't appeal it. this company honestly.Overall a good game I'd pay no more than $40 given some of its core issues connection is no longer server based but P2P which explains some of the ridiculously long loading times. you're often matched with foreigners when you try to lobby up for setups/missions. I've nothing against them except for the fact that they're laggy af to play with the ING oppressor mark 2. Very few viable countermeasures especially if you're on your own. The homing on that is absurdly powerful would be great if the handling got heavily nerfed along with the lock on range and homing ability so that there's some actual risk to using that to duel players rather than throw a missile or two and be miles away by the time they respawn calling in your helicopter spawns it over a mile and a half away half the time even when there's a perfectly good helipad right near you (e.g. on top of office). It's somewhat understandable in freemode but dispatches heists and other missions? Really? one of these days you'll buff the Cargogbob out of it's semi useless state. It can only pick up a small selection of vehicles and what's WORSE you can't pick up a vehicle unless you or your teammate get in it for at least a split second. It'd be cool if you offered a major upgrade like a longer hook or that big magnet and even a hint of added mobility and/or countermeasure buffs.Like I said though in spite of these issues I'd still recommend it especially at its $15 sale point.

The main story is amazing and can be played however you like or not at all. You could just play online the entirity of your GTA life. The story should be experienced at least once by everyone though it really is a masterpiece. I recommend the game just for that solely but you're probably wondering about the multiplayer so here we go.The multiplayer of this game is a double edged sword while with a friend or two or even alone you can always find something and someone to do something with the game has been out for many years and to keep it relevant powercreep has taken a huge toll on the balance of the game. A tank used to be the sign of a powerful and rich player now you're lucky to drive 10 feet in a tank without dying to agile flying machines that can one shot you and guns that laugh in the face of a tank turret.Though you can have sooooo many fun toys gliding or flying through the skies on an Oppressor is simply one of the best feelings you can have in a game the absolute absurdity and freedom is so much fun but getting there is the elephant in the room no one wants to talk about to new players.It costs a ridiculous amount of grinding to get to the good stuff hundreds of hours of tolerating s who want to tear you a new one every 15 seconds just because you exist while you try and sell some guns or drugs to get enough money for that new upgrade or vehicle. Or you can take the whale route and have everything right away and become a menace to the server for a quick and easy few hundred dollars of your own hard earned money.The game is best enjoyed with a couple of friends riding together taking a server by storm or just completing missions at your own pace the heists for example pay a lot of money require good teamwork and are very enjoyable albeit frustrating and a little random at times.Absolutely recommend this games' single player and multiplayer as long as you have friends or money to get to the good stuff fast.,Grand Theft Auto V

The single player is really good and i wished they would have made single player DLC but instead they focused on multiplayer and released ""free"" content. By ""free"" i mean over time they rigged everything to where you have to devote hundreds to thousands of hours to even buy the thing you want and mess around. They could have fixed this by adding a sandbox multiplayer mode where you have access to everything so you can have fun or by adding the multiplayer stuff to single player but instead it's all about the money. The multiplayer is rigged to make you buy shark cards and is riddled with hackers/modders and people that do nothing but kill others for no real reason. Also the only way to make money is play in these lobbies with these a holes.I recommend buying on sale for single player but not for multiplayer.",Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-30,0,0,327,False,Recommended,Anyone can run this game. It's really fantastic how compatible it is. I played it on integrated graphics with a processor that would fail 1st grade math class. Granted with a less than able computer you'll have to use the lowest graphics settings and play on a window that contains less pixels than your smartphone while still getting low FPS. But that's the beauty of the game. It doesn't lose the aspect of playability even when played on a rotten potato. As for the gameplay itself well... its a GTA game sooooo.... But there's plenty to keep you busy for hundereds of hours. Not to mention the fantastic replayable story. But in the very rare case that you may become bored with this game there's always tons of community created mods to keep you interested. From new cars and player models to new locations and missions. The modding community has a bunch of stuff to offer.GTA Online is something I am not as familiar with. Although for the little time I spent there I was already dying randomly... as well as everyone else in the game. But the singleplayer mode keeps me busy enough so I usually stay in that. But it's up to you to decide what part of the game you like the most. All in all this game is definitely worth the price.,Grand Theft Auto V

I like this game i played very much on this game and i really enjoyed it but lately there were just too much of moders and when you don't have much friends it's kinda boring to play it . If you meet modder they just start giving you money and that completly ruins the experience of saving money to buy something. Yea in this game are really expensive things and you must play it alot to afford these things yea for me it's not a problem but if you're an adult without time it isn't that bad to have moded money from someone but the game won't feel the same. I met codder lately and he said he won't get banned becouase he is codding and his reports are refreshing and they ""can't"" detect his files he was banning innocent people on the session who just tried to kill him he said they got perma banned . Just he took 60$ from them and i don't think it's good . A second by he started dropping money to people and did some commands on the session like !money !spawn and stuff and it worked so i left . i just felt i must write this here becouse i don't want to be happened again. For me this game is very good and you can have lot's of fun if you have atleast 1 friend to play it with yea with more people it's more fun but i don't have that much friend's to play with so im playing alone or with 1 person and im really enjoying it even when i have everything in this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

This game feels like an indie alpha at times it's unpolished and frankly broken to a point of being almost unplayable.

2017-08-31,0,0,834,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This is my review for GTA OnlineThis game is amazing if you had started before all of the expensive DLC's came out and had money built up along the way. Otherwise this is not the game for you. It's now become extremely hard for newcomers to gain any cash to get by in this game because of the overly expensive prices of in game items as well as the tryhards and KD warriors who constantly roam around sessions prancing on low levels. The only realistic method of gaining decent cash is through the heists but even then it's hard to complete because of the amount of people required and the lack of incentive for more experienced players to go play them. If you have money to spare for the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack then do consider spending the extra cash as your GTA Online experience will be significantly worse if you don'tIf you have friends who play the game and are willing to help you grind then by all means go for it. This game is amazing when you have people to play with even if you start playing at this point. Otherwise the solo experience as a new player right now is not great.However if you intend on playing Grand Theft Auto V Story Mode then go ahead. I had a blast playing through the story mode.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-26,0,0,204,False,Not Recommended,There are many problems with GTA5. The character movement vehicles controls and health system are terrible. When trying to play GTA Online other players will harass and bully you. The report system does nothing. The online portion has been pathetically implemented. Players can kill other players in free roam with no consequences. High level players can destroy newer ones with ease. Better yet when they kill you you spawn right next to where you died so they can kill you again. This game facilitates borderline criminal levels of harassment. Also there are missions to do in free roam than can pay out a couple hundred thousand credits that usually involve selling things from your properties but someone can come and destroy it all instantly. In other words this game is trash.,Grand Theft Auto V

The only curent complaint is that no one at R* will set my level back to 169 from 8000 and it annoys me I join a lobby and get kicked for being a hacker and it drives me mad. It is happening a lot lately 5 of my friends also got set to level 8000 when we joined a lobby to play Biker missions and suddenly we all disconnected and a R* Alert opens up saying they have set our RP to the correct amount and suddenly level 8000 and cannot play anything. If R* would please help me it would be amazing. I have hundreds of screenshot about me having fun with friends and I still hae friends joining even now Thnx for the game R* please sort my level and Continue to make the game better while we wait for GTA VIEdit this was resolved within 6 months of it happening by a player I had use hacks to change my level because Rockstar didnt care enough to help,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,326,False,Not Recommended,Not recommended for nonexistent multiplayer moderation freemium style multiplayer mode on a full priced game and their recent legal action against a 10 year old modding tool coupled with a bald faced in their official statement on the matter.This is a shame because this game has brilliant single player and some of the best production values I've ever seen in a game. If it weren't for the crass monetization of multiplayer the truancy of admins to put a stop to the online cheaters and the blaming of OpenIV for said cheaters this game (at least single player) would be one of the best money can buy and would come highly recommended. Take2 and Rockstar need to have repercussions for their behavior. Since they already have my money (twice) for this game the only thing I can do is hurt their rating in retaliation.Take2 should know better especially since their other devs like Firaxis are very mod friendly.,Grand Theft Auto V

I guess the story content was alright but it could have used a few more loading screens. Online is basically all loading screens so that's good. Recommended Current Review Of the 1 400 hours I've spent playing this game 1 399 were being killed by geysers of water appearing under my feet Christmas trees replacing my character model and lagging my game to high heavens random session wide explosions causing lag and unending death because you can't open the menu to quit the game parts of structures spawning over you and trapping you in place and instant death orbital cannons. I guess the story content was alright but it's not worth AAA prices anymore (let alone Shark Card prices). Online is basically one great dumpster fire of modders griefing in Godmode as described above and an incredibly forceful microtransaction marketing strategy because of hyperinflation by a greedy publisher.

Together with very nice city and all what can be done there I was really happy. If you want to play only singleplayer part of the game go for it by all five.Multiplayer I have never seen so bad multiplayer realisation than in this game. Especially when you want to play together with your friends you basically can't. Other then go together around the city. But quests matchmaking was made by someone who never did it before or I don't know. Even if you are in private crew party there is almost impossible to play together trough any quests part of online game mode.

2019-01-05,0,0,427,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is one of the defining games of the 2010 decade both for being a magnificent environment to traverse around and a disappointing abused cash cow culminating into the most profitable game ever as of 2018.Singleplayer story mode is a strange tale of three characters who navigate their less than tranquil lives into high stake crossover crimes ultimately parodying some of real American experience and an egotistical culture which is transforming with new technology into something worse. The result what this game should really be like with all of its bells and bruises. However having replayed this recently some of the mission timings are off and some collection missions are just plain stupid.Multiplayer in the form of GTA5 Online is a shadow of its former self rich but you must be time and 'money' rich to try and even begin enjoying it. Once upon a time there was 'hardly many' assests worth having and now there are 'many fine' additions to the game with each taking a very long means to get to. CEO businesses a good idea in theory have arbitrary costs and running costs to prevent players wholely enjoying them often with stupid wait times to profit off of them too. But in reality they pay out more under normal conditions than what the grindy instanced missions do just not enough for any meaningful length of time. Don't worry though the game will keep bugging you until you decide to buy all of the new updated stuff! Also adding hackers into the mix who can frequently pop up in public lobbys (which don't even have true dedicated servers they try to work it from your router) makes this game more of a free for all than what its own parametres should allow for. Sure they get banned and sure they give out free stuff every now and then but Rockstars management of the game has left much to be desired from what is suppose to be the defining 'live a life of crime in style' game of this decade. After all you can just buy another account on sale if you want too after getting banned (even incorrectly with resolution as some have claimed) even if you're too young legally!If anyone wants a snapshot as to why the PC port of this game just doesn't mesh well too all you have to do is consider the 'new' arena style update which handles bad like punching in a dream with cotton arms whilst looking aesthetically unpleasing. On top of all the other problems mentioned above of course.To conclude I'll finish this review with this comment. Someone once said that it's stupid to dislike a game after having played more than one hundred hours. After all you must've enjoyed it at some stage during that massive amount of time invested. I agree. This game has many gripping moments and experiences that make it one of the best of this decade. But if you want to 'have' more artistic freedom in creating a character and interacting in the online mode be prepared to spend a lot of money time or even both to get anything out of the game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-02,0,0,685,False,Recommended,"This review will be in parts one for Story Mode and the other for Online.Story Mode Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best GTA's ever made. Not because of story but because of ingenuity. It's the first of hopefully many games to allow you to have 3 main characters that you can switch to and play at any point in time sort of. The game world is one of the biggest maps I have ever seen in a game and it is to scale as well as it takes several minutes when driving full speed to do a full loop. Graphics are another thing. For a game that was released on PC in 2015 almost 4 years later the graphics are still better than most games to date. Not only that but the game runs buttery smooth. If you meet the recommended requirements you will be able to play and enjoy this game. That is mainly because the game engine is amazing. In all my hours playing this game I have hardly ever crashed even with mods. One of the things I loved about GTA 5 was the story mode. I thought it had a great story mode that was accompanied by an even greater interactive game world. For example the in game stock market. If you wanted to make money the stock market was a very good option to do so. You can manipulate it by destroying rival companies products like airlines or trucks. This would end up causing your company to grow. There was also the infamous stock market assasination missions where you could earn millions. The actual story itself was great. The characters all had ""character"" and while some were comedic like Trevor others were more gritty and serious like Franklin or Michael and I never felt like one character was a carbon copy of another which is good. The story had a very serious feel to it while playing but it never felt like a chore especially with all of the comedic breaks in between. Even playing the story to this day I still find myself laughing at parts because of dialouge or what the mission actually entails.There is much more that I could say about the story mode of GTA V but I typically like to keep my reviews focused on a few really good aspects of the game.Online GTA O has had a very long ride and believe it or not is still active to this day. I have mostly found myself enjoying Online because of a few things. Money cars and grind. I actually enjoy the grinding aspect of this game unlike other people. It is totally possible to buy what you want if you dedicate yourself to working for it. To jump right into it I honestly think more money should be earned from doing missions and selling product but I also think people that complain about other people buying shark cards are overreacting.Shark cards are an in game microtransaction that have been in the game since it was released. I have purchased a few in my lifetime but that's it. In total I have probably spend $100 or less and that's across all platforms since 2013 when the game came out. That was also back before you could own a criminal empire and make money fairly easily so it makes sense. Rockstar has done a fantastic job with keeping this game alive with updates. I always have a period where I stop playing for a while but the updates almost always bring me back.So yeah. I could go on about this game but I would definitely recommend it. The hackers in Online have seemed to die down as of late but you can still run into them every now and then but overall this is a really good game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-10,0,0,161,False,Not Recommended,I belive that It's way to much grinding for what you're saving up for especially because you need to repeat the same missions over and over again just to make some profit. When you are doing a heist and someone leaves it cancels all progress and you have to start over. (This also counts to when you are basically flying to safety and one player disconnects)This isn't anything new but I have to wait at least 10 15 minutes just to join a friends lobby.Some say they are only in it for the money I say that I wouldn't have played the game if it hadn't been for my friends.If you still want to buy the game after reading this buy it on sale.4/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-11,0,0,162,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It has a fine singleplayer campaign that in all honesty is a very good experience with a lot of things to do and explore. Some might get bored after completing it once some might want to 100% it or run tru the game multiple times. But nobody cares for the singleplayer (the devs sure as heck dont) As for multiplayer its a fun experience with a couple of friends but its not something I would call ""good"" Sandbox is rarely interesting and consists of constant meaningless shootouts with randoms and griefing. While it's expected there's barely anything to do _other_ than that.And everything else you could do is grindy at best. yes you could do cool call of duty style missions with friends shooting npcs and such and get like 20k for each but why would you when your time is best spent grinding either whatever mission gives 2x cash at the moment or doing cargo runs in sandbox for corporations to get even more money. all of that only so that you could buy a boat/plane/tank to use in the sandbox which as i've stated isn't really fun. It's all just a microtransaction scheme regardless. skip this game unless you care for the story and even then i'd rather you wait for a sale or ask a friend to share it rather than giving this company more money.",Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-07,0,0,98,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5An awesome and quality game as expected by Rockstar but it is also marred by boring tedious and outright painful challenges and activities. Where is the fun in collecting over 100 collectibles? The hunting challenges are alright until you meet the 4th photography challenge which will make you rip your head off. The game also lack many quality of life features such as restarting a mission without needing to fail it then exit out of the mission then play it again and collectibles tracker especially with the absurd amount of them.I also do not agree with the way handles additional content. Why do I have to play a previous version of the same game in order to get more content? If I pay for a game I expect to get everything without needing to play a previous version or some other nonsense. Missions are too linear and aren't made to be replayed either but they have these gold medal objectives that forces you do to it if you want to 100% the game. I don't like how police instantly starts searching for you the moment you commit crimes like they are ing ready for it. GTA Online is just a cheatfest so don t bother with it.The Rockstar editor is an awesome addition and many more games should have that but the camera feels too restrictive.Complains aside the game world is stunning even in 2019 standards. The driving and shooting in the game is satisfying the story and missions is interesting when you first play through them. The amount of variations in the side missions are an icing on the cake as well.Overall this game is a very solid game though some aspects leaves to be desired.In depth Review Hours put into game as of writing 76.6Complexity Easy to learn and master Easy to learn but hard to master Hard to learn and masterGame Type Single player only Multiplayer only Single player and multiplayer Mostly multiplayer Mostly single playerBuy at what price?

2015-11-09,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,The singleplayer mode has a great story that spans across three main characters and overall has great support for mods created by the community. I would highly recommend this game for the singleplayer experience just because of the story but also would recommend only getting it on sale.The singleplayer story is based around three unique characters who you will come to love as the story progresses. I didn't get Grand Theft Auto V right when it was released on PC after being ported over from consoles. So I can't really talk about the experience then but I can talk about it after that since I personally got the game back in November of 2015 which was roughly ten months after its release on PC. However these days upon joining online you are already thrown face first into the wall with abysmally long loading times into multiplayer. Multiplayer sessions are also hosted by individual players through their clients so it is very easy to find out who's hosting your session and DoS/DDoS of them if you please.Once you load into an online session after about a good five to ten minutes of waiting you will be met with the toxic dumpster fire that is the online experience. Modders/Hackers/Cheaters are still a problem after the various ban waves that Rockstar has claimed to have done. They constantly are greifing in online sessions be it either a regular free roam session or a mission They have also just brought the overall feeling of playing online down making it not worth playing in public sessions anymore unless it is a small session which of course will eventually be filled up.Modders have the ability to essentially destroy entire lobby sessions at will. Various abilities such as teleporting everyone spawning objects spawning objects in safe houses (apartments motorcycle clubs offices etc.) and becoming invincible to all damage just to name a few are all available to a modder to use at their consent. There are a few friendly modders out in the GTA Online community that will simply create race/stunt tracks for players or even hand out money however the practices are still shady since some money that modders give players may result in either a character reset or an entire ban from the GTA Online part of the game.Players can avoid being killed and overall abused in public lobbies by entering passive mode via their interaction menu however it will limit what the player can do in terms of what events and positions a player can enter. Passive mode is more of a mode to get from point A to point B if you are just not doing anything. Personally I have used it to just screw around in a session with my car or fly a plane around the map and explore. Passive mode will protect you from any PVP damage however it environmental damage self damage and damage from NPCs for example from the Police will still be able to be dealt to you.Online features more content than the singleplayer experience from new clothes to sweet rides to even new safe houses. However anything that isn't vanilla that has been added in through various 'free dlc' updates have been insanely priced to promote grinding for cash and overall to keep players playing the game. If you don't feel like grinding for money you can fork out some additional money to Rockstar for some of those shark cards with the highest tiered card the Megalodon Shark costing the player $99.99 USD for just a measly $8 000 000 dollars in game that can only buy a few fully modded super cars or a couple of fully decked out buildings. However if the player insists on grinding since they don't want to spend any more additional money on the game so be it.After completing all of the online heists (if you complete them all with the same crew you will be awarded a bonus one million dollars and an achievement if that even matters ) you essentially have nothing left to do. You can create a motorcycle club (MC) in the breaks between heists and overall just while playing in GTA Online and start your grind towards getting Securo Serv (CEO) offices warehouses etc. With the new additions of the bunker and the facilities it provides more areas for CEOs to access and make money through their provided services but only adds to the grind. All shipments of supplies to generate goods for specific MC or CEO industry as well as shipments to deliver said goods for a cash payout must all be done in a public session.Upon deciding to sell stock in a public session you are immediately ousted to the entire lobby with a cargo beacon after a few seconds of stealth time. In public lobbies if one has their shipment destroyed not only do they lose all that potential profit from hours of supply runs but the person(s) who destroyed the supplies or stock will only receive a few thousand dollars as payment. It is more of a joke since not only does it make someone look like a jerk for just screwing with someone else's potential profit but also because they destroyed it and they get nothing but pocket change for it. It is not only an insult to the person for undertaking the task of destroying someone else's stuff but also an insult to the person who was going to deliver the supplies/stock since they screwed someone out of their money after hours of grinding.Rockstar recently added the nightclub feature which allows players to generate a passive income of $40 000 over time just as long as the player is playing the game and has their nightclub popularity up. A bonus with the nightclub is missions to promote the nightclub can be done in private sessions as opposed to everything else being required to be done in a public session. The nightclub also offers a new feature where you can hire up to five technicians (each more expensive than the previous) that can be assigned to certain goods to accumulate which allows the player to stop getting supplies for it. One example would be if a player has a gunrunning bunker they can assign a technician to its good (sporting goods) and the technician will eventually create stock for that good type The player will never need to go get supplies to produce goods as long as a technician is assigned to that goods type. Another thing with the technicians is that if you want to have them produce goods for you to sell you will need to be actively be playing in GTA Online. More info on how nightclub earnings are calculated and generated can be found here.There is a way to create a 'solo' public session that will net the player a few runs of supplies or stock deliveries before any players join however it is more of a rinse and repeat cycle where if the player wants to continually do tasks that must be done in a public session they will find themselves creating a 'solo' public session about every few minutes to up to an hour. This is mainly due to how GTA Online is ran through players' clients. If someone connects you'll need to create a new session if not then you may have to keep checking every few minutes just to make sure you are still alone in your 'solo' public session. However it is rewarding since it allows players to get stuff done in public sessions as required but without the possibility of someone being a jerk and just screwing you over.Other means of earning money through the game are from just playing since if you are a 'good player' you will be awarded a few thousand every once in a while as well as robbing convenience stores. Jobs are also available which may be small side missions or other events such as races minigames etc. that will net you money based on how well you performed either score or position wise. Game lobbies that have at least a minimum of four players also will run freemode events gta.fandom.com every twelve minutes real time such as challenges.

2019-02-13,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR Buy this game for the storyline and if you like exploring every single place on the map. Don't buy it if you want lots of additional stuff to do after completing the story like in older GTA games.The Online service is Fallout 76 levels of bad if not worse on certain occasions (connection issues long loading screens) and you get a great choice of either hackers or people who purposefully attempt to ruin your fun at a surprisingly frequent rate. If you don't have friends nor do you want to do Jobs don't bother with the Online part of the game.Buy GTA San Andreas. It's cheaper and you get more bang for your buck. REVIEW With that being said here's my review. I'll be comparing this to GTA San Andreas (SA throughout this review) as that was the last GTA game I properly played (I tried out IV for a very small amount of time which isn't enough to compare V to IV).Map The map is beautiful. One of my favorite things in this game is simply to drive/fly around and see how much the graphics department has advanced compared to the days of SA. You don't get three islands anymore but you get a pretty good island. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. Los Santos feels more alive than its predecessor and there are plenty of side activities to keep you entertained.Driving For some reason to me it feels more arcade ish than GTA SA's driving. The handbrake is certainly more powerful meaning that Tokyo Drifting your way through corners like I did with the old Greenwood isn't the best way to do turns here. The arcade side of things is also clear when you realize that you can't flip the car like you could in previous GTA games which sounds great at first until you realize that going out to get another car was one of the main reasons to try to be a good driver. However they decided to add an additional layer of ""realism"" by... adding health damage when you hit an obstacle. Who thought that it's a good feature to have? It literally ruins riding a bike for me as I feel the need to be excessively careful. It also applies to cars (although it's less sensible fortunately). The ragdoll physics are funny but that does not compensate the loss of good gameplay.Cars You have plenty of variety here trust me. From Smart cars to classic Bugattis I think that it's good enough. Their handling is varied enough so that two different cars don't feel like the same car. You can toggle the convertible top in convertibles which is awesome. I spent more time than I should watching that animation. You can't ride a lawnmower like in SA though.Customization You get plenty of customization options. Although it's still limited in most cars like it was in GTA SA it allows you to do more stuff than it did before. That's a big plus for GTA V as customizing cars can be quite fun. It's not a Need For Speed Most Wanted replacement but more than enough to keep you entertained given that this game isn't a racing game.Police/Cops In older GTA games your car was sort of like a safe spot. They couldn't shoot you through the glass thus the only way for them to kill you would be to blow up your car or let you flip it yourself. Not anymore. They can not only shoot you through glass but also while you're getting into a car. That's a bonus point for realism but it also sort of ruins long pursuits. You rarely get to switch your car and survive unless you've gotten a considerable distance from them. They can also kill you right as you drive off which is quite annoying. It's one of those features that should be enabled/disabled in the options menu the way Mafia 3 did with car handling.What about a motorcycle you ask? You can forget about that. Not only is the police quite accurate at shooting you but they also ram you causing you to fall off your bike. You're only safe out in the open (countryside) or in places the police can't reach you.If you actually managed to evade the overpowered police force you'll enter a cooldown period copied straight out of the Need For Speed Most Wanted book. Which isn't a bad thing at all. If you don't know what I mean you basically need to stay out of sight of police helicopters and vehicles for a certain amount of time. As an added game mechanic you can hide in the shadows in order not to get spotted (although I rarely managed to find one but that's my lack of skill not an issue with the game) and helicopters won't see you in covered surfaces. However the police must be ran by some sort of divine entity as they easily guess where you are sending police vehicles towards your new unknown location. The improved drive by mechanic allows you to shoot police officers while inside their cars and while you are driving in more than just four directions which can be quite fun when you know how to use it and gives pursuits a breath of fresh air.If you're looking for police bribes or for a Pay'N'Spray to save you you can forget about that. There is Los Santos Customs (with an oddly similar icon to the old Pay'N'Sprays) but it doesn't allow you to mod cars if you have a Wanted Level (as far as I recall).As an added note the 6 star Army wanted level is gone which kinda removes the goal of long pursuits (i.e. to get military vehicles).Character(s) It's pretty much a known fact even if you haven't yet played this game that this game has three characters instead of just one. It's one of its selling points.Personally I like them all. The three protagonists' (Trevor Michael and Franklin) personalities are different enough that you don't confuse who they are or feel like they're emotionless husks. The dynamic between all of them feels straight out of a movie and there's lots of story to be told/uncovered throughout dialogs or simply by hanging out with them or doing activities.Trevor is crazy and loyal Michael isn't loyal and gets angry easily and Franklin is... well basically CJ from SA except that he doesn't give a damn about gangs.Watch some cutscenes if you want to know more about how they interact before purchasing the game.Radio Stations Given the fact that they had to work with 2013 as the setting of the game they chose good songs for this game. From Tupac to Queen there are plenty of good songs in this game if you're into older songs. Previous GTA titles may have more songs made during their particular setting (80's and 90's) but it's not a bad soundtrack at all. In fact it's surprisingly above average. I expected it to be a lot worse.Oddjobs/Professions/Stuff to do One of my main complaints about GTA V is the lack of oddjobs. Remember when in SA you could do Paramedic Vigilante Delivery Pimping and Freight oddjobs? Well you can forget about all of those in GTA V. Except Taxi. At least you get Taxi. Thank whoever you want to thank for that. I expected more activities not less and certainly not so many activities taken out which greatly impact the replayability after the story ends.What about the Driving School you ask? Gone. The Bike School? Gone. Only the Flying School survived.Races remember those? The ones available in this game have small intro cutscenes that again were copied and pasted straight out of Need For Speed Most Wanted. Except that Most Wanted... heck even SA had a lot more races. I keep wondering how much time was wasted on that that could've been spent on more races. I could say that about most of this game in fact. You have plenty of races in Online though... but I paid for a solid singleplayer experience not a single/multiplayer hybrid. Speaking of Online the Online portion will be covered in the comments section of this review. There's a character limit I was unaware of.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,594,False,Recommended,There are some great things about this game however some parts suck. I'll go over what is great about the game. The story mode is awesome. Such a good story and I would recommend to anyone that you play it. The only thing the single player mode lacks is DLC. It would be cool if Rockstar created some single player DLC like in Grand Theft Auto IV. Now onto the bad stuff. The online is pretty terrible now. It used to quite fun but now Rockstar have just made everything so expensive now and added some pretty ridiculous things. The only way anyone can progress is purchasing a shark card or getting modded money. It's a shame because in the first couple of years GTA Online was really enjoyable. Overall I'd still recommend this game due to how great the single player is however playing the online mode may disappoint you. At 24.99 ($29.99) it's still worth a buy. Even better if you get it on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V
2019-02-13,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,An overall very enjoyable single player and experience but as the online got increadibly popular Rockstar basically put ALL their attention onto online and we haven t seen a single player update pretty much ever. Even with putting all their resources and time into online it s a grindfeat with overpriced in game item that can take days to earn without real in real life cash. It s sad how far Rockstar has fallen from grace. Even the story isn t as good GTA IV and some core mechanics were dumbed down and look less realistic in this game than its predecessor. Enjoyable but severely flawed I hope they add something to single player or we ll just have to wait for GTA 6,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT As of June 24 2017 Take Two has brought back OpenIV. However they have said that they can still remove it. Either way GTA Online is still plagued with the issues stated below and makes GTA V deserve a thumbs down. However if you want to buy this game for modding or for the singleplayer then GTA V deserves a thumbs up.If I had written this review months ago it would have easily gotten a thumbs up. Now the game has gone to complete garbage. I still would have given it a thumbs up but Take Two decided act like a child and forcefully end the support of OpenIV for modding in GTA V. This program has let users such as I use and make mods such as LSPDR and The Flash for the single player versions of Rockstar games for almost a decade. Now it is being taken away for no apparent reason other than the bs excuse of ""Hacking."" Because of that act alone GTA V deserves a thumb down in protest.However if that was not the case GTA V suffers from a terrible multiplayer only powered by greedy developers. Don't get me wrong the single player in this game is a 10/10 alone but the crappy ""GTA Online"" is a pay to win sh tstorm filled with hackers that get away with ruining the game because Rockstar does not try to fix the issue. Instead they push out these crappy DLC updates to the multiplayer which only make it harder and harder for a legitimate player to do well. This is not even an exaggeration. Without paying for stupid shark cards with real money or hacking the game there is no way to actually make GTA cash on a sane basis.Grinding for hours for the game is literally impossible because of terrible matchmaking system this game has. Even if you fully load into singleplayer and then try to load into online it can take ten minutes (on a good day). Each place in this game has a loading screen and unintuitive menu to pass through before even getting to the meat of the game. Once you do the hackers bombard with money and you either get banned or have your progess reset.For all of the complaints listed above GTA V gets nothing more than a thumbs down. Take Two may have been the one that finally pushed the nail into the coffin but you Rockstar were the ones that put it there in the first place. Fix your game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-04,0,0,425,False,Recommended,GTA V This is my review of gta v. it is my opinion and yours my be diffrent to mine. i will start off with saying gta v is an open world game with limitless things to do both online and offline. The story is fun and is something you want to invest in with you feeling fully part of it. 90% of the missions are fun and youw will want to play them again but 10% is just a grind do to wanting to end it soon. The online is a fun experience to play with friends but if you dont have any friends who own GTA V its not as good as it could be. playing privet servers with friends is recommended by me as although it is not as common as people make out hackers can be annoying although most of them just do fun stuff.Pros Good storyline Amazing graphics Never gets boring and is constentally updated having online friend partys is fun huge map with diffrent parts to it makes it feel diverse mini games are the bestCons Hackersservers are not the most stable in the world but there decentthe in game talk is a bit broken but just use discord or teamspeak the combat system could be better ing russiansConclusion/ personal opinion GTA V Is a really fun game that you should buy if you re into open world shooters. the story is good and online is fun with friends. if the game is on sale for 25 you hsould highly concider buying.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-10,0,0,163,False,Not Recommended,The game is and so are the people making it. In general it's a massive grind to basically milk as much money as they can with work only being putting into making more money and not into improving the game. One feature that they implimented was making it so you cant report anyone more than once every few minutes so even while in a lobby with a group of hackers all actively discussing what hacks they are using and etc they limit your reporting to once every few minutes rather than actually adressing the issue of hackers. Instead of allowing you to experience online mode hacker free with friends or with your crew you won't be able to do any of the tasks that are a part of the main forms of income. And while it may be busted to let people grind them safe from the griefing of other players whats more busted is the rampant hackers permeating online as well as that combined with that the game is too grindy to function and so people aren't playing the game. Because they have to do an extreme ing grind doing menial in friends only pay a bunch of ing money or just deal with cancerous hackers. Essentially its a waste of your money and its not worth playing the people making it and those in control of it are too busy ing the blow up dolls made of cash they got from the whales they cater to than to actually make the game playable and enjoyable.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-10,0,0,53,False,Recommended,It s a Rockstar game. Rockstar games usually make the bet single player games in this generation. The single player in this game is really good and you will really love the characters especially the crazy Trevor and how they work together to make the most money they can while also trying to deal with the feds in the problems with Los Santos. Really is a great sequel to San Andreas and it is a very enjoyable experience. Same goes with the multiplayer at least at the beginning stages it gets a lot of fun but after playing for so long it kinda gets boring and you really don t have anything left once you have everything. Though they do free updates that sometimes do encourage the communty to have fun with the game so Rcomstar does good in that.

2019-02-14,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,"Full disclosure I'm old. I really enjoyed GTA II but wasn't a fan of the gratuitous violence in the series as I got older. A friend of mine convinced me to pick up GTA V he didn't have any other friends that played it was on sale and to be fair there's a lot of entertaining content available.It's for this reason that I feel genuinely bad for all of the developers and designers that put hard work into this game. The effort really shows and it has a lot of redeeming qualities. Somewhere along the way (I'm assuming pretty early on) this game became about one thing making money at the expense of everything else.A key business metric for GTA V surfaces very very quickly maximize the number of players in public sessions. It's unwieldy and not very intuitive to setup and maintain your own private session and the moment something goes wrong you're kicked back into a public session. While that might seem reasonable ""goes wrong"" has a very loose definition in this case. Most of the missions require more people than I care to play with and if someone dies or leaves at the last second I'm forced to start over. And over. And over.Even though I purchased content I'm not allowed to run certain missions in a private session. You already took my money don't make me play with the motley crowd please.This brings me to my next point. While playing with a friend and driving around in one of the neat cars I purchased my teammate steps out of the vehicle and immediately dies to someone that isn't even in the same hemisphere as us. I assumed he was being dramatic when he said that there was a hacker/modder in our session but the death toll kept climbing as the seconds ticked by. People began to chat about a modder in the session then suddenly for no reason I started to receive money while standing in place.I was astounded. Cheating is *so* prevalent in this game that it was immediately recognized by everyone in the session. Something similar happened three more times in the same night.Despite the obvious quality of this game it's very clearly being run by people that don't give a flying f*** about the experience of the players. The business model seems to be sell as much DLC as possible don't let people play the content that they payed for in private sessions do your best to force people online and then spend *zero* effort to make the game secure from people that get their kicks from ruining the enjoyment of others.Again I'm old so I don't experience disillusionment very much these days but I was sorely disappointed to see one of the most enduring and recognizable franchises in the industry brought to its knees by greed and the juvenile whims of 12 year olds.What the hell Rockstar? What the hell.",Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-06,0,0,363,False,Recommended,Overall It's an amazing game wouldn't recommend to the younger audience but it is a really good game and has aged as good as it could have in the time it has been out. But that was my review on the story mode. The online mode is way to broken. To many modders and other people who just want to screw with you in any way that they can but the online mode can be fun as well. If you get yourself into a public lobby with only yourself in it you can earn money pretty fast and easy even if someone else joins that person may or may not want to screw with you but it would probably still be fun due to the fact that you wont be alone in the server and you'll have someone to compete with to get better at the game and have a better understanding of how the game works. So in conclusion the game is a good game and I would recommend to people who enjoy a good story line and a competitive online mode if you do start hating the game just get into a public lobby by yourself look it up on Youtube if you don't know how to do it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2019-02-06,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"There's a reason this game is selling so cheap. It used to be amazing until Rockstar got greedy and started manipulating the game in order to extract more money from it. All of the recent upgrades are nothing more than a money grab from the company rather than a legitimate effort to make the game better. They claim they turned off porting accounts to combat ""hacked consoles"" but in reality it's their greed that motivated this. It's simply easier and cheaper to punish everyone rather than to spend the money to patch the exploits and to punish the people breaking the rules. It's super convenient that making a player start over also makes them money if they don't want to grind through and buy a shark card eh? Typical arrogant ""if we our customer we win"" thinking. The entire GTA series had it's day but those days are long over. It's just tired and boring now. They should probably drop the ""open world"" bit too. It's just a big map. Open world implies that it's much larger and it takes no time at all to fly across this tiny island in a jet. Typical marketing speak from people who likely aren't even interested in games. With the real VR open worlds out there where you can do more than just consume content and shoot at people their description falls flat. Save your $14.99. With what those idiots are doing to this game every update it probably won't even be worth downloading when it eventually becomes free.",Grand Theft Auto V

Trees and BUSHES are appearently more undestructible than a truck insurgent fences2. Why wont they update story mode with new vehicles? I mean if you want to try them out you have to spend IRL money on Online where you wont get much money but in GTA Story Mode you can afford whatever you want and there you can atleast try them out if they update it you have the money to try the vehicles out such as the Insurgent Pickup Select Michael and go meet Trevor go get an Insurgent Trevor as gunner and michael as driver and mayhem in Los Santos.3. The only way to get a decent amount of money is to play 24/7 or buy sharkcards that are overpriced AF but i still buy them to not get blowed upp by Oppressors everywhere.Oppressor MK 2 i mean the first one was OP enough but they decided to add another one.4. Rockstar game services unavailable i have checked my internet and it has a very good connection but it still says this sometimes when im going into a race or mission.5. Npcs they drive STRAIGHT into you if they get the chance i drive straight they turn left towards me so i crash in them and its 12.000 $ from the vehicle cargo.6. The Cops If THEY drive into YOU you get the cops after you stand still infront of them they're after you call lester to lose them 1 minute later they're after you for nothing. They are after you for stealing 1 CAR i mean its logical but its GTA nothing in GTA is logical (Flying cars flying bikes and undestructible bushes)7. Spawn locations i was killed by aimbot NPCs and i respawned on an island... I couldnt call Merrywheater for pickups or anything like that so i was forced to swim for 20 mins.8. Mission t i was standing on the objective point but it never registered and at last it said i failed... I was there..Good things about this game1. Online feature2. Cars3. Missions (Sometimes)4. CampaignThis is why i wont recommend it anymore it was really fun the first 100 hours but then i realized how much t that was in it. But i STILL play it i think this game deserves new developers R* wont care about fixing this ""Rockstar game services are currently down try again later"" problem they just wait for the sharkcard money to roll in when they still have millions that are buying the game and they wont change the prices on sharkcards YES im pretty mad at this game at this point no Call me salty kid all you want but this game is just more t than good like 60% of the time.",Grand Theft Auto V

They noticed that they could milk money out of GTA V completely ignoring the community making it harder for them to gain money and ignoring the things the COMMUNITY wants. Developers have been known to do this but not to the extent of rockstar. They don't do jack about the modders. They despite belief do ban but the shear amount of them is too much. We are screaming at them to get dedicated servers but they choose to ignore us. Thus FiveM was born the roleplaying delight. If you have GTA but your sick of the hackers modders toxic community etc. Go to FiveM. Now GTAO has sparked many good moments for me. But rockstar keeps taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back. If you like previous GTA games but you're on the edge of buying it. Don't. This is not the same game as the previous in the series.

It also brings back the airplanes functionality as in San Andreas.To bring back the vehicles from the previous one (GTA IV) you have to use mods (see Modding Capability).CameraFirst Person Perspective (FPP) was not my preferrence at start but since there's an achievement for it I did it for more than a day play time. The FPP camera is just awesome like... this is like when I play some of the First Person Shooter (FPS) games. Even the fighter jets and combat helicopters in FPP also featuring simple version of Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) with airspeed and altitude indicator just like in flight simulator games.Online FeaturePeople talk about cheaters and yes there are too many. I've encountered one along my way and I chose not to interfere just to be on a safe side. And if I lose the RGSC account because of cheating (even though it wasn't me) not only I lose access to multiplayer (GTA Online) but also the singleplayer so that my modding freedom is at risk (see Modding Capability).Modding CapabilityMyself's a long time modder before I have this game and I also made several mods. Come to think of it this game has a ton of stability that makes this game safe for modding of any kind like adding new vehicles people... you name it. I tried more than 100+ different mods and they work without any negative drawbacks. However mods and going online didn't go too well so it's meant only for singleplayer mode.My current PC specification when applied with a lot of mods can cause FPS drop to maybe 15 or 10 depending on the complexity and type of the mod.AnimationBasic animations are much more enhanced than previous GTA game but there's a con on the weapons animation especially the shotgun animation. I found the Pump Shotgun and Sawn off Shotgun animations are quite weird because every time you reload you just put in a shotgun shell and it while in a real life you put in how much it can load into a barrel before you can use it. Previous one was about 2 shells when you reload. I found it really unrealistic if being compared with FPS games such as Call of Duty but hey this is a video game. What can you expect?OtherI'm taking into an account that the environment of the game was good. Place of setting was more or less same to the real Los Angeles city although I never visited that city in real life. Vehicle physics was quite good although from some video titles on YouTube previous one was better than this despite negative drawbacks on that. The game's an open world and you can do anything about it. In singleplayer mode (after finishing all story missions) I prefer to get chased by 50 police officers and shoot them and to do that I prefer not to kill too many civilians. Other than that is loitering buying property meeting strangers or met some random guy in GTA Online. Most of them I met preferred to pick a fight if in freeroam mode no matter who is friend or foe.In conclusion this game is a symbol of good gesture for all GTA lovers like me although like I said there are pros and cons. With the announcement of GTA VI come near I hope it can be improved better than this one.,Grand Theft Auto V

What we have now is a great single player open world game attached to one of the best sandboxes that exists today where you can mess around with friends! Constantly getting free updates that add new ways to play and earn money although some grinding will be required for the more expensive items.How to deal with hackers Find a new lobbySeriously though this game has an amazing single player campaign and buying it just for that is well worth it. I think a lot of people let their entire review live and die on GTA Online. While it has bugs hackers and can require lots of grinding if you don't pay for the GTA$ it is not without it's many upsides.Even after 3 years many of the major gamebreaking bugs that pop up once in a blue moon are quickly squashed by Rockstar. They have diverted work from GTA VI for this game and continue to pump out DLC and quality of life updates that give people new races weapons and vehicles. Hackers are a big problem but if you suspect someone to be hacking report them and move on. No point in waiting around for them to drap cash on you getting you banned. And as for the of the game if you are not wanting to play CEO or MC missions then go passive mode or have fun fighting them. Play that part of the game. And if not then find a new lobby. Plain and simple. Yes it can be a pain but it's better than giving them the satisfaction and you the anger.This game sure as hell isnt perfect but people become so entitled that they don't see that there are plenty of ways to enjoy the game they just choose not to.Stay safe ),Grand Theft Auto V

Parts that i dont like is that it feels way to linear for example ""chase the drug dealers"" with you just being constantly told what to do.

2019-02-12,0,0,87,False,Not Recommended,"Voice acting is superb. Animations are very good. Online and let's be honest you really want to play this online You struggle to make any money at all when you're starting so you either buy shark cards with real money to get the literally millions of dollars you need to actually set up businesses to make money or...you never ever make enough money to actually start making money. At $20 cash per million you can expect to pay hundreds to set up businesses. Now once you actually have millions of dollars you can be like all the cool kids and buy a rocket firing flying car which allows you to breeze through missions. Don't worry though if you manage to get enough money to start your own cash making business which literally takes HOURS to make any product for you to sell be it guns drugs whatever...then the fun really begins because now you need to be on a public server to actually drive the goods to market. At which point those kids with rocket firing flying cars get bonuses for killing you and destroying your goods. So much fun can't possibly fit into one game.Oh yeah and lets not forget the ""loading"" screen which at the best of times takes several minutes every time you start a mission end a mission start a match end a match. I put in 70 hours online and probably spend at least 10 hours looking at loading screens and apparently that's typical. Story mode offline Sure this one is fantastic. But your solo play doesn't interest Rockstar because you aren't buying shark cards with cash and that's really where the expected to make their money. The game itself is fantastic with a massive open world you can explore dozens of vehicles to drive and fly thousands of npc's to punch in the face. Hundreds of hours of fun. It could be thousands of hours of fun if they stopped catering to that 1% of gamers who got picked on as kids and now live to lord their in game superiority over those little people by shooting every other player with rockets from their flying cars. I would be lying if I saw anyone over level 300 who wasn't simply killing other players for fun because that's the only kind of person who sticks with this game online.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-18,239,706,120,True,Recommended,I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far ... So I had just established my young but promising new colony Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end ...). The basic needs were all covered everyone had a nice place to sleep decent clothing enough to eat and time to relax. The people of Ashton were prosperous. They lived in harmony with nature and each other. Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans.Now and then a few warriors of a near tribe the Pig Face Men attacked the settlement but the people of Ashton were safe relying on the strength of their automated defence systems. And so the colony grew and I thought This is it I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours.As if ...Remember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature? I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists most were friends and there even was a married couple Tali and Waltz.The harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent the people relied mostly on their crops eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e.g. old age or other animals) so the animal population in the near forests remained stable. So far so good. But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds. Normally that wouldn't have been a problem everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way. But then came the tortoise. Waltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a hilla which had been killed by some other animal. So Waltz has just grabbed it when a tortoise nearby turned mad. I thought ok those aren't that fast Waltz will be able to safely carry the hilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise. Nope! I'm not quite sure what exactly happened maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak. Anyway when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace. Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly. However its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun. And so he came back home injured but happy that now there was even more meat than expected. But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving. The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves. The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker. If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs that might had saved him but you can't just amputate someones chest.At last he couldn't fight any longer the infection overwhelmed him. Tali his wife carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus. The burial ceremony was heartbreaking. Everyone had come Tali his sister Julia his friends Vas Jones Stephan Boyd and Leia Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2. In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband brother and friend before the people of Ashton went to bed. With Waltz dead or not they had to cary on.But apparently it was all too much for Tali not very surprising if you think about it. There was only this one little problem She was a pyromaniac. When the rest of the colony slept she left her big and empty bed. Driven crazy by grief she did the only thing able to ease her pain. She set the forest on fire. Finally exhausted almost to unconciousness she fell back into her bed again.While she slept the others waken by the crackling fire desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings. But they simply weren't enough they could either try to save the buildings or the forest not both. Of course they tended to the buildings to the food storage to be exact. However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest completely sorrounding the settlement.In the end it was all too much.Tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat. And then when no hope was left the gods the ancestors the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in heard their cries. Rain started falling down putting out the fire. But it was too late. More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames. Vas Stephan and Leia were unconcious. Julia was the only one still able to stand. She did what she could but with all the medicine burned she had no chance. Leia died first Vas second. This caused his wolf Nevile who had been laying loyal by his side to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end.Traumatised Julia who managed to flee when Stephan was killed wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton. Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere. All the food they stored for the winter was gone the fields empty. With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings. She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it. So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked. With the solar panels a loss to the flames the turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath.12 / 10 Creates more immersive storys than many RPGs looking forward to my next colony (and possibly its desastrous destruction ...).Thanks for reading if you made it this far ),RimWorld

2017-06-03,395,2070,560,True,Recommended,If you're thinking of buying this game stop hesitating and purchase it immediately.I started an isolated research facility on a frozen wasteland as a 74 year old sociopathic scientist called Geckulon Decktar I researched robotics to begin with and constructed some automatons to handle the menial tasks like cleaning cooking and hauling etc leaving me free to conduct my research. All was well until a band of vagrants laid siege to my settlement. I barely survived and resolved to increase my security installing several auto turrets around my perimeter. This would keep the ruffians at bay for a time but I needed a longer term solution so I turned my focus to bionic enhancements. I wanted to turn the human form into the ultimate living weapon. When a faction of slavers passed through my frozen wasteland I did not hesitate to inspect their wares. I wanted a slave but not just any slave he should be foreboding brutal savage. And there I found him His name was Skint Mcgruff. He was a feared crime lord when they captured him infamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him. I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in. I fed him (alas not human meat but nutrient paste made from potatoes poor fare but such is life in the frozen wastes) and I clothed him. By now I was confident in my ability to improve upon the human form and so I presented the idea to him the very next day. He was keen particularly about the notion of having retractable claws and so the work began. My medical droid handled most of the surgery but I crafted the bionic components myself. It was a long and gruelling process but eventually he was complete. More machine now than man I felt it necessary to rename him... to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something more and thus I named him C.A.N.N.I.B.A.L (Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs). He is my pride and joy... bionic eyes that can see even in the dark bionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetah and retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foes and of course I give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a reward. Now I can conduct my research in peace...,RimWorld

2018-09-18,6,513,439,True,Recommended,I've played RimWorld for easily over 1000 hours aside from the 160+ hours on record for my account I really should have reviewed it sooner since I've played it so long but I never got around to it so this'll include my experience in the game what's good and bad and everything you'd likely need to know before getting it.To jump to my conclusion This game is fantastic if you like build a colony from the ground up it's very interactive and you'll always have something to do be it planning a new room for your base building up defenses creating a more reliable food source or even raiding enemy factions. At first it's very daunting as there is a lot to get used to but each new discovery comes with a new way to experience the game your story is always your own and it'll never be the same as before lending this game to nigh infinite replayability and that's not even considering mods which are abundant relatively easy to make yourself and very active. The developers constantly revise and improve aspects of the game improving it more and more as time passes even your own ideas may be implemented if they're good additions to the game. The community is one of the best I've seen where people joke around share their playthroughs and wacky happenings whilst generally having a good time. I recommend this game if you like strategy tackling positive/negative turn of events planning things and sandbox style survival games. If you're still on the fence for buying the game watch a 'lets play' video and see madness that can occur check out all the mods that are available and imagine the possibilities it really is a great game.Art 8/10 The art style is quite minimalistic at first it may be a turn off but the style works well with the gameplay with the attention you need to pay to so many things on screen it's good that the textures aren't complex as it'd strain your eyes whereas this style is soft on the eyes and doesn't impede the gameplay things represent what they're meant to be and it's surprisingly easy to get immersed into the game with the simplistic graphics.Story 10/10 This game is both heart breaking and hilarious there is no set story so things can go in any direction you could have a trader caravan arrive to sell items just as a raid occurs causing a massively shoot out between two major groups just outside your base after which you can mop up all their valuables and turn their corpses into meals and skin maybe for that human leather hat you've always wanted. Perhaps you start brewing beer only to have one of your pets drink some and get addicted to alcohol. Story is incredibly well done in this game and with how fun it can be I'm surprised lots of other games don't use the same style.Sound 6/10 The sound is basic like the art the sounds work for their intended purposes there's nothing spectacular to talk about nor is there anything unique the sound it has is right but it's not something the game is well known for and isn't made to contribute a lot to the game.Gameplay 8/10 There are different types of games so I'll elaborate for the style of game this is (a sci fi colony sim) I'd say the gameplay is near perfect and it can be perfected to a player's liking with mods a lot of features from popular mods are incorporated into the game over time so the base game's gameplay will get even better over time. Things are placed using the UI at the bottom of the screen and your colonists with build them if they have the resources they can get the resources from your setting up of work orders (like cutting down trees mining rocks butchering animals harvesting plants and various other ways). It's almost like you're the architect of a colony telling them what needs to be done and when it needs to be done it's quite nice as luck is a big factor but foresight allows you to somewhat control your luck and mitigate disaster there's little that's more satisfying than diverting misfortune with a well thought out plan.Mods 9/10 Mods are very good for this game some change the game entirely (like changing the space cowboy style theme to that of Lord of the Rings Medieval WW2 era and many others) whilst others change / add to the games features and tools allowing for you to adjust anything you don't like into something you do like and the modding community is quite active if there's a good idea for a mod then it's likely already made If you choose to buy it then I recommend trying the base game without mods first as whilst they add a lot to the game they also take away from the main theme playing it without mods will help you understand the fundamentals a lot quicker.Overall 9/10 The features individually would make the game an 8.2/10 but how they come together makes it a 9/10 for me since RimWorld is the best game of it's type I've looked long and hard for other games like it and Prison Architect is the only game similar but to me it doesn't have the random glory that RimWorld has. RimWorld is certainly worth 30 hell it's worth 50+ to me since I've got so much entertainment out of it other games you may play for 200 maybe 300 hours but this is one of those games which you can sink months into and games like that are worth buying.Thanks for reading my review if you did I don't often write reviews but this game is just so good that I can't help but share my opinion.,RimWorld

2016-11-16,382,537,39,True,Recommended,Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to 1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.Really what else do you need in a game?,RimWorld
2018-07-09,214,550,635,False,Recommended,"I've been fiddling around with challenging game modes rather than the stock three. So I began a game with absolutely nothing other than the starting colonist no food no weapon no silver. I've then opted then to go for a mountainous region cause it's easier to defend from attackers.This is where things get interesting normally what happens now is you get to choose your colonist. I thought ""Right i want a good miner someone who can farm relatively well and I guess a good fighter to start off with"". Off I go cycling through the colonists where I stumble upon Patrice. Patrice was at everything I'm talking zero's one's and two's across the board with the exception of Art which was seven and Social which was bloody eighteen.I thought to myself how the hell does she have such a high social skill so I read her backstory. Now Patrice was just twenty years old very young but she had done so much. Patrice wanted to sing for everybody luckily for her Dad was the CEO of an interplanetary corporation and set her up as a Childhood Idol. Patrice sang her poor heart out for everybody and made her parents proud. Until her mum died dad was beside himself lost in his thoughts Patrice at this stage was developing into a woman and 'offered' herself to dad as a replacement for mum which he accepted....The shenanighans went on until the corporation executives discovered Patrice and dad's secret and gave dad an ultimatum ""Give us your daughter or we go public with what's been happening between you two ruining both your lives in the process"". Dad agreed and sent poor Patrice away.The executives kept Patrice in an orbital station on the galactic fringes far away from daddy where they used Patrice for a new kind of job if you know what I mean say hello to Patrice's adult background Pornographic Idol. Yes you read that correctly Patrice was now sold into sexual slavery. But it wasn't all that bad she wasn't a typical ' ' as it where more like a Companion from Firefly where she selected her clients. She became very popular amongst the nobility of the region. Attended balls and had a cult following much like her childhood.I thought to myself ""Holy crap Batman WTF did I just read?"". This story was absolutely nuts I had to try to help Patrice live a better life. Off we went to Patrice's new home. I'm assuming at this stage she's been rescued by some unknown benefactor. Anyway Patric lands right in the centre of a small clearing surrounded by mountain with only one opening and fertile land within that area too. ""Score!!"" I thought as I got her to work setting up a shelter bed and torch. Bloody hell wasn't this a task for her? It took two days to complete this menial task but together we persevered. Eventually she completed this task cutting down a dozen trees in the process and skilling up two levels in construction.Then the feral rabbit came knocking ""Crap"" I had to get her to safety fortunately this rabbit tired itself rather quickly and left Patrice alone after it slept. I got Patrice to fashion herself a club to use and just in the nick of time well I say nick of time but it took her a whole day to get this done too. At this stage she hasn't even gotten to setting up a farm luckily there are heaps of wild berries around.A visitor arrives and Patrice says hi but she has no goods to sell so they leave in a hurry as they are leaving sirens roar as we're under attack. The attacker has a shiv loves to fight and has eight skill. ""We're finished"" I think as the attacker runs down towards the village but attacks the visitor the visitor manages to put a solid slug into the attacker but is killed in the process. The attacker is wounded but proceeds to move towards Patrice I order Patrice to stay behind the door ready with her club. The attacker busts the door down and charges in but after suffering from blood loss Patrice is able to knock him out with a single swing from her club.Patrice locks him up in her room after fixing the door and manages to stop the bleeding thanks to some bandages the visitor had. Then I got to see Patrice do what she did best talk to people. You see what normally happens is these attackers are hard as nails to recruit to your village with some taking days and even seasons before joining your community Patrice didn't even need food to entice him as soon as she walked into the room he instantly switched sides and became Patrice's . Patrice was a God amongst men as she began her new dynasty Patrice settled into her new roles as town artist and socialite while minion one got to work erecting a wall finishing some farmland and contructing a kitchen and dining room for Patrice to enjoy all in a day's work as it were.Patrice gathered up the supplies the visitor 'donated' equiping herself with a rifle in the process and set to work skilling up. It was like a switch was flicked now she had a minion to dominate she finished everything with precision and haste. She developed a taste in gardening as the minion went to work digging out the tunnels constructing two cells for conversation duties and completing a new throne room and Queen's chambers for Patrice.This is where the story of Patrice ends..... for now... I'm actually looking forward to resuming the tale of Patrice.Rimworld can be full of trash normally I would look purely at the stats of a character to pick them for me but Patrice has changed my attitude here now I look at the stories these colonists have as the main driving factor in selecting them.Edit Just getting my point for a review listing Rimworld for GOTYFYI I have the Patrice save file played a touch she's still alive.",RimWorld

2017-06-27,27,496,54,True,Recommended,"You're reading the reviews thinking ""Damn some of these people have like 300+ hours on this they must really like it."" Then you're looking at the price thinking ""That much?"" Definitely worth it in my opinion. And I've only played for 20 hours (and have gotten not too much done because there is so much to do). It's the best base building survival I've played yet. You get attached enough to some of your colonists that you become sad if anything happens to them. You can build your colony however you want to. Think of it like a top down minecraft. You're not limited on how you want to build your base at all except you can't build multi leveled buildings. (Two story).Every colonist has their own personality. IE My hunter Lumine is probably one of my most useful colonists. She can snipe targets from long distances with perfect headshots. However Lumine is staggeringly ugly and has an annoying voice. So my colonists don't really like her much. My surgeon Toni has been through so much. She has gotten her leg and arm ripped off so I've operated on her and given her a metal arm and leg. She is literally Edward Elric except instead of fighting Scar she is healing Scars. Different Survival Elements. You need to keep your colonists cool when it's hot and warm when it's cold. You can do this in different ways such as crafting them the right clothing and having heaters/coolers. Your colonists need to eat. You can have them eat raw humans and animals like savages or you can have them butcher animals and cook different meals so that they can stay healthy. You need to build a freezer so that your food won't deteriorate. You need a medical room for the best effective chances of successful operations and treatment. You'll need to build wind turbines and solar generators so you can give power to the things in your base that require it. You need to build a research bench and research new... well basically everything. So the game doesn't just give you everything that's available. You have to work for it. In the regular mode of the base game you start off with 3 colonists. And you stick with them for a while and think ""When am I going to get more? This is kind of slow since I only have 3 people."" Next thing you know you have like 10 people who are all doing their own jobs. Be it people you recruited or people who fell from cargo pods from space.And I've only been talking about your base. This game has an entirely randomly generated world that your colony is in. Which means trade caravans will visit you different tribes will visit you. You can visit them by forming caravans of your own. You can even raid other bases. You can eventually build comms equipment to contact different trading ships that are in orbit or the different outposts nearby. And you will get raided by a lot of different outposts as well which means you will have to set up defences. You can take prisoners and either recruit them release them eat them or harvest them for their organs. Yep. Don't want those perfectly good kidneys to go to waste now do we? If you don't want to take prisoners you can have your colonist slit the injured guys throat. It's cold man. They just walk right up to the injured fella and either shoot them until they die or brutally stab them to death.Now one important thing that this game offers which any good game offers Mods.To me mods fill the important content that the developers have not added yet. More turrets more organized menus more furniture more everything. Even the option to show visitors hospitality so that you can better establish friendship or even recruit them to your colony! I can't imagine playing the game without some of the mods that I have installed. Not that the vanilla game is bad it's just that some of the mods are so useful and necessary that I wouldn't want to play without them. And none of the mods I have are cheats either. You need to use your valuable recourses in order to craft everything including objects from mods. So definitely check the workshop out once you get the game. The only negative that I have so far isn't very much a negative of the game but just me being a little whiner.Sometimes some of the random events are very highly not in your favor and completely unfair. Which will result in you reloading an autosave or main save just to prevent the event from happening. When you reload a save that event that played out gets replaced with a different random event. So you're getting raided by a bunch of people while half your colonists have severe illnesses? No worries! Just reload a save! It's saved my colony a bunch of times. Sometimes I've let some of my colonists die and I've continued the game but most of the time I just reload an autosave to prevent their deaths. It's an easy way to cheat the system. Overall it's a great game. There is a reason you're seeing people with hundreds of hours on it. Every single player's game is different. Different bases different colonists. So many outcomes. It's why you see so many people posting their stories on their reviews. It's a game that I didn't even know I wanted until I played it. Amazing community. Especially the modding community. It's making the game so much more than it already is. 10/10 would have one of my rookie hunters shoot at a hare 40 times point blank only to miss give up and go stargaze. Oh and don't let your colonists go on a mental breakdown. ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE PYROMANIC TRAIT. My god. Freakin Engie literally sets fire to everything she helped build. Try to arrest them or reload a save. They will burn everything slaughter your cats/dogs fight your own colonists and wreak havoc as much as the random evented angry hares that can destroy your entire colony if you're not prepared. I probably missed a lot in my review. But hey you will discover that yourself once you play it. So what are you waiting for?",RimWorld

2017-11-06,529,505,472,False,Recommended,"Heavily recommended game! And the following play through should make you either highly appalled or very interested Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her ""Butters"" but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad. Built a nice settlement made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around wood. Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.) I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her. My self created character named Adante was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter well as the name implies he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.But then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters the pet Monkey and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle. They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra. The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day. Bones probably noticed long before I did but hey he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out. Hunter however eventually shot &amp killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey. Butters was then picked up by Hunters carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off. By the time that we've managed to construct these an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!(Now here's a lesson I've learned Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.) The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire. All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire. The fire became so intense and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.) Now the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler not a speedy gonzalez. Butters the poor cursed monkey just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. So within seconds we could hear the cries again of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before but now also jumping by the belly up &amp down inside her once comfortable pet bed being on fire. Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. I made Bones since he's supposedly the new master of Butters go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake. This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement while both being on fire. The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion. I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.After the fire died I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came ""What kind of f***ed up game is that?""Rimworld my dear. It's Rimworld. true story",RimWorld

I waited anxiously to see if he would recover on his own and when he did i changed his title to the 'The Revenant'. He got a scratch scar and made himself a pair of pants from the bearskin.For me this game is like a book.When i read a book i use my imagination to draw the characters and places using the author's descriptive writing and i can 'watch' the drama and action unfold in my head.When i play this game I find myself doing the same thing.

They take no prisoners and play chess together a lot. I decide to spend a bit of metal and components on a geothermal generator outside my base's extremely thick walls. I used materials from my solar panels I destroyed to build the generator. Little did I know I used my last component on the geothermal generator. Then a wave of raiders attacks and my auto defence mows most of them down. One of the raiders has a triple shot rocket launcher. He fires it causing a chain reaction on my turrets and destroys them all. Comba and Jacob kill the last few raiders and I designate new turrets to be built. I go grab a sandwich while they do this. I get back to find that the turrets have not been built and a wave of mechanoids is heading towards my base. I don't have any more components to build turrets and a single mechanoid could probably take out both of my colonists. There are ten. I accept my fate as Comba's head is blown clean off by a mechanoid sniper and john is filled with bullets from three miniguns.Some say this game is easy and some say it is hard.

2017-10-27,15,298,757,True,Recommended,"This game was on my wishlist for months just waiting for a sale so I could try it out. But as months went by it never once dipped in price and during a night of unfathomable boredom I decided to take the plunge forked over the $29.99 and started to play one of the most awesome games ever. Naturally I set a timer to 2 hours in case I wanted a refund but that wasn't the case as I was hooked in before the first hour ended and knew after looking over the modding community that this game is a keeper. That first time I played it I didn't stop until the sun rose and I realized it was almost 6 in the morning after playing for 8 hours straight.If you are like me and are waiting for a sale it seems like that won't happen anytime soon or at least it never seems to happen and this review is to encourage you to take the plunge and have a good time. It is absolutely worth the $29.99 you don't need to wait for a sale it's worth it and while it may not click with you immediately it is met with ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews for a reason and it is a ton of fun. Very interesting concept too and executed in a way that is easy to learn difficult to master and incredibly addicting regardless of the outcome of your pawns.Most of my colonies die at one point or another. Most of yours will too. It is not a bad thing it is not a sad thing and it shouldn't make you mad and I don't think it will unless you are like insane about ""losing"". It's just how the story unfolds though and it's part of the game and part of the fun. Another reviewer put it perfectly saying ""Colonies are here for a good time not a long time"". However sometimes they do last and it's cool progressing everything getting more people to join and experimenting with what to do next as you make it further and further in the new world you are trying to make. Currently my longest lasting colony started out as a tribe of 5 people but has grown and thrived and may defeat the odds against them in surviving in the world as a colony to be reckoned with. Maybe someday they'll even make it off the planet if I choose to make it so.Point is this game is worth its price tag. Give it a go you may find yourself immersed in one of the coolest games with a wonderful modding community aiming to make each run a different engaging and exciting experience. Update 11/13/17 Below I tell you a tale of a distant Rimworld. They started as a group of three crashlanding in a small patch of temperate forest surrounded by the green hell commonly referred to as ""tropical rainforests"". Akemi was a builder and a fine one at that first prioritized building shelter for his fellow survivors. Akemi was accompanied by Kirschi a former child star that grew into a seasoned actor charming as hell and good looking to boot as well as Mal a roboticist that some considered ""too smart"".The first few days were rough. Akemi worked hard to maintain their shelter and even started to build more in order to stockpile their goods safely and even considered expanding their little domicile. He was an optimist after all and crashlanding could just mean a new beginning. He even wanted to give their home a name declaring it ""Greenhell's Oasis"". Meanwhile Mal studied further technologies and applied her intellect to research ways to improve life on this new Rimworld. Kirschi took care of keeping their area clean but grew restless as he started to experience withdrawals from his psychite addiction.For Kirschi each day without a hit of yayo was a challenge but he wouldn't break just yet. It was then that the budding colony got its first visitors some people from a nearby colony that were interested in seeing what exactly fell out of the sky. It was then that Kirschi showed what he could do. What he was born to do charm and entertain. He talked with each of the visitors and silvertongued his way into their hearts causing them to break allegiance with their colony and join his cause and his people. One of them was Skye an enforcer and while she was swooned by Kirschi's charm she saw that at his core he was an addict and that he needed help. She decided to arrest him and force him into rehab a decision that ended up being the best thing for Kirschi but caused a lot of berserk rages and psychotic breaks on the path to sobriety.Their numbers grew from three to eight and the colony began to thrive. However this angered their previous chief causing tension between them and the rising faction that crashlanded only days earlier. A move that could easily turn into a grave mistake if they decide to send raiders for a siege.However days went by then weeks then months. The colony only grew and prospered becoming wealthier and more established each day. Their numbers continued to grow from eight to ten to fifteen until one day there was an outbreak of malaria. Six colonists were infected Akemi among them and had to be forced to rest in the hospital. Lorne a recent addition to the colony was a nurse and Skye's father and he did his best to treat the condition. However when it rains it pours.A myserious plague started to ravage the populace. Twelve colonists were swept by the plague including Kirschi and Akemi as well as some others that already had malaria and only two colonists were considered healthy Lorne the nurse among them as well as Mal the roboticist.Lorne did what he could using up most of the stockpiled medicinal herbs only to find that his efforts were spread so thin trying to treat everyone that it was an impossible battle that could not be won. He wanted to break but he persevered long enough to bury his friends and his daughter Skye a real survivor that was taken too soon by a plague that Lorne couldn't cure. Lorne is a broken man now teetering on the edge of insanity often having mental breakdowns and hiding in his room.The colony is mostly deserted now with Mal being the only founder to have survived this long. Still while the colonists are beside themselves with grief they continue on. They can find new members surely and hope that such a plague doesn't come back. After all Mal now sees that they must make it off this planet and has started to research ship building and all of its intricacies. It may be some time before this happens but Mal must make sure her comrades' deaths are not in vain.It's become all too clear. They must get off this Rimworld but... Will they be able to? Or is this the place where they are all doomed to perish?",RimWorld

2017-11-20,335,551,28,True,Recommended,Had a colony GREAT colony. Had Olga the spy the ing best. I sent out a caravan to go save this guy who gets downed outside the borders. So the colony splits into two. Little did I realize only one person I left behind could fight fires Jess the cook. The caravan lead by Olga finds the dude fixes him and they get dragged back after a extra day of getting split up before returning to the colony. Meanwhile at the main base a pack of MANHUNTING RABBITS decided to swarm the colony. No big deal. All the rabbits get funneled in and get slaughtered. Acouple people get bit and have to be patched up. So lots of people are sleeping off being covered in rabbit bites. Suddenly there's a heat wave. Lots of rabbits lying in the open on the floors and people spend all night stuffing rabbits into the freezer before they rot. They go to sleep late whatever. There wasn't alot of meat left.QUEUE TRAGIC AS EVENT there is a fault in the electrical system. Dead. Center. In. The. Colony. Jess being the only one who can fight fires gets out of bed as quick as a man covered in rabbit bites can and starts putting out the fires but not before the fire has already spread into the warehouse and then subsequently to the lower housing area that happens to have wood floors and all wooden beds. Jess is attempting to fight the fires alone for hours but not before it becomes too much and begins SUPERHEATING THE ING COLONY to 1400 degrees in certain rooms. He has to take breaks running in and out of the compound as he tries in vain to fight the fire. Finally it's called to just let the colony burn. Everyone evacutes the building it can be rebuilt. But not before people get trapped inside. Colonists braving the superheated building attempting to find fallen comrades pull them outside while receiving burns from the superheated air.The caravan returns a billow of smoke is seen. The returning colonists who don't fear the fire begin fighting it as best as they can. The warehouse is lost at this point but losing the fridge would be a death sentence. They lock up in the fridge and begin putting out fires as they come. It isn't enough. They get pulled out and collapse on the ground outside those not trained in the medical arts doing their best to traige as the wounded come in. Tony doesn't make it. The combination of the colony turned crematorium with the heat wave occuring outside puts him under. He stares vacantly into the rain beating down appreciating the irony of the situation. Tony outreaches to his trusted alpaca companion Animal. He was never good at names. He came from a group of tribals. The alpaca gives a 1000 yard stare back to his human compatriot. Realizing the man who had trained him had passed Animal slips into a state similar to a man wandering in sadness. Maybe Animal being far more intelligent than humans believed granted upon a simple llama wondered what gods would cruely taunt those who needed water to extinguish the flames that consume their home in the night.The fire burned. Like a bright star on the blackest night. All the colonists could do was watch many yards away as everything they had helped to create together be consumed by the raging inferno. It would not be quick. The colony was a mountain converted into a grand residence. It took nearly the whole night until it was safe enough to stamp out the embers. The rain still pouring down on the faces of those who were barely able to move. Of Animal who stared his thousand yard alpaca stare into the smoldering ashes of what was once a home.(edited)As the fire was put out nearly every colonist was suffering from heatstroke. Olga Jess Niko Charna Charles Lucy the new colonists Malakor and Miles. They all were hurried into the freezer. Still somehow working became the new triage center. Infections from burns began to set in. Many things were lost the fire consumed all including all the weapons left behind colonists felled by the inferno. It wouldn't end well if they were attacked but luckily they all for the most part survived and had enough food and medicine to rebuild. KNOCK KNOCK Who's there? The Federation mother er.Bomb bots began flooding in from the north. Many too many. No one had time to react. Only two of the colonists were even armed at the time few guns were scattered around in the home somehow surviving the brutal flames. Olga and Malakor took a position against a few rocks as Lucy and Jess frantically searched for weapons. Olga the best shot in the whole colony readied her sniper rifle but already knew what the outcome would be. While waiting as the bots began to stride quickly across the farm fields there was a time for a brief conversation between the two. Malakor laid his hand on his husky Senaca comforting her for the last time. The conversation had a good final affect on morale as the two were swarmed and disappeared into a brilliant explosion of red mist and scrap metal. Senaca somehow survived the intial explosion but it mattered not. The Federation didn't spread so far and wide because of mercy.(edited)Lucy and Jess having retrieved weapons made their way outside but that would have been the final nail in everyone's coffin. A series of chain explosions ripped through the hallways. The structure supporting a mountain was no longer able to bear the weight as the night before left it weakened. The mountain collapsed. All those left trapped in the triage freezer perished instantly. The fields of healroot swayed. They wouldn't be needed any longer. The wind turbine would eventually fall into a state of disrepair and crumbling. Looters would come and pillage anything not nailed down. But they would return to their colonies.

Medieval mods make it even more fun with no tech even harder game. Built a castle in the mountains with my starting party. Had a few people join the group all going well. Then RNGesus decides its time to play. Malaria strikes 3 of my 6 colonists ouch. After using up all of the medecine reserves one guy goes crazy and runs around in his room until he collapses (lol) he didnt make it. Also lost the cheif builder. Then the gods cursed me again and decided poison rain was due. Thus the king ordered the gates be shut and nobody to leave. All would have been well if not for the fact that the moofalos had gotten into the grannary and all but emptied it. With no way to leave to get food the remaining colonists were left with an unsavory choice. Canabilism. TBC,RimWorld

Just Doc Miss Farmer and Chef on a strange world.We gathered what resources we could from the wreckage and slept the night rough on the floor of a cave.The next day we started building a lavish stronghold before planting a few crops.Before we knew it the rations we scavenged were gone (should have planted crops first). So we were forced to hunt the local wildlife for food.A cry for help came over the radio. It was Doc's sister Princess she'd also survived planet fall and was being chased by raiders!We set out in force and rescue her and bring her back to the fortress. We celebrate with a hearty meal of our first crop.It turns out that Chef is a nudist. In a bid to make her more comfortable we let her spend her days o'natural. Everyone is fine with it.Our home of Fort Haven is finally finished and we start researching upgrades. Chef makes a statue of her self striding around in the nude and we use it to decorate the guest room.Another escape pod crashes down. We rescue the occupant some guy called Aiki. He's a junkie with violent tendencies.We patch up his wounds give him a hot meal and send him on his way.Both Doc and Princess catch plague! I bet it was that space junkie. They're instantly confined to bed.It take some doing but Doc treats Princess and Princess treats him.Raiders attack with half our crew bedridden with disease. We push them back but Chef is badly injured.Miss Farmer carries her back to Fort Haven and heals her wounds.Through sibling compassion and their medical know how Doc and Princess survive the plague and Chef is also restored to full health.Realising how vulnerable we are we start building defensive gun turrets. We need more metal so everyone heads off to mine.Princess doesn't like mining and for some reason she snaps. She runs around setting fires all over the place.Doc and Farmer knock her out and put her to bed but not before the fires spread taking out a huge section of forest to the North.A huge army of raiders attack. Perhaps they saw the fires? The attack our walls and devastating most of our crops. The new gun turrets come online and we mow them down.With our crops in a bad way and our food supplies low Chef recommends eating the would be raiders...A fun game. Would crash onto a Rimworld and eat man flesh again...,RimWorld

Seriously if you're thinking about it stop thinking and just get it.In long (I guess) Here are my thoughtsPros Interesting Graphics Fun storytelling gameplay fun balance between AI control and player control generates great stories you can tell your fellow Rimworld players Great character building characters backstory and actions throughout your game can really get you attatched to them (or hate them and banish them in a fiery rage) Amazingly massive depth you can play this game in a massive variety of ways and the depth of storytelling really sucks you into the world and each one is different. You can choose to stay in one area and build a massive colony be nomadic imperailistic a crusader or try to get off the planet altogether Unique neo western esque soundtrack very good Rich sci fi lore Great developer he wrote a great book about designing games and this game is evidence that he does in fact know what he's talking about Excellent modding sceneCons I really can't think of any. There can be a couple AI bugs here and there that make your characters more stupid than you want them to be but that is rare and often just keeps things interestingAmazing game in my top 10 of all time for sure!11/10,RimWorld

2017-06-19,0,0,355,True,Recommended,Great game designing your colony is fun and engaging. The character stories which develop over time give scope to the events. The ai director works well but the number of types of events is rather limited. I prefer playing in the northern climates since the summer winter cycle is interesting. There is a definite slowdown late game though and its hard to design an appealing colony without drawing too much aggro. Bionics are even worse requiring ridiculous amounts of waiting before they drop as random loot. Mods like prepare carefull help alot but lots of other mods help aswell. I look forward to more extensive product chains more balanced late game enemies better trading systems and much more room types. As is the game is rather short. I hope for z levels and deeper event series but doubt theyll happen but if we get them this will become dwarf fortress the better one.,RimWorld

2018-02-04,0,0,15,True,Recommended,while i do recommend the game i think the price should be adjusted to about $20 instead of $30... but this is neither here nor there.this game really is amazing. all of the AI is truly independent. you set goals and perameters for your colony to perform and they follow these but with seemingly their own individual thought. if someones priorities are adjusted a certain way they might perform construction projects regular meal cooking and hunting as needed.things can also get WAY out of hand. in one playthrough i made the mistake of settling in a very hot biome and neglecting to research cooling technology AS WELL AS neglecting to set someone as the designated meal prepper. first it became very hot making my settlers need more food but we ran out of food causing one of my settlers to RANDOMLY CANIBALIZE THE DESIGNATED DOCTOR! aaaaaaand that was the end of that campaign. sometimes it just works out that way.the biggest thing that makes this game so spectacular is the fact that each gameplay is so organically unique that it would be difficult almost impossible to reproduce a campaign multiple times. the game will certainly be different every time you play it and you set the pace and direction of what you want to happen and where you want your story to go.,RimWorld

2016-07-31,0,0,102,True,Recommended,As a rich man I lived too comfortably and sought a more rugged existence. I landed in a lush jungle and began to gilligan. I met a young factory worker there by the name of Walls. Apparentally they had been using her face as a crude hammer at the factory because she was a powerful ugly real wrath of god type stuff. We never quite saw eye to eye as her visage was staggering but we found a way to work together for a time. She trained monkeys in our living room. To do what you ask? I haven't the faintest. Things were going well until I apparently hit some kind of quota on gagging in her presence and she began a spree of pyromania. Unfortunately we had built our home mostly of the jungle timbers. Walls burned and our walls burned. What took days to build became ash in moments. At that point I felt we should part amicably so after building her a nice cozy wooden labyrinth and devouring her monkeys I took my leave. 10/10 Great game!,RimWorld

2018-10-17,12,265,123,False,Not Recommended,"Hot damn. This game is two extremes. There's just no in between. It's the best basketball game I've ever played and also one of the most frustrating. It's incredible in every sense of the word.On one hand the gameplay is freaking stellar. To say it's the best basketball game I've ever played (i.e the actual on court gameplay) is understating it... it's just absolutely great. The gameplay itself the in game presentation the graphics... it's just gorgeous.On the other hand so much of the rest of it is hot garbage. The microtransaction issue has been discussed plenty and yeah that sucks. It really makes what should be a really awesome game mode feel like a chintzy cash grab. And generally speaking many of the menu systems are a convoluted mess. But those aren't even its biggest problems. Because even with all of that I would still be recommending this game. Just based on gameplay alone it's great. Personally I love playing franchise mode on sports games so the whole microtransaction headache really doesn't come into play for me. The menu headaches I can deal with once I figure out the system.But! The game's so freaking buggy I keep losing save files to corruption. As someone who likes to play franchises over long periods of time that renders this game more or less useless to me until its fixed. And it's not like this is a launch day issue this thing's been out over a month now. And a quick perusal of forums and blogs and etc shows I'm not the only one having this problem and there's no shortage of other bugs being reported and 2k is apparently so swamped with tech support requests they're taking over a week to reply if they're replying at all. Don't waste your money. I saw the $40 sale and thought ""what the heck "" but honestly 2k doesn't deserve your money.Editing this to add experiences after a couple of months in the game my impressions haven't changed overall. It's the best and worst thing ever.The myPlayer microtransaction moneygrab thing... honestly if they'd like made it SLIGHTLY easier less grindey it would be awesome. As it is you pretty much have to spend $10 20. If you do that the game's fine. If you don't? It's a slog. Your player will suck for a really long time and improving is a slow and painful process. You really have to grind.But hey at least your myCareer save file doesn't corrupt... unlike franchise save files which they still haven't fixed. For me franchise files have corrupted no joke 9 out of 10 times. That's out of 10 times I tried to start a franchise 9 of them corrupted the first time I saved and closed the game then opened it up again. (The one time it didn't the first time it corrupted the second time I saved and re opened. WOOOOO.) Contacting 2K support was a joke. I sent them as much system and error info as I could and it took them 2 weeks just to send me a clearly automated form email giving me troubleshooting tips... for a console. Like... you have to work to be that bad. And no your ""we're sorry we're so slow we're buried under emails from people who hate this game"" is not a good excuse but thanks for playing. Honestly I just remain amazed by this game. For the on court experience it's the best basketball game I've ever played and maybe the best sports game I've ever played. But literally everything else the bugs the laughably bad menus the money the painfully bad customer service etc has pretty much convinced me to never give 2K a dime again.One final edit I finally got the save files working. I don't think it was anything 2k19 did if you search for some combination of ""2k19 file corruption"" you'll find a thread on the Steam community forums pointing you to where the save files are located I followed that advice and got it working. So now I'm playing my franchise mode and I'm overally pretty happy.I'm still not recommending this game because holy crap I shouldn't have to fix your bugs for you.",NBA 2K19

2018-09-27,6,424,110,False,Not Recommended,Gambling and pay2win is not ok stop it alreadyAnother year another sports game. So I ll start by saying that I m not going to give a positive review for a game which has the most blatant pay2win model gambling and selling cheats.NBA 2k19 is an improvement over the last game. You may not notice that by just watching videos but when you spend some time playing it you see it s quite different.Graphics are pretty much the same maybe players look a little better. But some player are like from PS2 era. I know that making every player look god is a long and difficult job but with releasing the game every year and getting insane profits each year it s possible to do.Animations are nice and this time game relies less on them. It is still animation based but now you have more control over your player.Another improvement which I consider the biggest one is when you re open you re really open. No more just standing behind the player who shoots and it registered as contested shot. You must stand in front of the player and put your hands up to contest the shot. So finally you can pass the ball to an open player and shoot right away while defending man is behind you or on the side or just standing in front of you but does nothing to contest. Unfortunately this has a downside. Because it s really easy to get open shots the game may become three point shooting contest.Defense is improved too. You still drive to the basket but often it ends with a climbing into the tree than a successful layup. So it s better to rely on other way to score. Defense is much more effective this year.I had no problems with performance game runs fine on max settings and looks great.I play MyTeam and MyCareer mode mainly. Both are p2w and infested with cheaters. The game has no anticheat. They only ban cheaters who cheat the currency.MyTeam this time is better and worse at the same time. It s better because you can get some decent players at the beginning and if you know the game you can be pretty competitive. They have added tokens this year which you can earn by simply playing the game online and offline then use those tokens to purchase player cards. And to be honest you can get a lot of ruby cards for cheap from the auction just for a few thousand MT each so building a competitive team is pretty fast.Now why it is worse? The auction is locked. To unlock it you MUST win and online triple threat(3vs3) game. This was possible at day one when most people had poor player cards but it s impossible to do if you bought the game later when everyone has the best players already. There are two outcomes to this you either spend money on VC to buy good player cards or you simply don t play MyTeam because without an auction it s pointless.And again like any other year there are cheaters who if losing just makes the game not count. Of course this doesn t involve cheating VC so 2K doesn t care they doesn t care about bad experiences glitches or bug but if VC glitch is discovered they patch it in a few days.Now another thing about MyTeam. I know it s fun to build your team of super stars but in the end it s boring. Everyone has the best players everyone has almost the same players. Every player can shoot mid range dunk or three pointers. And it s no fun either you win or lose. I wish we could have a separate mode(or this done in the current unlimited mode) where we would be forced to use some crappy cards like bronze silver gold emerald. This would force people to use each player s strength s and for opponent to find the weaknesses this would make people to think to plan in other words to play basketball like it supposed to be played. Now we have every player good at everything which isn't fun.MyCareer is awesome if you play single player. Finally we ve got some nice story mode. Last year I wanted to skip all the cut scenes because it was boring. This year we can skip them but I don t want to do that because are very well done and are interesting to watch. I wish some rpg games had facial animations so good. You start as a player in a Chinese basketball league and make your way up to NBA. You can see how your player struggles how hard he s working and wants to get into NBA. Really good job 2K.To make your player better you must earn VC and upgrade him. And with the ability to buy VC we all know where it leads when it comes to online play.Of course there are many more modes in this game. There s a lot of content for both single player and multiplayer. There s an online mode Play now which isn t affected by p2w mechanics so you can enjoy that at least and know if you win or lose it was only because of your skill.In conclusion I recommend to buy this game but don t buy any VC I mean any not even one time not even the cheapest option. Doing this we show them that the game is good but we are not ok with p2w and gambling.Pros Improved gameplayGood graphicsLots of content for both single player and multiplayerMyCareer mode is greatCons Gambling and pay2win bsSome players look really badNo anti cheatLocked auction in MyTeamMy curator page,NBA 2K19

2019-02-14,6,163,120,False,Not Recommended,"I'd like to preface my review by saying that I've only played My Career the other modes don't appeal to me.The actual gameplay (although it still has flaws questionable AI at times and some serious cheese) is great... for a while. My Career should really be called ""My 1st season"" because you'll end up so bored of the seemingly scripted games (Up by 10? Get subbed out for the whole quarter and put back in down 18) you'll reach the playoffs that 1st year and it will more like a chore than enjoyment.Win rookie of the year? No cutscene.NBA All star weekend? 0 cutscenes or fanfare just a normal game and a sub par dunk contest.The lowest of the low is the progression system in My Career. It's perhaps the most predatory piece of game development I've ever seen. You start off and you suck that's to be expected. But you suck so much that you can't make open layups you can't pass without turning the ball over and you handle like I do in real life. Then a little voice in your head goes.... ""I can spend another 40 bucks and actually start to play like an NBA player... I can actually enjoy this game"". So you check your bank account and see that you can stretch to 40 bucks it's a hobby I enjoy why the not?So you spend 40 bucks on an already pricey game and then you feel dirty sure you can start racking up some numbers on the stat sheet hitting some sweet swishes and breaking ankles... but you've just basically bought you're enjoyment. Without that initial investment (or arduous grind for an obscene amount of hours) this game isn't fun. It's designed to be frustrating.

2019-02-05,0,0,19,False,Recommended,So I have completed two original scenarios for Claire and Leon by standard level of difficulty. After first walkthrough ( for Claire ) I was absolutely sure that RE2 Remake will be the best game of 2019 but after second one I saw some troubles. It's subjectively and of course only my problems.a Same combinations for all safes &amp doors ( I wrote down all the tips and keys in a notepad ) so there wasn't a excitement to find it during the second walkthrough.b) At second scenario Tyrant doesn't scare at all. He gets noisy and loud but not scary and boring.c) For some reason I was absolutely sure that the scenarios would be really different from each other cause it's 2019th triple A game and exciting plots + lots of content are modern standard but the difference is ridiculous like at 1998.But I also have a two extra scenarios for each character + future DLC so I hope it will be more diverse. However RE2 all this years is my favourite part of favourite franchise. And Remake is absolutely awesome!Thank you Capcom!

2019-02-05,0,0,28,False,Recommended,Easily one of my favorite games this year. Got it on greenmangaming for about 40 which almost feels like a steal. The game needs no value proposition. This is Capcom back to their roots with a classic quality title. There is always tension mystery anticipation and important decisions to make. It feels as if every item placement and encounter are carefully handcrafted to leave you with the feeling of despair. There are many surprises that motivate you to keep playing and you're always curious to explore new areas from the puzzle you just solved. Dying never feels bad because the game pulls no punches and allows you to bring valuable knowledge for your next run.Took me way longer than I thought to beat the first campaign in hardcore mode which I believe is the only way to play the game.

2019-02-02,0,0,16,False,Recommended,"I am apprehensive about thumbs upping this game because I definitely don't think it deserves a 96%+ positive rating. It's extremely overpriced for what it is which is unfortunate because the game honestly is pretty decent. I'm reviewing this game as it is. I don't recall much about the original I played it forever ago when I was like 12. So I know a lot of people will defend the faults by saying it's true to the original. Graphically mechanically and cinematically the game is amazing for sure. I think the gameplay is nostalgic of the horror games in the 90's and 2000's. Not because of the mechanics but just the level design and the progression pacing. I think it did a damn good job hitting the right feels in that department. I think it's also a graphically gorgeous game with some great level design. I have some legitimate gripes beyond that though... Firstly. I think it's ridiculous that they have these side character missions. Both play off stupid gender stereotypes (Claire gets to be mommy and Leon gets to be distracted by an FBI woman who doesn't know how to dress appropriately for her job) but that's basically it. There are parts in both the storylines where you get to play these distracting side characters in this subplot sort of scenario. And I barely see the point in the two side characters at all. The FBI Agent was far less infuriating than the child by a long shot. The child's little side mission is so irritating it took me twenty minutes to figure out where I was supposed to hide because there was literally only one place you could do it. That was totally worthless. Leon is the epitome of a dumb blonde. Not the trained police officer one would expect. Claire is basically a piece of cardboard but her interactions at least felt more realistic. Leon's forced last minute romance with the FBI Agent was totally ridiculous. He met her for literally like twenty minutes and then he's so distracted by her boobs that he starts acting like a complete moron. And I get that the Agent's outfit was an homage to the original but that doesn't really make it any less obnoxious. I'm glad they had enough sense to change up Claire's outfit to be more practical and less annoying. The plot is honestly the worst part of the game. And I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate from the RE community but RE has barely ever patchworked together a cohesive plot in its entire run as a franchise. I'm not gonna get into it because I am trying not to spoil everything but the way the characters act about the crisis that's happening around them is so stupid and unbelievable it's not even funny. I very very rarely say that a game's gameplay and graphics make up for its bad characters and plot but honestly I can't help but enjoy playing this game. I really think it's worth something more like $30 at most though. You can replay after you beat each story in a New Game + to get different endings but I don't really see why you'd want to grind through the game to get those. RE7 was absolute trash and I am glad that the RE team made this game more challenging they made resources more scarce and they rewarded accuracy in shooting. I thought they were making zombies HP tanks like they did in 7 to try to make up for the abundance in ammo but I very quickly realized I was just an extremely bad shot and that ammo is actually pretty damn scarce. It felt like a real survival game though the HP items were waaaaay too abundant. I think the RE team needs to steer more towards Silent Hill and less towards typical shooters. But that's just my opinion on the franchise. Overall I'd give this game about a 7.5/10. It's not quite an 8 for me but it's definitely not horrible. I had fun playing and it did feel very nostalgic. But if one more person said ""Go on without me Leon I'll just slow you down "" I would've docked another point. Lol.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-03,0,0,36,False,Recommended,Simply amazing. My only gripe is how the 2nd story ends up going through many of the same areas and puzzles as the first playthrough. Although there's a decent amount of new areas and experiences so it's not like you're playing everything twice over. After finishing the 4th survivor on the skin of my teeth Tofu survivor has become such a comedic relief. I certainly hope they keep up with additional content. This is definitely my favorite title this year. If they can remake every title up to Resident Evil 4 this well I'd fall back in love with the Biohazard series like many of us were until 6.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

I only have 2 things I dont love 100% in this game and thats the Tyrant and that Knifes break but these are small things. The Tyrant is well done for most parts but he can become pretty annoying when he just refuses to leave the place you have to cross... The Knife thing is... well its ok considering the new use of knifes as ""Get out of Jail free"" Items but its somehow strange since the knife was always such a trusted weapon in the RE games and now its just a consumable item...

2019-01-25,26,801,21,False,Recommended,"In A Nutshell Pros + An incredible remake. Everything was remade from scratch using RE7's engine delivering top notch graphics quality.+ Two parallel stories to play Claire's and Leon's.+ Plenty of hidden items weapons and secrets to find with exploration rewarding attentive and careful players.+ True old school survival horror experience players need to be extremely conservative with resources and avoid combat when possible.+ Varied challenging gameplay situations that keep the experience fresh from start to end.+ Higher difficulties provide considerable challenge even to veterans of the genre. Cons The ""Ink"" mechanic (enabling game saving only with a certain consumable) on Hardcore difficulty should be optional as not all players might like it but still would like the additional challenge compared to Normal. First of all it has to be said that this is a Remake with capital R as everything was remade from scratch models textures lighting even the engine was completely changed to the excellent one used for RE7. As far as looks goes RE2 delivers astonishing graphical detail giving a true 2019 worthy look to this great game of old.For those not knowing it RE2 is an old school survival horror quite a bit different from the more recent chapters. Impersonating either Leon or Claire players will have to carve their way through zombie infested police stations putrid sewers and even worse places. What really changes is how they do this as RE2 is a ""pure"" survival horror game favoring extreme conservation of resources for when they truly matter (boss fights or unavoidable normal fights) while encouraging players to be creative and avoid as many unnecessary fights as possible as one would do in a real apocalypse after all.Exploration is rewarding and satisfying for the attentive players that do want to explore every corner open every locker crack every safe lock they find and examine items they find to reveal secrets. Not only this is rewarded with ever needed resources but aswell weapons and objects such as additional inventory space or weapon upgrades. And believe me when i say until the last bullet will be needed to make it through this horror so better start looking! Combat features detailed dismemberment mechanics such as mutilating an enemy's legs to slow it down or hitting weak points to stagger it momentarily and run past. Overall this remake of RE2 is an excellent survival horror only quite different than what most players are used to nowadays and thus needs to be understood to fully enjoy it. Still to those willing to understand how its mechanic work it can deliver an unforgettable experience for this genre as only a few other masterpieces can do. It's actually a game I have been happy to pay full price for. In depth Feature Analysis Gameplay Gameplay in RE2 is divided into Exploration Management and Combat.Exploration is performed with a 3rd person visual featuring mouse based aiming sprint/walk and plenty of interactions with the environment such as using specific tools to open pathways barricade windows or opening lockers and containers to gather loot. Attention to detail and backtracking are fundamental in this game as many areas will be only accessible as more and more tools and keys are gathered so going back to already explored places is actually meaningful even if optional as it often leads to great rewards for those willing to risk it.Management is a fundamental mechanic in any survival horror but especially in RE2. Inventory space especially at the beginning without expansions is very limited so either going back often to the Stash to store items or a wise optimization of resources are needed at all times. Combining herbs ammo stacks and decide what to take or leave behind are things players will do often in this title. With the presence of a global stash however it's just a matter of storing surplus into it often when accessible. However balancing the loadout in ammo healing items and weapons is important and doing it wrong can lead to not having enough space for critical items. Story The story in RE2 is divided into two parallel campaigns and its lore is narrated via pieces of information found scattered around cut scenes and dialogues with various characters. The narrative is solid decently written and engaging from start to end. Characters have all strong defined personalities and are interesting aswell. For not being the strong side of these titles definitely good. Combat System Combat in RE2 is tactical pretty much slow paced and based upon accuracy preparation and knowing each enemy's skills and weaknesses. The best offense in this game is... to avoid combat. That's right try to kill every enemy and soon all ammo will run out leaving players defenseless and doomed in case of mandatory fights. Instead careful planning of routes engagements is vital to save up the spare resources for when they truly matter.Still then it comes to it each weapon has good and diverse feeling to it while enemies react beautifully to shots in a shower of gore most of the time. Enemies are considerably tougher than most of nowadays games of the same genres so beware. This might seem as a CON at first... but once understanding the game's concept it becomes a good side of it. Content &amp Pricing Priced at 60 and lasting (depends on play style difficulty and experience GREATLY) around 10 16 hours this is one of the VERY FEW titles i can recommend getting at FULL PRICE. The quality it delivers is simply too good to be missed. Balance &amp Challenge This is not an easy game by any means and players can even be forced to restart because of having wasted too many resources. But once understood it delivers amazing satisfactions. Challenge level is medium/high. Technical Analysis Graphics Astonishing. RE7's engine improved even more with a plethora of modern effects filters and settings to tweak and top quality textures models animations and effects makes for one gorgeous title. Possibly one of the games with the best graphics around considering it's a remake. Sound Excellent ambient sounds effects and voice acting. Directional sounds also featuring binaural audio for better realism deliver excellent quality that contributes immensely to immersion. Performance &amp Stability The game runs without issues in 1440p with maxed out settings 3GB textures and 120% quality on the following config i7 4820K GTX1080 16GB RAM . No performance or optimization problems to note. Artificial Intelligence Enemy AI is not that brilliant considering most enemies are mutants or zombies. As expected. The few ""intelligent"" enemies follow patterns of movement through the maps and chase players on sight. Quality of Life Good interface and menu handling without any issue for the genre. Bugs &amp Issues Nothing major to report. Great polishing and refinement. Conclusion RE2 is really a gem of the old times brought back to life with modern technology. One of the best remade versions I have ever seen on the market and truly worth every cent.Follow our curator page OCG Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-01-31,5,198,23,False,Recommended,This game has me emotional in a way I can t explain. I ve loved the Resident Evil series with a fiery passion ever since I played my very first entry with Code Veronica X on the PS2. After I finished playing the hell out of that game I devoured every Resident Evil title I could get my hands on and was a dedicated fan (even wrote my share of fan fiction) all the way up until Resident Evil 6 which thoroughly ripped my heart to shreds with what the series had become. While RE7 was something of a return to form despite the first person perspective it was missing the one thing I loved so much about these games the characters. I didn't realize until now how badly I missed my time with them but stepping into Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield s shoes again felt like coming home.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1639405393That said I was terrified that like so many overly hyped high profile titles these days that Resident Evil 2 would stumble and miss the mark. But let me tell you they nailed it. THEY NAILED IT! Granted the story has been somewhat simplified and the B scenarios feel rushed and a bit tacked on (likely a result of the devs not wanting to disappoint the fans when word leaked that they wouldn t be included) but those are miniscule grievances when the rest of the game is so supremely satisfying. Everything that I loved about the series is back and it all looks sounds and feels so good that I m literally getting choked up right now just typing this.Even the swap to over the shoulder camera feels fitting and natural and I ve long been a champion of fixed camera angles. But the way the action is framed the long dark endless corridors the creatures that lurk in the shadows the terrifying sounds they make it all makes up for the loss. Fortunately the characters don t move with quite as much agility as they do in post RE4 titles either. There s no dodge button no quick time events no counterattacks. If you re grabbed by a zombie you either shove a grenade down its throat or suffer the consequences. This heightens the suspense tremendously. No matter how heinous the foe you need to tread carefully and wisely.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1640404534And that's not even mentioning how much better the writing and acting is. The dialogue actually sounds somewhat believable albeit cliche at times and the interactions between characters are so much more organic than they used to be (thank goodness there s no I love you moment ) All of this is elevated by the voice actors giving great performances which really help bring these characters to life. We already know who bad super agent Leon S. Kennedy is but it s refreshing watching the rookie cop become the man we all know and love.I honestly could continue gushing about the game for several more paragraphs but there s already thousands of reviews that ll say the exact same thing. So I ll just say this if you re an old school Resident Evil fan and you can get past the modernization of a classic then you need to play this game. YOU NEED IT! This is old school survival horror in a gorgeous new wrapping and every bit as good as the original.Curated by Chudah's Corner,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

As a kid in the Resident evil 4 days I've always looked forward for a remake in the same style for resident evil 1 or 2 AND CAPCOM DELIVERED. Kinda sucks that the original music is locked behind a paywall but HOLY HECK it was worth it. I've played both A B and B A scenarios with and without the orignal music and I keep coming back to the sweet syhmony orchestral melodies. First time i ran through that hallway with zombos bursting through the windows and the loud screechy music of old times it took me back. New music is alright though. 9/10,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-04,0,0,30,False,Recommended,Great game! No doubt about that. Brings forth the feel of the original but in the 21st century! The game play is great and the graphics are even better. I would totally recommend it. HOWEVER Read below my in site on what I did not like.My only gripe about it is reply value.We all know about that IGN review that says 2nd run is basically the same as the 1st run through and everyone gave them crap because of that review... well to be fair they really weren't that far off. I just finished playing through both Leon and Claire's 1st and 2nd run throughs and honestly... I was bored of the game before I finished my 1st 2nd run through with Leon. Other then where you start off and some item locations (which that is even rare) and a minor twist to the end of the story everything was basically the same.I was not impressed with the minor changes in the run throughs. It was simply not changed enough and I was still replying the same sectors just in a different manner (as in used the door earlier or later then previous run through or starting on the other side of the station) the results end up being the same you still have to go through the same puzzles and same rooms to get the same items to clear and move onto the next sector...I know this is basically how the original was too but for a full priced game. I was hoping for more replay value. (maybe we will get that with the up coming free DLC)And survival mode is a cool idea but again nothing new here no new areas to play in etc... it just spawns you at the end of the game with Hunk and you have to run through everything but backwards to get to the evac point... Great? I beat the survival aspect in my first try... so that was fun while it lasted?Either way its a good game and highly recommend it. Just dont invest a crazy amount of time in the other run throughs. You might be disappointed in what you find.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-04,0,0,37,False,Recommended,After a little less than thirty hours I have just completed the 2019 version of Resident Evil 2 (unlocking all achievements in the process) and am now searching for words to convey how I feel without sounding like too much of fanboy. Truth be told and despite the fact that I really did enjoy the franchise s new spin through a brilliant and successful 7th entry nostalgia has always kept the 2nd and 4th entries very close to my heart both of which I have always considered the true epitome of the franchise s atmosphere and gameplay respectively.Claiming that said entries left a lasting impression on my gaming career as a younger man would be a massive understatement and so I am bound to cover this REmake with praise it being nothing short of a perfect fusion of my two favourite entries.. and probably even more than the sum of its parts. I'm not going to insult your intelligence lingering on the technical side of things (the game is just beautiful and runs well there is nothing more to add) or on the outdated gameplay (which remains more or less similar to that of RE4 and 5) or even on the nonsensical b movie plot (which nevertheless retains its timeless cheesy charm).What I would emphasize instead is that this game has a soul uncannily similar to its 1998 source material perfectly capturing what made that game legendary in the first place whilst simultaneously improving upon it dramatically creating a new beast altogether in the process.This game turned the clock back 21 years when I played Resident Evil 2 on PS1 for the first time thoroughly impressed by it all and just happy to experience such a great ride which is basically the reason why I love video games so much. So yeah.. just buy and play the damn game already. This one gets my highest recommendation.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-04,0,0,31,False,Recommended,The game runs smoothly and looks amazing. The same engine used from RE7 was used for this game.For a remake it's everything a fan of the series could ask for.There are 4 main campaigns in the game. Leon A/B (first and second run) and Claire A/B (first and second run). It took me approximately 10 hours to complete Leon A and 6 hours for Claire A. Now I'm on the second run of their campaigns and it's quite different already within the first few minutes it changes what you already know about the game and it takes you out of your comfort zone and forces you to explore again.The controls feel natural. For a horror game its definitely one of the best. I played Leon A on regular difficulty and it worked out to be a bit of a challenge I didn't die once since I'm already familiar with the series and game's mechanics from the demo but that doesn't take away from the experience. I was constantly scared of the next corner or next zombie encounter because I barely had a full clip for my guns. The clues and items you find throughout the game are worth paying attention to as they help you progress further. The puzzles were not too hard as to make you quit as long as you're somewhat patient and pay attention to how the puzzle should be solved. That being said the game is great for fans of the series and horror game enthusiasts. However if you've never played the earlier games such as RE1 2 3 then you may struggle progressing through the game without a guide because the game plays differently to most modern games it doesn't exactly hold your hand or specifically tell you where to go no waypoints nothing. Some tips are to look at the map and see which rooms have been explored or not EXAMINE the key items you collect (keys boxes etc). I'd highly recommend this game it's not for the faint hearted but where's the fun of it your heart pumping and adrenaline rushing. Also it's just a game zombies aren't real D10/10 it's the only good horror game I've played since dead space.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

Still chared me a ton for costumes and usless guns (these would be free unlock sin past). 7 out of 10 wait till cheap as 8 hours max play I did both campaigns in 7 hours at one point in police station back and forth I was starting to get bored was interesting when Tyrant showed up but then a pain having to go long way to avoid him (scary foot steps). And Caires story finishes it off nicely but 50% same quests. Leon has been here and unlocked the door so why I got to do it lame spoils game so about 4 5 hours content and I wom't replay. Nice cut scenes and worth a play through but at 20 not full price. And had some great memories and seeing how far graphics has come is amazing they did a great job at Capcom but its 2019 and I expect more game for my money. I would have paid 10 oor 15 more if they had Claire do unique missions and some of the new areas in concept art amd Res Evil 3 as part of a complete package.

2019-01-29,0,0,17,False,Recommended,"Awesome game and a benchmark on how a remake should be done. It's RE2 at its core without any of that t other companies tried to pull of. Compared to the original it provides no significant changes in gameplay or story and there are only a few changes in the level design but those do reduce backtracking quite a bit. Still the slight changes that have been made are interesting and provide a good mix up. People who know the original RE2 by heart will immediately feel at home in Racoon City but even they will see a few new things.The best part of this game however is its presentation The sound design is amazing. From little things like the sound of your boots on the ground to the more important ones like the music ore the well known Zombies that scream and moan... Still even the sound is outclassed by the graphics. I can't stress enough how impressed I am with the damn graphics! The game always looks amazing and at certain parts it even manages to look real. Now that's not something I say often and I even think that videogames should concentrate on their own visual style rather than trying to recreate reality but RE2 does concentrate on its own style and achieves the photorealism along the way by having an incredible attention to detail. Faces and clothing look impressive rain looks awesome animations are fluid and believable... Everything is spot on. Capcom even took the time to add facial expression to the characters so that they squinch their faces when injured. Considering the game is played in an over the shoulder perspective so you might not never realize your character is doing this it only shows how much Capcom cared about the details here.There is only one thing that might put you off The game can be a bit short. Since there are two playable main characters it provides you with two campaigns that offer just enough differences between them to count as seperate and only playing both of them will let you see the whole story. After finishing the game once you can then start a ""2nd Run"" which basically is kinda New Game Plus and only this mode let's you see the true ending. Again finish 2nd Run once and you can start to play additional modes that don't offer much new except very tough challenges. Now if you're a completionist you will probably play the normal game twice and then the 2nd Run twice too because 2nd Run makes the enemies tougher changes the location of items and weapons and starts you off a fair bit into the game by skipping the Prologue and the arrival in Raccon City. If you're in it for the story however you might not be interested in playing the game four times and after you've played it once with a character you can then start the 2nd Run with the other. This way will let you see the whole story and the good ending in about 15 to 17 hours.So if you're gonna play it several times the game is definitely worth every penny. If not however full price might not be a good idea since you will pay almost sixty bucks for 15 hours of gameplay. I still wholeheartedly recommend RE2 to everyone but those who are in it to see the story and don't plan on playing it several times (or simply don't have the time to do that) might want to think about waiting for a sale.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-05,0,0,17,False,Recommended,This is a perfect example of a gaming masterpiece and is easily the best remake I have ever played far surpassing the original title. The graphics atmosphere and positional audio is terrifying in the most enjoyable of ways (You can hear every growl click clack and shriek near you while the music builds tension constantly in dangerous areas) and the map designs are superb rewarding players for foresight in carrying certain items or approaching puzzles in a specific way. Many parts of the game offer you an opportunity to save ammo by boarding windows or doing certain things to prevent zombies from becoming a problem later. Carefully choosing your battles and the path you take through the police station will reward you greatly later and extra puzzles are always worth the effort to solve.The story is engrossing even to those who have already seen the original as it is very well retold and area layouts have changed significantly enough it feels like a brand new game.This should absolutely be a purchase for anyone who enjoys survival horror games atmospheric scary titles and great games in general.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

The value of this game is the same as when you play a story driven single player that you binge for a while and if you like it enough (like most fans) you'll go back to the game later simply because you love the game not because theres more to do.

2019-01-31,0,0,23,False,Recommended,I'm simply blown away by how good of a REmake this is. The enemy design within the game works out great and you always feel a tinge of danger even when facing basic enemies like the regular zombies but full blown anxiety attacks when you screw up while fighting or fleeing from bigger threats like Lickers Mr. Birken or Mr. X. Speaking of Mr. X he's best scary snazzy looking antagonist I've seen in a game in years. His unstoppable nature large figure and stomping footsteps let you know he's a major threat from the get go and seeing him remastered after all these years in such a great way really makings me want to hug the whole team who put together this REmake.I haven't even mentioned the sound design which is critically important to good horror. The ambient sounds enemy sounds and even the sounds of the protagonists panting and cursing are all so well done! Take note developers this is what you should strive for when designing sound for your horror games.This is beyond a faithful REmake this was better than what I could have hoped for.With the massive success RE 2 is seeing I'm almost certain I'll be able to experience RE 3 remade using very similar assests in the near future. With how they handled modeling Mr. X I can't wait to see how they'll recreate Nemesis.Oh and I wouldn't mind a RE4 remake with more content added in a few years either. I played it for hundreds of hours as a teenager and would certainly dive into it again given the chance.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

If Capcom or AMD release the patch I will recommend the game but now I must give it a negative review.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-07,0,0,65,False,Recommended,One of my favorite game series and possibly my favorite overall hits its peak with this remake. What was previously my favorite game of the original gameplay style and inventory focused structure is remade with painstaking attention to detail in order to keep it faithful to the original feel and focus while updating it to modern standards. They absolutely nailed it. There were certain aspects that I thought might have been an issue if implemented in a sloppy manner and it's clear the designers programmers and even writers and scene directors were very aware of this as well. They made sure nothing ruined the experience. Luckily it also runs perfectly on PC just as RE7 did.I last closed the game earlier today having completed every unlockable based objective of which there are around 70 including speed runs inventory limited playthroughs extra mission modes etc. I also completed the extra objective of getting an S+ rank (requiring limited saves) with both Claire and Leon (each character comes across a unique set of primary weapons and sidearms) one on each campaign variant . Since I played RE4 on the week of release for Gamecube I've considered it my favorite game ever with RE2 and recently RE7 tied for a far second place in the series. I can't say for certain right now but this remake is definitely giving it a tofu run for its money.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-07,0,0,17,False,Recommended,I only have 17 hours played but it was enough time for me to get through the A runs of both Leon and Claire and I couldn't be more excited to do the B runs.This game does survival horror perfectly. No constant jump scares every 2 seconds. The eerie feeling of walking down a dark hallway also while there is a bunch of creepy noises from creaking water dripping zombies moaning. Not knowing where said noises are coming from making you scared and hesitant to turn every corner keeping you on edge but also worrying about what resources you have left gives this game one of the best atmospheres I've ever experienced.The way the game sets all the puzzles works amazing not too complicated but not too easy. Leaving the answers scattered throughout the game making you truly explore the areas to make sure you haven't missed anything. Having these puzzles also allows for a good implementation of backtracking. Finding a puzzle early game to find the answer mid way through making you go back through an area you've been through already but that zombie you didn't kill is still there giving the backtracking a different experience each time.The inventory is one of the best mechanics of the game. Giving you exactly what you need to get through an area but not too much so it makes you contemplate is using these bullets/health item/grenade worth it right now or should I save them for later?. Having limited spaces engages you in inventory management. This also falls into the exploration part too from the first paragraph about puzzles. These items being so precious also encourages you to explore every nook and cranny of the game really giving it that survival feel.The game looks beautiful as well. The lighting shadows textures insane detail in gore. Only down side I had was some micro stuttering travelling from one area to a new one. Especially in the main hall of the police station but it was something I could play through and isn't warranted giving this game a negative review. l felt like I was engaged in the story and wasn't missing out on anything. I understood what was happening from start to finish. Each character had their own personality that stood out and was unique to themselves and all had a role to play all the way to the end. Some of the voice acting was a bit odd but you could tell they were trying to keep that original voice acting and I loved it.Overall this game takes it's basic mechanics improves on them without taking away that original feel but gives it that modernised look you get in today's games. 100% recommend to anyone old fans new to the series and want a way to get introduced. There is so much more that is great about this game that I haven't written in this review. There is just too much to write about. 10/10 must buy.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

If anyone is thinking of picking up this game I would highly recommend playing on the hardcore difficulty to truely experience this masterpiece.Here's to hoping the RE3 remake is in the works.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-01,0,0,19,False,Recommended,(VERY MILD SPOILERS AHEAD)Resident Evil 2 Remake is an example of the modern hype train over a genuinely good product going overboard and turning it into a God.Let s clear two things up categorically this is a fun fun game and a worthy remake but it is neither as good as the original nor as good as the disgracefully underrated Resident Evil Remake.Let s start with the basics remaking RE2 is a true sign that despite the end product s quality that Capcom are completely out of ideas and have resorted to remaking sequels in order to find something new. And the fact the game is pretty darn good justifies their lack of imagination.But I do wonder when this series will be permanently shelved RE7 was good it was but not very RE y while this one is good it is but doesn t really capture the feel and vibe of the original games.For example RE Remake absolutely captured the 96 original plus massively improved on every aspect that time dictated need a new lick of paint. It is for me hands down by far the best video game remake in history. I didn t expect this one to match it and it didn t.What is good about RE2? It s a fun stand alone survival horror which feels like Outlast in places and RE7 in others it is visually decent if not stunning and the gameplay is the RE Engine gameplay the series has evolved into it is not the gameplay of the originals even if you think it is. It like RE7 feels disconnected from the earlier games but even though that is a bit disappointing it s not the end of the world.One review made a very fair point the new police station isn t well designed. I don t like the new stairs in the lobby and the navigation is horrific it is not intuitive and the frequent backtracking is a nightmare.I also dislike the hoops you have to jump through to get the magnum I didn t get it completed the game without it but blow me if I didn t expect it to be given to me as part of the game. No turns out you have to bend over backwards to earn it and I don t really agree with that. I also don t agree with making chief Irons office non standard plot either. I didn t find the club key on my first playthrough so didn t get to see the backstory there.But this didn t ruin the game I know it sounds like a hating review I really did enjoy this game but it in no way captured the magic of the original RE2 and a lot of the changes it made were frankly unnecessary. It s a good game in its own right but it s perhaps a little overrated perhaps others were expecting something different to myself but I wanted to play a game which felt like the game it was remaking rather than a RE Engine contemporary take on it.It didn t feel like I was in Raccoon City it didn t feel like Umbrella s Lab and it didn t actually feel like Leon Kennedy not that I mind because he is the most boring and overused protagonist in the series history anyway give me Jill Chris and Barry any day.It also bothered me that Leon's scenario saw very little interaction with Claire unlike the original for example no Sherrie in Leon's till the end and her character being made kind of irrelevant in his first playthrough.There was also a slight 'bug' whereby the 'so far' summary on the loading screen was illegible because it loaded too fast to read!I also wasn't fond of the rejiggling of the order of game aspects and I didn't really like the change in the gun shop owner's character.But back on the point the game is good very good it has its faults (zombie bullet sponges are just old and completely idiotic by now) for sure and anyone thinking this game is perfect has very different standards to me. But it isn t RE. RE will always be the original 90s games 2001 s RE Remake and more recent HD remaster nailed the old feeling while bringing it into the present. This one just doesn t.But I d still recommend it anyway.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-07,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Anyone else notice Capcom crushing other major publishers lately? Last year's Monster Hunter World and Mega Man 11 the upcoming DMC 5 and then there's THIS game. Damn this game. RE 2 made me realize why public facilities need wider corridors. Liked Game looks pretty all things considered. All backed up by good performance. True Survival Horror. Finished it in hardcore mode just a while ago. I think this is the first time I actually had to conserve ammo on a game like this making a bullet count not by hitting the right area of an enemy but actually saving it for a bigger threat later on. The music new and old(got the dlc) the thumping of Mr X's boots that disgusting sound when you keep shanking a zombie to make sure it stays down every sound just fits perfectly and sets the mood. Puzzles that are satisfying to solve. Those A ha! moments making a comeback. It also ties in perfectly with the next two things I like. Inventory management. None of those endless pockets here. You either have enough space discard another item or you backtrack here when you finally have room. Speaking of.. Smart backtracking. This is not traversing through empty space. There are key items that will be in the same room as you that can't be accessed. Not yet. There's plants and bullets you actually want to come back to and pick up and depending on your past actions may have to deal with some unpleasantries along the way. I actually had to plan how I'm gonna come back to certain areas. Mostly because of certain individual. Tyrant. I can most definitely say that even after getting spoiled by previews/gameplays before release having the knowledge that this guy can't be killed didn't make my encounters with this guy any less stressful. Someone should mod his AI so he can enter safe rooms. Replayability. Different modes to unlock. Story campaign long enough to not feel like a chore when replaying multiple times. Currently planning on how to pull off the 3 hour completion for that unlimited ammo. Didn't Like Writing. This is videogame storytelling from over 20 years ago. There is only so much a remake could do to modernize it without straying too far from the original. Still its not gonna blow anyone's mind. Also storywise some parts on the 2nd run playthrough just don't make any sense. Sections where you lose control of the main characters. Secondary character sections are meh at best frustrating at worst. Bosses. The 360 swipes the one shot kills the jump attacks.....come on guys. Evil Within 2 had more creative boss fights than this.

2019-02-06,0,0,66,False,Recommended,RE2 was always my favorite game in the series and this remake doesn't just do justice to the original tale it actively improves upon it. Better writing realistic facial expression and voice acting amazing visuals and a dismemberment system that STAR WARS games should be taking notes on. Normally I'd scoff at the loss of my tank controls (as I'm a master of the old titles) but the shift in control and perspective is superfluous when you take into consideration that Capcom managed to preserve the atmosphere and tone of the adventure without the need for the sense of dread that the fixed camera angles of the original imposed. Whether you're a veteran of the original or just a civilian reading about the horror in Raccoon City for the first time you owe it to yourself to play this game and experience the nightmare first hand. It's a true masterpiece of the genre.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-02,0,0,54,False,Recommended,After waiting years for this game i can say it was worth the wait game game has a blend off the old school and new schoolthis game is a really good contender for the goty but like any game it has its flaws one of them being that in contrary of the old re2 you will have a few battles that happen with leon and claire in the same place with the same version of birkin (not like the original) scenario A and B with both leon and claire dont have a lot of differences compared to the old re2 and some gun shots sound not powerful especially if you compare the old and new upgraded shotgun if you play the game on hardcore there will be some frustrating parts just l ike any other hard game. but the atmosphere and the way the story is telled for me is much better than the original one some characters like annette and Ben have changed their personality and behaviour and are moch better compared to the old ones.

Here's to it being as good as this one.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-07,0,0,54,False,Recommended,Resident Evil 2 Remake is a triumph of clever polished game design and is quite possibly our favourite game in the series. It leans into terrifying close encounters more than epic action setpieces but that s really what the series is about and RE2 does the terrifying perfectly. Enemies are superb and the game boasts the best zombies in any game ever unrelenting and mostly unstoppable they re just creepy. Then there s Mr X the game s own Jason Voorhees continuously stalking you throughout. We loved every moment of Resident Evil 2 and even if you know the first game inside out you won t know the Remake at all. If you ve ever loved a Resident Evil game or wished that RE7 was third person want to go back to RE2 and its great horror design or just want a horror action game get Resident Evil 2 Remake. You won t be disappointed.I don't regret a single cent well done devs.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-07,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Yes,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-07,0,0,60,False,Recommended,Short version of my review It was my wish that survival horror remained the same but if it had to change then this is the way to do it.9/10I feel like in the case of any remake the past experience of each individual with the original game plays a huge role in their opinion of the current iteration. RE is one of my favourite video game series and I have played all of the games extensively (yes even Gaiden). Like many others I consider the original RE2 the best of the bunch and while I enjoy RE4 and have played it more than 50 times on a variety of platforms I credit it with the downfall of RE and survival horror in general. I really liked RE7 for its return to horror themes and a more planned and tactical approach to combat but to me it never really matched the formula that makes a survival horror game which includes fixed camera angles and tank controls.Now comes the new RE2 and it took me by surprise when I saw it went TP over the shoulder. I was already disappointed I wanted a remake like the first and we were going to get a generic action game. How wrong I was.This game IS survival horror in the 21st Century. It is an amazing experience that brings back the tension of the old games and by that I mean the constant required planning of routes item carry and what to kill or ignore. I makes use of the well established setting and story and improves on it delivering more detail to the world and refining the gameplay to appeal to both newcomers and veterans alike. The new zombies are a less predictable and lickers are more deadly making your ability to aim a necessity rather than an overpowered mechanic. The new redesign of the RPD and the subsequent areas keeps things fresh but has many of the landmarks old fans will recognise especially in the beginning sections of the game. Some characters have their roles expanded like Chief Irons Marvin and Kendo but the story remains the same. Some enemies have been removed namely the spiders the crows and the moth while the G offspring was downgraded from boss to a powerful but numerous enemy. All the guns from the original make a return except for the Bow Gun but you won't really miss it. The gunplay is very satisfying and making your shots count is as important as ever just do yourself a favour and play on Hardcore. If there is something negative to say about this game is that the Devs probably rushed the A&amp B scenarios as they no longer complement each other making the experience rather repetitive. For instance aside from where you enter the RPD and the sequence of a couple of puzzles Leon A and Leon B are the same up until the end when you get an additional boss battle and the true ending cutscene. Leon no longer meets Claire in the RPD and they do not talk on the radio which I feel was a missed opportunity. I wanted to see more interactions between the main protagonists and a bit more character development but alas it does not really detract from the bulk of the experience. I wanted a traditional return to classic Survival Horror but instead got a modern masterpiece. This is Capcom's redemption and a rare time in which a Resident Evil fan can feel optimistic about the future. An absolute recommendation you owe it to yourself to play this game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-07,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Great game! I'm actually scared while playing it it feels just like when I used to turn on my PS2 and play resident evil when I was younger this is definitely a great remake I hope they remake RE4 like this but in order to do that they need to remake all of them .10/10 amazing,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-07,0,0,49,False,Recommended,Fantastic! Classic survival horror tension with a finely tuned modern control scheme. I was disappointed when I learned Capcom was doing away with the fixed camera angles of the original but it feels so good to play I forgave them almost instantly. The game would feel like a more complete package if the first and second run scenarios were true conterparts to each other rather than a different twist on the same events. However this is a relatively small issue in an otherwise fantastic reimagining of a twenty year old game. Capcom seems to be turning the franchise around after over a decade of bombastic (while still fun) action packed shooters and I'm elated to see them do it so successfully.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-01-26,0,0,70,False,Recommended,This isn't just a remake this is a REimagining of what made the original game so special to those that played it back when it originally released and a welcoming experience for those new to RE2.Addendum Just buy the damn game it really is just incredible and I feel as though that doesn't do the game justice.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-26,0,0,18,False,Recommended,Classic survival horror returning with the RE engine. The game almost feels like a open world with the amount of replayability (ability to roam around) in the Raccoon City Police Department with the endless dark areas surrounding you for most of times during objectives gives the player a reminder of the hostiliy and how escaping one event doesn't neccesarily mean they won't be put in another. The game can be very punishing with the misuse of resources. Such as the attempt to guns blazing in to clearing a area will cause you to run out of ammo much faster than someone who would just use what is needed to bypass the enemies. This is because of the absurd hitpoints the enemies get making the player learn to be conservative with resources as possible. (Critical headshot in this game is rare)The visual design found in this remake will blow the old and newcomers into the Resident Evil series away. With the amount of detail found in the diliapidated Raccoon City to the terrifying facial designs of the zombies. (I also suggest users to switch to DirectX 12 if they encounter a bug with the first cutscene in the police station) The controls are something I can't talk about for keyboards since I just found it more simple with a controller. But the controller controls are fairly easy to remember. I'm expecting it to be the same thing as PS4 and Xbox. You should try and play around with the control settings such as toggle/hold for sprinting because it might not be the right one for you.The sound for this game will scare the living hell outta you. From the creaking floors in the police station to the endless footsteps created by Mr X trying to find you and last but not all the enemies growling sound all trying to make the player aim down their sight through every corridor and every hallway. Overall this is one hell of a game to remember in the franchise. Capcom being able to redesign a 90's game from the old tank control to a over shoulder camera angle to be able to appeal to modern day gamers show that they understand what survival horror fans today want and it is true that survival horror games do not get as much recognition as they should. But I think this one really does shine the light in the genre. I hope Resident Evil 3 Remake continues its development and nothing tragic happens in its way as I can't wait to discover what all the hype is about surrounding the 3rd series installment in its remake.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-06,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Sound design is incredible! You never feel safe the ambient noise (coupled with Mr. X stomping around trying to kill you) creates such a spooky atmosphere. Graphically it's also very impressive and it actually runs really well. Gameplay is fun you're constantly low on supplies so you have to strategize your paths and figure out whether you even want to engage any of the zombies. Only thing I dislike is how some zombies can take like 10 shots to the head just to die while some take only a couple. So sometimes you'll waste your bullets since you assume it'll only take a few but in fact it takes many more. Maybe that's just me but in general it seems that the pistol is quite inconsistent in terms of damage compared to other weapons. That could be by design and I wouldn't be surprised as it's a survival horror but it's just something I noticed.Overall though it's great just a solid game without any nonsense.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-06,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Resident Evil 2 is how you do a remake. This is really how survival horror is supposed to feel like. Graphics are top notch sound design is on point and the game is just brimming with atmosphere. Not only that but there are two campaigns. You really get your money's worth with this game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-05,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Good game and I recommend buying it. But lets get to the negatives first so that Capcom hopefully does something about it with future updates Spoilers Ahead Story Zombie Brad is not in the game. Hopefully future updates add him back or if he isn't coming back on RE2 then hopefully Jill will face him as Zombie in RE3 Remake. Else it's going to be a waste. Ben's role in this Remake was a letdown. I was hoping to see more of him not just Leon being an and then Ben dying all of a sudden His death was cool but it was too quick . Leon didn't meet with Sherry on the police station at all. Even on Leon B. There's literally no connection between him and sherry in this game unlike RE2 and RE DSC. Even if he couldn't talk with her he should have seen her running away or something like that. Consistency error. If Willaim Birkin already breaks the bridge on the underground part of the police station when you play as Leon the bridge possibly couldn't be fixed in such a short time for Birkin to break it again when Claire comes. I'm not sure if Claire or Leon meets Birkin first but that is irrelevant since the bridge breaks on both campaigns which doesn't make sense. Same kind of error can be seen here and there in the game. There's barely any difference between A and B scenarios for the same character so at least there should have been consistencies among the story. Enemy types I didn't see different models of Lickers. Was expecting different Lickers on the lab. No spiders at all. Having at least few of them on the sewers would be great. Maybe just one spider as mini boss. Crows should have been at least present on cutscenes or something. Technical aspects Lack of proper support for different aspect ratios. Only 16 9 is supported properly. 21 9 works during gameplay but cutscenes are pillar boxed. 32 9 and multimonitor aspect ratios are vert vertically cropped . What's funny is that cutscenes are letter boxed to 16 9 and yet they are vertically cropped lol. 16 10 and 4 3 are letter boxed too.There should be options to turn off black bars and the cropping should be fixed. It's not like it's impossible cause all these problems are unofficially fixed and are available here on WSGF website www.wsgf.org . No option to turn off vignette. It makes the game way too dark. Again it is fixed by fans See the link on WSGF above . Having the ability to turn it off would be great. Ingame contrast slider would be great too. This game has sharpening filter which works well with TAA but any Anti Aliasing setting other than TAA suffers from severe sharpening which looks downright ugly. An option to disable sharpening filter would be great so that SMAA and FXAA can be used. Interlaced mode on PC looks noticeably worse than Xbox One X's interlaced mode as you can see on Leon's hair which shimmers weirdly on PC with interlaced mode with TAA. A small fix on this issue would be appreciated.These are some of the few things which if fixed would make the game a GOTY material for me. The game in it's current state is already great and was totally worth the 60$. The base game is long enough and enjoyable to justify the 60$.I finally found another good third person game on PC after Evil Within 2. There are so many 3rd person single player games on consoles and I like 3rd person games. The gore in this game is on point too. Shooting zombies and seeing visual feedback really adds to the immersion.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-08,0,0,29,False,Recommended,In spite of its success it's clear RE7 was a mere test run for this game and oh boy what a gem this is. RE RE2 is a faithful but altered version of the original classic with a refined formula from RE7.Leon is good but is arguably the weakest of the characters here as Claire wins the badass big sister trophy. Marvin for how little we get to see of him is fantastically played. The experienced cop knowing that his time is basically up but still willing to bare the pain to give the rookie/ unfortunate Claire the chance they need to live. Ada is the sassy spy we all know and love and she steals Leon's spotlight once they link up. Their flirting is however adorable.Gameplay and performance is TIGHT. While my GTX 1070 is not a good benchmark for budget builds playing on near max had 0 frame drops. Interfaces work well on PC with good mouse control. Capcom has done an incredible job. Zombies are tough but responsive to your attacks riding a line between fodder and sponge that makes them surprisingly dangerous in groups and worth planning around. Lickers make their terrifying return in their most aggressive and nerve racking form yet depending on how you engage them. Add in a couple new creatures and you're in for a good ol spookin. Your first play through is probably going to be rough being low on reserves but probably not reaching hopelessness. Get to grips with the game and how to properly react/prepare for it and it can be a cake walk and a perfect route into the game's time based rating system and of course the challenging S+ rank.My only complaints 1. breakable knives (though I know why its designed that way) and 2.

2019-02-02,0,0,44,False,Recommended,"When Resident evil 2 was originally released it truly brought terror to a whole new level. Overtime Resident Evil wasn't truly living up to it's horror aspect as the game progressed further and further into a more action like film rather than a survival horror video game where we feared for the worst in the safe room when there was no ammo or herbs. This Remake is a ""breath of fresh air"" to those that are seeking for something the classic Resident Evil titles provided back then the nostalgia when I played this was such a trip. Thank you Capcom for starting this year off right! (For fans that want the full experience I suggest starting on ""Hardcore"" difficulty!)",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-04,0,0,111,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Many were shocked when Capcom requested the discontinuation of a Resident Evil 2 fan remake but even more surprising was the company's announcement that they would be working on a remake of the 1998 original. Resident Evil 2 is often considered the pinnacle of the franchise but even though it made a number of improvements to the series' gameplay it never managed to be a scary survival horror game. Out with the bad stuff and welcome to the new fancy featuresSo this time around Capcom has fused the best of old school and modern survival horror elements together into one amazing game that clearly stands as the best the series has to offer. The first thing you'll probably notice about the new Resident Evil 2 is that the gameplay has changed in favour for a middle ground of both immersion and improvement of character control. Many of the issues associated with the tanklike character movement are no longer the case and the fixed camera angles have been thrown out of the window for delivering an over the shoulder camera which brings the horror close up especially when the undead are are about to bite your neck. The gameplay isn't just the same old thing. A number of new twists have been added to Resident Evil 2 such as the defense items which add quite a bit of strategy to the game. Knowing when to use a defense item can often mean the difference between life and death and it adds a welcome layer of complexity to the game's combat.. At the game's outset you choose from one of two characters to play as everyones favourite first day on the job rookie policeman Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield's sister Claire each of whom has his or her own set of weaponry. For example Claire can use a grenade launcher that will either shoot acid or flame rounds towards your enemies while Leon can thin out the horde of enemies with a shotgun. Another addition to the gameplay is the enhanced A. I. of the Tyrant (T 103 Model) or better known as Mr. X . Unlike the original this time he can follow your almost anywhere even into the infamous R.P.D. main hall which used to be a safe area.A feast for everyoneWhen Capcom stated that even veterans have to relearn certain things like puzzles or item locations for the remake they weren t kidding. Enemies items and events have been switched around so that the game will seem completely changed to all but those who beat the original a number of times or have recently played it. Many of the high stress areas from the original game have been completely reworked which can create a real sense of suspense or relief such as when the Licker you're expecting to appear in a certain corridor doesn't actually show up. While some of the puzzles are new and others have been slightly altered many have not. You'll still be collecting a multitude of keys plugs and all other sorts of junk while trying to make sense of where they might be used in the environment. This amounts to a great deal of backtracking throughout the game and there will also be many times when you'll be moving forward into new territory only to realize that you need to return to an item box to get the item you need to move forward. By now you've likely realized that Resident Evil 2 is one fine looking game but screenshots and video clips can't begin to do the game justice. Capcom has finally perfected the art of utilizing their proprietary RE Engine and the result is the most visually impressive video game ever released. The attention to detail is exceptional. Of particular note is the gore it is by far the most graphically realistic gore ever included in a game. Blood will gush from bodies and somehow realistically splatter and when large amounts of the red stuff hit your character you re soaked in that red liquid. Taking off a zombie's head with the shotgun rewards you with an explosion of particle effects that simply has to be seen to be appreciated. Despite all this the game's graphics do have a few shortcomings such as in the some weird reflections on shiny materials or 16 9 cutscenes which require a fix via modding. But this is just nitpicking an otherwise unmatched visual experience.Voice acting was a noticeably weak aspect of the original version of Resident Evil 2 but with with the new voice actors this is no longer the case. This time the voice acting is one of the best parts of the game and that praise isn t only limited to Nick Apostolides and Stephanie Panisello voice performances this praise applies to the entire ensemble of the voice actors in this game.TL DR With two playable main characters four (slightly) different scenarios almost a dozen different tofu survivors a 4th survivor mode and an upcoming free DLC including Robert Kendo Katherine Warren and an unknown soldier the game also offers you plenty to do. With the exception of some unrealistic constraints e. g. you can t shoot locks and knobs to open a wooden door Capcom has nearly perfected its craft and created the best Resident Evil ever.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

Not only does it look gorgeous but it's extremely well optimized as well. Max settings and I still have yet to dip below 100 fps.

2019-02-08,0,0,24,False,Recommended,To be honest Capcom did a great job on this remake. It's not some HD remastered thing. And instead of making it same as RE2 1998 it got some new puzzle and riddle. So it is useless if you know all the playthrough of RE2 1998. And ammo and resource are low so even if you can aim better and move faster than '98 this game is balanced.But if you ask me if this game is perfect I'd say those boss fight are little bit easy and the plot between Claire and Leon are less than RE2 '98. But after all this game worth to buy and worth to play. Hopefully Capcom will remake RE3 too I wanna meet Nemesis in modern days.At last Mr.X gon' give it to ya.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-31,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Resident Evil is a series that passed me by when I was a kid and the series was at its peak. I played one of the early games back in the day but never finished it because I struggled with the controls and camera. I decided to try out Resident Evil 2 because I saw a playthrough on YouTube and I m glad I did.The game has received a massive Graphical overhaul and although it stays true to the original game there is a whole new section and monster to deal with whilst the tension and atmosphere feel fresh. I ve never played a game with such a sense of hopelessness before as my resources dwindle.You can play through RE2 with either Leon or Claire and whilst both playthroughs will take place in the same setting there are differences to each. It s well worth playing through both possibly multiple times. Zombies are very well done in RE2 as are the rest of the monster roster with varying degrees of difficulty and ways of bringing them down. The quiet moments of the game get your heart pounding as you edge your way through the darkness. The narrative is well done and whilst it maintains some of the cheesiness of the originals it feels very up to date in this remake.RE2 look stunning. The dark areas are proper dark and the map is filled with detail. The animations are fluid and believable and the map in general just feels believable. The puzzles are meaningful and the added stress of worrying about the resident ghoulies really sees you making some funny errors even in the simplest of tasks. The 3rd person camera feels great and the character models nicely detailed. Performance wise RE2 never put a foot wrong.Playthrough on the normal difficulty took me between 7 and 8 hours for each character and I definitely see replay value as I am sure I ll be playing through again. Capcom show here how a remake should be done and I hope they give some of their other games similar treatment.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-09,0,0,19,False,Recommended,Resident Evil 2 is not only one of (if the the) best remakes of a classic that I've ever played it's one of the best playing games I've dug into in a long time. I was thrilled to come to the RE2 remake after playing so much of the original on PS1. I will say that it's not a shot for shot re release of the original but I think everything that has changed has been great.I hadn't played an RE game since possibly RE4 or so but this game feels like everything I was looking for in a new survival horror game. Every single gameplay element has been thoughtfully designed with a lot of strategy in mind but also immersive gameplay. The amount of cinematic experiences you get from not having ammo in a certain part and have to make a big risk to get somewhere make for some great stories to share with friends.I think one of the biggest changes with a certain villain chasing you around more frequently than expected make for a more interesting gameplay experience. Hiding in a room and hearing a THUMP THUMP THUMP down the hall pressures you into trying to figure out the best paths to take and best ways to avoid danger. I don't think that change really gets in the way of major puzzle solving and shows up just enough to scare the daylights out of you to great effect.The graphics and performance are phenomenal. There's so many options for tuning that the game should run on just about any system and it looks amazing. I haven't played a game in a long time that cut seamlessly to a cutscene and everything looked like a pre rendered movie. It was jaw dropping a lot of the time.If you're a die hard fan of the original you're going to absolutely love this game. The great thing about this RE2 though is that you can enjoy it just as much even if you've never touched a game in the series previously.Really can't recommend this one enough!,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-31,0,0,29,False,Recommended,"Awesome remake of an awesome game brought almost perfectly to 2019. My only complain is more ""after the fact"" and in no way (for me at least) big enough of a reason to not buy the game so it will be in spoilers. Unlike the original game where you played with one character first and then saw the point of view of the other character the first run affected the second. For example you could use an item to close the window shutters on a hallway on your first run and if you did that zombies wouldnt burst through the windows in that run but they would on your second run. Some damage to areas from the first run were visible on the second run or rooms that needed you to do certain things on both runs to be accesible on the second one.Here both runs are independent almost to a story breaking degree because you pick up almost the same items from mostly the same place on both stories except some key items. Some situations happen exactly the same or characters die in both scenarios in different ways or you kill the same enemy in the same form in both scenarios while in the original you fought in one scenario one form and in the other scenario the next mutation and so on.I would like to see this problem fix but realistically it wont since it would mean almost remaking the second run/scenario. Still absolutly recomended to buy even if you havent played the original or any other game in the franchise since the story is suficiently contained as to not miss much.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

It was simply an amazing experience and i highly recommend this game for anyone to play. No doubt there are already so many positive reviews of this game out there so i don't need to say much more.Ps. I recommend you play this game on hardcore. Treat this like you would Dark Souls.

2019-02-09,0,0,48,False,Recommended,Best Resident Evil yet? Pretty much. Resident Evil 2 (2019) is a remake of that much beloved original RE2 and in this case it improves pretty much every aspect from the astounding almost photo realistic graphics to the immersive atmosphere and sound design to the methodical combat and to the rafters production values. This screams polish and the love for the game and story is obvious. There's none of the terrible voice acting but the odd cheezy line are nice callbacks. Zombies are no longer basic fodder but a true and dangerous threat from the start of the game to the nail biting finish. RE2 is survival horror perfected for a new generation of desensitized gamers and the previous generation of nostalgic STARS members who are ready to see what they remember as awesome being blown out of the water by this work of interactive horror. Are there flaws? In some parts the oppressive darkness of the environments (which is probably intended) could have been slightly less for convenience's sake. The seeming immortal basic zombies can frustrate after you pour a dozen headshots into one and it still comes at you but that is once again probably intended and something you'll eventually accept.Not for the squeamish as it surely rivals Mortal Kombat with the gore and blood. But if you like survival horror this is the real deal. If you love the Resident Evil series you've already bought this. Capcom you did right this time. Now where's Resident Evil 3 Remake? 10 of 10.

2019-02-10,0,0,11,False,Recommended,11/10 for this remake soooo glad they didn't do what they did with re1 remake.You can basically shoot your way through the game just remember head shots only and you can on easy maybe you can also on medium difficulty mode (cant remember what its called in game).Its the same game just every area is expanded with a twist I love re2 but it would of been boring and pointless if they kept it the same with updated graphics.Over all I really do like it so far its a nice change for how new games have been coming out lately broken and unplayable.Pros and cons timeMake mod / customization mode games are made to have fun make it easier for us to have fun like fallout 4 did..Knife/ bayonet dose decent damage now sorta but they do break but you find more so its is what it is.Why head shots don't do more damage? Make them do more damage and find less ammo? Not the end of the world.Id wish I seen a shove or kick zombies out of the way feature maybe a curb stomp when you knock them down?Counter attacks A+ given if you have the items on you.Adding gun powder to make ammo very nice makes getting ammo for whatever gun easier.The cut scenes with Clair in them hahaha wtf the faces she makes for how shes rendered in the game its funny for how bad she looks.The auto discard of items would be nice to have again.Adding a +1 to guns that are mag fed would but a nice thing to see also.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

I dont know how well it does compared to the original but I strongly recommend this game for anyone slightly interessted in Resident Evil and or those (like me) who allways wanted to play through a horror game in full and never accomplished it.There seem to be 2 Stories in the game 1st Leons Story and 2nd Claires Story.

I was sceptical as to whether Capcom could pull of a remake of RE2 that felt both fresh but also didn't change too much of what made the original great. But boy did they do it with this! I think this may even be better than the original RE2 which I can't believe I am saying. It is genuinely terrifying. Being stalked by Mr X is what nightmares are made of. The zombies that shuffle around in the dark and lunge for you when you least expect it and not to mention the visually pleasing combat system which literally sees the zombies bodies fall to pieces in front of your very eyes when you unload bullets into them.Dialogue is also much improved and it also has a great deal of replayability to it.

A major nostlagia trip for anyone who owned a Playstation in the 90's as well as a fantastic introduction to new players to one of the oldest and greatest gaming franchises around. It's got tension in all the right places. Scares that are just things jumping out at you but a building anxiety as you hear groans and creaks around every corner that could be a zombie or just the environment and you keep checking your ammo count in your incredibly diminutive inventory when suddenly Mr. X shows up and starts stalking after you like the Terminator and OH MY GOD PLEASE LET ME LIVE!Yeah.

(actually 2 one as Leon and one as Claire where you can play a third version as a slightly different outcoming) I have yet to play the second storyline (Claire) so I have to find out yet what this brings. And for the third story I must be honest that I don't feel thrilled about it to play it since it only differs a bit from the original one.Overal I should give this game a 8/10 rating for the fun I had.I defenitly recommend this game but keep the short story in mind when buying.

2019-02-09,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Great game scary and immersive. This came to me by surprise so I wanted to write a review to offer a serious word to the wise CONSERVE YOUR AMMO. I got pretty decently far into the game and completely ran out dry because I was too careless it became unplayable and impossible to continue forcing me to start over. I've heard of players running out of ammo on the last boss fight too making it so they cannot beat the game.Zombies usually take A LOT of hits in the head to fully be killed so try your absolute best to run past them/avoid them when you get the opportunity. Otherwise try not to miss and obviously aim for the head. They also will get back up 90% of the time even when you think they're dead so be on your toes.

2019-02-09,0,0,10,False,Recommended,"Hey Capcom I don't often take the time to post reviews but this game warrants one. You guys knocked it out of the park with this remake. This is exactly what we older gamers had hoped for and were afraid you might fall short of. It appears our fears were unfounded. Well Done. It is obvious that your team took great pains to stay true to the source material and bring it into the 21st century. RE2 Remake evokes the same fear and excitement as the original and it runs just beautifully! Thank you for all of the options to tweak graphical quality and game performance. Having these options means that I can easily recommend the game to people with all kinds of PCs knowing that they can fine tune their experience to an enjoyable point even if their computer isn't the newest/strongest/most expensive. This is a point that a lot of Triple A PC Game Developers forget about and I applaud you for it. If you remember playing the original 20 years ago you will not be disappointed in this version.If you never had the chance to experience Resident Evil 2 before I highly recommend you play this version. Though I did not pay $60 for my copy (I got the game for $45 pre release) I do agree that it's a fair price. The negatives I'm a little bit incensed that I have to buy DLC to hear the original announcer say ""RESIDENT EVIL.......TWOoooo"" on the splash screen. But in this day of rampant microtransactions designed to leech money from the consumer baked into nearly every new Triple A game I can let this one point slide. At some point I'll buy it just to experience that nostalgia But not today. Final verdict 10/10",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

It makes my hair stand hearing zombies growls and Lickers snarls echoing in the hallways.Second Tough Zombies. Just when you thought they're down for the count as you pass by them they'll grab your feet upward to bite your neck. That gets me a lot jumping off my chair. You don't need to put them down permanently.Third Agile Lickers. RE 2 Remake Lickers are the most terrifying Lickers I have ever faced. RE OPRC and RE 5 Lickers are nothing compared to this Lickers.Fourth Tyrant or Mr. X. He will find you where ever you are in the police station. That adds up to the horror when you hear his stomping getting louder and louder.Fifth Item Management. Your storage is really limited.

2019-02-09,0,0,15,False,Recommended,I can not get over how I absolutely love this game. It combines the resource scarcity of Resident Evil 7 with the gameplay of Resident Evil 4 and the horror of what makes a great Resident Evil game. In other words this game is a masterclass of Resident Evil which I never thought I'd ever get to experience after something as amazing as Resident Evil 4 was made. It's like hearing that a Star Wars sequel was actual better than the originals. The only complaint I have is that the way you have to solve puzzles is a bit confusing at first because I didn't realize that you have to read every piece of paper you find in order to progress (whereas I'm used to them containing optional expositional information).If you want a great review I highly recommend AngryJoe's Youtube review I can't sum it up any better than that,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

If you played original resident evil 2 before you know you need to solve puzzle in the monster crowded police station. I'm struggle for the ammo shortage in the first run but it's not very difficult if you know the position of items and dangerous enemies. The only drawback is that the 2nd game play is kind of tedious. Finishing Leon/Claire story lines is good enough. The only thing different is the position of important items and puzzles.

2019-02-08,0,0,16,False,Recommended,An incredible update to a classic survival horror game. I typically go into new games in a loved series very skeptically (especially remakes) but this game genuinely surprised me. I was worried they would dumb it down or change too much for the worse but they didn't do any of that. I honestly think this game is on par with the first game's REmake it just got so much right.If you're upset that it's not fixed camera angles and tank controls you're sorely missing out. It only benefits from all the updates it makes to the original game and the control style is enjoyable without ruining the atmosphere. Also don't worry it's not a goofy action game like RE5 or RE6 was the tension and horror of the original Resident Evil 2 is there alive and kicking and amplified by the huge leap in graphical quality.The difficulties available in the game range from easy to hardcore mode (which classic players will enjoy) making it perfect for new or old fans of the series.If nothing else will convince you just know Mr. X in the original game was annoying... Mr. X in this game will make you your pants.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-08,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Honestly I have never played a Resident Evil game before this one and Resident Evil 7. I have always heard high praise from the Resident Evil games before 5 and 6 which I could not understand because I had never played them. But from game standards this game is a 10/10 for me. The pure nostalgia I felt when i entered the police station was beautiful. The fact that I feel anything like that while still not having played the original is wonderous to me and amazing that they could pull it off. Graphics wise this game is fantastic I've never seen something like the RE Engine and It should be the standard graphics of all video games in the future. Gameplay wise I was immersed as . I have seen so many people complaining about how hard the game is from the few amount of resources at your disposal the strength of the zombies and how long it takes to kill them and to Mr. X chasing you every 10 seconds and to those arguments I say shut the up. All of those arguments point out how perfect and amazing this game really is. Why would anyone want a laid back no fun survival horror game where you could steam roll through the whole game with no challenges. Challenges are what make you strive to beat the game in the first place and they make you feel all the more accomplished when you finally beat the game or get an achievement or beat your record time or get an S+ ranking on one of your runs. All of these accomplishments in the game just really feel... great. I personally never have the feeling of wanting to 100% a video game because either the game doesn't have that lasting effect I need or the games achievements and goals are too plain and have no sort of unlockable item or addition to the game if you do them. But Resident Evil 2 has some of the best goal driven gameplay I have ever played. This had been the only game I have ever wanted to 100% in my life and I will strive to do that until I complete this task. Overall this might be the best game I have ever bought on Steam ever. 10/10 Would Recommend,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

I like the fact that there's no pointers making use of your map critical. I just finished Leon's side of the story and I was very satisfied with it. I can't wait to experience Claire's side. I haven't been excited about a game for too long probably since S.O.M.A. This game reminds me that you don't need a game that does everything for the gamer. I particularly like to be challenged in a game specially in this horror survival genre and this title achieves that.I highly recommend this title.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-10,0,0,21,False,Recommended,I don't buy games before release anymore but this is one of few games I would throw money at the second I could. It blends the old Resident Evil with the new flawlessly to recreate what older survival horror captured while maintaining it's own identity. Runs fine too on my Frankenstein PC no real issues I've seen since launch. Sometimes I drop frames but it's only when I'm moving faster than the game can load or there's a lot of going on in one space.The RE Engine has never looked better. There is plenty of attention to detail if you look for it. Most of the zombies feel unique and present a real threat on top of classic enemies making a return. Mr X is one scary Lickers will literally rip you a new one if you don't deal with them etc.It's only short comings I can think of is that after you do everything there's not much left to keep your attention. Capcom however is releasing DLC for the game and it's all free. FREE. Who doesn't like free things? ...Also Claire's model looks kinda' and she comes as off dumb and ignorant about everything....Also I don't remember Leon having a butt chin. What's up with that?In short I'd recommend everyone (fan or not) to pick this up even if they're not into horror games. It does a little bit of everything without being master of none.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

From jumpscares from not wanting to die.Decent replay value with 2 (technically 4) main different stories. I'd say the first story takes about 6 8 hours but subsequent playthroughs can be shortened down to 3 5 (due to familiarity of the game and reduced spook factor). A few extra game modes that'll tide you over for an extra few hours. So 10 14 (16 24 if you play all 4 stories) on average.Just a great game.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

The game doesn't give you much of anything so you have to be really careful how you manage your inventory.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-01-28,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Survival Horror RebornWhen I heard that Resident Evil 2 was getting a remake of sorts I could genuinely say I was excited. Resident Evil 7 brought back everything that made Resident Evil well Resident Evil. Skrimping by on supplies and managing your inventory was definately what made the game so challenging in its hay day. And now here we are with the remake and what can I say that everyone hasn't said already? Nothing. So lets get into the nitty gritty.A Beautifully Grim ApocolypseLike Resident Evil 7 Resident Evil 2 takes advantage of the RE Engine a powerhouse that delivers a truly gourgeous retelling of enviroments and set pieces from the original and it doesn't stop just there. Character models Props Weapons and Monsters are all modeled with incredible detail from blood sticking to your clothes through to how you can individually tear chunks of flesh from zombies. The more open outside segments do deliver with great lighting effects and reflections from rain and street lights and textures on the police station are crisp and highly detailed. A Hero and Heroine RisesLike the original you can take on the roles of Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield two survivors caught in the middle of a zombie outbreak. Both characters have a unique personality and of course a unique playthrough that varies greatly between their weapons and key characters they meet from Sherry Birkin and Ada Wong. They aren't silent either both characters will exclaim their current prediciment and even display pained emotions when injured. A Looming ThreatAs in the original you will encounter familiar enemies and key monsters and one in particular will literally keep you on your toes. The Tyrant T 00 (Mr. X) returns but this time around he's a little different. The Tyrant is a continuous threat that looms over you throughout certain parts of the game and conventional means prove to be useless against him so your best course of action is to simply run since shooting him with even your more powerful weapons prove to just put him out of commission momentarily only for him to come back in full force.My Criticism's and Addressing OthersIf you're expecting to come into this game with the mind set that it will be easy you're surely wrong. Yes. This game is difficult even on the Standard difficulty setting which to me isn't much of an issue. But I do find mild irritation with some things. Yes this is a survival game and yes you're expected to manage your resources since spending ammo to kill certain enemies is pointless and more often then not you can just run past enemies without wasting a single bullet. But sometimes you're going to have to pop a shot off on some enemies and in the original zombies weren't all that difficult to take down especially with a shotgun. Sometimes in the original you could just stand still aim high with a shotgun and blow a zombies head clean off without any fuss. In the remake however the zombies are far more resiliant to even basic gunfire and unlike how in the original a few shots from your pistol could take down the most weakest of opponents in this game zombies can soak up rounds better than Hannibal Buress. Why does 6 critical shots to the head simply stun the zombie? Why does a point range shotgun blast to the face do diddly squat? I understand that the devs wanted the player to simply immobilize zombies so you can more easily traverse the station but even that feels pointless. A new feature to the game which I do find useful is the addition of barricades but even when a window has been barricaded you will always return to that area with a handful of zombies still wandering about. With how much I enjoy the return of The Tyrant he becomes more of a nuisnace then a threat. Yes. I still shake in my chair when I hear his thunderous footsteps but after that I get a mix of fear and frustration since trying to ourtun him only leads you into more danger forcing you to rush certain tasks which again I understand for the sake of keeping suspense at an all time high.Some people have complained about the difficulty. And to that I say play assisted mode then. It pretty much holds your hand and raises your chances of survival. And if its still too hard? Then go back to Fortnite and Minecraft. My Vinal VerdictEven with the antiquated controls and mild nuisances Resident Evil 2 is effectively reborn. It has plenty of new twists for seasoned players and is very friendly to new comers and with that in mind it casts a bright light showing that 2019 is off to a great start and that survival horror is still very much alive.My Score 8.5/10,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-12,0,0,10,False,Recommended,I'll admit at first I was skeptical as well anyone would be when a company decides to remake one of their classics. However everything about this game is flawless. Capcom set the bar for what a remake should be so high every remake from now on will be measured against this game. The magic of the original was perfectly captured while modernizing it. It's like this is what they wanted the original game to be all along. There are people who will complain about Mr.X being too hard or the game being unfair do not listen to them. This isn't Call of Duty this is Resident Evil. It is Survival Horror you are supposed to always be low on supplies and it comes down to management and skill.Exploring the environment is as much of a puzzle as the actual puzzles do you clear this hallway or do you leave the enemies alive? If I kill this enemy will it alert Mr. X? Everything in this game needs to be taken in to account and your moves must be calculated. It requires as much bold strategy as it does careful maneuvering.Once you get the hang of the controls and have a decent grasp on the map subsequent runs will come easier on both A and B scenarios. I'd suggest writing down answers to puzzles and combinations to lockers and safes as they are different on A and B runs.Resident Evil 2 is exactly what a remake should be it is a phenomenal game that everyone should play.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-12,0,0,17,False,Recommended,"Probably the best ""from the ground up"" remake I have ever played. Whether you're an old fan or new to the series you'll love this game. The graphics are amazing &amp the controls feel right. The game took me about 15 hours to complete both Leon and Claire's first run but there are second runs for each character that vary quite a bit from the first as well. If anyone is wondering if this game is actually scary or not don't worry because it truly is (I'd compare it to RE7 in terms of scariness). If I had to put a number on it I'd give it a 9/10.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-12,0,0,30,False,Recommended,Unlike the Resident Evil 1 and 0 Remaster Resident Evil 2 is so completely remade from scratch it might as well be a whole new entry to the franchise. It feels like the natural evolution the series would have gone in had it not veered off its survival horror roots.As much as I loved the original 1998 game and wanted a remaster of it in the same manner of Resident Evil 1 and 0 I cannot deny that this remake is an incredible achievement and have thoroughly changed my mind.

2019-02-12,0,0,16,False,Recommended,"Holy hot damn is it good. For me RE2 REmake sets the franchise right back on track. Now where do i sign up for the RE3 Nemesis treatment?I had my doubts when this remake on Resident Evil 2 was first announced. Would Capcom be able to capture the spirit of the good ol' original? RE2 is a fanfavorite (rightly so even though I prefer RE3 myself) and even the slightest deviation from the original could mean swarms of angry fans with torches and pitchforks. Was RE2 really the best choice for a remake? Why didnt they cast the original voice actors?! Will a 3rd person camera do justice that what RE2 did back then? Will it still have partner zapping or will capcom just settle for a co op campaign and call it a day? So i had my doubts but it's finally here and i'm glad to say that it was well worth the wait. The previously released RE7 (yes confusing for newcomers i admit) was really good at times (The mansion! The greenhouse!) but it could get pretty bland at times too (SAW traps boring caves etc). So RE7 was a step in the right direction and the engine behind the game had loads of potential. Now RE2 grabs that promising engine and handles that missed potential way better!! Instead of the rather slow introduction SAW elements and lineair caves from RE7 RE2 brings back a true Resident Evil game making it an engaging game from start to finish. When playing RE2 remake these were just a few thoughts I had ""But I shouldn't waste the little supplies i have... Which routes should i take to evade them and what are the best angles?""""I should save that Flashgrenade for later""""Is it fight or flight?""""What?? Hold on a minute lemme check the map""""I see i'll probably need this item later then""""Dont mind me Mr zombie just keep doing whatever you were doing ok? To me you're invisible enough ok? hahaah? (awkwardly looks both ways then continues the attempt to creep/dodge)""""Gotta check out that room. But i'm not sure how or if it's even worth the risk""""Uuhhhmm that sound... Is that what i think it is...?! Now i can't see it right away but THAT sounds like BIG TROUBLE"". The game is very tense and in all the right ways. So in my opnion this is how a great (horror) game is done!!***This review will be updated as I myself only completed Leon's story first now which took me like 15 hours. But there's more good stuff waiting in the 2nd half of the story in which you play as Claire's perspective. You can also begin the story as Claire and finish the second half with Leon so that brings the game to a total of 4 playthroughs. And then you can play on higher difficulty too so theres plenty to go around of you ask me!!!",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

As a huge fan of the original Resident Evil games playing them with friends huddled in front of whichever console during a sleepover I have to say that this is the game truest to those roots to be released post RE4. It still feels fresh for being a remake not relying too much on your nostalgia but still a remake all the same. This is the Resident Evil game I've been waiting for since playing the first few and the game I've been hoping for since playing the REmake back on GameCube. I'm hoping they can keep this going and we can all forget about punching boulders.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
2019-02-04,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Not without it's faults but still an amazing experience. My biggest nitpicks Scenario's A &amp B were too similar if you've played the original you know what I mean. You don't even meet Mr. X until Scenario B in the original. Which just made everything much more different and interesting. This one felt repetitive though I've still played through both Scenarios several times.They cut out many of Leon and Claire's interactions with each other (Ex Walkie Talkie scenes Meeting at S.T.A.R.S office Claire asking Leon about Sherry Leon having to pick up Sherry towards the end and more!). Who else thought those scenes were pretty important to the development of the main characters? In the end it felt like they actually grew together and bonded through their ordeal. The remake not so much.Mr.X was actually pretty fun and made for some tense moments.The part with The giant Alligator seemed rushed.Last but not least the lack of music. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I got the Soundtrack Swap DLC and it's been a game changer. Everything just feels so right it's the only way to play the remake. If you've already beaten the game several times and want to try something new look up the 1st person mod. It's great Capcom should have made this an extra mode after beating the game on S or something. Also I wish they would have included an Extreme Battle mode like in the Ps1 Dual Shock version which is similar to Mercenaries or Raid mode from the other RE games. Would have given this game even more replay value. Maybe they could make that a future DLC? I'd buy it. Luckily I hear we're getting a Free DLC soon....By the way Great job by Capcom optimizing this game. Runs pretty decent on my 7 year old laptop without having to lower everything.

2019-02-12,0,0,45,False,Recommended,Ok so This is how a remake is suposed to be done.I did not play original RE2 but I was couch watching my cousin play it.Why is this a great model for remake?First + Grafics that are nobrainer that is what makes a remake/remaster in the first place.Second + a Frigin proper setting screen. You dont offten see a performance load meter or so many relevant options with actual examples and that should be in every game that is not 2D or pixel art style. Third + they mixed up enemy locations and item locations at least a fair bit. Also they added some more stuff so that is what gives a remake a value.Fourth + playability and other features that have to be in a very good game done.The only two minuses that I found and had are.First glitchfesting speedrunners. Simply I do not consider a glitch skip or something similar as a speedrun cause lot of reasons but this is preferential. Srsly skipping half of game thru invisible gliding is just bull****.Second Hitbox bugs no so offten seen but they are half responsible for glitchrunners and some anoying sytuations that happen only 1 in 100 times in regular run.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-12,0,0,55,False,Recommended,"9/10This RE2 remake is the proof that remakes/reboots can be amazing when done right. This shows that Capcom despite still messing up here and there throughout the years is still listening to their fans and willing to fix their past mistakes by creating content that people actually want.RE2 feels as welcoming to new players as it also feels refreshing to fans from the original games.Rather than continue to go down the path of games like RE6 this game goes back to the origins of the Resident Evil games gruesome disturbing horror. There are no cover mechanics no dodge abilities and no melee combat other than attacking with a knife. You rely entirely on aiming and running except this time using a third person view instead of the classic ""tank controls"" which not only allows the player to get a closer look at the disturbing enemies coming their way but also to aim where they want to aim (rather than a fixed up/center/down aim from the original game).The game looks and feels amazing a whole new look at the classic scenarios like the police station the sewers and the laboratory with nothing held back in terms of gore and violence. The game still feels like the classic game as it maintains many of the original items and even the layout for some of the places but also making some very necessary changes by either adding things that were needed or removing things that weren't. The layout of the police station is slightly different but a lot of it is still like the original. As an example Claire's crossbow was removed since it was an awful weapon to use in the original game being replaced with the SMG (which is no longer a special weapon) and the grenade launcher now only uses incendiary and acid rounds with no ""normal rounds"" anymore. Weapon upgrades can be found for almost every weapon in the game instead of only for Leon's arsenal. Puzzles were reworked to feel less annoying and troublesome while still offering some challenge and the inventory while still quite limited can now be upgraded by finding hip pouches.One interesting detail the game adds is that there are no more ""safe doors"" as enemies will chase the character through doors. Mr. X also shows up in both scenarios further increase how tense the game feels as he'll be relentlessly chasing the character until they manage to run away or temporarily stun him with headshots. He remains present through a good portion of the game and can be heard patrolling around requiring caution in order to avoid the areas he's patrolling.Difficulty levels are quite balanced Normal offers a decent challenge without feeling overwhelming Easy has enemies somewhat weakened and offers aim assist and Hardcore is pretty much a harder version of the original game the game can only be saved by using ink ribbons plus enemies are harder. In addition there are also less hip pouches to be found and some of the health/ammo items are replaced with ink ribbons.There is also a good number of unlockables. 4th Survivor is unlocked by beating both scenarios while Tofu Survivor is unlocked by beating 4th Survivor. There are also 5 infinite weapons that can be unlocked by achieving certain rankings in certain difficulties as well. S rank now only requires the game to be beaten under a certain time limit (according to difficulty and scenario) while S+ rank requires that plus a maximum number of 3 saves and no use of infinite weapons.My only problem with the game is that scenarios A and B don't really feel that different. While in the classic game it felt like they were both two stories happening at the same time with different puzzles and bosses involved this time it feels like the only difference is the first part of the game (navigating through the police station). After that everything feels pretty much the same. Both scenarios will have the same encounters and the same bosses. If we're considering that scenario A and scenario B are two stories that are happening at the same time as Leon and Claire go their own ways it makes no sense to consider that they're going through (mostly) the same events and fighting the same bosses.Still however this is very much an incredible remake that I easily recommend even at full price. Plus there is also free DLC coming up in the future as well.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-02-06,0,0,76,False,Recommended,"+ Tense fun gameplay+ Excellent graphics audio+ Solid performance on PC+/ Very streamlined A/B scenarios are lacking compared to the original Missing scenes files and content from the original New sections suck Not enough musicWhen it comes to combat graphics animation and voice acting it's a great reimagining of RE2 that's been heavily updated for a modern audience. It's still largely the same game there are zombies and mutated creatures to dodge and defeat puzzles to be solved items to be found and combined to then be used in earlier areas. The adaptive difficulty of the action RE games (4/5/6) is present though it feels unnecessary (punishing good aim and stockpiling rewarding the opposite) the ""zapping system"" (A/B scenarios) got ruined and there are some minor flaws but it's still a lot of fun.Ways that the game feels streamlined (perhaps too much for some purists decide for yourself) Like RE1's remake the map shows rooms as blue when there's no reason to keep searching them and red when there are items or anything that still needs to be interacted with in them Going near items marks them on the map Going near something an item can be used on marks it on the map removing the need to think about what to do next when points of interest can just be scanned on the map Like RE1's remake defense items can be used if they're equipped and an enemy grabs the player from the front keeping the player safe from damage whilst hurting or stunning enemies Inventory space can be upgraded to 20 slots allowing the player to carry multiple firearms ammo types defense items healing items and progression items Autosaves prevent much progress from being lost and make manual saves unnecessary most of the time there's less tension and more room for taking risks Manual saves don't require Ink Ribbons except on Hardcore difficulty which also has no autosavesEntering a new area is always tense in all the right ways and the locations lighting enemy design and controls all feel very polished but for fans of the original the most obvious issue it has as a remake is that the A/B scenarios have been watered down leaving all four possible scenarios' game progression and puzzles largely the same and producing unnecessary inconsistencies within the story despite the developers saying before release that their focus was on telling one more coherent story.In the original version whichever character gets picked first is used in the ""A"" scenario afterwards the other character gets a ""B"" scenario producing four different playthroughs (Leon A/Claire B and Claire A/Leon B) all with varying puzzles areas and story. There are choices made in the first scenario that affect the second such as picking between the Side Pack or Machine Gun in one will leave the unpicked item in the other not blowing up a certain boss will lead to it being a boss in B burning vines in one area will prevent them from appearing in B a gas can be used to make enemies weaker but it will make an enemy in B poisonous and lots more. None of these design choices are in the remake.The remake's scenarios are dumbed down with B runs simply having a slightly different route through the first part of the Police Station and slightly different solutions to the same puzzles. The route through Leon A and B is about 90% the same as it is for Claire A and B and the only differences between Leon and Claire's routes are very minor (relating to Leon's interactions with Ada and Claire's with Sherry). Puzzles are the same across all scenarios and solutions in Claire A and Leon A are the same just as solutions in Claire B and Leon B are the same. The Tyrant (Mr. X) is now in both scenarios instead of just B and no longer drops anything so there's not much reason to fight him. A more consistent story may have been a worthy trade off for the developer simplifying things but all four scenarios share so much now they end up contradicting each other more than before especially around the third boss where things stop making sense.In a relyonhorror interview shortly before release RE2 remake producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi said ""We have a Leon campaign and a Claire campaign they re separate and you can choose which one you want to play first. We did simplify it a bit and make it more elegant by eliminating the A/B distinction and sort of meshing together what happens to the character s A and B scenarios into one story. I think players today they want these sort of deep/intense experiences with the story and by stretching it across 4 scenarios the story gets spread a little thin and create a sense of repetition by going through the game multiple times to see everything. So for that reason we went with two campaigns that still show all the events of each character s story rather than have it all split up.""It looks like they changed their minds and rushed the A/B runs in because now the remake has them and they're much more poorly thought out and lacking in replay value than the original.There's not much variety in any of the bosses and without spoiling anything you'll be pretty used to how they thrash about by the end of the first scenario. One boss from the original is relegated to one of those silly RE6 style sequences where you have to run towards the camera and avoid one hit game overs. Both scenarios have four bosses three of which the same and the B scenario gets a fifth boss (which in all fairness should not really be considered a boss). The bosses exclusive to Leon and Claire in the remake were not exclusive in the original.The scene introducing the Tyrant is gone and now there's nothing to explain anything about it. The scene that explains the helicopter crash very early in the game is gone so now it seems to have just crashed randomly. Leon and Claire can no longer meet in the multiple locations in the R.P.D. nor can Leon happen across Sherry like he could in Leon B. There are some missing enemy types (Giant Spiders Super Lickers Giant Moth...). The Bow Gun is missing which is a shame as it's somewhat of a signature weapon for Claire in RE2 and Code Veronica. Unlockable costumes are now paid DLC. Extreme Battle mode is gone. Individually these things don't seem much but all together and with the way the A/B scenarios are handled the remake starts to feel lacking.The remake changed Ada and Sherry's sections and tried to make some original contributions to the story but these happen to be the worst sections of the game. They're very limited in gameplay they both have one screw up and it's game over sections and Ada has this terribly out of place hacking gun that can magically turn anything on or off and redirect power wherever she wants.Cutscenes are very well directed. Some of the dialogue and files could have done with another pass. A lot of details from files in the original are missing. The 'Letter from Best Friend' that Claire starts with is a perfect example of how to write exposition very badly. Chief Irons' taxidermy log reads a bit juvenile for the sake of trying to make an already gross character seem more vulgar. Leon and Claire swear during encounters with enemies which is fine initially but on repeat playthroughs it starts to feel unnecessary. Voice acting is good but the music is ambient to a fault and it feels like most of the game is devoid of it.Performance is very good in my experience though there are minor graphical issues they don't spoil the experience.My first playthrough was thorough and at the results screen my times were 4h40m as Claire and 3h10m as Leon though some players may take double that time. Repeat playthroughs don't pass the 2 hour mark (without cutscenes).It's not a perfect remake like the one the first RE got but it's nice to see the series return to its roots again.",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2019-01-30,0,0,22,False,Recommended,I've only completed Leon's Campaign so far but I've heard enough about the others to give my opinion about this game. UPDATE FOR February 2nd 2018. I've completed Jill's 2nd run and my review still stands Overall this is the best RE game in my opinion. It has good aiming and controls like the actiony RE games it has the overall design philosophy and presentation of RE7 that makes it feel like a true modern survival horror game and brought some improvements similar to the first REmake and it's built in a way that makes it feel like the developers loved and respected the original game. I think the pros are obvious here but now I'm going to list the few cons.Narrative Annette Birkin apparently has two different death scenes in a single A/B run. Not sure what happened here.Also the way the different scenarios are structured feel more character exclusive than scenario exclusive like in the original. For example Claire's ''A'' story is the same as her ''B'' story. The same holds true for Leon there are slight differences but they're not as substantial as the original. Also the only differences in gameplay between the A and B scenarios ( for any character) is that the RPD is remixed a bit and the endings play out differently. I ultimately understand this issue since I'm pretty sure it requires more time and resources to produce 4 unique plotlines compared to the 5th generation but it's still a bit dissapointing. The game itself is still very well designed and we're getting free DLC that reveals some side stories so I guess that's where the energy is being put.Visual The Screen spaced reflections as they are now present too many artifacts this should be resolved in a future patch.Altogether this is still an excellent remake and return to form for the series. It's probably my GOTY.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2

2018-02-15,5,163,496,True,Recommended,"I love card games of all types. I grew up playing traditional card games like Crazy Eights Solitaire and Uno. I later got into Bridge Rummy and Poker until Magic the Gathering (MtG) consumed my life for years.These days though its hard to find people to play traditional card games anymore and Magic the Gathering and other CCG's are way too expensive to keep up to date with.A few years ago I discovered physical deck building games like Dominion Thunderstone Race for the Galaxy and many more. I had a ton of fun playing these but again it is hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so I turned to the PC. Several of these games have pretty good PC versions but they are still restricted by the fact that they are based on physical games. There are often clunky mechanics that really slow things down. That's fine when playing with friends at home but over the Internet or alone against an AI it tends to get old pretty fast.There have been quite a few digital card games recent years that are great but most of them are based on card collecting and those can rival even Magic the Gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cards.Then come Slay the Spire A game it took me weeks of hearing people talk about before I finally gave it a chance. This little weird looking card game has somehow managed to tap into so many things I love about card games and video games that when people ask me about it I struggle to even say anything about it because there is so much I want to say.Drawing your cards The reason I love card games today as much as I did as a kid is for the simple feeling you get when you are dealt your cards you pick them up and see if you have a good hand. That rush of excitement at the possibilities of what your hand has for you never gets old its why I got so heavily into Magic the Gathering since apposed to games like Bridge or Rummy you get to draw new cards constantly. This is also true for deck builders and even more so with Slay the Spire than many others since you play your hand fast and don't have to worry about building your deck while you're playing it. This brings me to my second point...Building the deck Slay the Spire has done a genius move by taking the deck building aspects of a deck builder away from the action of playing. So when I am in a ""fight"" I don't have to think for 2 minutes about which card to get like you have to do in Dominion style games. After a fight is over you are rewarded with a selection of new cards and only then do you have to make decisions about what card to pick. And that choice is always informed by how the last battle went so you know what your deck is missing before you pick your new card. I really love building my deck as I play with it its how I used to tinker with my MtG decks back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building games appealed so much to me. Slay the Spire has the incremental building of a deck builder but without the constant ""stop and think"" style of play which slow those games down. This makes the pacing of the game much more interesting. You have an action phase followed by a thinking phase. Rather than jumbling them both into each other.Playing the cards All this would be for naught had the game not been fun to play. Thankfully the cards are interesting and have a ton of cool interactions with each other. There are many different types of decks you can build and they can often change and adapt as you play if you find that one rare card or relic you can build a whole deck around. This makes the game extremely re playable more so than any other deck builder I've played. While games like Dominion and Thunderstone have a lot of different card combinations for you to play I simply find myself enjoying what I can do in Slay the Spire more. It also plays very fast it flows a bit like Heartstone in that sense unless you have very complicated deck combinations which requires some forethought or specific play orders.Best of both worlds Since Slay the Spire is a digital card game rather than a physical one it is not restricted to the ""laws"" that govern how a regular card game plays. This means they can do a lot of stuff that simply isn't possible or takes too long for physical games. Each fight is against one or several monsters who before your turn indicate what they are going to do over their heads which usually is either attack block or apply some buff/debuff. This means what you do on your turn is informed by that. If the monster attacks you block if it blocks or buffs itself you attack. Having this kind of AI interaction in a physical game could be possible but would require a lot of dice rolling or boring set up between rounds. As you play the game more you start to learn how the different monsters work and develop strategies for each of them making each game a little easier than the previous. Its not just your deck that's getting better its your ability to play it as well.The game also has a lot of statuses such as buffs and debuffs kind of like how MtG works which is one of the reasons why MtG can take forever to play but with the game being digital all this is taken care of in the background. The digital version of Magic the Gathering handles these things for you as well but since its rooted in a physical game it is a lot slower and more cumbersome than Slay the Spire.Just one more turn... I am also a huge turn based strategy fan Civilization being my favorite game of the genre. That genre has the ability to captivate me in a way that makes me just play on and on one more turn at a time even though I know I should have stopped hours ago. Slay the Spire does the same thing for me. Each game of Slay the Spire consists of 3 floors with multiple encounters with a boss at the end of each floor if you die or win you get some experience points towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run. It plays similarly to a Rogue Like in that way a genre that I've always been fascinated by but never got very deep into but Slay the Spire got its hooks into me very hard. It took me quite the force of will to say ""No"" to another game so I could take the time to write this review. I can't wait until its over so I can try out the latest patch. Which reminds me...Early Access The elephant in the room in my opinion is the fact that the game is in Early Access. That to me is always a HUGE red flag. There are a few games though such as Factorio Rim World Subnautica Prison Architect Oxygen Not Included and others that actually listen to their community provide regular updates and already have a game that is worth playing as it is. Slay the Spire in my opinion joins the rank of these great games without question. The technical aspects of the game is top notch it plays smoothly there's a ton of content and it has received multiple significant updates over the few weeks I've played it. With a clearly defined Roadmap that promise more content in a game I feel already has enough content to justify its price 5 times over. I have no doubt that the game will be finished and even if development stopped today I would be more than satisfied with my purchase.Finishing thoughts This is a game I am going to be playing for years to come and while it already has enough content to justify that today I can imagine limitless possibilities for it in the future. More game modes such as infinite restricted cards special relics or modifiers new cards more monsters new characters etc. I feel like this game has managed to do one of those things that you don't really see all that often. It has taken the best from many different genres combined it in a new way and created something greater than the sum of its parts.I think Slay the Spire is a game we will be talking about for years to come as a genre defining game. It has my full recommendation!",Slay the Spire

2018-11-22,0,0,109,True,Recommended,Slay the Spire has provided an unbelievable amount of entertainment. Even though it's in Early Access it's easy to lose hundreds of hours playing it. Modding can expand that number significantly as well.The game is a run based deck building rogue lite. You select from one of three classes that begin with a starting deck of 10 12 cards. As you progress through the map you choose which rooms to visit attempting to climb up 50 floors to reach the final act. Each room can contain shops events combats or campfires where you can choose to rest and restore HP or upgrade a card. Winning a combat will give you three cards to choose from to add to your deck (or you can skip the rewards) and elite enemies will also provide a relic which offer a variety of passive bonuses.The mechanics are simple to learn but provide immense depth and strategic possibilities both in combat and deck building. The devs have been responsive and communicative with updates and patches being delivered regularly. Overall the game is tremendously fun and highly recommended.,Slay the Spire

2018-11-21,0,0,47,True,Recommended,I've played a deck builder or two (or just Hearthstone) in my time but never managed to get invested in exploring the possibilities presented until Slay the Spire. It's certainly a game you can run through without extensive thought or knowledge of the potentialities but there's quite a bit of fun to be found along with extensive but shortlived frustration in developing your knowledge and building for a particular skew or making decisions that turn out to be far more synergized with your deck than you had previously believed.Though you are likely to lose more runs than you probably will be happy with due to stage layout or draw RNG there are so many moments where satisfaction abounds in this game and the developers are both open eared and responsive to the community which is more than anyone could reasonably ask for.,Slay the Spire

This hasn't happened to me since I was a little kid so I felt the game deserved an early review. Fun and addictive turn based rogue lite featuring turnbased card combat as it's main gameplay mechanic. Fair RNG Multiple characters with their own cards and playstyles a real solid difficulty curve that rewards strategy and punishes carelessness. Though it is in early access and more content is always appreciated the core gameplay loop is complete and very entertaining. A quick browse shows the developers update the game on a weekly basis and seem fairly responsive to community concerns and ideas. Definitely recommend investing into the game before it leaves early access and it's price increases. It is still rough around some edges with some interface graphic bugs occassionally and one run ending bug that prevented selection with both the left mouse button and my controller but that has only happened once so far. Restarting my game fixed it for me but some report you might need a system restart. Controller support could use SteamAPI intergration if you are like me you will need to fiddle with your Pro controller in the game setting and get used to wrong Xbox positioned icons being displayed for your face buttons. The developers seem aware of the issues and hassles and are looking into it.,Slay the Spire
2018-03-19,16,186,298,True,Recommended,I don't have a lot of time for gaming anymore and with around 1000 games in my library I've never even played I'm trying to cut back on buying new ones. So when a friend told me I had to play this one I was skeptical. I do love card games and strategy but I also have a lot of burnout from poor Early Access experiences and since my maternity leave is over and now I have to ugh make money AND look after a baby absolutely no spare time for gaming. So I surprised myself when I realized that three days after launching this I'd managed to clock up 15 hours. That pile of paperwork next to me the unfinished laundry and my mums messages asking if I'm okay because she hasn't heard from me for a few days may be related in some way but you can't prove anything! I was so tired last night I beat the final boss with the Ironclad for the first time sent a screenshot to the friend who bullied me into playing the game (essential step) turned my PC off walked to bed and fell asleep to dream of deck building.Despite my friend having played double my hours and generally being vastly superior at games to me his playstyle choices have been vastly different. He prefers Silent the poison character whereas I prefer Ironclad the strength deck. He'd never used the style of deck I used to get my first win (barricade massive armor stacking dual wield into body slam) and I played with quite a few different deck types before settling on my winning synergy. Even though there are not a massive array of cards there is a significant amount of choice and strategy in your play coupled with constant adjustments needing to be made as you pick up relics and rewards.With over 9 000 reviews (no I mean literally that's not a meme) and overwhelmingly positive you don't need someone slow to this bandwagon to describe the mechanics of the game. What I will say is this is a fun roguelike deck building card game that is simple to grasp hard to master and incredibly addictive. I'd love to say it can be played in short bursts when you have 30 minutes here and there but only if you've levelled your willpower to max and can walk away from the PC.Highly recommended from me even in Early Access with hopefully even more content to come.

The game mechanics themselves are fairly simple but the depth of the card pool and the verying other features such as the different characters the wide range of relics and the dungeon layout differing with each playthrough makes for a lot of replayability.

2018-06-13,0,0,19,True,Recommended,TL DR Sum up Slay the Spire has players fighting with cards through a semi randomly generated dungeon and build their character and deck with random drops. Slay the Spire has players struggling screaming raging then asking for more because that s how fun Slay the Spire is. Based on challenging and enjoyable mechanics which palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing its formula is meant for challenge seekers to which I recommend it even at its current price. Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelike/lites might want to wait for a discount.

Combats are fought by carefully picking cards which will trigger various offensive defensive and strategic effects. Along the way players will build their character thanks to random card gold and bonus drops in hope of finally reaching the top and eventually restart from the bottom and/or compete in a daily run event. Three different playable characters are available each with their own set of cards and unique gameplay. The strength of the title is undoubtedly its combat and deck building mechanics where players will have to improvise and make sweet sweet lemonade of of runs that sometimes feel like the ultimate lemon storm card and bonuses drops obtained after clearing a floor are random and if a build will certainly evolve throughout a given run how it will evolve is down to luck and very strategic choices. There is something to be said about a heavy reliance on RNG. The game can at times feel frustratingly random in its difficulty (I almost beat it during my first run then struggled for the next 8 hours). That said card games are random by nature and this formula is meant to appeal to players who enjoy facing strong and uncertain odds. To somewhat balance this built in unfairness though the developers have implemented a forced flush mechanic where unplayed cards automatically go to a flush pile after ending a turn. This system helps knowing what card will come next and allows nice little tricks such as digging in the flush pile for that one card that might very well change the issue of the battle. If the combat and gameplay of Slay the Spire are a lot of fun some other aspects could benefit from a lot more polish. The art is sometimes painful to watch (bonfire screens in particular need a lot more work) and I personally found the music and sound effect lacking impact. Too standard and repetitive to be immersive no dynamic soundtrack very few sound effects for the variety of cards provided and generally forgettable themes I do play on mute. That said the game still being in early access there is still hope for improvement and in any case the art doesn t matter that much once a combat has started. Technically the only real downside of the game is its animations. With no variety whatsoever they are also slow enough (even on their fastest setting) to account for a good 30% of a turn s time depending on how fast players take their decisions. With nothing to justify this length and no skip option they increase the duration of single runs and decrease the fun/time ratio. Added to the general boredom of the first 2 or 3 fights and a title that could be much more nervous currently suffers for an unequal pace that can become uncomfortable. VerdictSlay the Spire is based on challenging and enjoyable mechanics which palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing. Its fresh appealing formula is meant for challenge seekers to which I recommend it even at its current price. Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelike/lites might want to wait for a discount.,Slay the Spire

The battles feel fun and slightly chaotic (especially when you get good and turn on fast mode) the ""?"" room encounters are fun well written and sometimes create genuine dilemmas in your head about the best way to proceed. Amassing a trove of relics is great fun too and of course helps to shape a different run every single time. Slay the Spire is an A+ and an absolute steal at what they're selling it for. Good on ya Mega Crit.",Slay the Spire
2018-11-19,0,0,33,True,Recommended,Extremely intuitive game there is almost no learning curve beyond simply learning what some card keywords mean but you will be able to understand nearly all mechanics of the game within one or two attempts. I've found Slay the Spire to be fun while both try harding to reach ever higher levels and while creating meme decks to kill your enemies in ridiculous ways with. Its endless replayability and depth make it well worth its cost and it isn't even fully finished yet. Don't let the fact that it's in early access fool you though the elements that are included are fairly polished and the devs are constantly in communication with the players getting feedback and improving the game while simultaneously adding in new content to mix up the game.,Slay the Spire

2018-04-14,4,46,142,True,Recommended,I bought this game 5 days ago and have played it for 50 hours. I don't even know how that's possible. All I know is this game is a steal at the current price. Do you like the board Game Dominion? Do you like card games or Rogue like random generation games that are quite difficult? Then you'll probably love this. Even well into playing this game I was constantly surprised by the different deck options and combos open to me not once did a run feel stale or bland. Checking my stats I was surprised to find I've only finished this game 11 times I thought It was way more than that. If that ratio of beating the game sounds depressing to you and you like to win a lot this may be the one factor dissuading you from purchasing. But the mechanics are so addictive everything is so smooth that for me the journey is fun enough. This may be the best early access title I have every played. I can't believe it is still a work in progress as the game right now is really polished with more classes updates and card tweaks happening every week. Very much recommended!,Slay the Spire

2018-11-05,0,0,117,True,Recommended,This game's value kind of sneaks up on you after a few (probably failed) run throughs. It's not an easy game and it doesn't tell you the best combos or deck building strategies so some practice is required. But after doing this awhile you can see the depth. I have to admit there's a lot of fun to be had when you've managed to put together a very strong deck and you can just blaze through floors in the spire. And every run is different so simply knowing what the best strategy is will not be enough for each situation.I hope they add more characters. The three are each interesting and unique and more characters will open this game up even more.,Slay the Spire

2018-11-22,0,0,185,True,Recommended,"Slay the Spire is an amazing piece of work. Emphasis on ""work"" because it has been forged reforged and polished to a mirror shine via weekly updates and beta testing throughout its Early Access run. For myself I enjoy playing a run or two every few days. There's no harm in taking breaks unlike many games there's no penalty for putting it down for a while.Slay the Spire stands as an excellent deckbuilder that encourages you to change your strategy through its myriad of ways to earn lose and upgrade cards. It gives a consistent yet variable setup that is easy to understand but will take time to understand and master. The base layer of the game consists of picking one of the three characters the Attack focused Ironclad the Skill based Silent and the Power pushing Defect. All three characters have different archetypes and can earn a few character specific relics. All three have very strong options for climbing the Spire and can use a multitude of strategies to defeat each floor. It's difficult to find a consensus about which character is ""overpowered"" as each character appeals to a different playstyle.Though it is a single player game there are Daily Climbs that let you fight your way up the spire with three special modifiers rotating out every 24 hours where you share the same seed and run with every other player. These modifiers are also available through Custom runs which allows even more variation.",Slay the Spire

2018-11-23,0,0,237,True,Recommended,"I've greatly enjoyed my time with Slay the Spire even though I'm not usually a big fan of the deck building genre. The mechanics are easy to pick up yet full of depth so you are always rethinking and evolving your stategies. The gameplay is fast and you rarely need to stop and crunch numbers keeping things moving.One of the best features is the daily challenge where a random set of modifications to the default rules are applied leading to a run that rarely plays out like a typical one preventing things from feeling stale. As well difficulty scaling via the ""Ascention"" system makes sure that the game is as challenging as you are able to handle.The developers seem to be great with updates and bug fixes released weekly though I've not encountered many (if any) bugs myself.Pros Great artwork / production values Runs great / Bug free Quick to learn Depth of strategy Difficulty scales well to your abilityCons Sometimes fast mode isn't fast enough and you are left waiting quite a while for an action to complete I often need to restart steam for the daily leaderboards to work properly",Slay the Spire

Anyways this game is fantastic! If you're a fan of Hearthstone and enjoy the Dungeon run feature this game is perfect for you! I'm sure fans of deck building games in general though will throughly enjoy this.Currently there are only 2 playable classes in the game but with the random relics cards and other events you'll happen upon almost every play through will be different. There are plenty of fun combos and deck builds that you will discover but probably not be able to replecate on your next few runs which is great as you'll find one you like even better!TLDR If you like Hearthstones dungeon run or any deck building game do yourself a favor and get this right now!,Slay the Spire

2018-11-22,0,0,117,True,Recommended,Slay the Spire is simply the best at what it does. If you like deck builders roguelikes or high risk strategy games then this might be the perfect game for you.Slay the Spire is a deckbuilding game where your card choices are random each game and incredibly important to winning. You are given a choice of 3 heroes (which determine your abilities and cards available) at the beginning of a run and you use your deck to fight battles. The map is randomized and you get a choice in what path you take through the Spire. Will you risk an Elite battle to get a relic or will you rest to assure you can survive the final boss? You choose cards as you go and eventually make a deck that wins a run or loses on the way.The choices go deep and even 90 hours in I'm discovering new deck combinations that do and don't work. The endgame has great content that constantly forces you to re learn what you know about the game and try new things. On top of this every day there's a custom run for a leaderboard as well as customizable runs.It's worth noting that the devs are very involved in the game. It's keeps things fresh but is occasionally confusing. If you boot up without reading patchnotes you may find that something you used to use has been changed. New room types and cards can get added. It's always in the best interest of the game but this is still an Early Access title. That said these devs are super adament about weekly patches and adding in things as they go. It's a blast to keep current with and the changes are never huge or unfair to a specific style of play.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes deckbuilders or roguelikes. It keeps you on your toes but isn't hard to learn or get good at. It's just about the perfect singleplayer card game.,Slay the Spire

2018-11-23,0,0,42,True,Recommended,I was always interested in playing card games but I hate everything about building decks ...In Slay the Spire you start with a really basic deck and then all along your game session you will to decide which game you add or remove from you deck one by one.Based on rogue like mechanics every game is completely different.The game seems updated regularly and is well balancedI recommand it !,Slay the Spire

2018-12-02,0,0,34,True,Recommended,I beg the developers to rework tiny house as one of the boss relic. I honestly rather get a relic named spit from the developers that does nothing than this trash called tiny house cause at least I will feel accomplished when finishing a run with that relic. Tiny house does nothing... ing nothing. No upgrading a strike and a getting a common card does not count as a thing It loses u hard in act 2 and your whole run.Please Please Please get this out of the game T_T,Slay the Spire
2018-12-02,0,0,83,True,Recommended,So I don't normally buy into early access titles so much anymore but I had this game on my radar thanks to northernlion. I've watched hundreds of his Isaac videos and noticed that he had been playing Slay the Spire and talking about it. I came to the conclusion that it must be good. I watched his first episode then bought it for myself. I love this game. So far I have not found anything I dislike about it and I look forward to seeing how this will evolve over the early access period.,Slay the Spire

2018-05-17,0,0,192,True,Recommended,I intially purchased this game with no prior knowledge of the genre and based solely on the positivity of the other reviews you've probably already seen. It's safe to say they don't lie and that this game is pretty damn good. It offers a good but fair challenge tons of replayability and most importantly it feels super rewarding to finally succeed. When I brought this game I had no idea I'd still be coming back to it even with all the other choices I have to play.,Slay the Spire
2018-12-03,0,0,167,True,Recommended,Massively replayable and tons of fun. It was well worth the money when it first launched in early access even if no updates ever came and now it has tons more content. You are not expected to win every game you will lose many runs as its very challenging. I feel like I am just starting to understand some deeper strategy at 157 hours played.,Slay the Spire
2018-12-04,0,0,80,True,Recommended,This is a very very well designed game. It's challenging and satisfying and can provide many many hours of entertainment. If you're like me this is 100% worth the price. The game feels finished enough to me to make me wonder why it's even still listed as 'early access.' My only complaint is that syncing saves seems a bit inconsistent across computers but I haven't tested that in a while so it could be better now.,Slay the Spire

2018-12-02,0,0,76,True,Recommended,Good casual card game. Like Darkest Dungeon but with cards. It even has a very similar vibe and feel. It's pretty complex too. You need to spend quite some time learning the cards and how to mix and match them to make your deck great and overall powerful no matter what enemy you are going to face next. And there are 3 characters who are very different one from another so you'll gonna need to triple your learning time to be able to play all of them correctly to their strengths.Slay the Spire has a perfect length for a run usually 40 60 minutes 3 acts (4th act is very small with a few fights). And 20 difficulty levels. That's what made me play this game non stop for more than a week before I beat the Ascension level 20 with the Ironclad. It was super fun at the start but once you get to ascension level 15+ the game becomes more about how lucky you are to get the right cards and relics in act 1. If you are not so lucky you will probably die in latter half of first act and have to try once again. I needed about 13 15 runs on average to complete Ascension levels 18 20. it wasn't fun and challenging at the same time but more like a grind. The balance is really off on those difficulty levels. Most cards are pretty bad or mediocre at best. And if you don't get lucky the end.I think that this game lacks variety in enemies. You always gonna face the same enemies on act 1 on each playthrough the same on act 2 and so on. With the same HP with the same compositions with mostly the same attack patterns. After a while everything becomes very mechanical. it really doesn't matter which path you choose because of the way this game works. Once you start a run everything is already predetermined. It has 4 starting different paths most of the time but every single first enemy on each path will be the same every second also. The same can be said about question marks chests and elite reward drops. So no matter what you choose you will probably end up with a very similar result when you reach an act boss. That's pretty sad tbh.I needed 65h to complete the game on all Ascension levels with 1 character. I bet it would take me another 120+ hours to do the same with other 2. That's a lot of rinse and repeat if you want to be a completionist. But the minute I did actually complete Ascension Level 20 I just lost all the desire to do so with other characters. I don't know. The drive is just no there anymore. Maybe It's just a burnout on my end or maybe because I already know everything and experienced everything so many times. Hmmm.Still a good game with a handful of flaws and issues here and there.,Slay the Spire

2018-11-23,0,0,105,True,Recommended,Slay the Spire is an example of Early Access done right. The gameplay is simple yet always keeps me wanting to play more. Every playthrough between the 3 characters keeps the game fresh. One game I can be a block stacking Ironclad and the next run get a shiv stacking Silent. The developers do very well with determining balance of cards and relics and even some fights to ensure the game doesn't feel too easy or too hard when it comes to certain situations.,Slay the Spire

In fact between the variety of possible Characters Cards Relics monsters events maps elites and bosses you'll never have the exact same game twice.

2018-11-21,0,0,884,True,Recommended,"I'll preface by saying I was skeptical when I first bought this as I don't even like most card games but StS has eaten a lot of my time and I don't regret it at all. Onto the review Solid deckbuilding gameplay with enough challenge for more hardcore cardgame players thanks to its ""ascension"" system and at its base difficulty it is casual enough for the average person to play and enjoy the story they unveil piece by piece as they climb the Spire.With 75 cards for each character in additon to an entire pool of neutral cards and harmful curses coupled with a diverse pool of relics the gameplay is very diverse and your strategies will need to be flexible.On top of that the art style is distinct and memorable and its developers have week after week consistently released bug fixes patches and new content for their fanbase to enjoy.The place where the game falls flat for now is its animation and soundtracks the soundtracks are cool but not diverse enough after you've heard them all the animations are for the most part pretty basic. There have been a lot of new ones added recently though and they've been pretty darn solid.Highly recommended",Slay the Spire

2018-12-27,0,0,73,True,Recommended,Can't stop playing please send help. In fact I can't even stop playing long enough to finish this reviIn all seriousness though this is an amazing genre defining game. There's a reason so many others have tried to rip this game off already. It's damn near perfect for what it is. If you've ever played the dungeon run mode in hearthstone it's slightly similar to that but with much added depth in terms of the 'Relics' you acquire which effect your cards and actions in various ways. The assembling of sets of relics is not unlike the binding of issac's combinations. Admittedly one of the classes the silent is a bit RNG focused with it being difficult to assemble winning combos but on the whole the games' RNG is acceptible which for a game like this is absolutely critical. Rarely will you ever feel too unfairly treated.I highly recommend this game to fans of card games and roguelikes both.,Slay the Spire

The three characters play in different ways that get you to think differently about deck building.

2017-12-10,0,0,185,True,Recommended,I'll start of by saying I'm very considerate when spending money on games (most of my library games were gifted from a good friend and from in game currency trough trading).I have DayZ and that was a lesson to never trust Early Acess games but after I saw some good reviews I decided to take a chance with this game and hey worst case scenary I'll get a refund.I haven't played much but the time that I played flew.The game can be picked up left mid dungeon and picked back up again which really helps it.The RNG is there (it's a card game so it's unavoidable) but all my losses never felt random I either made mistakes when choosing cards or in combat itself.The two characters are distinct enough and the looming prospect of more to come is amazing (Mega Crit Games PLEASE DON'T ADD MICROTRANSACTIONS BY THE WAY).Super polished and really well done for an Early Acess Game good luck with this devs.I currently have 2.3 hours played but I'm pretty sure it'll skyrocket soon probably my favourite game purchase this year really recommend the game. EDIT Played for more than a few hours now and it's still a blast every time I play it devs constantly and free of charge update the game with comunity feedback absolutly great devs.I'd be more than willing to pay for DLC from these devs the game is worth more than it's being sold for.Nominated for game of the year!,Slay the Spire

If you like the idea of Hearthstone's Dungeon Run but wanted more customization over your gameplay path this will be right up your alley.Edit 11/23350 hours later there is only one game I can select for my game of the year and it is Slay The Spire. With three very different characters to choose from 20 modifiers to the difficulty to unlock and struggle through and a fourth concluding act to take your super powerful deck and turn it into a pile of garbage Slay The Spire is an excellent rogue like experience. One round often takes 30 min 1 hour which is the bite size appeal I like for my schedule these days.,Slay the Spire
2018-11-21,0,0,66,True,Recommended,Product received for free. A truly great game worth checking out. Its been updated regularly with interesting content enhancing an already stellar game jam packed with content. The game feels fairly well balanced and the daily missions allow for some added chaos to spice up the average run. Its also a pretty lightweight game that most computers could probably run without too many issues. Only small gripe is the bosses can be pretty brutal if you dont have good combos but it gets easier to know whats good or bad for the current run as time goes on. Overall an excellent game thats worth full price if you like strategy or card games and a definite buy if on sale.,Slay the Spire

2018-03-03,0,0,174,True,Not Recommended,"*UPDATEST*The continuous additon of content has reduced reliability and made the game far more play by flowchart than a ""draft card game"" you will not succeed unless you follow the flowchart.Further they have released a patch which has made a large amount of random content non random and it has been in this state for over a week so it seems like they've lost track of their own process.*UPDATER*I gave this game a specific trial based on a 14 day of playing the game doing only dailies for evaluation. While I still feel like this game is largely more of a great base framework with a lot of ""potential"" as a game (and I wont recommend something on what it could be) 14/14 dailies have been at wost ""not that bad"" and many of them have been thoroughly enjoyable.On this point I believe that this game is at the very least a wonderful lunch break game and even in that worth the money.I have varying opinions on the rest of the content in the game but I've encountered no obvious bugs crashes or other issues so it is a heavily polished Early Acccess title and you can get your money out of it without ever touching anything but dailies so I do feel comfortable in recommending it at this point. Left in here for posterity *UPDATE*After putting more time into the game I'm actually giving it a more hard non recommend.While the game has a lot of the potentials of a good roguelike the RNG elements of the game are far too heavy in a lot of the arenas. Fairness mentioned below is recanted. As you progress up the difficulty ladder you will be fundamentally discouraged from experimentation in any fashion and encouraged to play what amounts to ""winmore"" strategies at the lower difficulty levels.There's a really neat potential for discovering unique combinations of deck combinations and plays but the requirement for good luck and system mastery (read following prescripted deck archetypes and combinations) is an extreme detractor from elements of long term fun.This ultimately magnifies my complaints below as the more you try to challenge yourself in the game the less the game is willing to let you play it.*ORIGINAL*On the whole I would recommend the game. It's a great blend of roguelike and card game. However due to Steam having no nuanced review system this review must be negative because the positive recommendations amalgmate a percentage that is higher than it should be. People will comfortably select this purchase simply based on the suggested consensus.The part that makes me unwilling to go with the consensus is due to that almost all of the flaw of the game is packed into the first 1/3 of any given game. The potential of the game to produce certain combinations and actions of which produce the fun of the game do not generally begin happening any earlier than the first half of the first (of three) floors. Even if you succeed through the first floor that first half is frequently a non game because the decision making process is minimal assuming it exists at all. You will spend a large chunk of your game experience here during the learning curve and even then when hit with bad RNG. You can out play the game and get past such things it's not that the game is usually unfair about that but those actions are commonly an element of delaying until you can get something that works.You do get a little bit of a mixup at the beginning of most runs but it is just more RNG gamble that doesn't generally do much to change things.For a comparison that's probably almost cliche Binding of Isaac. Now it's not without flaw (nor without degeneration over each of the misguided expansions and booster packs) but each segment of the game offers the general promise of two items to improve your gameplay the item room and boss item. By analogy in this game there is no guarantee of items at any point from the first two items rooms and boss. They may eixst but they may also not.It's fully valid for a game to be designed with different foci in mind but to me the analogy isn't mere comparison The lack of immediate variation in a run kills the enjoyment of multiple runs of the game in succession. This wouldn't be a huge issue if it weren't for the fact that again that portion of the game is going to be a large portion of the experience.While each run of the spire is different in pathing the paths are not unique unto themselves such as a floor layout and the contents of the rooms in Binding of Isaac would be they amount more to the sequences of choices you intend to make. It's not a bad design decision but it all compounds to make the early game commonly feel like a waste of time where you pay for real world time with in game HP which leads to probablistic decrease in survival chance due to patience and real life being a thing.That rant aside and if you've gotten this far and especially if you're willing to deal with the above you're probably not going to regret the purchase. The game is early access so there are more than a few things yet to be added refined etc so there's still room for my complaints to be fixed and the rest of the experience to be refined.",Slay the Spire

This is a great game being developed by a small indie group of game devs who actually care what their community has to say (they took the time to directly respond to me because of my issues with Red Shell). If you ever enjoyed or wanted to try any of the versions of Harvest Moon or its like this game is a wonderful adaptation. It is still in early acess and already feels more polished than many big title games that are ""complete"". I have nothing but high hopes going forward and hope that the devs continue to care about their community and develop this amazing gem they have begun.**END EDIT**Game is a lot of fun and is a great game. However the Devs have chosen to include the spy ware ""RedShell"" with the game which tracks and stores all your online activity. The theory behind redshell is so that the dev can see whether you're googling their game but its tracking software and that is not okay.Devs please stop using redshell so I can continue to enjoy your great game that I was excited to purchase.

2018-12-19,16,370,162,True,Recommended,"This is an incredible game and the best Early Access game I've played since Grim Dawn. I'm 70 hours into this game and it feels like a complete product to me. There are 0 bugs thus far. It is well optimized. I played some Animal Crossing back in the day on Game Cube and while it had its charm it felt limited to me. It certainly didn't pull me in the way this game does. This game has so much to do and much more depth to it than I was expecting going into it. There is a social aspect with the folks around town that is a mini game in its own including play dates gifting and completing crafting assignments mini missions or mini games like exercising a pet pig. Reaching certain friendship levels unlocks bonuses like store discounts and gifted items. There is a lot of repetitive mining which I personally find relaxing but the redundancy is broken up by the search for relics in the mines. Relic pieces combine into relics which can be placed in your house or the museum (which at certain quantities of donations grants special perks as well). In addition to crafting items you can assemble larger items from crafted items. These are frequently used in story progression. You can raise chickens ducks cows and sheep. You can own and ride horses. You can expand your property size and upgrade buildings. You can furnish your home. You can grow crops and trees. There are special events on the calendar such as snowball fights fishing contests a Halloween type event land run races etc.There are prizes for running a successful workshop.You can have a cat and a dog pet that hang around your house.You can do dungeon crawling (necessary for some crafting) or slaughter rainbow llamas for fur and poop (to make fertilizer for the garden). The dungeons are challenging early but you out level the low level one pretty quickly so its easy to burn through them for materials. There is a higher level dungeon later on in the story.There are day/night cycles. At late night the townsfolk hang at the restaurant which has a few mini games you can do without eating up clock time (darts slots and balloon shooting). These give badges to trade for items. There is a haunted cave mini game as well on a small island.When you take out enough animals/enemies higher level versions spawn with special rewards.The story is good. The characters are good. The music is good. Controls are easy. Inventory space is plentiful at reasonable upgrade cost.If I am pressed to find flaws it would be that the clock goes so fast. You have to basically pick one thing per game day to do and spend the rest of the time managing your workshop. But that works out fine and a game day takes about 30 minutes of real life time which is nice for a short game session. It's also addictive though that its hard to only play one game day!The biggest negative would be the slowness of certain story progression missions. Some crafting materials are not as plentiful as others and when you need 60 of that material the game can drag a bit. I find ""mucus"" to be the most awful thing to farm. It drops off a small handful of creatures and only 1 at a time but it is needed in a number of important recipes. Most missions are not timed however so you get there when you get there. No big deal.Travel distances seem to be increasing but there are fast travel locations and the horse helps with that.Update At 115 hours now I've finished the story thus far and am looking forward to future story content. I discovered the Civil Corps office where you can set commissions for the NPCs to carry out for you and retrieve a variety of items for you such as the hard to obtain mucus I previously mentioned. I courted and married Emily who helps me around the workshop by taking care of the animals and crops. It adds a little more time to my clock each day. I've attained all buildings including the factory which I have mixed feelings about. Factory pros Reduces occupied land. Powered through one central battery that I easily filled for the next 120 game days. Significant numbers of slots instead of 1 slot per machine so production quantity is increased quite a bit. A 300 item storage space for the workshop to pull materials from.Factory cons The item storage isn't connected to the house meaning you have to store certain materials in the workshop others in the house. And you can't easily have say 250 iron bars in the workshop and the remainder in the house because the sort all buttons may carry things you didn't mean to put in that location. I found it best to keep all base materials in the workshop and all manufactured items in the house. But I still do need to split and manage where my bars are to keep up production of things like bronze pipes and steel sheets. It would be nice if it was all one shared item pool. No idea where materials are being allocated to. You can set up a dozen slots of iron bars a dozen slots of steel bars etc and it doesn't subtract those items from your inventory as you build the slots. So sometimes I would end up overreaching and end up with a bunch of slots that couldn't be completed because I ran out of iron or copper ore. There doesn't seem to be a need for so many slots. Even mining every day I can't fill every available slot and I probably only have 20/30 machines set up. I try to run multiple small quantity slots but still can't max out my slots. After the story is over there isn't really enough to do but collect materials and build relationships which at that point are not all that necessary. For materials I'm at 1500 glass 1000+ of each bar 400+ of each plate 350+ of each pipe 1500 charcoal etc. and nothing to do with them since I can only do one commission per game day and only 5 out of every 7 game days. That sounds like a complaint. I suppose it is when it really shouldn't be. The ability to get 115 hours out of a game in Early Access for $15 is incredible. The story is over (until the next update). That is the natural end for most games which are often far shorter and more expensive. It's only a complaint because I enjoyed the game so much that I want to play more! And while nothing stops me from logging in and mining which I'm sure I will do because it's a chill way to kill some time I do wish there were some goals to strive towards in a game that feels like it doesn't really have an end.",My Time At Portia
2018-05-07,3,189,121,True,Recommended,I am very rarely moved to write a review no matter how much I like a game. But this one definitely gets one from me.

2018-01-23,4,198,33,True,Recommended,"Guess I'll start off by saying I don't review many games but I feel like My Time At Portia deserves me taking the time to write one. Like in other reviews if you enjoy games like Stardew Valley Harvest Moon or Yonder type games you will definitely find enjoyment in My Time At Portia. Here are some of the Pros and Cons I have encountered in my first 10 hours.Pros For an early access game it is fairly free of bugs which is refreshing considering how EA games are released nowadays with many bugs and uses the crutch of ""EA"" to explain them. The few I have run in to were easily fixed by restarting my game and were nothing groundbreaking that made me lose time. Every aspect of the game is very well done. The crafting mining exploring building questing battling fishing ETC. all feel like someone took time to perfect them. Some times you may play games where one aspect of the game seems really good while other aspects seem lacking and usually you get a response like ""we are working on cleaning these things up and optimizing them in future patches"" again the EA crutch. MTAP has clearly taken the time to work on ALL aspects of the game making it very enjoyable. MTAP offers a more in depth take on the genre with things like the skill tree and leveling up system. It gives the game a bit more customization from playthrough to playthrough and player to player than say Stardew Valley does. I can easily see myself replaying through this game making different decisions each time. I love the little quirky things this game has to offer like the sparring mode and rock paper scissors. Its little things like this that happen out of the blue that make you think ""that was unexpected but I liked it!"" UPDATE Loving all of the things that are being fixed with patches like increased stack sizes etc. It really feels like the developers are listening to the community and making the changes needed to keep us happy! Cons Im not sure yet if the map is big enough. Seems like there are only a few zones to unlock. But with only 10 hours and not unlocking all of them to see how big they are or how much content each zone provides I can't say for sure this is a Con. For those who like to use controllers on these types of games like I do I found the sensitivity of the camera movement entirely too high. Even at the lowest setting if you just barely touch the joystick to move the camera it went crazy. This made using my controller not an option and went with the keyboard. Now if you don't use controllers then no problem but personally games like this I like to sit back and relax while playing making using a controller great! This is probably my biggest Con. (UPDATE Seems like they have fixed the camera sensetivity for controllers but I will say that using the controller for this isn't as fluid as say Stardew Valley but still nice that it seemed to get resolved quickly)Overall I would easily recommend this game for those who like this genre of games and those who aren't sure if they like this genre. Its fairly easy to figure out for beginners but also provides plenty of depth for those of us who have put many hours in to the genre. The game offers tons of content and plenty of replayability! I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for us in the future for My Time At Portia!",My Time At Portia
2019-01-18,13,673,66,False,Recommended,"In A Nutshell Pros + Charming post apocalyptic setting portrayed in a way making it lighthearted and mysterious at the same time.+ Immense quantity and variety of activities dungeon raids quests base building mining commerce lost technology recovery... and a lot more.+ Great art direction using colorful cartoon ish but also very detailed graphics to portray the world and characters.+ Decently written and quite interesting storyline and events unfolding.+ A successful blend of Management Sandbox and Open World Action RPG in equal parts offering exciting gameplay.+ Huge quantity of items to collect craft restore or win at events with cosmetics or home furniture giving meaningful gameplay bonuses.+ Well developed relationship system with NPCs leading to different interactions and content. Cons The game forces players to drop asleep at 3AM every in game day also teleporting them back at home when this happens. Very annoying while doing some activity. The sheer number of activities available can be overwhelming and disorienting for some players at first. Needs some getting used to.My Time At Portia (MTAP) is a sandbox game deserving capital ""S"" with an amazing quantity and quality of content. After covering the very basics a world of possibilities opens to players mining ancient ruins to gather minerals and technology accepting quests from citizens or the City to build infrastructure fighting monsters throughout the world and inside dungeons planting crops... there is just SO MUCH TO DO.Each of these activities has several ""tiers"" of complexity commissions will level up as you gather fame and respect as a builder (and citizen) of Portia becoming more rewarding but also complex. Dungeons feature several tiers containing harder better rewarding monsters while base building will need a lot of time and care in order to build an effective Workshop furnished with all the machines to face the most complex tasks without hiccups. Machines and appliances are often the result of intricate crafting more their level rises more complex this becomes. But is also the key of Portia's always fresh gameplay working towards an harder objective without making it frustrating.The Action RPG part of MTAP is surprisingly elaborate for the genre featuring multiple skill trees weapon and equipment stats character stats and even mechanics such as invincibility frames during dodge rolls and bosses with changing attack patterns when Hp is reduced inspired to the Souls genre but of course much more easy than that! Experience is gained from quests and activities such as resource gathering and combat and becomes exponentially longer to level up as character power increases.Overall MTAP is really an exemplar Open World Sandbox scoring high if not top marks in all fields from graphics to gameplay. For the proposed price considering the huge amount (and quality) of content it would be a CRIME not to get this game. In depth Feature Analysis Gameplay The gameplay of MTAP is divided into Base Management Quests Dungeon Raiding and Exploration. Base Management features completely free form placing of furniture machines and any other item to organize work as wanted. Materials deposited into storage chests are directly used without having to pick them up each time (except form items crafted at the Assembly Bench and specific base upgrades at shops in Portia) they are also organized in a handy global menu allowing players to select any chest from any other chest's location. These significant quality of life features a really clean interface make base management satisfying and not a chore. Upgrading of all facilities is available with the appropriate materials while Research Dungeons and Quests unlock more and more blueprints as the game progresses. Quests are given by NPCs global events such as festivals happenings or the City Hall board. Each quest rewards XP Reputation with that particular NPC or the City itself Gols (currency) and also sometimes unique blueprints items or other bonus content. Generally quests are about building something and delivering it to a specific location while other times are about exploring a certain part of the map or clearing a dungeon. Dungeon Raiding gives you three lives losing all HP results in a respawn at the start of the last dungeon floor but all enemies including bosses still have the damage inflicted to them. This makes clearing dungeon of par level decently easy. Clearing a dungeon results in great amounts of Lost Technology parts and aswell materials of many types. Each dungeon holds unique enemies and resources obtainable from it. Exploration of the game world is limited at first as many locations are inaccessible until specific quests have been completed or events happened. Even with this in mind the explorable part of the world right off the bat is large and there are many secret chests fishing spots monster spawns mineral veins to discover. Story Generally the main story is quite varied and interesting decently written. Secondary quests are aswell decently interesting portraying a wide variety of situations and shenanigans. NPCs are well characterized each with their own preferences when it comes to gifts actions and habits. Even if Story is not properly the strong suit of Sandbox titles Portia does a good job at it. Combat System Combat takes some inspiration from the Souls series but fear not it is much more forgiving than that featuring dodge rolls player stats such as critical chance DPS defense attack values and aswell skill trees to boost effectiveness. Weapons include melee ones but aswell pieces of Lost Technology later on such as firearms. Enemies are varied and each has unique attack patterns and effects. Unique rare monsters and bosses are several. Content &amp Pricing For a base price of 30 sporting a massive 50 60 hours for the main content ONLY while very well 100+ (a big +) for doing everything there is to do it's simply a bargain to good to refuse. Balance &amp Challenge Challenge in this type of game is not very high as standard but still some boss fights and dungeons can give a rough time if taken lightly. Balance is pretty decent with enemies of the same level being a fair challenge. Technical Analysis Graphics Magnificent colorful graphics simple in a certain fashion but also very detailed and cured. The art direction is simply great environments far reaching and inspiring weather effects design of models and choice of palettes is always top notch. Sometimes it seems to be playing a moving painting rather than a 3D game. And this is exactly what the developers wanted to convey. Sound Decent effects and soundtracks but sometimes especially in dungeons sounds seemed to disappear or not be played correctly but only in a few instances this happened. Performance &amp Stability Game runs flawlessly in 1440p at maxed settings. i7 4820K 16GB RAM GTX 1080 . Artificial Intelligence Enemy AI follows a pattern based and follow script typical of action RPGs. friendly NPC AI will make them follow a cycle of daily activities and participate events. Quality of Life Excellent features cutting out the annoying management parts leaving mostly the good ones. Bugs &amp Issues Nothing major to report.

What makes us get up every morning chop wood smash rocks build boxes and run screaming across the fields with a huge sword slaughtering every llama in sight?My Time At Portia. That s what. It would be easy to look at My Time At Portia as if it were another Harvest Moon style game. I mean you show up at a town because your grandpa died and left you the farm or whatever the backstory is you can grow crops chop wood annihilate llamas and build relationships with the townsfolk. Simple.But wait! Plot twist! I don t plant I ve got no crops. None. This is not a farming game. You can farm sure. But you don t have to. You can craft items for a living. You can fish.

Pros + Lots to do. Sometimes overwhelming.+ Cutesy graphics. I love the vibe this game brings.+ Plenty of places to explore. Secrets to find. + I like the combat aspect.

2018-01-25,1,79,34,True,Recommended,I'm a big fan of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley and when I saw a youtuber do a video on this game drawing the comparisons I knew I had to try it out. It's yet another fresh take on the RPG fantasty games that exist becoming something more of Rune Factory (a fantasty spin off of Harvest Moon) with a new focus on crafting over farming. Obviously farming is included but instead of inheriting a farm you inherit a workshop. You're striving to become the best having rival workshops in the are. Resources can be a chalange to find the methods to find them are interesting and challanging and it isn't easy. Which in itself is refreshing as being challanged is what I want in such games. You can mine fish fight cut tree's grow produce likely tend to animals and I feel like you're not locked into just doing the farming. If you wanted you could focus on one area more and do only main quest requests to unlock more of the map. Character creation was also a nice surprise given the style of the game seems so basic at first glance. But as I went through the options there was more sliders than expected allowing me to customise as I wanted. Though I look forward to potential more voices being added rather than the current one. The back story is also so different and appealing for the world and I want to learn more about what happened before the games setting. I want to befriend the people living in Portia and it's not a chore to talk to anybody as they are so varried with their views ages behaviours and daily routines. Sure being in fresh into early access means there are a few hiccups but since buying the game I've seen it update three times. I already feel like more content is being added daily small bugs are fixed and controls adjusted that I can't wait to see where this game goes. If you're a fan of RPG's Harvest Moon Stardew Valley or even Rune Factory I can see this game appealing to you greatly. It's well worth you're time even now as there's so much to do in this beautifully crafted world.Pros Variety of NPC'sChallanging In depth worldBeautiful stylistic graphicsA production team clearly behind this gameCons A few graphical issues (walking on water namely) Could do with high rewards for some of the more difficult requests (I get paid more to make storage boxes than I do making a whole bridge?),My Time At Portia
2018-08-27,0,0,133,True,Recommended,"After almost 100 in game hours I finally decided it's time to write a proper review.Let's start with seemingly unavoidable comparison to Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley offers a lot of activities but its main focus lies with farming. In My Time At Portia farming is really bare bones and the game is centered around crafting. While Stardew Valley feels like more polish and complete game My Time At Portia is way more ambitious project that is on the right track to be the best game in the genre.Great stuff NPCs. Pretty much all characters are great. They are unique both in design and personality they have different tastes preferences behaviors and routines. Not all of their lines are voiced yet and some characters have more related content than others (it is early access after all) but they make Portia feel alive. Interacting with NPCs. Talking giving gifts dating (not only romantically) playing doing quests marrying even cheating it's all there. And not only that. Sometimes NPCs take a little bit of initiative which is refreshing. And with new content on the way (NPCs asking you for date and ability to have babies) it looks like My Time At Portia is doing something that no other game was able to fully accomplish.Crafting system. I love it. The Assembly Station is really fun to work with. It's cool to see your invention partially done ).Help the city and help yourself. Main quests are mostly related to building/fixing things around Portia and finishing those will allow you to discover new places get new resources or... create fast travel system. Variety of activities. Crafting fishing mining cutting trees cooking hunting fighting going through dungeons farming taking care of your animals... Some are more fun than others but since it's early access hopefully it will change.Festivals. Unique fun and creative. I wish there were two per month. Neat character creator.Good leveling system. Although some perks are currently nearly useless. Responsive developers and regular updates with new content. Some criticism I don't agree with Rushing and grinding. I really don't see what's the issue. Every game in ""sorta farm life"" genre is grindy and as for the rush... For me this game has perfect pace because it's under your control. Most of main quests do not have time limit so you can focus on getting better equipment upgrading your house and machines gathering resources and generally getting more familiar with the game rather than pushing through every single objective as soon as possible. NPC quests usually do have time limit but with few dishonorable exceptions it's usually at least few days so enough to complete it.Bad stuff Some quests.So... you're telling me I have few days to distribute MEDICINE to people but only one day to find the owner of missing documents which I found around 10 P.M.? Okaaay... Cooking. Cooking is atrocious. I hate it. I only use it for character related quests never for my own benefit because it's just too frustrating and pretty much requires that you sit with open wikipedia which is a failure of game design. Frustrating boring and way too expensive to go with ""trial and error"" way (especially early in the game when some ingredients are either pricey or very rare).Farming. Using fertilizer is a nightmare. Crafting fertilizer is a nightmare since it requires mucus which is pretty rare and used by other more important recipes. Buying fertilizer is way too expensive. That renders fertilizer completely useless and without it the whole farming is basically plant the seed and wait.Worth mentioning There are also bugs but this is an early access game and there aren't that many so I don't think it's fair to make big deal about it (since there are plenty fully released games with much more problems). The optimization is not the best it runs fine on my PC but some players experienced performance issues. Developers acknowledged this though and are constantly working on improving this aspect. Conclusion.My Time At Portia is already an amazing game with huge potential dedicated community and responsive developers. I can fully recommend it in current state and can't wait to see how much this game will change until final release.",My Time At Portia
2019-01-27,2,65,107,False,Recommended,"This is by far the best Harvest Moon esqe game I've ever played. Now let me tell you about My Time At Portia it's set in a post apocalyptic world The world as we know it has ended technology has been lost and you're a new builder in town. A worn down shack has been left for you by your father who you haven't heard from in years. And thus your new life starts!Now it's more builder related than farmer related but you CAN have a farm. You can have crops and raise animals and horses etc but the main premise is you craft stuff that the town is needed. And as the story continues you help recover lost technology you BUILD lost technology you add features to the town and expand it beyond its mere excistance. Now that's the story but what makes this game so special? what makes it stand out?For me it's the small details that made me fall in love it has so many small features that I never even knew I really needed in a Harvest Moon lookalike game. (We need a name for these beyond simulators and crafting games).It's the fact I can decorate my house I can put up bookshelves and tables down. And actually put stuff in them! On them! You can place a plain table and almost anything can be placed on it. By clicking E when near furniture you open up their ""menus"" and you see how many slots they have. A table could have one or two or four depending on which one you're dealing with. And things that can't be placed on it from your inventory will be greyed out. I decorated my kitchen with food on the tables and a cauldron in the corner. It has a pretty extensive relationship system where you go from stranger to associate to buddy to friend to close friend to more. You have lovers and boyfriends/girlfriends and wives and husbands! And there is a real reason to nuture these relationships! Getting to certain relationships marks will unlock quests and cutscenes and some gives passives buffs. (like 50 more hp or 25% discount at their store). And there are multiple ways to level these up! If you don't care about this and only care about harvesting and crafting.. then what? what if you're the hermit that grumbles at people and don't want to socialize but make an apparence on town festivals? Well guess what.. Not only does most festivals give you +relations with everyone in town if you say... participate in a snowball fight with x members of town you'll get a boost for every one of those people. And as a builder you accept jobs and do delievers there is a board you can take them from. There are jobs from town people that will give relations to them + exp + gold and there are jobs for guild that gives larger amount of exp and gold but no reputaton. Now I cannot stress this enough.. this game has an actual story.AN. ACTUAL. STORY! This is new for me Stardew Valley which was my old big love didn't feature a very big story. You could restore this building or help grow a store and see weird magical creatures but there weren't really a STORY there. Here there is.Not only is there an actual main story of the game there are bad guys enemies to be defeated improvements to be made. There are crime and criminals to hunt down and apprehend (albeit slightly innocent criminals since it's mostly a PG13 friendly game. (example one of the crimes was someone burning down a building when we found out who did it they said they thought the building would hurt the town)).Not only do we have the main story there are individual story arcs some bigger than others. Most of these revolves around the characters you can marry but they all have some story you can discover without marrying (and divorcing) over and over again. I cannot tell you how amazing it was to get to know these characters with cut scenes and voice acting. I fell completely in love. I picked my husband with care I was sitting there considering two options and one of them asked ME to be his girlfriend. I was so shocked they could ask ME? I didnt have to do the entire job? Alright.I tried him out and didn't like it so I broke up with him and married the other.I felt like I was in the middle of a romance novel or something. Now what else can I say to make you play this The developers are great and they're involved in the community. They're a fairly fresh company (tho this isn't their first game) and they're still learning. Recently they had a slight drama with voice actors and people claiming they weren't paid. I hadn't heard anything about it until I read a post they'd published on the matter where they explained the drama the mistake and the misunderstanding and stated what they where doing to rectify the situation. I loved this it was very plain and honest unlike some companies that if they even make a statement just make some plain garbel about how mistakes where made and it will be rectified. I got told WHAT happened how it happened and what the plan was to fix it. And THAT kind of upfront honesty is what we need in this buisness. So yes like harvest moon?like stardew valley?Buy this game. It's amazing.",My Time At Portia
2019-02-05,3,127,8,True,Recommended,Wow! I have been wanting a good Medieval town builder for a while! I love Banished big fan of Age of Empires got heavy into Dawn of Discovery adore the Stronghold games and the Total War series... But none of those really hit the craving I've had lately. Either there's too much combat or the elemental maintenance is too high and I just kinda wanna... play.... Medieval Cities Skylines.This has a chill balance! Definitely a game I can relax to however it's challenging enough to where I don't feel as though I've exhausted all of my building options.This Foundation is what I've been craving!!! Love it so much!!!Spoilers? _______________________________________________Pros You don't have to micromanage every person they live their own lives you simply govern. The grid free building system is fluid aesthetically pleasing and keeps things interesting.(Even if I play the same map choosing the same starting location my town could turn out entirely different.) There's a slight Settlers of Catan vibe when you start fresh A new map is loaded and you have to select a property that suits you. This comes down to which resources you value on your starting plot do you want to be by water etc. A lot of strategy can go into where you place your town center. Or not! You can just go for it and see what happens! Replayability. Cute art style. Great graphics which run very smoothly on my PC. For early access I've played two 4 hour sessions and haven't felt any bugs. So that's pretty impressive! You can kind of make whatever you want by using monuments! Screenshot fun time! DPersonal Preference It would be cool if maps were randomly generated with/without select preferences forest density hills mountains water etc. This would allow for further replayability but definitely isn't required!!! Multiplayer would be fun. My wife and I have been playing side by side and comparing our little settlements but it would be cool if we could have a trade route between one another or something! However if multiplayer never came to Foundation that would be just fine!,Foundation
2019-02-06,3,60,1,True,Recommended,Is it a good game? Yes.Is it a fun game? Yes.Did the devs put 30 euros of work into it? Yes.However is the gameplay worth 30 euros? Arguably not.This game is like The Settlers 7 but without many of the constrictions that game offered. On the other hand there isn't much to do after a couple of hours in. You just build a town and... That's about it.I'll recommend the game for the work the devs put in because it's really pretty and well made but that's all I can say about it. Maybe if it was like 10 or 15 euros then I'd find the price more reasonable.,Foundation

2019-02-01,3,175,107,True,Recommended,I've owned this game since Kickstarter played all the alphas. It's fantastic and keeps getting better. We were building big cities from the get go and I can't wait to see what this new version has in store. Needless to say I heartily recommend the game! You can see my latest playthrough including a quickstart tutorial here https //www.youtube.com/playlist?list PLRm_zpPOcTPsbgbgr4BEark6lqBLwxncMAdding to this. I recommend playing without any balance mods for now they prevent the tutorial quests from running and these give you lots of free land which really speeds up the beginning of the game. The trader issue on the new Valley map has been fixed so a bridge is no longer needed in order to start trading. Devs are very responsive to bugs as they have been since the Kickstarter.,Foundation
2019-02-03,0,0,5,True,Recommended,After 5 hours of play time so far I'm impressed and pretty optimistic this game is going to turn into a good city builder.I've seen a number of negative reviews that named no proper tutorial and an unintuitive interface as their reason to vote negative. I agree that at this time it's not always very clear what you have to do and where you find certain things in user interface but most things really only take a little longer to figure out than you're used to. There's definatly room for improvement here but in my opinion it's absolutely no deal breaker.The presentation of the game is great. Graphics and art style are very nice to look and the music and ambient sounds create a very nice and relaxed athmosphere while you work on your town.The more free form and grid less approach to building is refreshing and lets you create towns that seem like they've naturally grown. Very pleasing to the eye not having to align everything and having a lot more control of what you want to build wherever.I really like the mix of building and managing your town and people and all of the base features that are important to a game seem to be well thought out and not too shallow though I do hope to see other layers of complexity for existing features added.As many people mentioned it definatly borrows from some of the best and most popular city builder games like Anno Cities Skylines Banished The Settlers and I'd say they dev team picked and chose pretty well which features from all of these games would fit well with their own flavour of builder.In the spectrum of Early Access releases I'd fore sure count this among the better ones. If I'd had to rate my Early Access experience with this game after 5 hours I'd say it's a somewhere around a 7.5 or 8.Overall thumbs up from me!,Foundation
2019-02-04,9,91,12,True,Recommended,"It's been my experience that reviews on Steam are pretty harsh. Don't listen to the detractors on this project. ""Foundation"" is at the very early stages as an Early Access game. And IMO it's already on course to being one of the greats. Think ""Banished"" but many steps beyond. Yes there's a lot of work that needs to be done. But hey... it's ""Early Access"". Right?I'll say it a little more clearly for those in the back of the room... ER LEE AX SESS!!! See that big blue box at the top? The one that states loudly ""Early Access Game""? It means something!Chill people! ""Foundation"" needs to be judged not on its completeness but by its state and potential. Already it's in great shape (all things considered). I've played it for a few hours and its crashed on me a few times. I'm willing to forgive those crashes. That being said it's game play and strategy its economy and the way it all works together (at least from what I've learned from it) are really well done well thought out... and what's more... addicting!! There's a few issues with the UI I'd like to see reconsidered. But these are minor. I really like the way you can paint your zones and watch your sims go to work. As they walk in the fields they create their own roads and this helps shape how your little village will grow. It adds a nice ""natural ness"" to the way your city will evolve. Again very well thought out and fun to watch.If you have no issue with branching out and trying an Early Access game and particularly if you like ""Banished"" I would highly recommend ""Foundation"". I for one am excited to be a part of its development and look forward to the adventure of watching it mature.If you're expecting a fully polished game with no flaws. Move on... please. Those working this project don't need your bad reviews. And I mean all of this with respect and sincerity. Some people just aren't there when it comes to branching out in the EA direction. And that's perfectly fine. Just please don't pay money for this game and then write a review as if it were ready for your PS4 console. It's not. But given time I really think those of us who jumped in when we did will be glad for it.Hey Polymorph! Great job! I really like where you're going with this so far.

Right now we got a (promising) barebones game and only the dev's vision for 30 want to experience varied and longer gameplay. You can build and expand the basic stuff but there is nothing to do anymore besides that. Entertaining for less hours than I have fingers on my hand. expect any kind of combat. This is a casual city builder need cloud saving. want a proper tutorialRight now I have refunded the game as it does not bring me enough value and I do not feel the need to test and shape the game for the amount of money asked. Too many good games out there that are perfectly playable to do quality testing for 30 Maybe I will rebuy this game once it has released feature complete as the mechanics look promising and the gameplay is very chilled.

2019-02-02,10,197,2,True,Not Recommended,Underwhelming at the moment there's just not that much to do. It seems fun in its premise though.It has some dangerous bugs (upgrading the church? No one can go into it until it is finished and they will keep trying to go. All day long. Making them starve.) and weird problems (monuments often have a sizeable part underground). Walls are free to build which seems... too easy? Canceling a building (or destroying one) doesn't refund the resources which seems silly.Anyway good potential but I can't recommend it for 30 in its current state.,Foundation
2019-02-02,1,46,4,True,Recommended,This game has so much potential to become the best city building game. Pros You can build on hills (my favorite) You can edit and make your own building design You can have troops to provide safety to your people You can draw which lands your people can use It has Quest System You can unlock stuff by using points you earned from quests You can zoom so close that you can see what your people doing They are fixing stuff on constant basis They have Great community admin Unlimited potential Cons Some bugs not major (keep in mind its Early access) Trading not clear (But I assume they will fix it) Food variety is very limited (But I assume they will add more) Overall I recommend this game if your into city building for sure.

2018-05-23,13,106,12,True,Recommended,As a big fan of Guitar Hero and as a person interested in music I was certainly excited when I first saw a gameplay video of this game. I bought the HTC Vive just a few days before Beat Saber was released and tried a few other games but as soon as this game was released playing the Vive has been the same as playing Beat Saber.The game is really simple. In a good way. I ve had many friends over and I just pop the Vive over their head start the game and just let them have it. All of them get what they have to do immediately. All of them sound a little anxious feel a bit ashamed that they miss a block or two but a couple of seconds later they re completely immersed in the game. As soon as the song is over they quietly ask Can I have another go? .For me this game quickly became a huge motivation. I want to be better I want to hit those global leaderboards. It s no casual gaming anymore. I m putting on shorts prepare a water bottle and play all out until I m spent lying panting on the floor. Even if I don t hit those leaderboards at least I ll be as fit as Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his golden days by the end of the summer. And this is the first time in forever that I ve been this motivated by a game.Even though the songs are far from the kind of music that I listen to I cannot help but walk around having the melodies in my head constantly. Some songs I play because I like the music others I play because the level is just really fun to play. And some because both of those reasons. In general the music and levels are really well done and I m really looking forward to more songs and user made content. I m hoping the genres will be a bit more diverse later on but I m really impressed with how good these first songs are.I do have a couple of suggestions to improve the game though I would like it if I could practice a certain part of a certain song much like you could in Guitar Hero so you can really hone your skills. Now your only chance to practice and study the song is to turn on the No Energy mode and play without the risk of failing the level. If the part you re having trouble with is 1 minute and 30 seconds in it s kind of frustrating to play through the song over and over again and not get a chance to really practice the hard part before you have to restart the song again. So a training mode where maybe you could even slow down the speed or something to really perfect your gameplay would be awesome. The other thing that has been bothering me are the blocks that have no arrow but a point on them. Everyone who s tried the game me included has tried to stab these blocks the first time they ve encountered them. It took a couple of tries before I realized that they were a Swing however you want block. I think it would be better if these blocks had no marking at all. That would be more clear as to what you re supposed to do with them.Also I would like to look as cool as I feel when playing. I don t. I look stupid. Like I m randomly waving my hands around uncontrollably. Can you make me look like a jedi master instead? I would appreciate that.Thanks for one of the best gaming experiences I ve had in ages!,Beat Saber

2018-07-14,12,420,245,False,Recommended,I was never interested in farming games. I ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn t an achievement hunter and it didn t have achievements. But now I see what all the hype was about.Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life especially the game s premise you re stuck at a soul crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather s farm on a far off island so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself where you the player are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game not knowing what else to expect.In Stardew Valley you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you ve been given from buying seeds and planting crops to raising animals to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event) to foraging for wild food and even to exploring a few combat centric Zelda style dungeons. But you re not making money for its own sake there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land each with significant and game changing rewards at the end and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.Years consist of four months each month being 28 day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons and (almost) no crops grow in winter so you ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes and you ve got to make sure you re back in your house by 2AM or else you ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the start of a day so if you re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops it won t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That s how bad it is.Another one of the game s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want no joke relationships are gender indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real you ll feel the pain of rejection all too often but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.As for complaints surprisingly the game has some strange and baffling bugs most of which are visual (like ice skating horses) but some which affect gameplay and a few known save corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile your character will turn to face it changing the default direction you aim compounding the problem. It can be infuriating especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish. Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop you immediately sell the item with no confirmation. I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.Also I can t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does perhaps more dungeons a bigger map and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development including a co op multiplayer patch in the works and a lively modding community.I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls it s some simply wonderful escapism and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting it ll easily take about 200 hours especially blind but if you re like me you ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs up.,Stardew Valley

I had wanted it for a while and I am so glad I got my hands on it. What starts out as a farming simulator quickly turns to a loveable game about what it means to be part of a small community in that world.

What should I build next? Should I get a barn? Should I get coop? How do I make wine? What can I pickle? AHHHHHHHH THE QUESTIONS ARE ENDLESS !!!!!!!!!!!!!But god do I love this game. Stardew Valley is beautiful in the way it can cater towards different players. You can play it extremely casually without asking ANY of the questions I do or you can be hardcore and ask ALL my questions EVERY day.

2018-09-24,5,146,205,False,Recommended,i was not interested in Stardew Valley at first because farming doesn't seem to be my thing. i bought the game for the new multi player feature to play it with a couple of friends.i tried it in single player mode just to learn the basics and for the next two weeks playing this game was basically what i did besides sleeping. this is the first game i have ever spent more than 100 hours on. i didn't know if i spent so much time in Stardew Valley because it was the perfect escape from real life or because i fell in love with the game... but now i know it's both.i wish i knew that farming is just one of the many things you can do in Stardew Valley. there are so many details and secrets in one small town to be discovered... and you have all the time you need to discover all of them. you can forage and dig up things everywhere you can socialize with townsfolks each with unique personalities likes and dislikes and fall in love with them you can mine the heck out of the local mines and then mine the heck out of a limit less mine elsewhere. you can play the game however you want and Pelican Town still stays beautiful and vibrant regardless.i recommend this game. i know my recommendation is just another one in a sea of positive reviews but hey it deserves my recognition still! thank you ConcernedApe and Chucklefish for Stardew Valley. this game is a good time ),Stardew Valley

She would always buy me the new one for Christmas and we would play it all day filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon it is a masterpiece in it's own right one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum. Stardew Valley is complex and simple heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work. Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten.,Stardew Valley

2018-06-26,0,0,208,False,Recommended,"I'm really bad at writing reviews but I will try my best. Stardew Valley is an amazing game with a moderate amount of content. After upgrading everything on your farm raising animals growing crops and choosing a wife/husband you can do ""quest"". Most quests are fetching quest with one really good ""quest"" and one decent quest. The Community center is by far the most fun quest but it is a more fetching quest but it takes longer due to the fact that you have to work for most of the things or wait for certain events but it feels rewarding to watch an abandoned building become a rather beautiful homey edifice after you complete ""The Community center"" quest the game feels like it's lacking content. The only other quest that stands out is ""The Guild"" quests which consist of killing a certain amount of dungeon creatures which after a while feels really boring.In conclusion it's a really fun game with a lot of fun content that I skimmed over in the beginning (If i missed anything comment)",Stardew Valley

2018-05-13,0,0,53,False,Recommended,"Though my Game Time may not show it i've invested hundreds of hours into this game.I can honestly say it is one of the best games of it's kind that I have played.I've always been looking for a Harvest Moon ey type game with something more and this beauty definitelty fulfilled that desire.Let's start with the aesthetics Overall in terms of Art/Visual Design it's a solid 9/10.The visuals in this tiny monster are absolutely amazing. The Sprites Maps/Areas Special effects where they apply all of it comes together so well. Everytime I take my strolls around the world I always find myself amazed at how well everything was put together.Gameplay This i'll give a full 10/10.As mentioned I wanted something Harvest Moon ey with more and this title sure delivered.The Combat System is Simple but not enough to be boring. The enemies each have their own little charm to them that makes grinding through the mines enjoyable.Each NPC is unique and their ""own"" person. All their Heart Events are enjoyable. Their Stories Romantic Interests Comments and just ingame chatter is amusing and (in terms of their Stories) extremely captivating. (Maybe it's just me?)In Game Events are interesting and bring their own little flair of excitement into the game. The Relationship system in this game is very well done in my eyes. Especially with the new Update where multiple Romantic Interests can (To my understanding) ""gang up"" on you? Very exciting stuff and a nice addition.The amount that there is to do in this game is overwhelming. From the Craft Recipes Decorations Winery fishing farming mining Combat just everything is so well done.Overall this game is well worth it's price. Perhaps even Doubled by my thoughts.

Dare I say this is Harvest Moon for adults who know better? Is this Thanksgiving dinner with the extended family after your sophomore year at college? Is it catching up with your high school sweetheart over coffee and laughing over a distant now but shared past but with no regrets?

2018-10-16,2,118,257,False,Recommended,"TL DR A fantastic game worthy of whether you buy it on sale or not. I could've paid $60 for it and I still would be happy with my experience. The developer (ConcernedApe) should be proud of the work he's done here it's a fantastically enjoyable piece of art.To start I played this game cooperatively with my girlfriend from the start to the end. As a side note if you're going to play with a friend from the start you want to enable extra cabins. The extra cabins allow 1 extra player to join you. You can start without cabins and build them super cheaply but if you're wanting to jump right into it you'll next the extra.I'm a very seasoned gamer having played video games since the original NES. It wasn't too terrible for me to the get the hang out it right out of the box I suggest enabling ""always on targeting marker"" in the options as it will greatly help with properly aiming. Also make sure you're not standing on the tile you wish to interact with such as tilling land. My GF is not a seasoned gamer this was her second game she's played on PC utilizing a mouse and keyboard. I had her enable the aiming marker as well and she had a relatively easy time figuring out what she was doing for the most part.There is a ton of stuff to do in this game and you can't go wrong with any of them.Farming is easily the most profitable and you don't even need to worry about which crops are the best cash crops. It's very appealing to try to have a crop of each type due to the benefit of cooked food as well as quests that require various crops. If you only grow one crop you'll missing out on other aspects of the game.Fishing is a bit rough and continues to be a bit rough throughout the game. Some of the fish are a pain to catch and remain a pain to catch but it's because it costs very little to fish and can yield large payouts should you get good at the fishing mini game. Crabpots are a great way to raise fishing and acquire 'fish' for other endeavors and easy money.Mining &amp Combat these two are together because they go hand in hand. You go to the mines and later elsewhere and in the process of mining for ore you encounter monsters. You don't become an almighty god amongst mortals in this game you need to rely on placement timing and farming/cooking to help you have the easiest experience especially once you're done with ""the mines"". Armor is your boots and buffs from food. Your weapons are a melee weapon and ranged weapon I've never used the ranged weapon in combat. Food restores energy and heals you your crops and livestock can provide better 'food' that is actually cooked that provides buffs.Villagers are an important part of this game and you want to work on becoming friends with them. There's a calender in town square next to a job board keep track of birthdays find out what people like and given them those gifts. Doing so leads to extra content within the game. It's completely worth it.Foraging is actually beneficial and provides a source of income food and goods. You use your hoe on 'worm tiles' and you receive items typically for the museum. I suggest doing this as it can give you a leg up on making money and give you access to things that you couldn't get yet.All in all I'd say I love this game. My girlfriend loves this game. It's been an enjoyable experience for a seasoned gamer and someone new to gaming. They did it right with this one and deserve all the praise they get. If you can play with one extra person farm life will be exceptionally easier. For each extra person the more specialized you can get. Fishing is always relevant mining is always as well. Farming is only useful as long as you can grow crops and have money for the seeds (or get a seed maker). With two people we were able to get a large portion of the content done we're just down to getting the last pieces of 'end game gear' and wrapping up maxxing out friendships.A few tips if you do decide to get into it.Enable always on targeting marker.Don't stand on the tile you're tilling.If you have nothing better to do go mining.Work on friendships.Work on the community center.Grow all the varied crops.Don't be afraid of the wiki crops were my usual pages.Play with a friend if you can. Make a friend to play this with if you don't have one.All options are valid.Upgrade the watering can first (gold if you can)Upgrade the hoe next (gold too but not as important as watering can)Don't worry about buying too much equipment for the mines just bring food for healing/energy.The upgraded backpack is SO worth it especially while mining.Don't concern yourself too much with min maxing it doesn't really matter.Be patient take your time.If you're going to the mines try to make 5 levels each time you go the elevator saves progress every 5.Gather all of your crops no later than the 28th (they all day next season except some.)All crops die in winter.Store at least a couple of everyone. I kept the highest tier I could get sold the rest.Use winter for mining and reorganizing (most useful for solo or duo play.)Most of all have fun and relax. Don't stress too much.There's tons more tips but this is a review. PIt's a great game worth every dollar. I don't regret buying this full price.

I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it) Animal crossing (&lt 3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam) I still love the game. Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season where to plant them on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first the fishing is challenging but as you progress your skill you become a pro in no time.Mining and combat. Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi I'm Bexy and i'm a hoarder.) Social. Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. Main story. The actual main story is well rewarding and once you ""complete"" it you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems hell you might even discover new things afterwards I sure as hell did! Yes I was a tester for the game. Yes I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game even though there were massive game breaking bugs errors glitches crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. And that's the thing not only is the game amazing the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. So yes I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",Stardew Valley

2018-05-13,0,0,123,False,Recommended,An absolute gem.I always loved the old Harvest Moon games on Nintendo's Systems but since the later titles have been an utter disgrace to the name of the series I have felt a need for a good farmingsim with some charm. Stardew Valley manages to capture the heartwarming feeling of the old Harvest Moon games just fine and comes with all their pro's and gets rid of some of the flaws.The soundtrack of this game is awesome and the graphics fit the overall theme plus the character sprites are top notch )The controls can be a little unprecise and the menues tedious to navigate but there is no reason to rush yourself in this game it is no brain surgery so it is not too bad.

2018-02-22,2,1,640,False,Recommended,A gripping speculative horror scifi tale both relatable and poignant of a modern day wage slave's dying dream. In their final moments as they suffer from a lethal yet preventable malady they cannot afford to have treated they envision a reality in which they escape the shackles of their corporate servitude. They move to a pictureqsue and bountiful valley full of friendly and open minded locals and through fair and honest toil they are able to earn an honest living organically growing only the skills they wish to pursue. Eventually they are able to buy expensive house extensions get married have children and secure a comfortable retirement as well as the approval of their extended family.Past a certain point the veil falls away. The player character learns they are not in paradise but a kind of purgatory. For the denizens of the valley time does not seem to pass spring summer autumn winter goes by birthdays are celebrated but no one ages sickens dies. Subtle hints of mysterious wondrous and sinister powers show over the course of gameplay manifestations of the reality the player character hoped to leave behind linger in their subconscious inescapable even past the great and inevitable barrier of Death.I loved Harvest Moon for the SNES and this game is a lot like that. Try it with mods!,Stardew Valley
2016-03-22,0,0,144,False,Recommended,I feel by this point I have fully and completely did absolutely everything I could possibly do. So I am going write out this review fully again and ever come back to it. Stardew valley if you need a few games to make reference to from games I've played is a lot like Animal Crossing and also Farmville and yes Minecraft too. Yes.Its Farmville in that you have an actual farm in which you plant things and you can have animals the animals need fed and they produce stuff for you and you control the structure of the farm and you are the driving force to making everything work but its not a mobile game so there are no such things as 'speeding up production' which in turn means no microtransactions but that really goes without saying.Its like Animal Crossing in that also have a house that you can upgrade for additional rooms (a total of 4 upgrades) Furthermore the game has a social aspect to it like Animal Crossing in that you can (and are heavily encouraged) to make friends with the various villagers and if you do they will give you things like materials and recipes to further increase your career as the villages first Gordon Ramsey. You can even marry the villagers if you so choose but I would refer to the wiki if you are going to do that because the various cutscenes are far too random for each one.Its like Minecraft because its how I handle the game.Its as fun as you want it to be in the end and it will only be as fun as you put into it. This game could ideally go on forever but it won't because its too repetitive and that is only as unfortunate as your hopes wish for it to be.You farm and produce an awful lot of money quickly you ger married you can get a horse and organize your farm however you like you can mine for stuff which later becomes a place where you can slay stuff which feels kinda stapled on.The social aspect is actually more fleshed out than you think from this review but it mostly only serves to make the world seem less lonely and really makes me just want to talk to an actual human being which we will be able to do come January when Muliplayer is expected to a thing.The Marriage thing gives you a bunch of archetypical folks to choose from but they're not as they appear. Abigail is the best example of this and is into the occult which is a thing that actually bothered me. Therefore I can with certainty that they did pretty good with the social aspect.Overall its a 8/10 for me but keep in mind that this score will be different for you.,Stardew Valley
2016-08-13,0,0,191,False,Recommended,I've been a huge fan of the Harvest Moon franchise since I was a wee child and this game right off the bat is extremely nostalgic to me. Though I feel this game betters more in comparison. The controls are much easier it's fun to explore you get to modify your farm however you wish and tending to your crops is far more pleasing. This game has so much freedom that I've spent hours having simple fun out of pointless tasks. If you're a fan of the Harvest Moon franchise or even just of the farm/tending scene I totally recommend this game.,Stardew Valley

Characters are very in depth with different scenes and overall feelings the world is very in depth with good soundtrack and different secrets and there is a lot of replayability ecpecially with the release of different farmlands. The best part I think is that I payed $15 for over 200 hours of content (from a personal standpoint of course. I might just have a problem). I care for the characters which is something I really value in games generally and I have actually been brought to tears at times.

2017-12-26,0,0,54,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Stardew Valley..... With the very short amount of time spent pay this game (5 hours) I am impressed. With starting the game not have read any reviews or watched anything on it I found myself thinking that this game would be like any other typical simulator for farming. I was very Impressed and hooked by the storyline of the game and gameplay being able to do anything I wanted within the small town of Pelican but also making sure everything I was doing was on track. Stardew Valley can be a very confusing and fustrating game at times you may faint of no energy or it being to late at night but it never comes back to the game itself but how you play the game. I highly reccommend this game for those with more time on their hands than others due to how the game depends on time heavily.,Stardew Valley

2016-03-02,0,0,192,False,Recommended,"So after the kappa review I did I suppose I might as well do a normal one.Today's game market is flooded with all sorts of games triple A's indies and some of which even made by one person. Sometimes one game shows up outta nowhere and suprises us in the best way possible.Stardew Valley is one of these games. After 4 years of development ConcernedApe (Eric Barone) brought us a near masterpiece. Stardew valley is a farming RPG heavily inspired by Harvest Moon. When I first heard of the game it was only 2 weeks away from release but it only took one glance at it to have me sold on it. The art has been redone completely multiple times over the course of it's development and the pixel art looks great the style's also very reminiscent of the aforementioned Harvest Moon. At the start of the game you inherit your grandfather's farm only to find it in a run down state and it's up to you (as the new owner) to return it to it's former glory. The gameplay is very slow but that's okay since it is meant to be a long term project. This is because you basically live your life in this game as you progress through days months and years. You can farm fish mine cook socialize forage construct craft and more. Stardew Valley has a lot of mechanics some rougher than others but they compliment each other nicely. What I personally didn't like as much was the fishing. I don't know if it's because I'm bad at it but it felt time wasting because of the result in the early stages of levelling your fishing skill due to the lower amounts of money you'd get. Sometimes the controls can feel a little bit lacking but this does not severely handicap your experience. In fact after the first 50 hours (which you will reach oh believe me) you're basically used to it. Stardew Valley has a storyline which you can follow but it's not necessary so you can basically just do whatever you want to do. The game has no ending so you can also keep playing for as long as you'd like (keep in mind that you do want to have some stuff done before year three though...). Now that we got mechanics and controls out of the way I can talk about what I like the most about the game. The NPCs are scattered across the map and at first you'll be urged to seek and meet them all. Most of the NPCs all have their own little backstory personalities movement patterns and dialogue of which the latter two are also dynamically influenced by conditions as the weather day of the week season and so on. You can befriend these NPCs by well err.. by doing what you'd do in real life of course! Giving them gifts every two days of the week! Barging into their homes and hand them a bat's wing only to leave as fast as you entered to leave them in confusion. Unless you give them stuff they actually *like*. As you progress in your relationships with these NPCs you'll collect small scraps of their backstory and eventually they will send you stuff (yay). Keep in mind that it is thus useful to improve your relationship with certain NPCs first who fit your playstyle as their gifts can sometimes prove quite useful. Some of these NPCs are also *bachelors* which means that if you increase your relationship to a level high enough you will be able to marry them. Your spouse will then move into your home and they will provide you with dialogue items or they will even do chores for you daily. The soundtrack was also redone and is quite subtle most of the times which fits the theme. My favorite track is in all honesty ""Marimba of the frozen bone"". Stardew valley has a relaxing theme and it is a great game to just sink lots of time into. I wouldn't recommend it if you have better stuff to do as that stuff will NOT get done. In a world with an increasing indie game market Stardew Valley stands out as one of these special accomplishments and it damn deserves to. 9.5/10.I'm suprised the game allowed me the time to write this instead of making me play it.",Stardew Valley

2016-08-18,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Since some of you people don't like to read lots of text the TL DR is at the bottom.I'm going to try to cover every aspect of the game but I'm sure I'll miss something so forgive me.Farming The actual Agricultural aspect of this game is great. You have to buy seeds plant them water them manually or with sprinklers once you can build them. It's simple and I personally thing that's a good thing. Everything has a different buying and selling price and you can craft different meals with different fruits/vegetables. You also have various animals and all of them serve different purposes that make you money. You have to make sure they are fed and happy and they will give you what you need. That being said the farming and animal work can get a little bit repetetive especially if you don't get sprinklers then you have to manually water every plant every day. There are things you can do to help this but you still have to spend alot of time doing the same thing over and over.Characters All of the characters in the game are done very well. Each of them have their likes and dislikes in terms of what you can give them. You can marry characters if they like you enough. All of them have different traits and it feels like they're all well put together characters not just crappy shallow NPC's that are there to sell you stuff like seeds or house upgrades. I actually liked and disliked them which was surprising.Mining I haven't gotten to much into mining but so far it seems entertaining. You mine to get materials to build things and you can get artifacts to give the Gunther at the Archaeology Center. There are creatues down there to attack you so you also have a little bit of combat mixed in there which is a nice touch.Miscellaneous There are other things in the game that are nice for instance the annual Town Fair where you have to bring some of your best items the desert that you have to repair the bus to get to the Community Center which you can help rebuild and your dead Grandfather (Who you inherit the farm from) comes at the beginning of your third year and rates you on how you've done in the first 2 years after that it's basically endless.TL DR I would definitely have to recommend this game due to the great characters the good farming mechanics the Mining the various moments along the way and the $15 Price. The only negatives are that the Farming can get repetetive and 2 years isn't really enough to time to get stuff done for the rating you get.,Stardew Valley

2018-11-28,5,112,278,False,Recommended,"After playing for just a couple hours I already couldn't even imagine going back to FS17. 80 hours later farming still feels better than it ever did before. Good job Giants DAlmost every single aspect of the game has been improved from FS17 in some way. Most notably item handling Moving things by hand is no longer frustrating! Things no longer fly out of your hand whenever you touch anything no Herculean strength to flip tractors with a piece of wood and able to rotate items in hand. Looking forward to conventional balers at this point. vehicle handling greatly improved steering feels much more realistic (using keyboard) you can feel you're driving a several ton piece of machinery suspension and ground response better than ever vehicle maintenance vehicles no longer have daily maintenance fee instead they have wear and tear that you have to fix for a small fee (similar to what Seasons mod did in FS17) resulting in massive decrease in passive running cost for the farm (idle vehicles don't cost you) land management you no longer own entire map except the fields land/field expansion feels more natural with having to buy the land. Buy a forest cut down the trees and turn it into farmland! buildings finally able to build up your own farm other than just adding a couple sheds although placing stuff on anything but a very flat ground can cause issues. Upcoming terraforming feature will fix that potentially. Also choice of buildings in base game is limited but I'm sure modding community fill flood the game with dozens of new items soon. field management new lime and weeds mechanics greatly expanding on the ""fertilize 3 times"" approach from FS17 more stuff to do between sowing and harvesting phases new stuff cotton horses sugarcane (for those without FS17 platinum). All with their own mechanics/machinery. More variety of stuff to do even if cotton is pretty bad profit compared to other crops. contracts complete overhaul of missions much less clunky although somewhat buggy at the moment (weeds will overtake NPC fields permanently) animals chickens are finally not useless as eggs will spawn in boxes without having to collect them manually. Placeable animal pens require higher initial investment in livestock similar to buying fields for arable farms. shop better separation of vehicles and implements into categories full 3D preview of machinery and its configuration (""Does this tractor look silly with narrow tires and painted pink? Did that trailer have a hitch on the back or not? I'll just look and see!"") graphics not a massive leap forward but pretty good upgrade overall game feels to be running smoother than FS17 too. Big improvements in lighting and atmospheric visuals you can easily see the difference in the overall image and feel of the game. Beautiful sunsets and night lights ) audio a lot of good enviromental sounds engine sounds stand out much more than in FS17 interface new interface look much cleaner more readable and compactStuff that did not improve (or marginally) AI Workers Almost as derpy as always D seem to miss less parts of a field on angled edges though Logging while the new chainsaw animation is good it seems 'aiming' the cuts is less intuitive pieces of wood can still get glitched after cutting (weird collision box and mass) and still missing any sound when a massive tree falls down.

2019-01-20,10,63,1330,False,Recommended,The 'Farming Simulator' franchise is great and I am a big fan of Farming Simulator 17 resulting me in getting this game pre ordered. Now that I have played for around 800 hours and I have noticed this many hours before I just see that the game is just the same as Farming Simulator 17. Yes they have added new cool features such as riding horses but charging 34 99 for a game that is so similar to it's previous version is quite upsetting. The features could also have came in DLC packs that could have saved you money. I wouldn't recommend against Farming Simulator as it's one of my favorite games but I wouldn't say it's worth it's price if you own Farming Simulator 17. I would just stick with that and get this game when there's a good deal.,Farming Simulator 19
2018-12-23,4,181,12,False,Not Recommended,"I'm at odds with this game and at the moment I find it difficult whether or not I can recommend it.See the Farming Simulator franchise has meant a lot to me in the past. I met a lot of amazing people indirectly because of this game (through FS UK) and had many great years playing FS13 15 and 17. Once again GIANTS has released their latest game two years later as normal and once again it contains new features some of these have been inspired by popular mods for the prequels and others are new concepts altogether.But my problem with this game is that you quickly realize that underneath its new gameplay elements and new brands and prettier visuals at it's core it's still the same old game as it's been for over ten years now. Unrealistic artifical feeling default maps and clunky arcade like controls that in no way represent farm equipment operation and bring to question the ""simulator"" portion of the title. Games shouldn't have to rely on mod creators to make their game what it is mods should add to the game not be required to get the full effect.GIANTS should take a page out of SCS Software's book. Since the release of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator they've continuously updated their flagship titles and released the occasional DLC for revenue instead of an entirely ""new"" game every couple years. This means that mod creators only have to tweak their creations with the new updates instead of completely overhauling them to make them compatible with the new title and loyal fans don't have to re buy the same game continuously. It's getting annoying re purchasing what seems more like a moderately updated version of the same game I bought two years ago.Personally I've grown tired of the franchise and the game that I used to love only bores me now but maybe that's just me. If it was a brand new game entirely maybe I could see myself getting some enjoyment out of it but like I say it feels like the same game it's always been after playing it for just a few moments. So I guess my recommendation would have to be that if you're new to the series go for it. If you've played other FS games and don't find them fun anymore don't bother getting this one because it's unlikely to reignite your interest. And remember that in two years time this same game is going to be re released and you'll once again find yourself starting over.",Farming Simulator 19

I simply don't understand the people leaving negative reviews because the core gameplay is the same. What the hell did you expect? zombies? a battle royale mode? Theres only so much you can realisticly do in a game primarly about farming. Anyway...The bad Bugs. Ive encountered a few more since I first wrote a more positive version of this review about 4 hours in. The most glaring right now are a weird floaty physics issue after putting logs in a pickup and removing them a sound hiccup when using the chainsaw and a visual glitch with rain coming through the cab of certain vehicles. Ive also heard about multiplayer connectivity issues but as a single player only person I can't comment. These issues exist as of 11/20/18 Reported issues with connectivity and control bindings not sticking with wheels pedals ect. as of 11/20/18Seasons and the Follow Me mod still haven't been implimented into the base game. Seasons I can kind of understand since people have strong feelings on the mod both for and against so its absence is probably a calculated decision.Sim ers are a fickle bunchVehicle list is a bit small. That's been the case for every farm sim game on launch and has to do with licensing difficulties. Still if you're coming from a heavily modded version of fs17 you'll probably be a bit disapointed. The good While not mind blowing the graphics look a bit crisper and cleaner. In particular vehicle interiours look a lot less 'plastic y' Hard to descibe but compare fs17 and 19 and its noticable. The new start from scratch game mode is a lot of fun and so far works just as advertised.It's probably the only way I'll play the game from now on.The maps while small have alot more detail and are generally more fun to explore than those in base fs17. the devs clearly took insperation from the modding community. Sound improvements. the vehicle engine loops sound better and the rain sound effects are much better. Tweaked vehicle handling. Vehicles in FS17 all felt stiff and toylike. more like driving an RC car than a big piece of machinery. While still not perfect theres a sense of weight behind them now. There is however the physics issue mentioned above with pickups as of 11/20/18I haven't played long enough to mess around with horses the biggest new feature yet but overall Same game still good,Farming Simulator 19

The hitbox is horribly huge and if you are within what looks like 4 feet of an object it will block you. You can climb trees with a horse.

2018-12-09,5,52,78,False,Recommended,"I got on board the Farming Simulator series at 17 so I'm not really an old hat at this game series (yet). But for me thus far it's an excellent way to relax and just do something that takes no effort to do. That said I recognize that there are some shortcomings here none of which affect the gameplay enough to shift me from a ""yes"" to a ""no"" but should be acknowledged *FS17 had a map where a player could roll their machines up to dispensers on the farm and have them automatically filled and charged money for the transaction likely more than it would cost to buy pallets and manually fill the tool. FS19 lacking this option for slightly less involved play and modders having to add the functionality afterwards is a slight black mark in my eyes. Obviously most people in this game will want the full experience get a loader load the seed/fertilizer/whatever on a pallet fork dump it into the machine but if the previous title offers a gameplay option to the player I feel that the sequel ought not take it away.*FS17 also had a system by which repeatedly doing jobs for the same farmer visibly accumulated ""friendship points"" for lack of a better term which translated to better pay and a better price for buying land from that farmer. If FS19 retained this there's no indication of it. I believe an incentive to build a reputation with the NPCs is another instance of a gameplay feature that a prior had that its direct sequel ought not to have removed.*Until the player become wealthy enough to be managing many fields at once there is very little to do other than fill contracts for money. When your field is plowed cultivated seeded fertilized and limed all there is to do is stare at it until the next growing stage and then until its finished growing. A minor complaint to be sure but there's a fine line between idle relaxation and boring and early game flirts with it.*This game oozes real world machinery out of every pore. There are an enormous number of options for what to drive what to use to seed cultivate plow spray fertilize and so on. The sheer content volume and variety is impressive and appreciated. And most of it there's no reason to touch except for the fun of it. You have a fast tractor with a front loader attachment that you can get immediately at the start which can be upgraded to have more horsepower for tools than anything short of the most expensive light tractor. The Khun subsoil cultivator/plow is more cost effective than buying the two tools separately and is quite cheap. Buying the most inexpensive fertilizer spreader and a weeder beats everything until you're rich. In essence especially if you're challenging yourself most of the content may as well not even exist. I list this as a downside but I fully acknowledge that even if there is a solution it'd be a headache to figure out so this like the others is a very minor complaint.As of 26 hours in these are the only things I see that could be downsides to this game. Wtih how small they are it seems fair to say that this is a truly excellent experience that I heartily recommend. I'm now looking forward to Farming Simulator 21.",Farming Simulator 19

2018-11-30,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,"I've ennjoyed all the farming simulator games. I enjoy this farming simulator game. I am disappointed in the continued lack of interaction with the environment. why have buildings and structure with doors you cant open? Eye candy is fine but this isnt a visually stunning game. Its a farming game. if there is a barn dammit i should be able to open the door and park / store stuff in it.this is more indepth and while not harder it does require more thought and planning than previous iterations of the franchise. Overall I like it but cant give it 5 stars. A five star game has doors you can open. this is at best a 2 to 3 star game. The maps suck. Really. We have these modes where we start with nothing but really the only decent place to build aanything is the now empty starting plot from the easy mode. the plots of land should allow enough room around them to do your building without impacting the field itself or there should be small plots adjacent to the fields that you can buy that are flat enough to have some fun building your ""dream"" farm that you cant interact with.overall very meh.... its ok. Not really recommended. It's not any better than the previous versions when it comes to interaction with the environment and in a farming game that was something i was hoping would be in this edition.if you like FS games and this one is on sale in the near future pick it up then.",Farming Simulator 19

2017-10-13,1,3,348,True,Not Recommended,A very fun concept of a game. Very addicting. But outside of that I don't really have any nice things to say. I know its early access but it feels like the game devs have no idea what they are doing or how to improve the game or work on a bug that has been plagueing the game from the release of early access. You would expect to see improvement week over week especially given the fact they made close to or over half a billion in sales. But that is just not the case. The gameplay feels clunky at best. The graphics nowhere near optimized. And the game is riddled with bugs. And most of these issues have barely improved if at all since early release. Bluehole needs to improve fast or another dev team that knows what the hell they are doing will take up the realistic battle royale mantle. Once I actually see strides made to improve the game in a timely manner instead of just collecting money from the popularity of the game will I change my recommendation of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Especially when PUBG itself are just a bunch of very generic props sticked together ESPECIALLY when PUBG themselves start off as a mod to Arma 3 not original content by any mean. And when anyone create a new game that even in the same gerne as them they go balistic with lawsuit and ""talk show"" to try to shut down the competitor instead of making their game better to compete with the other guys. That's not how you improve gaming as a whole you are holding it back instead.Now on to the game itself its buggy its littered with cheater/hacker its laggy its ran like even though it also look like even on a GTX 1070 of all things. The game basically dont evolve at all since the early access day other than guess what the addition of lootboxes and other ways to monetized the player. Now Im not saying that you cant look for more ways to get more money but when that's your sole focus instead of improving the game in almost anyway its a problem. And to top it all off its back to the dev problem again as they dont care at all about the opinion of the player and instead in face of complain they straight up insult the player calling them ""xenophobic"" because they dont want to play with ppl from like half the earth away who have high ping which ruin their experience with the game and concret evidence/statistic of the high amount of hacker over in China which the dev themselves called out in the past? Stop joking around. It also doesnt help that the hardcore fan of the game are all over the place trying their best to defend the game with things some straight up saying ""I dont care if they are wrong I still think PUBG is the best gamer ever"" which only serve to push the dev into an ""Apple mindset"" where they can do whatever wrong they want and everyone would still worship them anyway. So even though I dont like or play any Battle Royale game im kinda glad that alot of players are catching up to their BS and start moving toward Fortnite instead.So with all that said. No I wouldnt recommend the game. Both for their practice and their game itself. If you want to play Battle Royale I honest think you should try something else.

2017-12-29,0,0,563,False,Not Recommended,"First off this game was really fun to play with friends and solo. i have put many hours into playing and have had so many great experiences with this game. But this game has MANY problems and downsides that i dont like. With the release of the new desert map i have played less because it is so The loot spawns/drops are god awful and there are not that many small areas to drop unless you go way off to the side of the map. The map is based around sniping which i do like but goodluck playing it withouth a sniper and experience. With the map having big citties/towns it leaves just the good players and the lucky ones to win the first fire fight and the newer players and unlucky players to die withing the first 5 min. The map also has a very annoying glitch in when you first dorp to a location and try to pick up loot it will not go into your inventory also you can not open doors or vault through windows. The old map is realy fun and i enjoy how even and spread out the loot is. There are fun places to drop like school Mili Prision and shelter. and small places to drop near the bottom half of the map. Another big issue with this game is that the lag and frame rate lag is extremely annoying. In the start of the match when every one is dropping in you can land and start rubber banding around trying to find a gun or you can be unlucky and have your parachute glitch out and stand frozen in the middle of the air for 5 10 seconds. Frame rate drops are very common if you dont have a beast computer and wont often be that high I my self have a gtx 1060 and only get 40 50 frames on very low settings. The devs do not do very good optomization updates and i havent experienced any major changes in my framerate since the newest update. (12/30/27) Many people complain about hackers being a big issue where i have only experience 3 with my 432 hours played on NA and AS. The wrost i have experince is guys using wall hacks and aimbot which is not that hard to counter if you are playing squad. Overall i do love this game and will still play with my friends but i do not think it is worth 30$ or worth getting if you have a crappy computer or no one to play with. Edit on (2/3/18) Game is still ing and will not load me fast into matches i am often loading in already in the plane or when the plane is halfway over the map already. Some times when i load in fast i have a glitch where i can only move faceing one direction and the only way to fix that is to restart the game. (3/23/18) game is filled with a lot of hackers and i dont see this game going any where. it was fun when i played and i had a lot of good moments. was worth 30$ but now i wouldnt pay anything more than 10 (7/4/18) I decided to play this game again and it still is but now i would say even worse the menue is sarting to look like a shity mobile game surrounding your menue new skin releases and a new ""battle pass"". i have a gtx 1060 3gb and i7 7700k and this game still doesn not want to run smoothly on my pc recently i have reset my computer because it was clutered and that didnt even help.

Most of them make your weapon worse in some way or another.4 out of 5 games have hackers in them. It's out of control.

Sometimes when landing on ground buildings aren't even fully rendered and I can just walk through walls and then it lags out or I get stuck. Overall optimization of the game is just awful. No excuse. I have a mid tier PC and I'm having huge issues playing this game sometimes. And I've heard people with beastly PCs sometimes can't run it smoothly on higher graphics.2.) Clunky. Game just feels clunky all the time. Sometimes you have to press mulitple times (interact) with a door for it to respond so it opens or closes. Picking up loot from the ground sometimes is harder than it looks. Gotta press ""F"" multiple times for my character to react and take the damn loot. Shooting sometimes feels clunky and movement of the game overall. Nothing feels nice and smooth.3.) Lootcrates in early access. I hate being that guy but I mean it's still early access. Focus on your freaking optimization instead of how to milk more money.I would keep on going but I prefer to stick with these 2 major issues above.

If you answered yes to any of the above then this game is for you. It's all the heart stopping moments of DayZ and engaging fire fights of Arma all without the walking simulator feel. Not only are you fighting for survival but fighting for prime positioning. You're constantly faced by the threat of enemy players as well as the ever shrinking safe zone. You find yourself pinned down in a building. The circle is moving in and you know both you and the enemy player have to make a move for both of you to survive. What do you do? You'll constantly find yourself in a situation of ""what do I do?"" Sometimes your quick thinking will pay off sometimes it won't. Learn from your mistakes and what else you could have tactically done to make it out alive and push on to the next game. My mindset going into an early access game is to not expect 100% polished game play. I bought the game a few days after it's release expecting it's downsides but I have only witnessed frame rate drops and lag 2 3 times lasting no more than a couple of seconds. I have foliage and effects turned to medium and the game runs awesome for me and by no means do I have a top tier PC. The game does have it's small bugs. Jumping can be a little awkward sometimes you'll hit a bump while driving and next you're flying through the air and if you're spectating a teammate sometimes their movements and shots don't render well. MOST IMPORTANTLY The developers seem to respond to the feedback of players quickly and updates take place regularly. Hopefully they keep up with it. How many times have we given up on early access games because a patch or update ended up leaving the game unplayable? *cough DayZ* Seriously I could go on and on about what I love about the game but I'll stop here and allow for you to get the game and experience it all for yourselves.

The game is poorly optimized Because the game has lootboxes it will always motivate people to cheatI deicded to uninstall the game and I refuse to play it until the devs region lock china or if their low priority queue actually helps (which I doubt honestly it doesn't help that much with dota 2)Don't buy the game if you don't want to deal with hackers and people with 400 ping it's just not a good experience play fortnite battle royal it's a far superior experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And gun battles is giving my cancer. this game don't buy or play this until they actually put some effort into fixing it instead of adding stupid emotes.I am so sick of seeing these types of games being released half finished games were the rest of the game will either be added over time or sold to us as DLC (Star wars Battlefront) Sea Of Thieves is a perfect example. It's like they came to the board with the idea of an open world pirate game a few ideas for what to do and were then told to make the game and just add their other ideas later. I'm so sick of landing on two maps that i feel like i've played to death same guns and the few new ones that are added will most likely end up in an air drop so unless you want to risk losing all that nice loot you fought hard to get you're not going to touch that fanzy new gun that was added. And of course the cheaters...I don't feel like they have done ANYTHING to fix this MAJOR cheating problem i've gotten so fed up with it that it's tempting to start cheating myself cause it doesn't seem like anything is happening to those people cheating. Instead we get gun skins emotes air drop guns. Not a anti cheat system that works new maps a finished game. NO. All of that will come later after most of the player base are ing done with being killed by cheaters and hackers. I tell you do not waste your money on this game there are so many other great games to spend your money on. Instead of a half piece of battle royale game that feels the need to sue other develepors for making battle royale games even though they are all copying the same genre that has been out far longer then this piece of garbage.

The RNG is terrible and for the most part your chances are winning are GREATLY increased if the zone favors you. If you are caught running out in the open you're screwed. It's based 20% on skill/aim and 80% on luck/positioning. The new desert map is complete garbage and just ugly to look at. And then we get to the hackers... With a small amount of research they claim the game has sold over 3 million copies. 1.5 MILLION players have been banned already for hacking and the hacking is still rampant. They say that most of the hackers come from China and even if you play on North American servers there's a high chance to randomly group with Chinese players. Main problem with that is simply the language barrier.

2017-08-12,2,11,26,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Pretty much everything I wanted out of the individual titles Rust Arma 3 and DayZ combined into one package. A survival battle royale whose goal is to simply be the last one standing on an 8x8 km island super simple premise but the execution is oh so good. .. The pacing is good enough if you end up surviving till the end of a round it's at most 30 minutes.Recent negative reviews have almost ALL been the fact the developer is monetizing crates.... so what? it's cosmetics... anyone complaining about that has no idea how much game development cost I'm sure the developer is expanding their team and using this system to push more quality updates in the future... furthermore you can literally just buy a crate with the points you earn after game sell it and have enough for the key to that crate (considering this game is the most expensive game with the crate system and getting the crates is based on a reward point system based on getting more points if you survive to the end/kill/hit more/etc the crates stay valuable and there's still keyless crates too.)that said there is one downside to this game I've found and it's a texture loading bug where if you parachute in for the first 30 secs give or take textures and buildings entirely don't load (can literally shoot/walk through them/etc...) super serious bug that can be outright game breaking if you don't open inventory and force load (which will freeze you for 15 40 seconds) do it a moment too soon and someone's already killed you when you landed...

I get the sense that if the company (which if I recall correctly is based in South Korea) were to *actually* fix many of the problems (botting shooting through walls etc) China would slap them. Hard.They could fix this by either a region lock or by pairing all known cheaters into one group and all regular players into another so everyone gets the experience they want.

2017-12-25,0,0,120,False,Not Recommended,"The game itself is good and in any other case I would recommend it but...I was falsely banned by the devs. Not one of those ""my brother was playing and he cheated I swear it wasn't me!"" or ""oops I left my mods for *other game* running!"" false bans but a straight up ""I logged on and was banned"" ban.Innocence is impossible to prove but I know what my situation is and nobody else does so if you happen to read this and think ""obviously you were cheating"" then you can stop here.However what really ticks me off about this false ban is the developer's refusal to cooperate. I have made support tickets on both their forum and their official helpdesk and in both cases my response was simply ""our evidence supports the initial ban claim it has been reviewed and the ban will stay"". What evidence? Supposedly they can't provide evidence as ""hackers can use it to their advantage"" I think the reality in my case is that there is no evidence.I have clearly been banned by some kind of false flag in their anticheat BattlEye as one look at my statistics or a typical game would show you that I'm not even that great at the game I highly doubt someone saw my behaviour and reported me. So this automated system assumedly has me banned and the support staff thoroughly believes that it can do no wrong. Great...There are tons of false ban reports out there on the Steam forums for this game on their official forums and in just about every reply to BattlEye on Twitter. I'm sure that while many of these are people who were in fact cheating the sheer numbers say to me that SOME of these people like me must surely have been innocent.Still the developers refuse to believe their bans can be mistaken so I'm missing the money I paid for this game and I have a nasty ""1 ban on record"" blemish on my account. It's probably there forever and the only people who can do anything about it vehemently refuse to do anything about it.So yeah I'm assuming that you don't want to be locked out of a game you paid for with no evidence or support so for that reason I can't recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Like I said I've been almost 2 months without any Pubg and this week I gave some of my time to this and ... AMAZING how human beings can be manipulated just because it's the game with the most players daily nowadays (cof cof Fortnite) it does not mean it's good.Game pains Going with friends in the finals and our vehicle explodes without even getting damaged or die for vehicle explosion without any vehicles around giving multiple shots in the head with Kar 98 into people with lvl 1 or 2 helmet and getting killed in the next second while using a lvl 3 helmet with one shot of mini 14 landing on the floor with the parachute and after 1 second lose almost half of the health or even more (die) try to play in a random squad and in every server there's full asian team (nothing against asian people but it's really anoying when you try to communicate with people and the only thing they do is screaming in some random asian language. Can you guys start using your asian servers) grenades take different times to explode character / parachute stuck in props lack of updates hte most ridicullous number of hackers at least in every game you find one optimization is the only thing wich is better but still bad killcam bugged sometimes worst hitbox...

2017-12-17,0,0,33,True,Not Recommended,I love the games concept 100 man battle royal this game would have me playing hours and hours if it wasn't for the awful optimization of this game.I have literally seen things in toilets prettier than this games optimization. I love the fact that I have to play this game at low settings to be able to experience little to no lag. Whenever I get into a gun fight it always helps that my frame rate plumits to a single digit number. How's my PC you may ask? I can run triple A titles (Battlefield 1 COD WW2 or any highly graphical game) at ultra settings 1080p and keep about 70 80 FPS without dropping below 60. The textures loading in are probably the worst experience ever. Having textures loaded in is like gambling about half the games I play the textures aren't loaded in when I drop onto the map. The textures look worse than Playstation 1 graphics that were half and if they don't load in you have to sit outside and wait for the textures to load in and sometimes you really have to wait. Earlier when I was waiting for the textures to load in I was moving around hoping they'd load and I was experiencing FPS less than 5 and a bunch of freezing. Once the textures did decide to load in about 40 players were dead so in the time that I was waiting for my textures to load half the server got wiped.The game developers know how popular their game is and they probably know very well that this game has had optimization problems so instead of fixing it they make a deal with Microsoft to have it ported to Xbox One where the optimization is god awful. Playing on a normal Xbox One you're looking at a solid 30 fps or below guaranteed.Fix. Your. Game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-21,0,0,57,True,Recommended,So I bought this game in early access because of all the hallelujah hype.. Now... I can clearly see it has potential but seriously it is way too early in development to even be halway playable for newbies to the genre..I mean its addictive in a wierd way but I have played 9 matches now without a single kill because these weapons are way too buggy for me to use effectively..Even though in my opinion the game is not worthy the hype and twitch fame i would still recommend it because of its potential..EDIT After getting used to the game I think i went a little ahead of myself... After trying teaming up with people via discord i realize how much more fun and tactical it is when u are a squad.Definitively recommend this game even though it is still in its early phase of development.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-11,0,0,237,False,Not Recommended,"Overall the game is incredibly fun to play. The mechanics are quite simple that anyone can pick it up. Whether it's Solo's Duo's or Squad's the game still somehow keeps you ""hooked."" That's about all the good things I can say about the game. Now my problem with the game comes in a couple of ways one of them being CHEATERS. I've come across several instances where I get randomly killed from a player who is not even near me. For example one such experience occurred while playing Squad's with randoms. My whole team was in a building taking cover yet somehow everyone got killed through the walls from headshots. Since I was confused on how exactly I got murdered through the wall I ended up reviewing the replay. Apparently someone from who knows where shot at ""random"" through MOUNTAINS and through walls killing me and my whole squad. This infuriates me to no end. With this in mind one thing crucial to keep in mind is that these types of experiences always happen with people who are CHINESE. I understand the creator of this game has spoken of such issue but I'm sorry the creator isn't doing enough to fix the problem. I see many reviews here demanding a region lock for Chinese players and I'm sorry but I have to agree with them. I know it sounds incredibly harsh but I've had it. Another thing since a massive number of Chinese players are now flooding into the North American server it's almost impossible to find someone who speaks ENGLISH. Whenever I click on the NORTH AMERICAN server I expect players speaking ENGLISH. Seriously the server is named North American but almost no one speaks English. This probably sounds extremely petty but I can't enjoy Duo's or Squad's anymore since I cannot understand a single thing from my teammates. Overall I'm going to be supporting the REGION LOCK demand like many others. I know as I've said before it's harsh but I can't take it anymore.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-01,0,0,644,True,Recommended,This game is still in development so if you don't like buying a game that's undergoing development don't buy this. It has bugs glitches etc... But as someone who can look past these flaws when the game runs well which is most of the time it's a really fun and exciting game. No game in the last year has had me sweat like this... You can play with your friends or by yourself. Both options are enjoyable. This game also has a large amount of guns and attatchments unlike its rivals... So there is plenty of variety. The map is pretty big too and it also has unique features on the map so you know exactly where you are. Honestly the way this game is going now it has a promising future ahead especially with its frequent updates. HOWEVER I do feel the price for this game is slightly too high for what they are bringing to the table for new customers.

I highly recommend this game. I am already very happy with this game but it being in early access gives me hope that much more will come. The one map so far is a perfect size and is overal amazing. With every game I find something new. The game its self I give 9/10. But knowing it will inprove gives me hope that is will become a 10/10Map disignThe map is very well done and is perfectly sized. There are a couple of flaws that I am surtain will be fixed in the near future. I hope that they will add more maps in the future. But to be fair the one map right now could last me days.Hit boxesWith the game in early access it is sure to have some flaws. Many walls you can scope over end up blocking you shot even tho it is obvious that your gun is over it. For hitting players... Im not sure I havent had any problems with that.WeaponsAs with any game I hope that they will add more guns. This im sure will make this game even longer lasting fun. Also for the new comers dont be afraid to shoot 3rd person.VehiclesThe cars in this game are great but are finicy and buggy. This is the one thing I do have a problem with.

2017-06-26,0,0,30,True,Recommended,"GREAT GAME FOR EARLY ACCESS PROS1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle royale PvP games are mostly in Early Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet Deciding your next 'safe spot' etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi realistic weapon recoil bullet travel time and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles weapons weapon mods clothings and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV the game supports both FPS and TPS.8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.CONS1. Currently very performance demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum virtual RAMs can't help your 4 gigs RAM PC. In terms of GPU one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from &lt 30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops crashes and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high end rigs. It happens randomly I don't measure the frequency.UPDATE Although the game is still quite laggy minor performance improvements are already noticeable after the latest updates. I no longer suffer from fps spikes with my GTX1080.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover but 2 seconds later blood spurts out of your chest you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO's Competitive and Dota 2 you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game devs better fix this quickly.As a response to the comments' feedback I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally 1 or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid The controls are NOT reactive horrible for a PvP game.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead the game throws me back 3 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes these happen randomly. Even though this game has many flaws you won't regret buying it. You can expect this from any early access game! The concept of this game is so fun! You all skydive out of a plane (you choose when you eject) that flies across the island. You loot what you can killing anyone you see. As you continue the boundary of the island gets smaller and smaller forcing players to come closer and closer to each other. If you get caught outside the boundary you will start losing health until you die!Overall I give the game 4 stars for the concept ""addictiveness"" etc. not thinking of the server issues.2 or 3 stars out of 5 if we include the server issues.GREAT GAME!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The other guy started chasing me around the house while trying to figure out how to leave him...but I saw his motorcycle! so I took dat and drove off....he took some shots at me while leaving but HE GOT JACKED BUAHAHAH....anyways...I saw dis electrical coming at me and drove back and I notice it was coming at me fast....I then checked the map and realize the area gets smaller and smaller and those caught outside will get zapped! While I had my motorcycle I was driving off the road and it led me to a hill that made me jump out like a ramp and I hit a pole....then i got stuck to it and was like WTF?!....at least I lived though...WRONG it blew up! and thus ended my life.

It's all nice to have when you've got a game that performs good. We used to play with friends evening after evening. That stopped weeks ago. It may be time for you to do something in that direction. Over &amp Out...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-31,0,0,793,True,Not Recommended,With over 400 hours on the game I feel people just starting should get a headsup 1.) SOOOOOOOOOOO many hackers. There are hacks out there right now being advertised that they are undetectable and only $25 and they work!! PUBG knows about this and they do not care. You can report someone for cheating but PUBG does NOTHING about it. 2.) Their nat code needs serious work. Theres no reason I should be shooting at someone who has level 1 gear.. hit them 6 times... they turn around and shoot me once while I have level 2 gear. Doesn't matter the gear their nat code is off. I have videos of me in level 3 gear and getting shot one time and dying after putting a clip into someone with level 1 gear.3.) The vehicle psychics are ridiculous. I've been with this game from the beginning and they have made NO effort to fix the vehicle system. Driving a bike is pretty much suicide as you can hit a pebble in the road and the bike goes flying and you die. They also have a ton of invisible walls around the map that vehicles run into and of course you take damage from. (i.e. like transitioning from grass to a road. ) 4.) They have made adjustments to AFKs however they have missed the most simpliest of fixes for afks.. Don't auto release the parachute. Releasing the parachute should be a manual thing. AFKs won't deploy their chutes and will die on impact. Also... who says I can't release my parachute late to get down first?? If I take a bit of damage who cares.. If i want to get down first and release the chute 50 feet from the ground I should be able to. Taking away the auto deploy of the parachute would solve all the afk problems. Such a simple fix.. missed by the devs. 5.) The server performances have improved however you make 500 million on your game before it's even released the FIRST thing you do is upgrade your hardware.. ANY IT company knows this! Yet they are continuously having server issues that is most liking caused by the overabundance of people playing. Simply upgrading your servers will improve the server performances drastically. (My bachelors in networking tells me this). It will also help with point 2 (the nat code).6.) The third person shooting is off. When holding the right mouse button to third person aim or just freely aiming the aim is off. You have to set the crosshairs to the left of the person in order to hit them. This is due to the POV in the game design. The cursors are off. Even when you have the cursors directly on someone you can see the bullets go through them and hit the wall behind them or whatever. Again this is the NAT code but the fact that the most basic thing for third person (aiming) is off is pretty sad. I appreciate the concept of the game. FPS players and TPS players have been waiting for a game like this for a while. They are so close to being the SERVICE they want however if you are trying to create a SERVICE the most important thing of that service is the CLIENTS you are presenting it to. If it's a piece of crap the clients won't appreciate it and watching the ratings for this game tank the last few months tell me they really need to rethink their gameplan and stop trying to run before you crawl (i.e. tournments NVIDIA intergrations new maps ). Fix the issues before you expand the game. You'll find you'll have more backers. I can't recommend this game at this time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-27,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,Well I bought this game because many of my internet friends said it's an awesome stuff. I absolutely get the hype and why it is so popular.However I dislike a few things. If you play on low settings then the game is going to look like it's from 2006. The textures becomes soo smudgy and I don't really feel I get 300+ FPS in return. Another thing is the movement. You can't climb/jump over things like a short fence. There is no climb animation yet they are still working on it. A lot of bugs...just get over it. The sound is weird too! Sometimes it's too loud but you can mute in game. I have a strange feeling that the developers don't know how to master the Unreal Engine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-27,0,0,323,False,Not Recommended,Now that the game is out fully I can review it how I want... Starting off I can't recommend this game at all. It's a super popular game but at this point its streamer bait. This game has the worse servers ever. Hit dection is just sooooo bad and inventory lag is unbearable. Soooooooo many hackers its 1/3 game you see someone flying and speed hacking. Yes there are very seldom moments of fun but they arent often enough for me to recommened this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-02,0,0,480,True,Recommended,Good game sometimes. The amount of bugs in this game is too high for anyone to count to. Sticky cars lagging servers hit reg all of the things an early access game would have. Here are the things i hate that aren't glitches 1)Getting a drop with a sniper rifle with no damn scope. I dont see the point of getting a sniper and then not having a scope on it! In CSGO the awp for example it would be like only being able to use the awp just you cant use the scope its 100% pointless.2)UAZ. Being one of the vehicles in PUBG its probably going to be laggy right? A bit maybe but when its a damn military van you wouldn't think a small bump would send it flying head over heels would you? This has happened to me and my friends almost more than the bugs in this game.3)Falling damage and cliffs. Falling damage is WAY too muuch in my opinion. There is a small house on a cliff near the military base and getting down the cliff is RIDICULOUS. Fall damage is dumb as you take about a quarter of your health just tripping a few feet and the cliff is only accessible by a single road. No steps no slope just a road where you can get run over easily if there is a car.For these reasons i think this game should get a 6/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-29,0,0,236,True,Not Recommended,This was an amazing game when it launched. Now it is full of hacker 3/4 games we get killed thourgh rocks and other forms of Cover. I dont get how a game that made so much on launch cant keep up with the hackers it shows though. The Rating for this game used to be high now it is Mostly Negative. Get the Hint and DONT BUY THIS GAME. Its is a waste of your money. I wish i could get a refund since in my opionon they company Bluehole can not mantain the online servers nor do they release anything really on time. Heck in the last E3 conferacne they talked about and demoed zombie game play and stated it would be release in a month or two yet nothing now but poor code that has been hack. But this is a Korean Based company so you can not expect much from them hack look at the games they have launched. They where not and are not prepared to deal with a good FPS game. Best of luck and hope this rant helps you in some way. ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-29,0,0,289,True,Not Recommended,The main reason is that Bluehole are being DISRESPECTFUL to their users who bought the game. Making tons of promises and either doing some 1 ultra small update in a month or doing nothing at all. After many days (even months!) and many many funds that Bluhole gained they are still can't improve their game to make it at lease PLAYABLE. Too much bugs NO optimization (i'ts laggy on Intel i7 5700 Nvidia 965 M with LOWEST graphics which is not so good even on ultra) connection problems shutdown problems VERY and VERY slow updating (i can't even feel it after few months of playing PUBG). They said they will release the game until the end of 2017 but i just can't imagine how they are goind to do this with SO MUCH problems that game still has. If they will still release it it won't be a full and released game anyways so +1 to disrespecting us. That's sad. However the game has a potential to become something big and impressive since the gameplay and emotions i got from it was perfect sometimes. I REALLY hope that Bluehole will start to work super hard and intensive to make PUBG a completed game. Until that happen i NOT RECOMMEND buying this game to anyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But there are very many game breaking issues that just really me and my friends off. PROS Skill Based Gunplay I love this a lot its not hitscan. Vehicles Big Map Cannot use .ini files to turn off grass and shadows as of the new update. Decent variety of guns and ammo Attachments and a lot of them Solos Duos and Squads Can turn off auto matchmakin if you have 3 people and don't want to be auto matched with another guy Can choose where to drop off at A very useful and good map and compass Markers/Waypoints Character runs pretty damn fast (Pro in my opinion) CONS t Tickrate I've died numerous times because of the t Tickrate it needs to be higher. Graphics are not that good especially for the performance you get. Needs more optimization Server lag needs to be fixed Some attachments are useless i.e. the 15x scope. It isn't variable and it is way too zoomed in to use. Needs more audio settings like footstep volume and car volume. Needs more Graphic Settings Overall this game is amazing and a lot of fun. But with the tickrate and the server lag it just infuriates me. These need to be fixed as soon as possible. I understand its been out for a few months but these issues are #1 right now.EDIT I love this game so much but after hearing the news about the crate + key system being implemented I'm kind of Player Unknown said that system wouldn't be implemented until the game was out of EA and was finished.

2018-02-08,0,0,612,False,Not Recommended,So i have played a little over 300 hours on this game not a heap but enough to have a decent opinion on the game. The problem with this game is the more you play the worse it gets. Not much point selecting a specific server when they're all full of chinese anyway. This game started off as a pretty well received game and even though it had lots of glitches in early access lots of them were fixed. However this game was rushed to a version 1.0 release and rushed to be released on console. The game is now full of hackers and laggy servers. The developers no longer care about actual gameplay and instead release 6 gig updates entirely based on cosmetics and tiny bug fixes. This game is currently a horribly optimized mess and i would avoid buying it.If your looking for a battle royale game i would suggest playing either Islands of nyne or Escape from Tarkov they are well balanced have dedicated spray patterns and can easily maintain a stable framerate they also constantly receive new content from the developer and bug fixes as well as not being plagued by hackers.Edit 1 Wow what do you know i'm still playing this heap of game i've played another 250 hours since i wrote this review and if i'm being completely honest the game has not improved. The physics engine in this game is so broken you can literally drive over a bump at 10 km/h and end up doing 4 backflips and blowing up. And the game run so badly still how has this not been fixed?I mean how do you even manage to lower the optimisation of the game with every update? Also who thought the event pass was a good idea???

Currently it's in early access and there's only 1 game mode which is around 100 players set foot in a 8x8 km wide island. Guns armor equipments you find them yourself. Last one standing wins. There's solo duo and squad mode. Players can choose to play in first person or third person perspective but there's a mode which players are forced to play in first person perspective. I do enjoy the game. It really gives you the excitement that you're looking for and the anxiety during gunfights.Since the game is still in early access there are still some bugs with the server etc but I'm pretty sure the developers will get it fixed soon because it has gotten a lot better than when I first started playing PUBG. A few features will be added soon such as climbing and vaulting. Although the game might sound plain like how it's always the same map 'people might get bored playing after awhile'. I totally disagree with that because so far I've nearly 40 hours of gameplay which I have played hundreds of rounds I never once quitted because I was bored but only due to my bursting eyebags haha. Let's get back to the topic. This game has unlimited possibilities. There are so many ways you can ambush on an enemy and vice versa.Well there's much more to it but I guess I'll close my case for now. Hope you guys wouldn't change your mind after reading all those poor reviews. Keep in mind this is game is still in early access!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Which is strange considering its only for ' visual ' items ... that have NO EFFECT in game.. Cept maybe letting you run around in a white outfit which sets you up as a giant target.. So Ignore anyone who has a problem with that.. They are just looking for a reason to cry. There are some bugs some terrible an nasty ones.. but they have been slowly patching them . I have played 50 or so games so far with no bug ' having cost me the game '.. If you have a few friends to play with this is a GREAT experience. Is each battle based on RNG? Why yes it is people cry about lack of weapons an being at the mercy of RNG... Guess what everyone has that same chance.. Its part of the experience! Its like these morons crying about ' there were 4 guys who dropped at the house i wanted '.. well guess what.. its a mechanic.. plan for it.. adjust your plan.. hell the circles are random.. so crying about that is similiar! The whole point is you have what you find an adjust as best you can! For the cost you wont find anything as fun! No progression.. just a different experience every time! Though i will say trying to play SOLO isnt overly enjoyable.. Something about working with more people using tactics .. much more fun!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-01,0,0,85,True,Not Recommended,The game was fun at the beggining like most hits but success got to the development team's head and PlayerUnknown himself thinks he hasnt done anything. The gamerelies mainly on luck no skill whatsoever. You can lan on a building which you think is oaded with gear yet you only find clothing or melee weapons if youre lucky. Jump house to house with only your crowbar and then surprise you get a face full fo lead cuse there was no weapon to be found.Now they adding payed keys to unlock crates the only reason you would like to jump right back in to this games was because of he BP system in which you earn points to by loot crates. But now the take that away and leave you with a bland game hat provides no pleassure no rewarding experience for winning no progression no nothing. KotK feels better in that sense cause you have somewhat of a reward and recognition for how you played the game. But this is just trash I do not recommend this game you will have a bad time and mainly now hat this is a game that protect streamers and get you banned for honking or just killing them.

2017-09-05,0,0,198,True,Not Recommended,TL DR Game is poorly optimised buggy and the developers care more about making money than fixing them.Despite the global success of this game the developers have decided to on the community and divert time and resources into implementing paid cosmetic features rather than fixing game breaking bugs and issues. I have a decent spec system and this game is an absolute resource . It crashes all the time and even when I can play the game has serious frame drops. Sometimes it will freeze for up to a couple of seconds which obviously leads to deaths in firefights.

I cannot recommend this game so much is subject to change and microtransactions have already slipped into it while it is incomplete.Some of the recent updates have ruined the flow of the game drag and dropping gear is now slowed and nearly ed the pace of the game this was clearly done because certain players just couldn't keep up and it restricts fast players.UPDATE I was right this game was a cash grab don't buy this garbage after microsoft purchased rights to the game they rushed a console port out and stopped giving a single about making the game stable.

2017-05-29,1,2,759,True,Recommended,So you want to know a bit about battlegrounds before you buy this rather expensive battle royale shooter right?Well I will give you a bit of an insight into the game which might sway your mind about buying this game.Now we have to get past the fact that this is an early access game and has only been given access to the public on steam for 2 months now. So clearly there will still be some mechanics that need to be fixed in the game and I am sure those areas will be addressed as the game gets updated monthly. And yes the game is being updated monthly by it's highly active developers which is a key part of making a great game. This game is like H1Z1 in a way with its same concept of a large open area with weapons and vehicles scattered around and 100+ other players to battle against. There is also a barrier that closes in periodically limiting the area that players on the playing ground can be in. However you still can go past the barrier but it deals damage over time and deals more damage as the game goes on.Now that we've got the kind of blurb of the game out of the way let's get onto the pros and cons of the game so far.(Keep in mind some of these are my own opinions)Pros The game is so thrilling that it brings up your heart rate substantially making it a very intense and exciting game There are loads of weapons to find There is a huge map with tons of houses to loot and new areas to explore Your play style is completely determined by where you drop in the map The developers are updating the game monthly which means there will be new items and fixed bugs every month There is a variety of attachments you can add to your weapons to customise them and get that small advantage over your foes. You have an ability to look round corners to survey the area such as in a house. This stops those pesky shotgun users who hide round corners waiting for their unsuspecting enemies to pass through the door.Cons Aiming can be a little bit finicky sometimes and when you think you hit someone it won't register it. However this is probably being fixed by the developers or is fixed by the time you're reading this. Jumping needs a bit of a rework in game because jumping seems a bit off such as when you try and jump a fence sometimes you make it and sometimes you don't and also you can't jump and move forward Strafing is a major part of PvP combat but the game doesn't really seem to account for strafing and it's hard to avoid fire because you can't sprint left or right and you just slightly move from side to side and you become an easy target. There are a lot of performance issues and network issues due to the amount of players and the amount of servers being used. The game is very performance hungry and will challenge even the best computers. I myself can run the game rather smoothly and my PC is using 16 GB of RAM and the internet says that if you don't have 6 GB of RAM then you won't be able to run it. 6GB would be the minimum and you'd need to have a high level graphics card too such as a NVIDIA GTX 970. Vehicle mishaps are very common and you can be doing very well in game and die to a tiny bump in a field whilst in a vehicle.So overall this game is one of my personal favourites so far. Sure it has its downsides but all games do even after early access but as I said this game has amazing developers who are working hard to fix all the problems the game has so far.The game may be pricey but it's definitely worth it due to its variety of gameplay and heart racing thrills. It will leave you wanting to win so you'll try again and again and again. Thank you for your time. I hope this helped )Update PUBG 1.0 is coming out real soon! Some time in December (Hopefully) Thats with no delays of course.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-10,0,0,454,False,Not Recommended,"I really want to love this game man. It does the ""Battle Royale"" formula better than any of it's competition BUT.......CONS... Let me first start by saying the servers for this game are AWFUL. Considering the scale of the game the servers should be powerful enough to handle it right??? No... they run like dog with people lagging all over the place especially during the most important part of the game.. The intial drop. as soon as you get your boots on the ground enter a building and try to pick up a weapon you find yourself SPAMMING F to pick up whatever is in front of you. In addition to having horrible starting combat which consists of whoever has the ier internet wins the fight because on his screen you aren't behind the cover that you were running for. The loot is so horribly random sometimes you find yourself frustrated because you loot an entire building and walk out with a flashbang and the guy next door has a M16 with a 4X and armor. (I'm not complaining too much about this but I find myself to always be the unlucky one) Optimize your game I can't believe that they had a tournament for this game in the state that it's in. Sometimes you will load in and your buildings will look like PS1 Graphics and other times your buildings won't even load in and then you will get stuck in a wall. (ps I don't have a bad PC either i7 and a 1080) So I can't even try to comprehend how someone with a bad PC could play this game and the Xbox version of this game is just a ing joke lol. Being able to pick the server you want to play seems like a good idea on paper but in reality it is the worst idea ever. Like I said before the higher the ping the more advantage you have. Chinese players are just running around North American servers Cheese their way around with their high ping. I can't even tell you how many times I've been killed by players with names like Xhang Ping4354325 or Rihg yao fsade3. Miramar aka the desert map is the best/worst thing to come to the game. The map design is amazing compared to the OG map But everytime I ready up and I pop into the new map I want to leave. It is TOO big for 100 players there are too many points of interest so most of the time you end up maybe getting into a fight midway endgame which makes the matches so long drawn out and boring. Gun balance is a weird topic when it comes to this game because everything seems to be balanced but when you think of it what guns are you drawn to as a player. Most people would say the Kar98k or the M416. This is because these are the safer options unlike the AK or the SKS which boths recoil are just unusable in my opinion. Which leads me to come to the conclusion that some guns need some work to make them more well rounded like the M4 Mini14 and the M16.Pros.. You will never have your heart race in any other game like this game.

2017-12-23,1,2,926,False,Not Recommended,They Ruined my favorite game. Desert map is terrible. Game looks fuzzy and has weird shadows. 1.0 is garbage. The game has been going downhill ever since the patch that added the Groza. Vehicles are death traps slide all over the terrain and blow up randomly. Everything that has been implemented into this game reduces the skillful aspect of the game. Crouch jumping was something a player had to master to take advantage of now you can just vault (and randomly die at times to a vaulting glitch). Bullet drag makes it impossible to hit shots at +300m consistently especially on moving targets. The desert map is way too big in cities there are thousands of angles you can get shot from and the mid game on the desert map is a boring and involves running 1000's of meters to get to the zone. I have a lot of hours into this game and thoroughly enjoyed most of the early access. I am an above average player who has 200+ chicken dinners and know what I am doing (https //pubgtracker.com/profile/pc/LucaEats?region agg).

2017-10-03,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,This will more than likely update as the game updates and fixes issues.PUBG pretty much right now is a glitch fest. The shots are no where near accurate compaired to other third person and First Person games such as ARMA 2 and 3 and quite frankly is very unoptimized for older graphics cards (900 series for Nvidia). What I do like about this game is the fact that there are guns similiar to the real world counter part. The problem that I see with this game as of right now is that there are too much issues with hit registration and if you lag you are pretty much winning from the get go. My advice to people who are wanting to go with a battle royal game go with the one that has been out more which is H1Z1 rather than this one. Again once this game gets fully released (if ever) I will update it as it probably has more bug fixes and tweaks. Public Release Review Not much has changed with this game. Hit Registration is poor and if you don't have internet speeds about the national average in the US expect to die A LOT. Net coding is still garbage and instead of adding new features maybe they the developers should focus on improving their engine instead of this. Don't get me wrong the new map is beautiful and fun but they should have focused on Long Term Support rather than adding new features and making sure that this game was good enough for it to be publicly released. I find that as a consumer that people want to follow trends but like I stated above go with the people who started it first which was ARMA 3 mods and H1Z1. Mini Royal Review Again same issues still horrible net coding and hit regs are still garbage and hackers are still more prevalent than ever instead of fixing the issues BlueHole decided to release DLC and decided to not to fix the unoptimized garbage of a game. No wonder Fortnite Battle Royal is become more popular than this. They actually take time to fix their coding and seeing what the players want.

2017-12-26,0,0,229,False,Not Recommended,"I'm going to have to be honest here I don't know why this game is so popular still.If there were just a few things different about this game it'd be worth voting up and recommending to your friends.But it's not.Starting with the gameplay There's only a select few shooter games that utilize realistic ballstics (Arma Battlefield and this game are the only ones I can think of save maybe the Sniper Elite series but that's a debateable topic). This would be cool if your bullets ever registered properly.The servers run on average at about 17Hz. In simpler terms that means the server ""refreshes"" 17 times every second to register changes in the game shots impacts movements items collected etc. To put that into perspective most FPS games run between 30 60 CS GO (I believe) runs at 64Hz League of Legends at 30. This isn't even going into the beginning of the match where the high player density forces the servers to deteriorate to an 8Hz refresh rate abysmal by any stretch of the imagination. (Battle(non)sense did a video over this showing the details of this game compared to Fortnite which uses the same game engine and both use Amazon server hosting https //www.youtube.com/watch?v SwZ_NUruGTM).All this translates to Absolutely despicable ""rubberbanding"" that is at times so unbearable it's not even worth playing (http //www.ign.com/videos/2017/12/20/playerunknowns battlegrounds rubber banding is still the biggest problem with pubg on pc skip to about 40 seconds but I'm sure you've seen/heard countless other examples even worse than this one) Shots that were so obviously direct hits not registering being shot when completely behind cover shooting people square in the face with a shotgun yet they live sometimes not even taking a shred of damage (https //www.youtube.com/watch?v XqwhekZdBP4 https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 1KWw8I8dp6M &lt that one is a definitive example) Having to click items/doors multiple times before it registers you picked the item up/opened the door causing you to hover in one position just trying to get a garbage pistol or shotgun (that won't even register the hit) before someone comes up and jumps up and 1 shots you with their fist (logic!)The graphics have been improved tremendously since early access. This game was notoriously unoptimized pushing even the highest tiered systems to their limits on low graphics. Now you'll receive proper performance for your system (graphics wise gameplay wise you're f****ed bud) and running it at a constant 60fps shouldn't be an issue for any mid tier gaming rig.The audio is perhaps not as bad as it could be with long range shots actually sounding long range (you'll see/hear the bullet land on you/near you before you hear the shot itself) and suppressors being semi realistic in that they don't turn your weapon into a subsonic noiseless death machine that can barely be heard from 15 feet away. The biggest issue lies in footsteps because if there are people running around you outside the building you're in or above/below you in the same building you will have NO IDEA where they are because the sounds are just... whack. Even using a surround sound headset will barely help.Yet that is almost an unnoticeable issue when you consider just how atrocious the hit registration and lag issues are with this game.I have held off in throwing stones at this game for the longest time as I knew it was still in early access and likely had a very long way to go. We're now almost a year into development and somehow the gameplay has become worse. At first you will utterly fall in love with this game constantly clicking the play button again even though you knew that your last death was total rubbish. You will happily loot 3 cities and get all the best loot just to get in a 15 second long sniper battle and lose it all just to dust it off and play again. But this game will slowly begin to take its toll on your patience like dealing with a bad partner in a relationship you'll rationalize the negatives focus solely on the unquestionable positives and pretend like there's nothing wrong.Well there's a lot wrong. In the current state of the game it's not worth purchasing. There are a lot of much better more satisfying games that you could spend $30 on. Maybe in a few months when (if) they sort the game breaking issues out and provide steady server tickrates (at a rate higher than the painful 17Hz average) then purchasing it could be worthwhile. Until then Bluehole (PUBG Corp whatever the hell they want to call themselves) have a long LONG way to go still.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is not a single reason to play the game like a normal fps or battle royal and I don't mean that in that the game has a special niche gameplay. I mean it has the absolute worst gameplay you'd ever find. There have been times where I will drop with a guy and he will find himself in a safe spot where I have to push him and he will not move for 20 minutes until he is just about to die to the circle. What kind of gameplay is that? And don't get me started on fighting from tree to tree it is the worst experience anyone could ever have just dull boring encounters where every single opposing player is a complete bi .

PUBG is a running simulator and anyone who has played it can't deny it. The maps are too big the optimization is terrible especially for a company that has grown to this size and the gameplay becomes very boring and repetitive over time.

2017-03-31,0,0,91,True,Recommended,Best Battle Royale to date.I know we have all said this at some point but still dude this is good. Feels much more polished and just well done than Kotk. What's best is that you can almost always continue to search because you want that lvl 3 on Helm Vest and Backpack. Also there are weapon modifications like bigger mag scope all that. So it really encourages you to continue searching also i feel it's much more easier to find vehicles in this than Kotk you can basically just follow a main road and eventually you'll find one.I know how early access is and i don't know if the devs will become money s like all the others after a while. But currently they are gold haven't done anything yet. I am very satisifed with what i got for the price. I know many may disagree with me on this one but still i'm satisfied. Also if they keep their promises to make this game better it would be amazing (i'm very sceptical of this due to Early Access History)Long Story Short i recommend this. It got depth in searching for stuff and also very great physics in driving also shooting feels impactful. Biggest concern would be the lag but devs have said this is their priority #1.

Then I see this game on the top sellers on steam and thought it looked pretty cool. Thinking battle royal games weren't by cup of tea I was hesitant in buying it. I ended up getting it obviously and I think I am addicted. Something about this game just satisfies me so much. While gun balance isn't perfect it feels so rewarding getting a kill. While certain areas have better loot than others I still find myself exploring the map for new places to loot. To some the slower tactical pace of the game is off putting but I love it. While I have gotten quite tilted and mad from other multiplayer games like CSGO and mobas like everyone I don't get mad at all playing PUBG. Even when twice in a row I got 2nd in solo almost getting my first win ever (at the time) I didn't get mad. While I find many things great about the game I have experienced as many issues with it as the next guy. Yes optimization isn't the best. Yes I've lagged super hard many times. Yes the game has crashed for me more than once. Remember though this is in early access and as of now hasn't even been out on steam for a week.

This post will be one of them.PROS So let's cut to the chase here the game is fun. It's one of the ""survival""/royale early access done right. The devs are churning out content by a lot. Lots has been promised many of which has been fulfilled. No reason to think they won't go to the moon.CONS So I'll divide this into two parts. the game play and the politics. First the gameplay.GAMEPLAY CONS Game is highly unoptimized. If you have anything older than current gen hardware expect to lag every game. There are no ""recommended"" currently because they are still figuring out optimizations but don't hold your breath for something grand.You need a fast harddrive or even SSD to run the game. Loading of the in game environment is highly dependent on the speed of the HDD so if you don't have a fast one expect your buildings not to load. This is majorily game breaking and is the difference between life and death as you struggle to pick up loot.Car physics are awful but doable. Expect to be thrown into the moon if you drive over a small crevice. POLITICS CONS Devs promised there not be microtransactions and it was found out the game will have microtransactions soon. They claim it's for their tournaments but tournaments for an early access game is a poor allocation of resources. Even if it wasn't they still broke their promise.So Playerunknown (PU) is the lead dev behind the game. PU is a massive abuser of his power. He has banned people from twitter and discord for having people disagree with him. He has banned players without evidence or due process. PU has also been in bed with the small streaming community carrying out their ban wish list on ""stream snipers"" without any evidence.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However the hacking is ruining this game little by little and so far it seems the developers can not find a good way to stop these hackers. I will not recommend this game to anyone unless the developer could somehow find a way to eliminate these hacks.The hacking is particularly harzadous to this game compare to other shooting games. the player experience is extremely fratrusting if your squad did everything right and survived for 20 mins and then killed by a single hacker in few seconds all by headshot. I will just list a few hacking method that I have seen so far in the game 1. AimBot 2. Display all player's position3. running faster than Usain Bolt4. punching you from 20 yards away while you have no clue where you got hit at. 5. never die no matter how hard got hitand etc.Just avoid this game until hacking issue is resolved.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Cheaters are ruining what is currently the best game I've seen released from 1st or 3rd person shooters ever. 1.5 million cheaters banned and still you find a cheater (duo or squad) or a team (solo) every 2nd game. Some simple solutions 1. Create servers with no battle points. Stop cheaters farming crates. Make crates random drops on these servers at a 1/50 rate for any player who spawns into the game but completely seperate from the position you come or kills ratio. 2. Hire more people to deal with banning. 1.5 million x $30 $45 million you've raked in from cheating bans. That is a hole lot of high school students who could check for cheaters on minimum wage. 3. Region lock. I play in oceania. Not many NZ Aussie or polynesian players. Enough said. 4. Use in game death cam footage to check hackers (still being asked to send videos to prove cheating and teaming when clearly this info is hosted on your servers somewhere). 5. Consider banning IP addresses rather than steam accounts. This is pretty extremem but perhaps will make a difference.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

With constant lag issue's that to be fair are improving a little with every update it's amazing it made it this far and got as popular as it did. The netcode/optimization issues are finally being listened to a little bit but i personally feel with the money they have made most of those problems should be fixed by now if not perfected.This most recent update basically changed the game completely. Just when everyone got used to the last update they drastically changed things again. Now micro transaction? We all saw this coming.. It's only a matter of time before that one big BR title is going to come out and swallow PUBG whole. Fortnite hurt numbers bad enough as it is.With that being said though and the player base still somewhat holding strong. For the price I say it's worth it. It can be thrilling and fun but also raging and toxic. Beware certain Discords don't let bad communities ruin your expirience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

EDIT2 can i not get oneshot in the leg with a crosbow every game?EDIT3 can this game not be terribly optimized to a point where battlefield one on ultra and call of duty world at war can both get over 260 frames and at lowest 130 during heavy action while this game hapily gets 160 at the loading screen then when i load in i get a measly 10 40 even though most if not all of my settings have been turned down to potato and my resolution was changes as well?EDIT4 why is everyone so accurate? like a guy with a m4 on a hill is like full auto spraying and hits me for like 90 percent of the shots while im in a window like barely peekig and just every shot hits.Pros you can be dumb. drive cars.use medical supplies.Cons be wearing level 3 helmet and armor get onshot by a crossbow to the leg. be wearing level three helmet and armor get oneshot by an ump. have a 4 man squad with a mix of level 2 and 3 armor get decimated by one guy with crossbow who oneshots us all while i confirmed i had shot him 4 times in the head with sks along with the pepper spray of bullets from my allies. audio randomly switches side(confirmed this game only) and will trick your ears into thinking a guy is to your right front when he is actually behind you about to play with your dead body that is not so dead untill you turn around and spray a full clip at them and realize 7 shots to the chest from a scar l does nothing to someone else wearing level 1 armor. Multiple hackers met multiple times over a weak even after reporting found one who i reported 3 times before over the course of three weeks. land with someone and find a machete a level one vest multiple weapon attachements in a 4 building cluster while enemy seems to have looted a smaller and only one building just a few yards off and have level 3 armor helmet M16 SKS with tons of attatchments that should not be possible from one building alone. end up hating life because you got 8 kills and make it to the last 3 but some seems to have x ray vision and can see where you are in a bundle of bushes and heashot you even though i was 9000000000000% sure even superman would have not seen you. people with ungodly aim with a shotgun probably better than shroud and oneshot you with a shotgun across a field far out of the guns logical range even with a choke while he seems to have taken two grenades and 2 shots from an ak with no problem. this list can go on and on but im a salty boi who sucks at anything that is not using my right hand professionally.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-24,0,0,868,True,Recommended,I don't usually often write game reviews but I will tell you something game is simply amazing fun.If you play it with you friends then game is totally terrific but for me it's little boring to play it alone but hey if you want to grind BP points then solo is way to go.This game is all about 60% luck and 40% skill. Aim always helps you but luck factor is damn high here because you never know what is gonna be in the next house what loot and who is gonna be inside (except sound is important you can hear other player's moves). Also second important thing is knowing the map and where to go. So if you have good feeling for orientation on the map then this is also a huge plus.Also game currently game has performance issues for now (on my PC FPS can drop easily but my PC isn't very top notch) game is not that very fluid for now. And I think that game should have at least better looking graph (when you see how game is running not that quite good) but hey nothing is perfect and DEVs are gonna soon release 1.0 release of the game so if you ask me I think it's gonna be worth. I mean I just hope DEVs are gonna make game more fluid for lower/middle end PCs.I recommend this for buying because this game has proved already that's it is worth of the time for playing. Positive things Good replayability VERY fun with friends Current map in early access is pretty good designed + more maps to come Game is developing pretty fast in early access patches are coming frequently Grinding BP points (depends of the player but this is something which pulls you forward to play this game more)Negative things Luck factor (random loot finding other players etc) Graph. should look better Random performance issues/fps drops especially on lower/middle end PCs,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-09,0,0,269,False,Not Recommended,"Here's all I've got to say 1. I originally bought the game because it promised good mod support they turned their backs on that promise.2. Brendan Greene Lead Dev claims that all custom servers will require a fee to run stating that it's how he had to run his mods back in his Arma 3 days Let alone that this game doesn't even allow real mod support Arma 3 lets you run servers on your own hardware you only paid to rent other people's servers. PUBG gives no choice but to rent a server.3. A heftily priced game which offers essentially one real mode Yet has the audacity to charge for cosmetics have made free means of gaining cosmetics absolutely insignificant and now also charges for a sort of Season Pass which is blatantly derivative off that of Fortnite's yet offers SIGNIFICANTLY less. Furthermore Fortnite has a free version of their BattlePass which offers nearly as much as PUBG's. How bout that?4. Game still runs like 5. To continue from point 3 The publishers have the audacity to attempt to sue other games for ""copying"" the Battle Royale mode even though Game Modes should never be liable to copyright Yet this PUBG mimics so many of the other Royale modes As mentioned with Fortnite's Battle Pass Emotes the new spotting functionality etc.6. And to continue from Point 5 the developers and publisher have so much audacity as if it forgets that the game is virtually asset flip one. It doesn't hide the fact that many of its 3D models were bought from the Unreal Engine store It makes you wonder how much more of the game was outsourced.7. The devs like to parade around how many hackers they've banned and the effort they put into keeping the game hacker clean yet it's mortifying how much this game is STILL plagued by hacking. Fanboys will parrot how ""it's not that frequent"" Hackers being noticeable in the first place is insufferable I've yet to encounter a hacker in Fortnite and so many other shooters I used to play. But most importantly you will have your game ruined by some hacker every 6 games. You can still argue that ""it's not a lot"" relatively but it still ruins your day with the game.8. The game is infested with bugs like the pantry of a run down restaurant in Eastern Belarus. Seriously more often than not the game handicaps you being of some bug.People that defend this game religiously will claim I'm so Fortnite fanboy like I've seen so many times before I've played my far share of Fortnite I have about 40 hours in it compared to my 270h here and I have to say I used to prefer PUBG. I found it a lot more enjoyable. But whilst I play neither now I can only say Fortnite is an objectively better game and it does it for free. You know what look beyond Fortnite go to Realms Royale go to the Darwin Project Go to The Culling even go to Ring Of Elysium! Because those games have polish and real originality that PUBG severely lacks. Not only is PUBG an absolute trainwreck it's one that is commandeered by developers that give absolutely no about the player experience or ethics.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Pubg was bringing in players rapidly which also meant a huge income and when I see that a free to play is more into their community than a pay to play it makes me not want to play due to the lack of new cool features and fixes on bugs that would drive me crazy.

2018-08-07,0,0,130,False,Not Recommended,I want to like this game but I just cant. I havent been playing this game a whole lot but by watching videos reading news about the game and playing it myself I think Its best if you leave this game alone. PUBG could be a good game but the devs are focusing way much more on their mobile version of PUBG (which no one asked for) and then there also focusing their Xbox version way much more than the PC version. Then PUBG corp is trying to make a sport out of this game a unfinished game! PUBG has many bugs and glitches and then not to mention the unplayable lag at times. Plus the devs are extrememly I mean over the top EA level greedy. Their stupid battle pass didint even allow players to keep the free items instead you have to pay for the battle pass to actually keep the free items or else there was a time limit on those items and you'll eventually lose them then to top it all off they want you to pay 2 dollars for a damn key to open one of their crates almost every crate needs a key and some of the clothing in those crates are 0000.1% chance to get them how do I know this? simple. I watched a youtube called TheActMan explaining how this game basically steals your money and dosent give you anything back. Look I want to like this game and it has great potential to be a decent battle royal game but sadly the devs are slowly killing their game just like the h1z1 devs did. So for now im going to let this game go and maybe try it again until the devs actually fix the damn game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-09,0,0,145,False,Not Recommended,How do you make the worst most popular game on steam? Simple you have a company like blue hole make it. While the core gameplay loop is fun and very interesting the game it self is a hot mess. From making a server transition from AWS to Azure during a massive and major update period. To having FOV rendering based on the client side and not server side. To running the worst possible tick rate on a server you can think of all the way to implementing features without fixing core elements. This game has in all in the list of do not's in a shooter. I know this review is nothing and it will mean nothing. But I feel it's important to stress how utterly bad this game is. If you some how have magically not bought this game yet by now please do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs. The dev team for this game haven't the slightnest clue what they are doing. The performance is better than it was at launch but it's still awful. The game is runnign on a 32 bit client for who knows what reason. Screen tearing and out of no where fps drops are still common and unexpected. Hit detection is unthinkably bad for a game this popular. The number of times i have seen or watched bulllets fly through someones face into a wall and do nothing is insane. The phyisics in the game are still completely broken often fiding things like cars spiraling out of control and flying off into the sky is still common. Things like server delay on those actions means you can fall down a cliff for 5 feet take half your health in damage. Only to be killed by a person who jumps off a flying motorcycle and falls two stories kill you. Avoid this game until someone else can fix it's issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Vehicle control and iteraction is just a joke. Seeing who is landing near your jump zone is impossible to determine because some players are just stright up invisible so you have no time to adjust your play. Jumping and clearing small obsticles is laughable at best so the basic fundamentals of a shooting game just arent present. There is 1 Map released so it gets old fast and 75% of the time the game ends on military base.. very repedative.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-02,0,0,489,True,Not Recommended,This game was awesome when it first came out however the more they try to add to the game the worse it has gotten. You will have good days where servers run smooth but those days are rare. The consistancy of weapon damage is terrible one day an M 16 will wreck and the next day it will be complete garbage. When you think you have the jump on someone and shoot them four times direct hits think again they turn and one pop you when you ahve a level 3 helmet with a UMP. Armor is super glitchy put a patch to fix it an only made it worse. The list goes on and on it just is slowly killing the game. Instead of fixing what is known problems they keep trying to add more Vaulting weapons weather. JUST FIX THE GAME!!! I loved this game and took a break from it to come back to have it be almost unpalyable. Hackers are every where now speed runners with aim bots are the best. You even see them in nearly every top streamers stream. Devs are doing nothing to fix the issues and it has become an infestation of who can have the best hacks.

2018-06-27,0,0,1646,False,Not Recommended,"I've held off from reviewing this game for as much as I can hoping that all the things wrong with it would get fixed but no dice. This game in its CURRENT state is not worth a recommendation. As with anything there are good and bad points to bring up. To not seem one sided I thought I'd list both. Really fun WHEN it works. Playing with friends in either duos or squads is solid. Great teamwork building game. Runs pretty well even on the lowest settings. However there are more negative things with this game currently than positive. The gameplay is laggy. This bothers me as much as it does considering it was pretty decent pre Sanhok update. I expect a ""patch or update"" to be just that and not a step backwards such as this was. Then there is still the issue with hackers. I don't think I've ever played a game that had more hackers playing than this one. The whole ""banned however many millions of hackers playing"" is not something to be proud of guys. It should not be that easy for millions of people to be hacking. Another thing is the total lack of accurate weapon stats. Dont appreciate it when a game says weapons like shotguns are ""one shot"" within a certain range and when I find myself in those situations with a shotgun its now a 2+ shot scenario. Whereas everyone I go up against almost always one shots me but from futher than ""one shot"" range. Not to mention the shooting through solid obstacles and the game registering a ""hit"". This is something that really irks me considering it shouldn't exist seeing as how no attachments in this game allow for bullet penetration through barricade blocks or solid stairs. Also the vehicles are very one sided as well. Dont like it when I'm driving a vehicle (UAZ) and my car is taking a ton of dmg and explodes from one clip of gunfire as i drive by someone who is camping say the edge of the zone. Yet in another game a different person is driving the same vehicle and is driving by and I unload 2 if not 3 clips into their vehicle (because they stopped/turn around) and then it explodes. Basic math says 30 does not equal 60 or 90. I really just hope this game gets fixed. It has great potential. All of which is marred by the fact that making money is the main goal of this company. When really if you focused on fixing all the problems with this game and did so then people would maybe be more inclined to buy one of the many in game purchases you guys keep adding. In its current state however I will not put a single penny into this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-19,0,0,504,True,Recommended,"This game is an excellent survival shooter if you aren't playing on a low end machineI might not be the most qualified person to make such review as I don't have much of a history in playing FPS so if you're looking how this compares to something like DayZ or CS GO and such you're probably stoping at the wrong place to read a review. Either way I will do what I can to give my fair and basic evaluation of PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS.Pros+ 8 km X 8 km island.+ 100 people. That's a lot. Right?+ Speaking of ""a lot"". This game has a huge playerbase. + Once you die or win it's quick to jump right into another server.+ Loot such as guns and armour and other spawn related items such as cars and boats are generally randomized. So you almost never know what to expect when going to the same building twice. Last game there was a sweet First Aid there last time. Let's go there again this game! Oh nope this time there's a level 1 helmet this game.+ Both singleplayer and multiplayer are equally strong points in this game. Which mean basically it boils down to whether you prefer to fight on island with 99 other players all by yourself or with your buddies.+ So far the crate system is better than half what I've seen exists out there. It's there merely for cosmetic reasons not weapon or stat atvantages. (or pay to win atvantages if you will)+The shrinking zone circle concept helps give a nice balanced pace to the game. You can still play a good game of being a camper and sniping people. This basically prevents the option of you and people camping at a corner of a map for a long extensive period of time.+ It caters to those with different style of play. I've already mentioned one on my previous ""pros"" point. If you like to find a house bunk in there and wait to pick off people at a distance. You can do that. If you have a more aggressive style of play where you're almost always on the move. that works too. Like hanging out at the edge of the circle or dead center of it? Yup! That works too! Prefer landing in busy places like School or Millitary Base? Or do you like to land in more rural areas? No problem! I've seen various play styles people do and they've won Chicken Dinners all alike!Though it could be because of a bit of luck and skill too that's affecting. I hear occasionally that ""patience"" with the right skill is the key to victory.+ Decent variety of weapons. Unfortunatly I can't say much because I still don't have enough knowledge and experience to say whether the weapon is inherently good or bad or is there some better off in certain situations or does the style of play the player does effects which weapon would be best suited for him/her.+ bullet speed and bullet drops. Which means depending on the distance of your target you you'll have to lead your shots esspiecally if it's a moving target. It's a lovely challenge.+ The physics for the cars in this game can be pretty hilarious sometimes. I'm making fabulous memories with some friends because of this. This could be a con for some people but I'm making it a pro. Some of my favorite moments is some goofy thing that happens with a car.+ Pretty much everything you do builds up to that insanely intense end game fight. Where everyone goes into try hard mode. Kinda like that feeling you get in Overwatch when the payload is on the final checkpoint and is in Overtime. Lol.+ Now includes First Person Perspective as an alternative option to the standard Third Person Perspective. Widening the range of more players who prefer true FPS games.Cons Not nessesarily a huge biggy but I will mention this The points (BP. You use this to buy crates.) system seems to encourage a rather....passive play. What I mean is that you get rewarded a bunch of points for winning a chicken dinner but the points you get very much pales in comparison what you get when getting kills. Which means your only kill could be the very last kill and you would be getting more points than the person next to you who lost and got 10 kills in the entire game. I might be exaggerating but only by a little if such is the case. The game lacks a system where it puts you in servers with players with same or similar skill levels. This could be a good thing but right now I see it more as a con because I'm still somewhat of a noob even after 126 hours. There are some players you face that are just simply beyond your league in headshot skills (It's possible I might be spoiled with games such as Rocket League that has such a system.)Heck I'm still trying to familarize myself with all the weapons because bullet speed and bullet drop stats and damage output differ in each gun. Which also leads me to my next point. Lack of practice range mode or ability to customize your own game. Only selected few right now can make their own servers. At the moment your best bet is just watch Youtube video guides and just practice from lots from trial and error. Unoptimized and clunky with some considerablly noticeable bugs. This con is actually pretty huge. Bigger than all my previous cons put toghther. If you're computer's processor and graphics isn't above average you'll easily be experiecing FPS problems to a point it affects your overall ability to play the game skillfully. You will have to crank all your settings to very low and hope you can play something smooth at that level.Mind you the devs have improved it a little since I first bought the game. But they still have work to do and I hope they continue to polish this game up. and because of this major con I don't recommend this game with players with below average gaming machines. And I'll bet this is partly why the overall review rating for this game is suffering a bit.And bugs in this game could be use some work too. Example sometimes I get weird things happening with opening or closing doors. Sometimes I have door closed and it behaves like a open door vise versa.SummaryOverall the moments you get in this game can be more rewarding than other games but also more punishing because you only get one life. That's it. If you die it's all over. You need to start from the beginning again. Not like a tyipical arcade like setting where you just respawn in a few seconds and get a chance to make a comeback. Every desicion you make counts. And because of the higher risks and more on the line that's what makes it more rewarding when you get kills and chicken dinners. But at the cost dealing with fustrating games too. I've had days with this game where I felt like I was on top of the world then some days that just were utterly fustrating to the point I just wanted to uninstall the game.Even though the frame drops can be a struggle at the end of it all the pros experience in this game outweighs it all for me and is enjoyable enough that I will overlook the issues most of the time.Every game is different even if you're playing the same map over and over again. Giving many hours of replayability. I have a blast with this game! Esspiecally with my friends! One of them whom recommended the game to me! And I don't regret buying it!Thanks for reading my review! )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,137,False,Not Recommended,It is a great love+hate game. I like the concept and the gameplay. But the bugs are seriously ruining this game. I've had desync issues so bad that I have shot a shotgun at someone in front of me and all that happens is white dust comes out and when I check the killcam turns out I was looking all the way to the right. The game needs its bugs fixed and the game being this broken at this point in time is absolutely unnaceptable. Lately I have been playing Fortnite more not only because the game is far less buggier but it also ties in with PUBG's 2nd issue. The maps are far too big. If you drop across the map and the safe zone is on the other side good luck getting there without a vehicle. Not only this but its so hard to find players. You spend 30 minutes walking around barren buildings looting then when you get in combat you are not prepared because the monotony wore you down to the point where you aren't even focusing. I know they are adding a new map to fix this but what good is that if there is no map selector? I hate the desert map but Im forced to play on it because there is no way to pick the map I want to play on. This game is at times amazing but unfortunately these days it is an absolute annoyance to play. I play Fortnite more nowadays and I hope this game can actually fix itself to a functioning and playable state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-21,1,2,165,False,Not Recommended,So this game is actually a lot of fun I alwasy bashed it because I thought the idea was stupid and wouldn't be any fun at all. But here's the thing 1. The world mechanics are kind of bad so be prepared to be killed by being stuck between something constantly 2. Be prepared for the vehicle mechanics to be basically a joke (idk if anyone who created pubg has ever driven a vehicle before). You'll hit huge jumps and die off of a blade of grass or you'll swerve so badly off of a mild turn into a tree and explode. 3. PROBABLY THE MOST AGGROVATING the gun mechanics you'll see what I mean when you start tinkering around with the different guns. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ONLY REASON ANYONE HAS ISSUES WITH THIS ING GAME IS THE DAMN CHINESE HACKERS!!!! IT is SO prevelant I literally did not listen to the reviews because I thought it was butt hurt kids who were bad but any time you make it to top 10 just be prepared for some chinese scripter kid spinning around with aim snap on your head to kill you.

2017-04-17,0,0,489,True,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS a semi realistic (compared to ARMA series) battle royale gameI've seen people plays it I've played the game for a few couple games (mostly solo) and as an early access game this game nails it. Now as in many early access games you'll (almost) never gonna get ""the best experience"" from the game immediately since it's still in early development. But personally I had fun and it's just gonna get even better as incoming patch and updates comes. You may confused as you play your first couple games as the lack of detailed information in the UI that I have to check on the control settings to learn each function of the game which is acceptable in this state of early development so yea not really a game breaking problem really you just have to acknowledge that as you commit to buy an early access products.So the game starts as you drop off a plane to decides where you want to spawn then as you landed loot as many resources as you can to survive among 100 players in the same island. Weapon and the attachements varieties clothings laying around for fashion from painfully drivable Sedan to some Jeeps and even a Buggy (all vehicles are gas fueled so keep an eye on that fuel meter) and other equipments to help you survives easier in the game. There's going to be a circle of electrical waves that's gonna force players to take a walk and say hi with each other as the circles gonna starts from the outer island and gets smaller on each waves within visible range and time limit. It's totally random as it could centered at the corner of the map which is cool.There maybe some bugs and stuffs laying around (rubber banding weird latency spikes car flopping around soo high just from bumping a random rocks or bumps) but it's a lot of fun for me personally again.And for performance you might wanna crank down the graphic settings a bit if you're PC build is below system requirments stated as it's still not greatly improvised in technical performance.As for now that's all I can get from this game I personally recommend this game as in this early access state for players who wanna play a decent battle royale game haven't play much of any other BR games so can't say much about that.

Not only do you need to pay for the game they also try to get money from micro transactions to open loot crates. When you win a battle you get a reward called BP. You may spend this reward currency to get crates for cosmetic rewards. Now they have locked some of these crates so that you have to buy a key to open them. No thanks. And if that wasn't enough this game is ruined by cheaters who are primarily from China. To this day cheaters are continuing to ruin games. And when you report them you will never find out if they are banned or otherwise. Do you receive compensation for having your game time ruined by a cheater? Nope.

Fun as f u k boi! Theres no pinglock (chinglock) so oceanic servers in particular are infested with 80% yellow monkies who are at the very least only in our servers to amplify and exploit the chronic desync. Servers run at a whopping 17 ticks. To put this into perspective CS GO has 64 and 128 tickrate servers which is largely and arguably the only reason that basic af game is in any way successful. Overwatch only had 21 tick servers upon initial release but was quickly upgraded to 63 tick servers due to massive outrage at the poor competitive performance of the 21 tick servers and thats on games that dont need to support 100 players at once. To put it simply what you see and what the server sees are 2 totally different things on this pathetic game. I would not bother with this game until the servers have been upgraded (after over a year of hundreds and thousands of complaints posted on various media platforms and nearly constant server issues its f u k ing obvious this is never gonna happen) or at the very least have a simple pinglock implemented to mitigate the effects of Chinese monkies exploiting desync on our already pathetic servers when they have 3 of their own servers to go to.

I have never seen that kind of hackery in any other game.2. Banning players for ""stream sniping"" and other questionable reasons. I think this behavior really demonstrates a level of immaturity in the developers. If someone decides to stream their gameplay online they assume a risk that people will use it for a competitive advantage. Or banning people for using an unintended glitch to their advantage when it occurs. Early Access is effectively a paid beta. If we as customers are supposed to accept that the game is going to have bugs with unintended consequences the developers should accept that too and it's their responsibility to fix those bugs not blame and ban the player for pushing the boundaries of them. Maybe if this were release there'd be a case to ban people for exploiting but I don't think you get to pull that garbage in Early Access. Fix your game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,734,False,Not Recommended,"I enjoy playing this game I really do. I've met many good fun players on PUBG Discord servers for teaming up together as well as enjoying the game in solo matches. Compared to other battle royale games that are out right now it has just the right blend of gunplay and vehicles so that firefights feel intense and engaging. Despite the problems that are in this game when it works it works so damn well. During Early Access I held off on my complaints because bugs and network issues were things I fully expected.But this isn't Early Access anymore so I'm going to treat it as such.I've played though all the iterations of this game starting from it's Early Access release on Steam until now and I can't deny that there hasn't been significant improvements. They've reworked the grenade systems vehicles physics and sounds tweaked FPP to a playable level etc. etc. On top of that the jump to the updated Unreal 4 has seen major FPS increases all around and some slightly better visuals. The vaulting system as well as the animation work for character movement is top notch and definitely benefits the variety of gunfights in this game.Now on to the bad which I hate saying there is more than there really should be.Most of these critiques come from my own personal experiences but I feel a large majority of the players in this game would agree with me. Firstly the network/server systems in this game are just not up to the standards they should be for a ""released"" game. Rubberbanding and ping/latency lag between clients is a common occurence and is almost expected to be the cause of death in many cases. For a game developer trying to promote their title as an upcoming E sport is kind of laughable when the online server tickrates can't compete with the likes of CSGO of Dota 2. I can see how it will be more difficult to bring PUBG's servers up to that standard because it's a very different game compared to most E sports but it's still an issue that needs to be addressed.Talking about bugs/glitches most of these are minor when compared to the bigger issues but I can tell it frustrates people enough to the point where they'll make Reddit posts about it so I'll discuss this a little bit. Just recently a patch was released that fixed a collision issue with chain link fences in the game where one side would have no bullet collision (you can shoot thru it) and the other would have collision. Needless to say there are still some chain link fences that haven't been fixed. While this is only one very minor issue among many others (such as models not rendering at long distances or wonky vehicle physics) it's still an issue nonetheless and it does need to be addressed. Not to mention that in terms of the quality of updates and transparency with the community which PUBG Corp/Bluehole have a terrible reputation with making updates that don't entirely fix the problem or make it worse doesn't help in improving that said reputation.And finally I'll try to tackle the controversial topic of cheaters and the as PlayerUnknown himself calls it ""xenophobic"" behavior of the playerbase towards China. This issue is probably the largest by far going off of the massive amounts of hate I see on the Discord servers I play in as well as the attitude of people I've played with in those Discord servers.I'm honestly baffled as to how big this problem has grown in the past couple of months but maybe that's just because most of the online multiplayer games I've played through Steam always excluded the Chinese playerbase on most accounts. In September of 2017 CSGO saw a release in China through Perfect World and up until then I never realized just how big the Chinese playerbase for games was until then they needed their own version to play on. So it's no wonder that PUBG has been breaking Steam records it's because they're including everyone in the whole world. To put this into some perspective PUBG has the majority of its players from China about 60% or so. Then you look at the amount of hackers that have been banned 1.5 million. Quite the impressive number for a game that's only been around for roughly 1 year considering that again the majority of those hackers come from you guessed it China.I don't hate the Chinese that's not the point of what I'm trying to say here. What I will say is that it's stupid as a developer to look at this problem and say that the minority is being ""xenophobic."" Nobody would have an issue playing with people from other countries if they played fairly and I suppose that's what a system like Battleye is for. But it's pretty clear that Battleye isn't going to be enough if the minority is going to be as vocal as they are about it. People want this game to be better in so many different ways and that's why Steam has as many negative reviews about this game as it does because the minority of the playerbase knows PUBG isn't perfect and that it can be better. I don't see what's holding PUBG Corp/Bluehole back from implementing changes that would improve the game as a whole for the people who actually want this game to get better rather than not really saying/doing anything. That's the same reason I stopped playing CSGO competitively it just felt like the VAC system wasn't enough and Valve wasn't doing much to fix the problem.There's no best solution to this Chinese hacker problem that I can see. Many people want all kinds of things like hardware ID bans region locks ping locks etc. Truthfully I've only ever played with a legitimate Chinese player once and he was playing with an English speaking friend of his that would translate what he was saying back to the whole squad so we could all still work together. I suppose the fear of splitting up the PUBG playerbase by region locking half of the world to the other or forcing the Chinese to player on their own version of PUBG is that it would look bad by Steam stats since the concurrent player count would be halved (as of writing this PUBG has hit 3 million). Ping lock looks to be the safest solution to this mess and there are many games that do implement this already. Call me xenophobic for saying that but it would improve the experience for many people who want to see this game improve in a meaningful way myself included.Anyway that's pretty much all I have to say about PUBG. Who knows maybe within a couple months we'll see massive improvements/changes blah blah optimism blah. Given Bluehole's track record in the past I doubt it but that could change.Oh and Mr. Greene please bring modding into this game at some point soon at least some modified Unreal Developer Kit for PUBG that we can use to build our own battle royale maps with. You said it yourself you want to find the next ""PlayerUnknown."" For someone that came from the Arma modding scene to be so heisitant about releasing modding tools for one of the most popular games on Steam the next ""PlayerUnknown"" will never be found by only offering ""custom game"" options that are limited to a simple UI. Heck if you really want to do that take a good long look at the Halo games with their Forge mode and custom game options. Just a suggestion.Alright I'm done.

So prepare to be killed by people sitting in silent wait for you around every corner and atop every hill.Tedious inventory management Want to pick up some items? Enjoy picking them up one at a time or opening your inventory and losing all situational awareness. Forget auto collecting or auto equipping items that match your equipped weapon you'll have to open your inventory and manually do it (sorry PUBG Mobile gamers the PC version can't manage that because ???)Slow action mechanics Want to throw a grenade? Well first take a few moments to equip it then prepare to throw it then realize you're throwing it underhanded and take a moment to switch to overhanded. Now press a separate button to cook the grenade. Ok now you can throw it but you'll find that you now have a random throwable equipped in its place and no indication of what it is unless you pause for a moment wait for your hand to come up then squint at it to figure out what it is.Healing sucks Want to heal? Well first learn about the 6 different types of heals and the situations in which to use each. Don't worry you'll have plenty of time to read about them while you spend minutes applying 20 bandages in a row.Pointless graphics If you play on super low graphics enemies that think they're hiding will be visible to you since the folliage won't render on your machine.

2017-07-12,0,0,213,True,Recommended,PUBG is a great game conceptually and operationally. It is by far one of the best games in the battle royale genre. The game has little to no learning curve at all. The play mechanics are smooth. As for being an early release game PUBG is out performing most if not all similar titles. PUBG has a remarkable prompt patch/update record mostly in line with what their players are requesting. The game still has some obvious flaws with player animations and latency that are in the works and I'm sure will be corrected in upcomming patchs. Overal PUBG is a great title and the developers have done an amazing job.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Bluehole doesn't seem to mind though as hackers continuously do it.

2018-01-02,0,0,1469,False,Not Recommended,This was once a great game but . . .1. The North American server is overrun with Chinese players which creates a number of problems other than the obvious language barrier trying to coordinate during a gun battle2. While I will admit that the majority of the Chinese players are friendly I also have noticed a drastic uptick in teamkilling. I have been team killed by my Chinese team members more times in one weekend than than I ever was in the first 6 months of the games release3. Cheaters cheaters and more cheaters ...no explanation needed ( see numer one above )4. The game has some serious lag issues and the worst part of the lag seems to be at the very begining when players are landing and everyone is scrambling for a weapon/gun which is the ABSOLUTE the worst time you want to experience lag.5. The latest release has introduced a number of bugs which by themselves are not deal breakers they do add to the overall fustration level when combined with previous points.The game can be entertaining with some of the funny things that occur in the game from time to time but overall I have to give the game a thumbs down until at the very minimum the cheating is under control. Some people claim that there are not alot of cheaters...but considering that matches have 100 players...it only takes 1 cheater to ruin the fun for 99 other players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-14,0,0,567,False,Not Recommended,"Cant recommend this game in its current state. This game probably wont be at acceptabel levels of playability for another year maybe longer if the devs continue to add 6Gb updates containing Paid Cosmetics and only a handfull of actual bugfixes most of them minor. Also dispite the devs claiming to have banned thousands upon thousands of cheaters/hackers the ammount you run into just keeps increasing. Whatever automated anti cheat systems they have in place is clearly not sufficent and even ban people accidently at times which means alot of the bans have to be done manually which takes quite a bit longer. This game is technically considered ""finished"" because its no longer in Early Access but as with most games that ever set foot in Early Access and manage to get out its far from it. Appart from what ive already stated the game also has absolutely terrible net code. You'll find yourself getting shot by bullets that chase you around corners in the early to mid game on top of being unable to interact with or even SEE some of the objects and loot at times. These problems tend to dissapate in the late game but at the same time you'll get killed because of these issues without even making it to the late game. With this game in this bad of a state you'd think the devs would be focusing on fixing its many problems but as i said before they instead decide to add 6Gb of paid cosmetic lootboxes and when they do ""fix"" things it tends to break the game more than fix it. This game has alot of potential when it works its alot of fun but dont buy it now. Wait at LEAST 6 months to a year befor you consider this game.

So it does happen very often that you land on the ground and die because a bot kills you dozens of meters away through three buildings. Is it fun to play with this kind of ingame experience? No!Since the devs don't really care about the leaks in this game there won't be a real change to this problem. Sure they ban the bots but only to see that the game gets more sales in Asia thank to the bans. A real fix for this kind of stuff won't come. Damn business!By the way The performance on the EU and US servers is only crappy because of this damn farming bots!Another painful experience are the game breaking bugs. Just to mention some If you drive with a bike over 100 it starts to move on its own (on a normal street). Something similar happens with the cars. You drive on a normal plain field and the car hits a little stone (not bigger than a fist) and all players in the car get damage like hell. Mostly it happens that you shoot someone in the head and the person still stands. Nearly no realism in this. Most weapons are useless since the damage is far from being original. While dropping from the plane it happens very often that you land on the ground and still get drop damage. You don't even have to hit something. Many people complain about performance problems on the first run. Like the game itself needs plenty of time to display any content.Did I mention the cheaters? Well they shoot through walls. Normal players can't do that. The two maps are pretty boring. Sure they annouced more maps to come but sitting on two maps while the game itself is in final state is just not enough. Over 20 millions sold copies and the team doesn't even think about expanding and fixing the dozens bugs giving the pretty big community more content and making this game awesome.

I'm for one that prefer this game over fortnite but I can't help myself. I'm not enjoying this game as much as I used to in the past due to hackers and the fact that I can't even choose which lootbox I want to buy. There are chances that you will get a lootbox that require a key to open and you need to spend real money to get a key. I still like the gunplay in this game better than fortnite but I can't help it but feel pity for the DEV. They are the one destroying this game. There are still people who suport the game and like this game more than fortnite like myself. They haven't fixed the hackers issue that has been around since last year when I first made my review. I'm editing my review as of 6/28/18 or more than one year later and the hacker issue still exists. It's even worse now than it was one year ago. They added the fortnite season pass like system in game and it's bad really bad. So instead of fixing the game and try to keep the current player count they filed a lawsuit agaisnt fortnite and adding the new content.

2018-01-27,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG is a fun game. No doubt. This review is more of a warning about their support team Who as far as I can tell are a pack of mentally handicapped lemurs. They do very little to fix the problem this game has with hackers and have banned 100s of accounts in error. Some people have managed to restore their accounts many others have been told to pound sand. They will not give you any information on any accused infractions. They will simply lock your account and claim they do not do ""retests on bans as it is done internally.""If you ARE a hacker/cheater. Your ban is permanent. So good riddence. If you are the victim of hacking or cheating.....Your ban is permanent. So qq They will take your money and send their support team to kick you in the balls over and over and over and over while exclaiming the whole while how frustrating this must be for you. Cannot recommend as there is a reasonable chance you will be banned for no reason or for being the victim of a hacker (Chinese or otherwise).EDIT Blueholes ""appeal"" system does not exist. Their support staff are not actually trained to help you and won't actually respond directly to any questions or requests. This is one of the GREASIEST companies I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I am sure they have modelled their business' code of ethics to resemble that of EA because both carry the same stench of cheap whiskey and hot garbage on a summers day in L.A. Do not believe a word that drips from their encrusted lips. They are doing absolutely all to actually protect their player base. They are sure to get a couple legitmate hackers no doubt. However their policy of ban first and never ask questions is appalling (even if it is not totally illegal). You will not be asked to provide any proof because you are guilty. They will not accept any proof you provide shy of capturing the actual perps and bringing them to Blueholes offices alive. They will take your money ban you when you are hacked by one of the people they failed to protect you from then ghost you faster than that girl you ""really had a connection with"" from tinder did last month. Play the game. Or go play fortnite. They are both fun as hell. Just know you are really rolling the dice with these idiots.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-30,0,0,664,False,Not Recommended,"If you are reading this chances are you are thinking of investing $30 into a wildly popular battle royale genre game. This game has the potential to be the best of its kind but bottom line the one thing this game cannot and will not resolve is the hacking. Now I realize to some degree most games have problems with hackers. It is the nature of the beast and unfortunately you get some people with a few dollars to spend who would rather cheat than actually learn how to play a game that has a very simple concept Be the last to survive. It could be the a very pure and enjoyable experience even after being killed in the first minute but alas it isn't because depending on time of day and day of the week the majority of the near 100 players are hacking to some degree. Yes there are different levels of it. There is always the guy that sits 1.5 km from you that can shoot you through the other side of a mountain (yes this has happened and the only way I knew how I died is was the death cam). There are the ESP hacks where the hacker knows exactly where everyone is at which is a huge advantage because stealth and tactics plays a very important role to success in this game. There are no recoil hacks and aimbot hacks. Speed hacks. I am sure I missed several others but you get the idea. So I random duo'd with a Chinese player (who spoke English pretty well) who told me about his hacks and at first I didn't really believe him but he was like a heat seeking missile when we landed as he found everyone in our vicinity and killed about 10 guys in a matter of 2 minutes which in a game like this is virtually impossible unless you have these advantages. I watched this guy melt everyone and it was obvious he was happy with himself and actually advertised his hacking site to me over chat. Since it doesn't appear god mode exists (yet) I team killed him and exited out of game. Hacking in my eyes just enables the laziness of many gamers who are content on cheating to be at top of leaderboards. Intended or unintended this game embraces it. You have stats for a lot of different metrics. K/D wins win % top 10% headshot % and some weird rating system that embraces the 30 1 KD ratio and the 83% win percentage (again impossible if you are not cheating). It is my opinion that this game is not looking to eradicate these hackers it is just accepted because these hackers do pay some decent monthly subscriptions to maintain their ""fake"" greatness and I can only imagine that the hacking companies give the developers of this game a nice little payoff because otherwise there would be much more noticeable results with each patch to improve it for the legit players and yet it seems to get worse. I am certainly not a pro at the game I just like to jump in and have a little fun with a game with a great concept. The reason I wrote this is to make anyone aware that what they are buying is a game to which they will be playing on an uneven playing field even after many hours of improving. It isn't anything they would be doing wrong it is what the developers aren't doing to make it right. This game is massively popular and even I have devoted 450 hrs into it hoping at some point it would improve but I don't see it changing any time soon. If you like the challenge of playing others that have capabilities you will not have in game unless you hack this is a great buy for you and good luck to you. If you are like the majority of non cheating players and wanted a balanced game of you vs 99 others you will be sadly disappointed and frustrated.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The reason is because not everyones systems are the same and not every Internet connection is the same.EXAMPLE If you could perform a test and have 12 different people in the same position and fire at them at the same time with the same gun vs gun armor vs armor scenerio the result would be 12 different outcomes. example 1 You kill the guy he never turns to fire.example 2 You fire the guy turns and kills you immediatelyexample 3 You fire the guy turns you kill him but take alot of damage example 4 you fire the guy turns and fires back but you kill him and take no damageetc.etc.... Now People will say that this is because of skill.. and you need to play more to get better etc.But remember this is a test of the same exact situation every time. Skill has nothing to do with Desync. You can play this game 24 7 for 10 years straight. The fact is that there are always going to be people with better or lesser desync issues then you it has nothing to do witth practice or skill it is just the SAD TRUTH of the game.They Know it and hopefully now YOU know it too.It will never be fixed because it can't be fixed . It is a sinking ship that they are trying to keep the hype going for as long as possible.So they can rake in as much of your money as they can. Keep playing if you want Just know you are Never on equal footing with anyone else in the game. Also don't be stupid and give them any more money because what good are the skins and cosmetics good for??... Nothing just filling in your own ego...and where does that ego go when the game dies??...Will you reflect back at that point and think All that money could've went to something real and tangible??,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-10,1,2,442,False,Not Recommended,"Despite the game being in early access the amount of bugs and glitches is yet absurd. And the servers are atrocious often lag and sometimes even crash. The hit registration is flawed at times you can stand behind a wall or tree and get hit from someone who's on the other side. Bullets starting at the barrel makes more sense than at the scope like in CS GO but looking at someone through a scope or sights only to shoot some bars or a railing is excruciating. Physics is evidently not Bluehole's strong side since bullets can't go through water any wooden railing bars or any thin piece of wood (except doors).How can a developer be so secretive about the contents of its game that it refuses to explain almost anything or release information? It's not state secrets and you're not an intelligence agency. Desciptions of add ons or equipment overall is extremely brief to know the specific differences between things like muzzle addons you have to turn to YouTube. And even then you won't know the entirety of it. Almost all variables and algorithms are hidden.""Esports ready"" is definitely one of the most accurate memes ever the arrogance and sheer audacity of hosting esport tournaments while having the game in this state is laughable and hugely annoying.

This shotgun can be really really good if you got lucky with the spread but then again i saw my friend shot a guy about 2 3 meters apart from each other and they have the same shotgun when my friend shot the guy (he doesnt wear any armour) he didn't die but when he shot my friend (who is wearing a level 3 armour and level 2 helmet) he instantly died with one buckshot to the chest with 100% health. I love the shotgun because its actually really satisfying to shot it but it doesnt work a lot of times because its so RANDOM.Conclusion i want to like this game but I CANT STAND FRAME DROPS AND HOW INCONSISTENT THE GAME HIS WITH EVERYTHING IN THE GAME. 4/10 would never pick up pump shotgun again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

RNG is all this game is ESPORTS READY AM I RIGHT. Lets add more skins itll bring people back for 2 matches until they realize we still hvent optimsed this game fully. hit detection is still trash. ARs are trash shoot someone 8 times and they still kill you with a ump in 3 shots. This was supposed to be CONS but THE WHOLE GAME IS A CON. Theres more to be said but you get the point.

2017-11-01,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,Forest Gump Simulator 2017To start it is not a terrible game. But I wanted it to be so much better. The concept is very fun. The execution leaves a lot to be desired.From my experience it is a rewardless game that you can come second place in without having even fired a shot. Or if you are really lucky maybe even first by jumping the last person with your fists and hiding the rest of the game away. But that is unlikely.So you run and run and run grab gear get a 10 kill game going and poof some guy without a kill ends it all because he had a better hiding place in the last circle. And then you get some coins for a randomized loot box. There is no permanence or consequence to any game or action taken and no matter how well or bad you do you could end up the winner or loser based mostly around a slot machine pull. Huzzah.That is if you get through the terrible optimization. My computer is no longer the most amazing thing on the market but it was just a short year or so ago. And I have yet to find a game I couldn't run on the highest settings and not get 50+ FPS. Until now. In fact there are points in time when it would drop as low as 20 FPS on a custom medium high setting. It was shocking to me. And this isn't because of the amazing blow your mind graphics of the game either...At the end of the day I didn't find it fun. I found parts of it fun but it was more of a chore than anything. Drop here pick stuff up run run run then die or hide. Repeat. If you can get through another stuttering game.And I am not even one of the people complaining about banning hackers and all the other complaints.Not a horrible game. Not worth the price tag. May pick it up again later down in development to see if things have improved because it does have potential. But if you love mashing the run button very recommended.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-15,0,0,438,False,Not Recommended,Buyers beware what your getting yourself into. Although this game may have its moments they are sadly burdened by the failure of anti cheat implementation which is apparently constantly under development but to no avail. The larger issue is mind boggling an unpolished title is allowed to utilise the market place where items are are sold and profits made which is the bread and butter of the modern unemployed hacker the developers are 'enabling' this fraudulent activity to occure without any form of restriction nor sense of wrong doing on their behalf not to mention steam thinks its a good idea to float this game on their platform. These forms of practice are entirely unacceptable and a massive dissapointment to the true community both steam and Bluehole should be ashamed at this point niether seems to claim any responsability for what they enable and i truly believe there should be legal repercussions for both parties.The difficulty I find is that the game is actually interesting moreso with friends hence the confusion by all the hate accompanied by a very large player base and so I say if you must play please avoid supporting paid loot crates everything we see these days has been granted the allowance by gamers and their needs dont let the devs tell you what you want by casually creating desire,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And ever since the market place has existed it has turn crates no longer free to unlock and just is a big insult to original players who were able to get items for free well atleast after earning in game currency after matches.Problems The servers are very unreliable on some days it could be fine with no crashes or insane waiting times. but 80% of the time the game spawns you so late where you sit on a loading screen for 10 min only to find out you died in return.

A perfectly venomous system that can be monetised to the extreme exploiting as much money as possible out of the playerbase.Don't get me wrong there are fun moments to be had in PUBG but it isn't worth all of this.

2018-08-02,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,A running simulator except there's a 75% chance of getting shot by someone you cant see. I've played 10 hours on this game at the time of writing this review and I can already tell that it is riddled with bugs. The optimization is so awful. I turn my POV 30 degrees in any direction and my frames drop from 110 to 26? The desync and contrast in this game suck and it is really difficult to pinpoint the exact location of anyone shooting that is even romtely hidden. The servers lag when landing. I was playing duos with a friend once and the server literally froze while in the plane. Next thing you know the entire lobby is dropping the same place because apparently they were frozen too. I dont understand 1 centimeter hills that I am taking fall damage from or that my vehicle is ramping off of. I have to restart the game after every other squad match because if you don't you're just stuck in a queue that will never find a match. Apparently PUBG doesn't know when you leave the game either cause my friends are telling me to ready up after i have exited the game. Vaulting is still awful and my character looks stupid jumping into a wall. I spend too much time spamming 'F' attempting to pick up items on the ground which is especially annoying when landed in highly populated areas. When i drop a gun on the ground my attachments stay on but some how the firing mode always resets back to single which is really annoying considering how many times I've died when i've dropped a weapon picked it back up and its been in single fire mode. Prone is pointless on the miniroyale map unless you're hoping for a close up view of the grass. Overall this game has great concept but yet another poor execution and support from the devs. As I mentioned earlier i only have 10 hours in the game at the time of writing so i look forward to the hackers and high ping players from other regions.How does the devs address these issues? They attempt to sue their competition and then continue to release microtransactions. Great handling of their game I'm done ranting for now. 4/10 would not recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-15,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,I gave this game a try because I thought it would have that ARMA open world feel with good CS like gunplay.After an hour of playing I can say that I do not enjoy this game. 3rd Person is tactically superior to 1st Person in every way but I prefer FPS so I'm already at a disadvantage. The formula for the game is simple enough but the game is lacking in a few areas Vehicle Controls are horrific. Boats are a deathtrap. You're more likely to ground yourself than manage to get down a river.Gunplay is very difficult and the telemetry between shooter and target is so hard to judge that you're screwed if you have anything less than a Rifle or SMG. Jumping mechanics are bugged consistently. There are areas on the map with items that seem like they require jumping to reach but are almost impossible to get to.There is no Hit indicator and HRTF is a bit watery in this game. Like it echoes badly. Thus it's very difficult to know what direction you're getting shot at from. Also the in game voice communication sounds like people speaking through a metal pipe. Terrible sound quality.All in all I can say that after playing the game for an hour both solo and with friends I didn't enjoy my experience at all.If the game changes significantly and FPS becomes less awkward to use (the gun feels like it's too low on the screen) I may try it again but at this point I can't recommend this game to others.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,0,0,347,False,Recommended,Alright the game is out of early access.What has changed?Not much really. A new map polished graphics and slightly better performance.I still play the game for the same reasons I played it when I first got it 1) Everyone can win2) The game is heavily skill based at the end of the day3) You have your downtime and no match will play out the same or have the same playersOf course this doesn't apply to everyone. Some might say they play PUBG solely because their friends do it. And you know what? That's fine.In this game I don't care for the players. I don't care how the person who just killed me might look think or laugh about that kill. I queue up for another match and things might play out differently.The replayability is heavily supported by a NONEXISTENT ingame chat (apart from voice which you can turn off which is best LEFT off).Ingame chat and player interaction is what promotes tilting and rage the most. Seeing and hearing a stranger laugh at you or taunt you is one of the worst things that can happen to your dignity in a game. PUBG doesn't have that.The new content is cool and a welcome addition to the game.The map feels more polished thought out and generally more authentic. I've come to like it more than the old map.The weapons have their use and usability BUT The .45 ACP weapons are way too common. It feels like the developers wanted to shove them in your face so you use them more.And one more looting RNG on the new map is ed. And will probably continue to be. There are whole houses with nothing but backpacks and clothing in them whereas you can go to one specific building (you probably know which one) and almost always come out with an AR level 3 gear and MEDs.Of course there are still problems with the game the developers could have been fixing since long.Servers are horrid. The network lag and coding in this game sometimes is more than laughable. Replays are buggy and inconsistent or unreliable.Wanna see how on earth you died there? Oh Replay says he was 2 meters more to the left than where you shot at. Oopsie looks like this was your fault for not shooting right.Who knows which one was correct. The enemy in the replay 2 meters to the left or the enemy you felt like you emptied a clip at?Optimization has improved a bit...?AMD Graphicscards are still heavily underutilized as well as Ryzen and Bulldozer CPUs.However this does not mean you NEED NVidia and Intel to play PUBG smoothly.AMD has been bringing out patches to get their products to run better with PUBG.I was using an RX580 8GB for the majority of the time I spent in PUBG and played on medium to low settings to get smooth frames when things were getting messy.I changed to a GTX 1060 6GB at the start of 2018 and OH BOY have I been having a better experience.

Optimazation needs to be a number one priority for BlueHole but as of late I still experience the same issues I encountered when first purchasing this game.Is PubG fun? Yeah sure when the game doesn't want to you.

This game is destined to fall victim to the next big AAA FPS game as people move rightfully and justifiably away from a predominantly Chinese player base that seemingly have an unlimited and disposable pool of game keys allowing them to hack and mistreat the game with little consequence. Bluehole have made no attempt to clean up the mess that is PUBG. But holy is this game addictive.UPDATE JAN 2019 Bluehole have removed Oceanic servers justifying it with ""Low player base"" they allowed a bug to go untreated on the oceanic playerbase for months which ruined Match Making for anyone connecting from that region.

Constant crashes fps drops bugs etc. Instead of making ARS harder to use and making the UMP equivalent to a bloody M249 why don't you fix your game?? Not to mention skins everyone was waiting for a good update to a slowly declining game and whats Blueholes answer? SKINS!!!! Everyone wanted that right???? Because in a battle royale game you are totally going to care about what you're wearing or what your gun looks like in the middle of a gun fight. Don't buy this game waste of your time and money it has lived its glory days and now it is on a rapid decline.

2017-07-31,0,0,197,True,Recommended,"A game that overall has wonderful potential. The design the guns and the map is well designed. Excited to see more content. Mechanically the game is okay but could use some serious improvement in the network lag problem in game lag not being able to aim down sights clean and a few more tiny problems that will be patched over time. However where this game thrives in the already mentioned I would say its not meant for those who want a competitive experience. It is more of a casual game right now do to the handicap it gives with the current meta and third person for those who need help with these types of games.The current meta of this game is loot get to the circle camp and then move. You could start a game perfect and take gun fights have 10 15 kills and still lose because of ""campers"". The third person is another problem this game would be fine in third person if there wasn't an alt look or prone third personing. Both the meta and third person are intertwined in a problem that even H1Z1 didn't have that this game seems to thrive in. Overall I would give this game a 6/10. While I may be harsh on the meta and camping that doesn't mean you can't win and not have a competitive time but it is the main problem I have had and have seen. My best advice to anyone who purchases this game and I'll even have to take my own advice be patient don't get frustrated and play with friends it makes the experience worth it and it hides some of the issues I have stated above. Other than that this game has a great oppurtunity lets just hope our friends at Bluehole will listen to the community and focus on mechanics/gameplay over content.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You get to choose where you want to drop and land by jumping out of the plane whenever you want. Also less buggier than H1Z1 and has a better hitreg. Overall I enjoy this game more than H1Z1. It's a more tactical and slower game compared to the arcade feel of H1Z1. But overall its all personal preferance between the two games and depends on if you are looking for fast action or slow paced tactical gameplay,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In reality it means full release with a side of early access. My lobby still has issues and I can't access the options to troubleshoot. I do not recommend this glitchy mess to anyone. There is a good foundation for a battleground game with PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS. Gun sounds make you feel like you are on the island. The land mass is large is gives for a number of exciting battles. Spawning and choosing a location to start the freenzy is good and should be built upon. There is a lot of potential with this game.That said there were too many bugs glitches unoptimized areas and de sync moments. I ended refunding because of the latter. The start menu would rarely load. Only after restarting steam or even my computer could I get it to load. There were awful texture glitches causing missed shots and more imporantly ruining the immersion. Footsteps never sounded correct. Crouching was louder than running through the building... Come on... Even in early access that was an easy one to spot in the beat no? I cannot recommend this to the many who see it at the top seller list. Dayz ruined early access for me and my trust with developers is thin. I would highly recommend waiting out the early access period and see what the devs offer on full release. This game is definitely not worth $60 dollars full release let alone $30 for early access.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-30,0,0,593,False,Not Recommended,A great concept with fairly good execution if it wasn't for the major issue with cheaters and hacking at the moment this game would definitely have a positive review. At this point every other game results in a death from a cheater who's using blatantly obvious cheats/hacks. There are advertisements to cheats on the official forum that almost never get deleted due to lack of moderation.Then there's the issue with TONS of players from China and other Asian regions playing on the North American server because it gives a latency related advantage. The way the game works the worse your ping to the server the better you can play.Without some serious redesign of the regional issue and major overhaul in terms of anti cheat this game isn't worth spending any money on at this time.Ideally the Bluehole team will release some way for communities to moderate their own dedicated or authorized servers. It seems like the only way to ensure that players aren't cheating while in game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-17,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,Welcome to PUBG where we can put on an international tournament in Berlin Germany with a prize of 2 million dollars but drag our feet and ignore our player base with ideas to make it better. We like to do server maintenance during prime time in North America oh by the way our maintenance usually takes twice as long as we say. Once server maintenance is complete we have to release another update because the new updated screwed something up. Lets not forget that we like to ban players for no reason and then offer no explanation on why we banned them so be prepared to buy the game twice (because we're really only after your money). We have a wonderful loot system! Once you play about 50 games and get a decent amount of BP you get a crate! But youll have to spend money to buy keys to open it! (Again we're only after your money). We've introduced a lawsuit against fornite because they're contantly coming out with new content every month and it usually takes us about 6 months to put something new in the game. Well I dont want to keep you distracted with all the fun you can be having and again thank you for your money!UPDATE Hi welcome back where we made a promise to fix our game but yet we still cant put out information like when we're gonna do server maintainence in the lobby because we are more concerned about you getting our stupid outfits. Just to make things fun we like to do maintainence during prime time in North America so dont plan on playing. The only way you'll find out is if you have a twitter. We're more concerned about advertising out new outfits than useful information in the lobby. Its really hard for us to come up with new and changing things so we just come up with stupid new outfits because after all WE JUST WANT YOUR MONEY. The one positive thing ill say is that we put dynamic weather into the game which makes it more fun but still ALOT of work to do but we need more money first!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I find the game play very slow with lots of down times during which nothing happens besides running to the new zone only to get sniped by someone who was hidden there the whole time.The game play thing is personal opinion and I'm saying this to warn people who prefer faster paced shooters. However there are issues on which I believe everyone will agree.Lags servers struggle to hold the load and lags are fairly common you'll also often run into difficulties reconnecting after a game because the servers are ""too busy"".Kill cams full of glitches more often than not you'll see someone shooting way off you at relatively close range (where bullet travel times are not a thing) and still kill youCheaters the above point brings me to the issue of cheats. It's very hard to know from the killcam if the player who killed you was using something like an aimbot or not and yet it is well known from Steam and other discussion boards that cheating is an issue. Movements and vehicles how many times have I gotten stuck on the map for no reason... How many times the vehicle I was driving started tumbling unexpectedly?

Getting shot around corners getting shot when your not even on the other players screen and sometimes you get a glorious cheater who takes 11 SKS shots to the body and just looks at you with a smile. This game in its current state is not worth a single penny. It is also poorly optimized even with a beast of a PC rubber banding and massive frame drops are a regular occurance. People from the Asia servers also love to join NA for a nice ping abuse advantage. Game just isnt fun for me so many glaring issues that the devs seem to be ignoring. This is an early access Alpah despite the 1.0 realse. In my opinion its a real shame if this is the new stardard for ""finished"" games. Rampant cheating the worst net code I have ever ecperienced in an FPS game BF titles included and complete lack of region locking making it impossible to have teammates that speak your language.

This game now has the worst hit reg I've seen. There is a ridiculous amount of hackers. Back to terrible optimisation with lower FPS and slow rendering. Parachuting was working for once and then after the last update it's useless again.This game manages to fix things then breaks them in the next update.

Almost all of the WAR games that I am teamed up with Chinese this happens. I really hope that they REGION LOCK China because a majority of their players are absurd and cancer.

2018-01-13,1,2,254,False,Not Recommended,I have played a very large amount of this game. I have won many games and am consistanly in the top 7 percent of players. I am fairly good and usually come out with about 4 kills per game. Recently the hacker rate in this game is off the charts. For those of you who have been reading through bad reviews by fairly veteran players like myself take heed. It is true. If you play around 15 games you will most likely die to hackers and very percarious situations. This last game of mine for example I was killed a solid 3 seconds after runing behind the wall. I was of course upset and proceeded to watch my deathcam only to watch this guy not see me at all literally shoot the stairs and I die. I was actually way off to the right in the other room. Whether this was due to this games terrible network code or hacking it is a great example of the massive issues this game still has. Calling it a 1.0 release is a joke. I have 200mb per second internet as well as an Intel Core i7 SSD drives and a Geforce GTX 1080 so lag on my end is not the issue.

2017-10-11,0,0,1018,True,Not Recommended,The game is extremely fun in my opinion. That being said I believe it has major flaws that could easily be address but some have only been made worse.1. Map RNG I feel the game time should stay the same have circle start to move sooner but actually move slower. This way if you do not find a car or if cirle dicked you you are not punished. (shouldn't change game pace just has more death via combat)2. Loot RNG I didn't really have any issues with this until they made loot less common a few months back. It was night and day when it happened. Rare items were still rare pre update but it caused the early game no weapon issue to become and actual issue. 3. Slow updates / Bugs It feels like the dev team still pushes updates at the same rate.

When the game was first released it had huge potential and the development of the game was there. That is until they found out they could make huge amounts of money by creating lootboxes keys and skins. The developers main focus right now is to create as much of these items to increase revenue. Hackers have also been a major problem in this game. Some steps have been taken to reduce hacking but sadly not enough.

2018-03-02,0,0,181,False,Not Recommended,Amazing concept terribly executed...When this game was released in early access it was actually a better and more stable game than its competitors. The game was fun to play (keeping in mind that it was an early access game) they updated the game frequently and it seemed like the devs were committed to making it as good as possible. The game became very popular and they made a lot of money on it so then I hoped that that would give them the resources to make the game even bigger and better than they first had planned. However the updates for the game became less and less frequent and the promises they had made for the game seemed less and less likely to being realized. I was still hoping that they would surprise us with a big update that made the game great but instead they just came with a few changes and a released the game as a final product.This game still has a good potential to be a good game if it develops for the better over the next years but for me it s totally unplayable and I can t enjoy the game because of all the bugs and terribly optimized gameplay and graphics. The menus lobbies and customizations are terribly bad and it still looks like the game is in a pre alpha early access state. There s a big lack of content other than the two maps where you can t even select which one of them you want to play.

That being said the only two things that kept me coming back were (1) the hopes of bringing home a chicken dinner and (2) being able to get loot using the credits I'd earned with my efforts. Today I signed on and played a few rounds happy to get at least 1 kill per life and earn some points. Much to my dismay when I bought a couple of loot boxes I found that they were locked and I could only open them with keys that cost real money. I refuse to buy into this system and until they get rid of this elitist crap I highly recommend staying away from this game. I wish that the 'premium' loot boxes were the only issue with this title. The cheaters are everywhere on the PC release of this game and for some reason the developers refuse to employ some anticheat measures like BattleEye. Many of those cheaters are on the Asian servers and for some reason I keep getting automatically matched to those servers even though I'm in the US. Anticheat and region locks are pretty commonplace and for a game that's making so much money they really need to adopt both.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The client pc is the deciding factor which is why hacking is absolutely rampant and the high ping (read region lock please?) player wins.In the millions of dollars they have received in the success of this game they continue to add loot boxes to pinch every penny out of the consumer before this game dies completely because of the seemingly unfixable hacker problem (unless they 100% rework how the client/server communication and detection works and fully rebuild their anti cheat like that will ever happen! ).You know your game has an issue when they only rely on the player to report the hackers and ban accordingly based on the reports.They make posts to make you try to feel good about how they ban thousands of hackers daily and it is plain sad.The hacks will never go away therefore this game unfortunately is forever ruined.Buy this game if you want to get rekt by hackers in every single game you play who can aimbot iron sight shoot you in the head full auto with an AK from 400+ meters and never miss a shot.Happy playing.HERE WE GO 1/7/19 MORE HACKERS.

You know why I'm disliking this bloody game. It is riddled with hackers left and right. I can tell you a game on this scale will not be able to catch them all. Don't just leave it a region locking a certain country for gameplay otherwise VPNs will just be the next big hit but also region locking the markets would make huge jumps to this game.

2018-01-09,0,0,348,False,Not Recommended,"I think I've played this game enough to review it. Updated March 12 TL DR This game is unoptimized and absolutely terrible the developers are horrible and lazy and the Chinese players actively ruin the experience for anyone else due to the lack of a working anti cheat and lack of region locks. This is the quality control I expect from a Free To Play game. Anyone that says otherwise is captivated by baseless hype and the illusion that this game is innovative. I know it's lengthy but I strongly suggest you read the review anyways. I will update this review with more grievances following every major update.Long Version Is PUBG fun? With the right people that don't care sure and that's why I play it.From what I've seen those type of people are few and far between.Is PUBG good? No.Anyone that calls this game good is an idiot as far as I'm concerned.It's kinda like an idea for a game that someone chewed up spit out ate again and continued to regurgitate several times. Anyone that says this game is ""revolutionary"" or ""innovative"" has either forgotten or never played Minecraft Hunger Games. As childish and stupid as it sounds it's the exact same thing 100 players are dropped on a big map that shrinks in size and are made to kill each other.Except that was done 6 years ago and it actually ran on a vast majority of computers.The captivation with this game parallels the illusion that people had with DayZ SA when it first came out and how people kept saying it would get better. In fact it's exactly the same considering that DayZ is pushing for 1.0 in 2018 (certainly before the game is ready to be finished) and that PUBG had just finished doing the same thing. Bluehole had promoted the 1.0 release of PUBG the day that the steam winter sale started undoubtedly to avoid having to put the game on sale a marketing strategy that went completely unnoticed by everyone.Was the game finished? Hell no.Early Access worked better than the ""Full Game"".Since the 1.0 release I've been flung off vehicles killed by running down mountains killed by jumping and then subsequently sliding into the ground murdered by my vehicle exploding due to hitting a rock with the vehicle at 100% integrity my vehicle has straight up exploded just from hitting a bump in the road. But that's just what I can remember happening to me.To be fair to my friends that's not as bad as some of the problems they've encountered such as being stuck into a wall after dropping being downed by their own parachutes After the third fourth and fifth times stuff like this ceases to be funny and starts to become sad.Additionally the fact that a game ""released"" in 2017 has to have a button for refreshing it's UI is beyond sad and beyond lazy. There are texture pop ins on the main menu and half the time the text doesn't even show up correctly (an occurence that wasn't a problem before 1.0)And before 1.0 I wasn't dealing with Chinese hackers in every single match. Doesn't matter which server you use NA EU SA doesn't matter. If you look in the reviews you'll see thousands of people thumbing their s and praising Bluehole for things like this Fixing lag (If by fixing they mean ""fixing US server lag and incentivizing more Chinese players to server hop "" sure.) Decreasing terrain load time (They mean ""texture pop in time"" decreased from 30 seconds to 25.) Redesigned UI (Which like aforementioned doesn't work properly half the time.) Fixing desync (Sure now it takes me only 3 reload animations to load my gun and a full magdump to hit a guy five times.) Bullets now penetrating water (Unrealistic considering that supersonic bullets completely lose velocity 3 5 feet down.) Weapon balancing (Which doesn't matter when you have asians running around that one hit you with any weapon and negligible differences between armor tiers)And a bunch of other crap that makes it easier to catch hackers (such as the death cam) which is strange since if the game had a working anti cheat to begin with hackers wouldn't be a problem.How do I know the anti cheat isn't working? Because it doesn't detect cheats or .exe files when the game launches it relies on user reports for overview.Speaking of hackers let me illustrate my experience with them. I have experienced Chinese hackers with no recoil Chinese hackers who hit shots without even aiming in my direction Chinese hackers who shot and killed my team through layers and layers of walls Chinese speedhackers who outrun cars and vault mountains at lightning speed Chinese hackers who instantly kill every living player in the game and win immediatelyOddly enough I have never encountered a hacker who wasn't Chinese.How can I tell? The Chinese players kinda have two trends taunting people after they kill you by screaming Chinese/Cantonese wildly in your ear and making usernames with random letters followed by random numbers that no one can sensibly read. More telling is the fact that these cheaters have no problems taunting you after they kill you nor do they attempt to hide the fact that they are cheating as if the death cam isn't even there. I can't speak for the rest of you guys but constantly being called ""laowai"" and ""guailo"" on NA servers becomes a bit disillusioning after a while.Any promises of ""additional measures"" and ""improved anti cheat"" made by the developers have not been kept nor have their promises to ""take good care to not harm innocent players "" seeing as how shortly before making that statement they banned a streamer for a teamkill as well as having an auto ban feature in place which will punish people who disconnect from PUBG servers too many times.The existing anti cheat's effectiveness is even further mitigated by the fact that Chinese hackers will just buy multiple copies of the game on separate accounts. The developers' refusal to region lock China degrades the quality of the game daily but that doesn't seem to matter considering that some colossal idiots still give this game positive reviews on Steam.In fact the relationship between developer and player is far worse than any game I've ever seen. You can find countless steam reviews of people saying they were banned for ""stream sniping"" despite being unaware there was a streamer in their lobby something nearly impossible to discern anyway assuming the streamer has more than a 10 second delay.Nevermind the microtransaction incident which shouldn't have been a problem in the first place but god forbid they weren't going to try and milk this dry.Also to reiterate the fact that there is a button to refresh the UI which needs to be used constantly in order for the game to function is a sad excuse for Bluehole to avoid fixing the tiniest of bugs. These are developers who cut corners making their main menu work properly. Just imagine how much time they devote to major issues. Instead they'd rather pawn cosmetics on people to milk the game as much as possible.Despite what many Steam Reviews and ""critics"" would have you believe this is not the best Battle Royale game out there. Similar to DayZ Standalone which wasn't the best zombie survival game out there. Neither game was the best at what it did they were only the most fleshed out and complete which in PUBG's current state says virtually nothing.If this prevents at least one person from buying this gutter trash my time writing this will have been well spent.Necessary addendum",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-17,0,0,788,False,Not Recommended,First off this game would be great if it weren't for the total incompetence and lack of vision of the developers. There is very little to get you acclimated and the UX/UI is on the level of snapchat in its usability. Guns and attachments are a total mystery with no way to test any of them outside of a live game which if you're lucky enough to find one would give away your position and get you killed immediately if you attempted to target practice. In that vein the beginning of the game can be an exercise in not throwing your computer as the game struggles to load under the weight of what I can only assume is a microwave powering the servers. The mad dash to pick up items as they lag into your inventory while being punch only adds to this exercise.Secondly in a game of 100 people with what seems like little to no way to stop cheating the game loses any chance it could have been to be fun. With 100 people in the game there is a 100% chance you will encounter a cheater and you will more often than not lose.Finally the ability to join different servers around the world seems reasonable until you realize that means playing with people who cannot speak or understand you in a game that requires teamwork.All this being said there is some enjoyment to be had but at the price point I wouldn't recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now it appears to me that the guilty hackers as well as probably a few innocent hackers have taken to Steam to complain about how bad they feel this game is.I have an old system. My processor was purchased in 2013 and my video card is a GTX 770. I think I have 12 GB of system ram and I don't have any SSDs.When I first started playing on my sons account about a month ago the only bug I would have was a crash when I opened my inventory occasionally maybe once every other day or so. I fixed this by deselecting the option to show character in the inventory screen and haven't seen an issue since. The ""Bugs"" where you shoot at someone in the mountains and hit invisible terrain or your car hits a small rock or hill that flips or explodes you is common for all games in general in my experiences.Game's graphics and performance on my system are 8/10. It looks as realistic as it can be these days and plays great.The main issue that I have with the game is with the Squad players that want to just jump into high concentrated area like big towns that are along the path of flight so we spend more time on the loading screen than playing. I prefer lasting until at least the top 10 and that is not the best way to ensure I make it there.It is an excellent team game if you find good Squad members.

Meaning when it doesnt glitch when you can get into the main menu without having to reset the UI ten times and when you dont get killed by someone using ESP or aimbot hacks. Also whats the point of chosing what region on earth you want to play in when every squad I've ever been a part of involves a bunch of people I cant understand? There needs to be a language lock in the game or something that verifies your IP or where you are from. Unfortun ately I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone until they fix the hacking problems and honestly I wish I could get my money back. Best of luck to anyone who reads this and still purchases it alsways remember kids ""CHINA NUMBA WUN"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-19,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,So I gave this game alot of time to play and heres what I have to say. First time playing I sucked so bad and had to get used to the gun recoil and placement on close games. I won a few lost a lot but that didn't bother me it was still fun. Now I am writing the review that the devs are lazy barely any new content comes out and the worst part of this game is the chinese hacking community everytime I get killed now in a bizarre fashion its a chinese player. I did a test and this was the results. So I played on the AS servers and NA servers. Latency was not an issue I had more kills and wins on the AS servers because they are literally playing the game as default but when I play on NA servers the kills are so conned that I see what is happening. NA and I am guessing EU which I did not test are flooded by chinese players who want to cheat on other peoples servers. So here is my synopsis if you played at the very beginning you got your moneys worth but if you are playing now or plan on playing it I recommend buying cheats as sad as that is you will be part of the majority as it seems to be mandatory. I never use cheats and if I could I would get my money back now do to the lazyness of devs not attacking hacking sites and protecting there own services.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I absolutely love the game and have played over 100 hours with my friends. The reason for the negative review will be explained below.The game is great no doubt about it. Frequent updates that are actually pretty good for the most part. The developers are doing an amazing job in EA and it is extremely commendable. I cannot however recommend that anyone buy this game. Recently the community managers have been completely unreasonable after some in my opinion bad decisions were made. More information on this can be found on reddit. On top of this there has been a problem recently associated with stream sniping and how it is a BANNABLE offense. Not only should this NOT be a bannable offense it is almost impossible to prove if someone is actually stream sniping. Bluehole's decision to coddle their free advertising (streamers) over the integrity of the community is why I decided that I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone purchase the game. I do not agree with a lot of their official stances on the decisions that they make however if you do then feel free to purchase the game. If your views align with mine do yourself a favor and don't purchase the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No more weekly/bi weekly patches not even monthly ones. Now they focus more on adding crates instead of fixing their broken released game. Patches now add nothing just cosmetic changes and most of the time break the game even more. Netcode is bad really bad... to be exact the very worst of all the ""big games"" and fact that asian players play on all other servers but asian just lags the game and servers even more.To sum things up it was good in early acces if you wanted to support it and seen potential but now I wouldnt buy it when I see where its development is going.. just play Fortnite until they make this playable you may even have no need to go to PUBG after that.Pros +one of the better battle royales+fun with friends+big mapsCons broken really bad netcode really bad desync hungry for your money slow development no motivation to win (after you've played it for some time)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To make matters worse the recent update release was an absolute pi$$take pun intended the event pass priced at 7.49 on top of a sky high overwhelming price of 26.99 is merely a copy of Fortnite's ""Challenge/Reward"" system.

I don't recommend buying this game it is way to expensive for what it is. It is like buying a mediocre steak for about R300 (21 dollars). I recommend installing Fortnite. Although its community is cancer it runs much better than this and it is free to play. Fortnite also is a enjoyable game unlike PUGB and the controls are smoother.BUT I do find myself always coming back to this game eventually it is funny and the random encounters with other players is memorable but that doesn't save the game from being trash.

2017-08-04,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,Early Access at time of writing.It's OK. It's a DayZ/Arma clone. Doesn't have as many bugs as Dayz. The airdrop start and diminishing game area is a good idea. I mostly play with friends in duo/team matches that's where it gets good it's a bit dull solo and mostly comes down to RNG luck and whether you happen to see someone before they see you.Player movement inventory management and shooting feel quite raw it's clearly EA and feels like it. Fingers crossed all that will get sorted before they start adding more guns because this game doesn't lack guns.IMO currently not at all worth 20+ purchase price. It's a 10 game at best it feels a lot like a mod. I'm not sure it'll ever really be worth more than 10 unless they introduce a significant amount of content in terms of maps vehicles game modes etc. I believe they are planning to do this but obviously it's a gamble. The current game mechanics favour scopes if you're lucky enough to find one you will do much better. It's because the map is very open and there's a lot of time spent running through fields and things with little cover. It's not a bad thing but it can be frustrating if you aren't favcoured by the RNG gods.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-08,1,2,273,False,Not Recommended,"Right now the game is plagued with cheaters 80% of the times I get killed in endgames it's Chinese people with random numerical names that shoot in third person and track you behind cover. The game itself is based almost exclusively on luck the path the plane takes is luck the amount of people you'll encounter when dropping is luck the loot is luck the vehicle spawns is luck the circles... the only thing certain is the fact you'll encounter a cheater in the endgame more than half of the time. When down to 10 players the place the circle randomly decides to close on will almost exclusively determine who wins. And if it closes on you you'll have to pray a Chinese guy with 1000 ping doesn't 1 shot kill you behind cover with a Kar98 on a lvl. 2 helmet you got after looting 20 houses and traversing half the map.The performance is atrocious on a GTX 1060 and a i5 7600 I get constant frame drops and the houses for some reason take a while to load their walls sometimes.You can ""do well"" without doing anything just hiding or you can be experienced with the mechanics of the game and die by a fragger who happened to get a shotgun before you in your same house in the first 2 minutes of a game. You can get to top 1000 of the leaderboards by being awful at the game. But the top 10 is reserved to obviously legit people with 30 games and 300 kills.When you eventually win in your 100th game you'll have a feeling of getting blessed by the gods of randomness as you'll realize half the reason you won is because nobody happened to see your car as you approached the final zone people around you killed between each otherand you happened to see the final enemy in third person while the circle always closed on or near you AND while you happened to have cover.The fact this is the most played game on Steam is baffling. Skill and strategy is left aside in place of chance and randomness. While cheaters continue to profit from selling crates they get from killing 20 people per game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-08,0,0,1155,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game a month after it was released in Early Access. I came from H1Z1 which I finally abandoned after so many broken promises from a developer (Daybreak) that was clearly incapable of delivering a solid product. I was excited for PUBG the developers promised a clear roadmap with frequently published dev letters (which they did for 2 updates) no monetization until they were out of EA plenty of content updates (again when they were out of EA) focusing on core gameplay fixing bugs improving performance. As I mentioned earlier the detailed dev update letter went away after 2 updates. A few updates later and instead of focusing on performance improvements and bug fixing resources went to add in vaulting. A month later and the first monetization scheme was added in. There were excuses given with every change and many assurances that the performance issues rampant hackers and innumerable bugs were going to be addressed.Well it's July 2018 and these things have all only gotten worse. Server performance is absolutely terrible (it's great for a few days after every new update only to degrade heavily shortly thereafter) hackers are still rampant and stay on the leaderboards for months people from halfway around the globe can connect to local servers in your area and because of the terrible lag compensation and client side hit detection actually have an ADVANTAGE it's pointless using in game money to get crates because most of them require a $2.50 key to unlock and you have no way to choose which one you get the event modes are frustratingly imbalanced and not fun and the list goes on. Bluehole has promised every step of the way to fix the problems but at every juncture they instead implement new ways to take your money. Instead of stable servers we have an event pass that costs $10 set up in such a way that you're almost guaranteed to have to buy level advancements at $5 each to complete all the missions etc.Short version this game is a dumpster fire. Like a dumpster fire it's probably fun watching from a distance but get up close and you're going to have a bad time. This is the second battle royale game Brendan Greene has been creative director of and they both ended up the same way which makes me think this is a feature and not a bug of his games. If you buy this game you might have fun on occasion but the rest of the time you will be frustrated and annoyed. If you like dumping money into a black hole for a few cool skins you'll love it but don't expect it to be anything more than what it is right now Bluehole has made tons of money and they aren't going to change the way they do business. At this point I'm biding my time until a competent and less scummy developer comes out with a battle royale game that's similar enough I can drop this game into the dustbin of history and never look back. I think most others will do the same.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have consistently gotten to the top 10 only encountering 1 player. I can never actually get good at the gunfighting portion of the game because I never get into gunfights!! Also gameplay gets repetitve after awhile which is expected its a battle royale type game. Playing with friends however makes up for its repetitveness I racked up a day's worth of play time because I really only played with some friends a few dorms down. It was lots of fun working as a team in that kind of setting but if you're playing alone its not really that fun. I dont really want to like or dislike because it is right in the middle its ok.

2017-11-02,0,0,472,True,Not Recommended,"Game is a month away from release and it's the most broken it's ever been.The optimization is terrible since the game runs like even on good PCs.Servers have been for the past month randomly disconnecting people during games and being laggy as hell you often find people rubberbanding all over the place making it impossible to hit them.The combat is inconsistent as hell especially in close quarters the movement is clunky and so is aiming in general sometimes it feels like I'm controlling a crane rather than a character.Some aspects of the game are completely unbalanced someone that ends up on a favorable position and with a lot of healing items is virtually immortal if he doesn't take risks he can just pop out get hit 2 or 3 times retreat to heal up and do it over and over again. Most of the time it just becomes a game of who has the most First aid kits unless someone gets a headshot with a sniper rifle fights can go on for AGES combine this with the random combat and you get a glorified version of rock paper scissors.I have to admit that when the game decides to work it's actually pretty good especially with friends and as far as ""battle royale"" games go this is still the best one hands down just don't go in expecting a balanced or skill based experience the game is mostly based on luck so it can sometimes be very frustrating.All in all this early access experience it's been mostly negative I've been playing for a few months now and it really feels like the devs haven't made any real progress on a lot of aspect they promised they would have improved over time the game still runs like the game is still infested with bugs and glitches the servers are still laggy as hell and cheating is becoming a huge problem. Patches get released very rarely lately they used to be almost on a weekly basis and they actually tried to address some of the problems the game had but now they get released maybe once a month and they fix some very minor PUBG is a game I really enjoy playing I also think that it has a lot of potential to become a GOOD game right now it might even be the most played on steam but it's still pretty bad devs said they were focusing on fixing the game rather than adding content but right now we have neither I seriously hope that 1.0 is actually a playable game but I wouldn't keep my hopes up.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sometimes its obvious but other times you'll be wondering ""was that guy cheating maybe?"". The core gameplay is subjective. If you like Last Man Standing kind of games you wont hate it but the game has this initial investment period of every match. You drop in and spend 5 15 minutes looking for decent loot. Its mundane and repetitive and since gear isnt persistent you must do it every time. So once you've found some decent gear you're ready to actually play the game. In most cases you'll die so fast that all your cool gear won't matter and will just get looted by another player. Then you start all over again. minor problems directional audio needs work. You'll have difficulty knowing where shots are coming from. no directional hit locators. as above you'll struggle to figure out where shots are coming from.

2018-02-15,0,0,1348,False,Not Recommended,I have spent more then 500 hours in this game i bought it almost immediatelly after it has gone out so it means in early access and all i can say is that this game has so many irregularities that should not have been here after so much cash that they earned. I decided to wait and wait and wait but all they can fix i guess is ing breathing animation and I am sick of this. I really like the concept of this game and practically new genre that this game created but i feel like developers are not working as hard as they should. first of all so many bugs and second I feel like weapons and hit points they take and how they react on armor and helmet are a total t on paper everything looks fine but in game everything is mixed and the only thing that you can be sure is that you will not die if you don't get hit by anything and that is a damn shame. So if you want to rage from time time this is the game you WANT to buy. And after so much time i still want this game to succeed and fix so many of the big bugs and things that needs to be fixed so that we can all enjoy game that we payed for but... This will probably not happen. They are not listening for community and it will be their end. It is probably another case that we saw where some game company pulled big money on it and bailed after some time.I will continue playing this game probably and still hope for the best beacuse this game has great potential but i need a longer pause starting today.Ty for reading and hope that you see my words are true after you spend some time in this game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-15,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,Where to start with what's wrong with this game is the real question. They pushed for a christmas release and really this game is still in beta as far as I'm concerned. My number 1 issue with the game above is actual simple playability. Look at this forum and videos attached for what I'm about to describe https //forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/42649 being shot freezes game/No matter what your hardware is no matter what settings you play on THIS WILL happen to you. You will get a screen freeze every time you are shot at or begin shooting at someone in close quarters. Sniper rounds seem to not affect this but this alone is gamebreaking. I run a i7 980GTX TI in SLI setup with 32gb of ram and play the game on the lowest settings across the board and still get this screen freeze issue. This is the number 1 complained about issue currently maybe next to the zenophobia that seems to plague american's complaining about people speaking another language in their games.Onto issue 2 It's a world based game where we can play with anyone in the world and they can play with us. American's don't seem to get into games like this that often and it's honestly ridiculous how much I have to listen to 'explitive explitive explitive china explitive' in literally every single game queue without fail. In reality the chinese player base is very friendly even the cheaters are pretty cool guys it's super rare to run into a toxic chinese player yet you're not ever gonna find a PUBG lobby that doesn't have some american yelling to region lock china and send them back where they belong which is bs.Issue 3 The cheating in this game is absolutely abhorrent and going unchecked.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 3hMi8thYaj0https //www.giantbomb.com/forums/playerunknowns battlegrounds 729798/pubg cheating is out of control 1817982/Multiple examples here in the above mentioned links and this is in every game. It's not 'rare' at all it's such a commonplace practice at this point that even MMOwnedCore has links for free aimbots to xray mods. The just of it all is that aimbots are everywhere less common is the xray hack which allows people to see an outline of you through buildings wherever you are at all times so they can always know what you're doing/where you're going etc. There's wall hacking mods where people can jump/run/shoot through walls without issue my favorite I've ever seen though is a mod where it turned player models into skyscrapers. Literal skyscrapers. Imagine 100 skyscrapers just running around a huge open map. You shoot at the top of the building and it counts as a headshot no matter where the player was on the map absolutely insane. Bluehole keeps saying they're combatting hacking/cheating/banning people but imo they're really not. We saw a January release of them attacking hackers the community now believes it was nothing but a large scale banwave as people went to test old mods and they still work without issue ownedcore and reddit have confirmed a very large list of mods/hacks after the january 'patch' that haven't been affected in the slightest.Issue 3 Great game design. Horrible community by and large. Horrendous publishing company that already had a bad rap from Tera the MMO. The worst thing that they're doing and it is widely accepted to be true at the moment is datamining/bitcoing mining off your machine from the login screen. Watch your afterburner when you're at the launch screen for PUBG and you will see 90 99% GPU usage no matter what your setup is. You get in game and like me with my GTX 980 TI everything at low settings it instantly drops to 30% or lower. It's a disgusting practice don't take my word for it though there's a plethora of complaints about it online across multiple forums. The worst part however is they're using something called XIGNCODE which looks at all files you've accessed in the last 48 hours and scans keylogs. It's an atrociously invasive game that goes beyond even Facebook's data mining practices.https //forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/104174 sitting in main menu pubg is eating 99 of my gpu 970/In conclusion. Please do not hand this publisher anymore money. Please do not play this game as it's got a fun value that lasts about 40 60 hours after you're 'used' to the game mechanics and you start making it into the final 10 20 consistently only to realize you're not cheating so the chances of you winning are already slimmer than they should be.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You may drop in a city and loot 5+ houses and get nothing but a pistol whereas your opponents may visit 1 2 houses and get an AKM + armour and instantly destroy you.Overall the game needs a massive improvement and focus needs to be put into the game's inadequate servers optimisation and cheaters.

I'm glad a game like PUBG has actually taken its time to update their game because quite a lot of studios I find don't update anything for their games. Although I have tried it out again and to be completely honest it's fun with friends but only with friends.Then again I'm the type of person that just does not like battle royal games. I bought this game initially because I was interested in the play and since my friends were wanting to get into it that I may as well give it a go. Although when I did infact buy it I met with problems prior to (around) its release and I couldn't redeem a refund. That's why I still have the game and the hours.Do I recommend it for its price?

2017-11-23,0,0,608,True,Recommended,I love battle royale type games. They are rogue like winner takes all paranoid murder fests that require strategy awareness and skill. I have played the precursor to this game the Arma 3 Battle Royale mod and loved it. WIth PUBG/Battle Royale it all comes down to you have one life your choices are important you have to be aware and have a plan that is adaptable. If you screw up put yourself in a place to get ambushed easier fire your weapon when you don't have the upperhand don't stay near your team or drive unsafe you are putting your one single life and that game at risk. This makes the game exciting and interesting but frustrating and anger inducing when things don't go right.When they put PUBG together they took almost all the good bits of the mod and added features/systems on top of that that made the game even better. These additions include better squad games reviving squad members azimuth/compass HUD (better) shooting from a vehicle target hit feedback (with blood mist) fuel for vehicles etc. When the much lauded vaulting mechanic comes it should be a major change to gameplay and tactics. When all of these pieces come together it makes a fun and exciting game that has become very popular. I would even say that this game will end up influencing other leading shooters to incorporate and mimic PUBG and battle royale type gameplay mechanicsWould I recommend this game? Absolutely yes with some caveats 1. You need a good PC to play it even on the lowest settings the game doesn't perform as well as it should2. The game has some bugs that need to be ironed out3. There are cheaters that Bluehole and PlayerUnknown needs to further address4. There are toxic players with mics (which you can mute) The things I wish PUBG had that the BR mod had is a hardcore mode where ammo is tied to magazines that have to be packed and repacked as well as deploying a weapon to steady it on the environment. Scopes that have a red dot on top that you can switch inbetween. A night mode with flashlights and nightvision goggles/scopes. Also the BR mod had vehicle repair kits and one broken helicopter randomly placed that you had to fix and had very little fuel to run. If they could add a heli (or other special vehicles) that you had to fuel to run or that randomly airdrop it would be very interesting to gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I accepted and we unleashed our inner Mad Max our first fight as blood brothers he flipped a smaller car off the road after which I ran over it's occupant. After that we shared other battles took more lives under our wheels until one fateful encounter. We were driving along a road when from the bushes beside us came enemy gunfire i pulled back around and ran over the assailant but when i drove up to my ally's car i found him dead on the ground.

2018-03-29,0,0,155,False,Not Recommended,"The concept is good. The execution is absolutely dreadful.So by now I'm sure you've read a lot of reviews on the optimization hackers crashing etc. Well I'm going to go a little more in depth than surface issues like that. The things I will bring up certainly will fall within one of those categories but will be in an attempt to highlight a much larger issue.#1 HackersThe thing that frustrates me the most in this game is that the players at the end are always blatant hackers. Now digging a bit deeper the larger issue here is Bluehole's complete and utter apathy toward the situation. In fact there's a lot of speculation in the community that they are purposely not banning extremely obvious hackers due to the fact that it is actually an integral part of certain Asian economies. Yes hackers are encouraged by the developers because by the time they get banned they've often sold cosmetics for $700+. A ban means nothing to them. The developers will literally let people with a 90% win rate 100% top 10 rate and 50 1 KDA sit at the top of the leaderboard all season. That's how blatantly obvious it is. This is not hyperbole what I'm saying is a literal scenario from last season.To put this into perspective these buffoons don't even encrypt their packets. This allows script kiddies to hack undetected with ease running a program on another computer.#2 DesyncComing in second (it was close) is certainly the desynchronization (desync) issue. Hit detection is client side. Most things in this god awful game are client side. Therefor it's EXTREMELY common for someone to use a lag switch switch it on before popping out from cover light up their enemy then switch it back off. Bingo insta kill to the innocent person who's waiting for the person to peak from around corners yet never does. They only end up dying never seeing the person peek yet on the death cam it shows them carefully slowly peak around and take their time firing. Sure I know what you may be thinking ""I'm sure not everyone uses lag switches"". You're right and in fact that was my initial thought on the desync issue. HOWEVER and this is the main point here Asians hop over to the NA servers because they know their ping will be higher (which is a HUGE advantage with client side hit detection) and people with normally decent connections will start massive downloads before starting their PUBG match. This allows them to have a 1+ second advantage on everyone else. This is so incredibly common that I dare wager around 40% of the people I come across are desync'd. It's blatantly obvious when you pepper someone see blood poof 5 8 times and on the death cam you never even hit them once.#3 Physics and Physics Related GlitchesThird is the infuriatingly horrendous physics and the bugs caused by them. Want an example? Sure go to YouTube and search for ""PUBG Glitch"". There you go. Motorcycles bumping into cars cause the cars to fling into outer space at a few million miles per hour while flipping at an equally absurd rate. Tiny pebbles cause vehicles in general to either completely stop (and damage the hell out of you) or react in some absolutely ridiculous way. Now I again have a feeling I might know what you're thinking. I used to think ""well that's not too bad everyone puts up with it and it's a bit funny"". Sure you're right if you're thinking that. Here's my gripe however. Whether you're getting down to the top 10 to die to a vehicle malfunction or dying within the first 30 seconds of landing (yeah sometimes when dropping you take random amounts of damage for literally no reason at all sometimes it's 90% of your health and one punch will finish you off) it eventually gets absolutely infuriating. Having it happen the first 100 times is admittedly fairly funny. However beyond that it gets incredibly old to be so powerless over your fate. We're playing a competitive video game clearly it's not unreasonable to assume that someone playing this game would want to die to someone else's skill someone else's luck or their own shortcomings. Dying to poorly programmed BS is not fun.#3.5 Physics and Teamkilling Your FriendsPart three and a half still falls into the physics but it's a bit different. You will team kill your friends all the damn time with vehicles it's just the way this stupid game wants things to happen. I had a buddy jump onto my jet ski and insta die. No I was not moving. I couldn't even revive him because it literally insta killed him (not a down). You learn to adapt to these kinds of things and make sure you're playing EXTREMELY carefully in regards to vehicles but imagine that during a firefight. If you're more concerned by the vehicle accidentally TAPPING (and insta killing) your team mates than you are the 4 enemies firing at you there's a MAJOR flaw in the game. You are playing against the poor programming 95% of the time in this game and playing against other players about 5% of the time. That's the TRUE experience of this game fighting flaws in an attempt to actually eventually fight players.#4 LootFourth is most definitely the loot system. My god RNG is just the stupidest thing (and laziest) that developers could possibly do. Yes it works for dungeon crawlers. No it doesn't work for an FPS be it Battle Royale or otherwise. When will developers finally learn this? The fact that you can drop down and search through 5+ buildings and still not have a weapon is just pathetic. Yes that happens. I mean there are videos of streamers all over the place showcasing exactly that running from building to building not finding anything worthwhile. Meanwhile some lucky punk picks up a shotty and kills you. Sure having that happen now and then is not terrible and is part of the game. However when there are so many hackers who literally have a weapon before you gain control of your character (when dropping some people make it to the ground 100x faster than you do somehow and also never have the 2 3 second period where you're ""getting up"" after landing and unable to control your character) you are powerless. You can do nothing but watch as they aim on your head before you've even seen a single weapon. This happens every game. Every. Single. Game. The hackers know exactly where to go to get the weapons you will never beat them to a good weapon while playing honestly. All you can do is go to sub par areas and cross your fingers for loot.The Real Issue The DevelopersI'm sure by now you've noticed a trend. Pretty much everything I've mentioned here is essentially a gripe that the developers are well terrible. They are. I firmly believe that Bluehole consists of monkeys which they give different psychoactive drugs and put a keyboard in front of them. At least that's the quality of the product they produce. They're rookies without a clue and their interactions with their customers make it blatantly obvious that they're also condescending self righteous hats with a chip on their shoulder. I'm fine supporting a rookie company who treats their fans well. However supporting a pile of garbage with pompous jackasses behind it is asinine and unreasonable. I'd never recommend this game to anyone. Dr. Disrespect sums it up all the time with his many many rants. The developers are trash. The game is trash. It never gets better. To top it off they're more concerned with cosmetics and offering up rewards to the hackers than fixing any sort of legitimate bugs.Steer clear. Seriously. You will regret putting any time at all into this game.P.S. I made it to top 200 in NA my first season playing if that tells you anything about my level of familiarity with FPSes and my skill. None of my rant is based on getting roflstomped and simply assuming I'm being killed by script kiddies.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-07,1,2,162,True,Recommended,PUBG is truly a tactical strategic and skill based Battle Royale game that no other game can replicate. Basically anyone can play this game but getting kills is not the only thing. It's about surviving. You can win Chicken dinner with only 1 kill too! What you have to do is just survive until the last man.. xD But it is difficult to be last person standing with just one kill. getting into last top 10 players is the best experience you can get. Too many glitches right now since the game is early access. The game is not optimized so there are fps drops even in lower settings.

2017-12-05,0,0,722,True,Not Recommended,The game is 100% ruined by hackers for the time being and also by the developers unwillingness to do anything that would actually prevent cheating. PUBG has become near unplayable due to 90% of games ending with chinese hackers instantly killing half of the server or using a drop kick hack to kick everyone out of the game making player count go from 100 to 30 within 3 minutes of the game starting by killing them while they are disconnected. If you are lucky enough to land far away from a hacker it just means you will loot for 15 20 minutes until your whole squad dies instantly without any chance to fire a shot making every match tedious at best.With the developers refusing to ban more often cheaters are actually making money by killing mass amounts of players for points and using them to get crates and then selling those crates offloading money onto different steam accounts before the next banwaves.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-05,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. A friend gifted me the game and I tried to play it but kept getting an initialization error with Steam. Interesting thing is my friend had the same issues too but they got miraculously resolved (like everyone else that's been asking for help on forums). After having this game installed for over an hour and accumulating 15 minutes in the game JUST by sitting at the loading/error screen I've decided it's really not worth trying to play. The even better part is that half the users that ask for the solution to this problem never get it fixed but if they do they just restarted Steam and BAM! It's working! By the way the other half that were listening and trying to come up with solutions still didn't find a fix. Not even the big yellow ""Cancel"" button at the error screen does anything.I've accumulated 15 minutes in the game by spending almost an hour doing the following Restarting the game and Steam testing the same 5 solutions repeated all over Reddit and Steam even re installing and trying to play on the test server sharing with a different account and using it from there disabling my antivirus disabling my firewall using a VPN running Steam in admin mode running the game in admin mode without steam restarting my PC and verifying the game files.Too long didn't read The game is so buggy that only half the users who have the same issue as me get it fixed and it happens magically out of nowhere. I've tried most everything there is to try and that didn't work.ICING ON THE CAKEI went to submit a report ticket because I should probably be nicer and tap the devs on the shoulder by saying that the game is broken for half of their users and it tells me to register an account. Fine. I try to register and I get a server error. I literally couldn't fix the original issue find a fix that was working for more than half the victims of it or send a report ticket about the issue.My official rating 1.3/6 because I can only judge the game by what I've heard and what I've heard is fairly bad optimization for the majority of high end users and (from personal experience) bugs that literally prevent you from reaching the main menu of the game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

All three modes give a different feel to the game. Moments with your squad that you won't forget. 100 player battle royale. Nearly all of the cons listed here are being worked on. They're working on a new map. You don't have to wear pants.CONS (As of Early Access 3/28/17) Switching weapons and interacting with world objects isn't smooth (sometimes you have to hit the button multiple times to get the interaction or weapon switch to work). Reloading sometimes doesn't happen especially frustrating when you first find a gun and need to load it. Grenade throwing is extremely slow/feels off. What is up with the really slow end to the parachute landing. Sometimes it's instant others I feel like I'm falling through quicksand. RNG will sometimes get you killed.

I killed a lot of people from back while they were sniping other people I even trolled them a lot in the game stayed behind them waited so that they see me and boom! a kar98 shot from 2 meterwhat do I mean by this? we have plenty of good shooters and survival games that you can play battleroyale is just a marketing game. right now game industry is trying to earn more money from the online and competitive games and that changes the shape of video games ( i don't say we don't have good single players no . I'm saying that tables have been turned ).

2018-01-07,0,0,1386,False,Not Recommended,"Any positive summary of this game is entirely offset by the overwhelming number of cheaters.To date I've logged approximately 800 hours between the live and test servers. Cheating has never been as rampant as it has been since the weeks shortly before PC launch and every day since. It's clear that BattlEye is not the answer yet Bluehole refuses to acknowledge as much and instead demands that the community police itself by submitting reports to what is undoubtedly a severely backlogged tracker.BattlEye reported 50k accounts were banned for cheating in August 2017. That number increased by 500% to 300k in October. A mere month later that number more than doubled to 700k. As of December 2017 1.5 MILLION accounts have been banned for cheating. At the current rate we can expect BattlEye to report 3.5 million or more bans by the end of January 2018.I'm not going to mince words China is a huge part of this issue. Bluehole has taken the politically correct approach to combating the cheating and their ""creative director"" Brendan Greene has gone so far as to call out the PUBG community for demanding better results namely by way of a region lock. Given that Chinese players comprise an estimated 60 65% of the PUBG community it's no surprise that Greene and Bluehole are ignoring public outcry about the cheating in an effort to protect the player totals they so frequently enjoy boasting about on social media. Despite the rapidly declining quality of this product their interest remains with numbers and sales.Make no mistake PUBG is a fascinating game and wildly addicting. My squad and I have persevered and continue playing but the reality is tolerating the ever increasing cheaters is draining both mentally and physically. I can't speak to what the future holds for PUBG but I can say with absolute certainty that much like thousands if not millions of other players we too are contemplating calling it a career on PUBG.Greene is a fool and Bluehole is in way over their heads that's the harsh reality. Until this community becomes more vocal with their discontent beyond what you see on /r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS where moderators censor most of the unrest this game will trudge along and become a revolving door of players until ultimately it's a Chinese only product.It's really quite unfortunate because as I opened with there are a lot of good things about this game but ineffective anti cheat naive developers a pandering ""creative director"" and China entirely overshadow those positives. In good conscience I cannot recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in investing a significant amount of time into this game certainly not for a $30 USD price tag.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The numbers of hacker just increases and when we report we don't even get feedback on that player what so ever. As now I don't think money is the problem for them I just want to ask them did they tried their best to prevent hacking? Or they just want to get more money? I don't know the answer and I wouldn't know at the end of the day but I don't want this game to die just because developers don't get their hands on the hackers.

Every game i've entered my ping was always over 100ms never really stabilizing my internet was absolutely fine at this time. Unoptimization There are times where the game decides to dip below 50 on lowest settings on my GTX 1060 and i7 6700k and the game consistently appears choppy making the all around experience of PUBGs nitty gritty atnosphere unejoyable to say the least. PUBGs Difficulty for some people this could definitely be a plus but in my eyes i don't see it as much as a 'fun' difficult like CSGO where learning it is fun and rewarding PUBG from the get go is very hard having you measure and calculate bullet drop based on meter distance with your map difficult to learn gunplay.

I could go on and on describing the bugs but i'm sure someone more diligent than me has already done it in the reviews. It's not a surprise that this game was surpassed by that named fortnite at least the game works despite being Oh btw when i'm referring to the content they add I'm mostly referring to skins of course.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Granted I do not have a ton of hours spent in the game but seeing some other reviews it makes it looks like EVERY game is filled with hackers and from my experience that's obviously not the case.I've even played a couple of times on NA and haven't encountered any hackers either but sadly the ping difference makes it almost unplayable.Now with that said this game is a hit or miss. Either you'll love it or you'll hate it. I'm one of the former.Opimization is not great but it's playable on most rigs and there's still bugs that happens but they are rarely occuring and often minor.

2018-03-05,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,I honestly am surprised that this game had so much time in alpha and beta and still is a huge dumpster fire. Cheaters are not as big of an issue as I was expecting from the gameplay and reviews I had previously watched and read so good job on fixing that. Physics on vehicles that magically hit something when there is NOTHING THERE is just plain sad. Climbing over ledges railings etc. is hit or miss at the most inconveniant of times. Hit detection is abysmal. Having controller compatability but not allowing players using a controller to view death cams or report cheaters is yet another issue that shouldn't exist with how much time this game was in alpha/beta what did you just never have anyone test what happened after you die on controller? Last but not least... loot boxes (Player Unknown's casino) so you can get loot boxes for free but you get throttled through the week with having each loot box cost twice as much each time you get a random loot box and of those random loot boxes you can get ones that require keys to open (which cost money) good job forcing some players to pay for items that we all will admit look like crap unless you have God (or whatever deity you believe in) on your side giving you a cosmetic that you can sell for almost a grand (but loot boxes aren't gambling just like pacheenko parlors(sarcasm)).

This game partially made my summertime extremely fun and gave me and my friends a game to play. However after playing the game for hours on end each night you begin to realize how deep down this game is torn unstable and downright deteriorated on the inside. It's like that one fellow in your class who sits in class with a great gaping smile but deep down is filled with hurt and pain that is gasping to come out. Many of the issues I can describe are what many others have already stated terrible optimization (which they've been working on well done) client side kills issues with cheaters et cetera. However I believe this game outlines a greater problem I see with many newer early access titles today sure you purchased this game in ""early access"" and I know there will be that one guy who states""oh you dont know what early access means do you..."" but you see that's the whole issue allowing games to be broken to the point of frustration and unplayability but just brushing that to the side because it's ""in early access."" This similarly happened to Ark Survival Evolved as well where it was insanely fun to play with friends when it came out first in early access. However allowing your games to be this terrible just because it's an early access title completely spoils what could have been potentially an extremely fun game in the long run. It's like cooking someone a gourmet dish that all of the critics rave about but instead of giving you the final completed meal they give you 6 servings of the dish that were over cooked over seasoned dropped on the floor and accidently cooked with tainted meat. Sure the final dish is phenomenal but because you gave them a bad taste in their mouth of what this ""dish"" could have been they don't want to stay to eat the finished meal. They probably would have stormed out of the restaurant and filed a complaint with the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service. The point is I'm sure this game can go far in terms of replayability graphics and overall fun factor. But the fact that all of the fun that my friends and I have had was soiled with many of the ""early access"" issues is just upsetting especially seeing how much the game has changed. To be honest I'd rather would have waited for a few years and gotten the game in early access when these issues werent present at all then to have bought the game now and not be able to complain how terrible the game is because it's in ""early access."" If you haven't bought this game buy at your own risk. Fortnite is free runs better is more vibrant in terms of colors and is quite a fun game in my opinion I recommend checking that out. Also I do not have anything against the company and this review isn't to spread general hate and is simply outlining not only my honest opinion on the game but also what I think is to be a severe issue with the early access program.TL DR? The game was fun but the issues made it not fun. I don't want to hear a ""it's in early access don't complain"" because that arguement proves nothing. Early access has become a place of ""here's a terribly constructed game play it if you have any issues... it's in early access )"" If you take this review to heart my apologies but someone's gotta say it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The first 20 matches or so are so exhilerating and action packed that they feel like you've been brought right into the game. But eventually the same thing happens every match. Unless you intentionally do stupid and unique stuff the matches essentially boil down into win or die trying. The graphics are quite nice and pleasing to the eye.

2017-11-07,0,0,105,False,Not Recommended,Great Game with Great Issues I greatly enjoy this game I have invested nearly a hundred hours into the game doing either solo or squad with firends and streamers. I enjoy the level of competative edge you need to win the game and the tacitcal prowess that is needed for higher levels of play. But sadly the issues in the game are beginning to out weigh the positives. What I have noticed is that people are making excuses for PBUG due to it being an early access game which has some logic and reasoning behind it. Yet those excuses are starting to seem less and less creditable as the game ages. I have never encountered any obvious hackers but I have noticed that they have become and issue just like in any other game. Be that as it may BlueHole has hessitated in taking any action to stop the hackers or made any public statements that can reassure the community as far as I am concerned. But my biggest issue is with the lack of optimization. Again the game is early access but that is not an excuse for a game that has grown in popularity like PUBG has. I believe that BlueHole needs to take the steps to better optimize their game so that for us who do not have water cooled CPUs can have a chance at playing. But the other big issue that I have encountered is the inconsistency in the geometry. We have all seen streamers use the geometry to leap out of windows and into windows we have also seen players get their vehicles stuck and explode. Last night the night before I wrote this I was playing and found myself stuck on a fence. The fences that are open about a quarter of the way in places like the military base and around power lines in the game. I was stuck there and died outside of the playzone. Those are the inconsistencies that need to be fixed. Just to touch on the subject of getting hit by your moving car if you jump out I somewhat like that feature it could be changed a little to either damage you not kill you or kill you if you jump out wrong. All in all the consept of the game is nice and the gameplay is fun aside from what is above and the joy of winning has yet to get stale. The review is negative due to the issues and BlueHole not taking affermative action on these issues. Yet I will continue to play the game from time to time perhaps just not as religiously as I once did.Thank you.

The hacking is so bad it makes the game unplayable. The net code issues is just as bad. When you play 10 games and 8 of them are ruined by one of these 2 issues you konw it's time to move on and find something else to play. I have a lot of hours in this game toughed out a lot of stuff because I believed stuff would be fixed after 500 hours and not one thing has been fixed and the problems getting progressivly worse by the day im done. Save your money pick up fortnite or wait for the first triple A studio to come out with something like this. This team either doesn't care anymore or is just lazy and both aren't acceptable..

After playing this game for many hours since its release I can honestly say there are more negatives than positives to this game. To start the game mechanics have been broken and not improved on almost EVER. The vehicle mechanics are horrible nothing worse on this game than being fully geared moving through a field on a bike just to have it tip forward and kill both the driver and passenger. Wait times have gone up lately when joining games and sometimes you cannot even launch the game because ""Servers are too busy"". There are some good features of this game playing with friends is enjoyable for about 3 games then you just want to uninstall and refund. Many custom modes like Zombies War etc are not able to be played unless you get lucky when a lobby is not full but even once it is full good luck joining it as it never starts. Overall the game is something you may have fun with once you start but do not expect to be putting a thousand hours into this as playing it for more than an hour a day will result in some broken screens.

There is absolutley no objective to this game what so ever and the only thing it really has going for it is that its better than H1Z1. Yes the graphics are good and it can be fun at times but over the course of time youll just realize how buggy it is because its still early access and after wasting a good 30 minutes per match for no point youll soon realize that there truly is no point to this game than to come in first no ranks or unlockables besides some rewards packs. Maybe when they fix certain aspects of the game such as loot and server lag then I will most likely recommend the game.

I love the variety of weapons attachments and gear. I also can appreciate the fact that unlike H1Z1 there are lot more vehicles making it more fair to make it to the safe zone if you just so happen to pick a landing spot that isn't very close. My biggest complaint with the game at this point is by far the rewards system. I mean the currency is cool but even after saving and buying the third and fourth pioneer crate I got a pair of pants and a dirty white tank top. I mean ok ok I understand they have to make money and all but at least give us better rewards for winning. I have won multiple games now team and solo and still I just get a liiiittle more currency to buy a pioneer crate only to unlock a dirty wife beater. This isn't gonna keep me from playing but it is a little annoying.

It is obvious at this point that PUBG Corp are just trying to milk their playerbase before it completely loses interest.What they are doing is just despicable (within the world of game development of course). Close to nothing seems to be done to address the issues that the players have been enduring for over 6 months. Instead they just seem to remove features in hopes that it will run a bit better while just adding more lootboxes (none of which can be opened without using actual money).I had hopes for this game but knew something was way wrong when they released while it was not even close to finished. The creator (Brendan Greene) is even on record saying that they are aware of some core issues in their engine and that time is the issue not finance (H3 Podcast #44). This is what early access is for You keep the game in that state and work those things out. You don't just release a game with the promise of it being fixed at some point! THOSE ARE THE EXACT PROMISES YOU MAKE WHILE IT IS IN EARLY ACCESS!The fact that they did release it anyway says it all. The ability to add in game purchases and being able to host competitions and championships (just think of the sponsors!) seem to take precedence over actually developing the game.The game can be fun on occassion and I will still be playing now and again but I would not encourage anyone to opt in to this scam.

The grass and car are pretty but I dont want to spend a minute staring at it before the game connects to the server.Calling this anything but early access is a sham. The game still has a long way to go in terms of netcode and optimisation ebfore being deemed a full release. It was simply released so they could say it was and stop people complaining about hgow long it would otherwise have taken.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-27,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Introduction PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle royale 100 players open world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo duo and squad (3 4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward you hop off a plane loot weapons armors and equipments from buildings and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle royale game out there yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known PUBG has had a highly successful launch securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle royale PvP look no further. You've struck the gold..My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion Pros1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle royale PvP games are mostly in Early Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gatherinng as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no scoping bozos. A learning curve definitely exists not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi realistic weapon recoil and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles weapons weapon mods clothings and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. 7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV the game supports both FPS and TPS.Cons1. Currently very performance demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very low fps even on high end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum virtual RAMs can't help your 4 gigs RAM PC. One of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from &lt 30fps and extremely slow loading progress.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover but 2 seconds later blood squirts out of your chest you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO and Dota 2 you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three four RMBs to active the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game devs better fix this quickly.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to driveConclusionDon't lose all hopes because of my cons list remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-10,0,0,619,True,Not Recommended,If you want a proper idea of the game I really recommend you check out gameplay videos on youtube. A picture is worth a thousand words. That said Performance You need a fairly decent machine to run this game smoothly at full view distance and high distant detail LOD (screen scale). If you have a potato for a machine you might want to wait on this one.REASON FOR NEGATIVE REVIEW An epidemic of CHEATERS. The game is badly infested with cheaters in all game modes and also lots of griefers teamkilling in random duo and squad matches. The anticheat and devs have been catching and banning as many as 20 000 players a day for using cheats and it is still infested. Every second match has either a speed hacker running faster that cars or invisible players punching people long distance aimbots wall hacks no recoil etc etc. Plenty of video examples on Youtube. Literally thousands of them. The game is nearly unplayable its so bad. The steam forums have cheat distributors openly spamming ads for cheats. So many the mods cant keep up deleting them..For that reason I cannot recommend this game atleast not without this warning. Hopefully they get a handle on the cheating and griefing problem.. I will consider changing my review at that point if they do. Although Im not very happy with the developer for allowing people to grief other regions on this scale of abuse. So there's a good chance my review will remain negative whether they fix these problems or not. Even without the cheatng and griefing half the server filled with 400+ ping players makes the game a serious lag fest. With players teleporting like they are using a lag switch or something.tl dr buy at your own peril CHEATERS GALORE!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-07,0,0,138,False,Recommended,"Don't believe in mixed reviews. Any game that involves playerbase in it's development process will have mixed reviews. PUBG has it's flaws but it has a long road ahead of it. Any good game doesn't get developed in just one day. I believe PUBG is the most fun game I've ever played. Yes there are some problems but those problems exist because of the limitations imposed by technologies used in the game.People keep comparing it with CSGO for it's gunplay but they forget that CSGO has max 20 players connected to a server at any time. Whereas PUBG has 100 players connected to a server at a time. Of course it isn't gonna feel same as CSGO. People keep comparing it Fortnite but they forget that PUBG has more realistic texture and effects comapred to Fortnite. Of course there it is not as smooth as Fortnite. But the development looks promising.From its launch in Early Access to as of today PUBG has changed a lot. Devs keep updating the gameplay keep fixing the anticheat keep maintaining the servers. Overall progress is slow but there is progress. PUBG is the most promising game in the Battle Royale genre. I think Bluehole (or to say PUBG Corp) is doing all it can to make game better. Those who know what they signed up for when they bought a game developed by small company like Bluehole give it a ""Thumbs Up"".

When you play a lot this gets frustrating very quickly because it takes you more than 1 minute to load (if you dont have an SSD) and the same time to drop from the plane and land 3) The physics in this game are simply broken you can't understand if you dont try it 4) Cheaters A LOT of cheaters 5) 中国古代秘密 6) The feeling that there's something slightly off that you have in every game.7) Emotes The list will update every time devs will drop an update from their a s s.22 feb 2018New patch made the game unplayable for days UNLESS you deactivate replays and death cam.

Keybinds work temporarily then the game forgets the input randomly in a match the plane randomly drops all players still graphical texture related issues still occur regularly matches crash for all players simultaneously lock players on the plane flip and stop vehicles on a flat paved road destroy vehicles randomly without impact get fps drops from 120 0 as soon as a player shoots at you at close range you still get shot after youve long since run behind cover (Talking and unquestionable 1 2 seconds later) even with a ping of 20 30. I love this game but unfortunately it's extremely limited to it's lack of preparation for popular demand and even though it's been basquing in that glory for a year it still for some reason can't find the monetary foothold it needs to get better servers and netcoding. I don't blame the game really but Blue Hole a successful heap of mobile phone app pushing nobodies riding on the back of the first proper PC success they've ever managed. Riding it right off a cliff.

Negative.I bought it when this game was 3.6v and now i wish i had ''refund button''.I believed in game and i was hoping it is gonna have some BIG Upgrades &amp Updates but story is completely different. The servers became laggy and i mean really laggy. Tickrate is so u see u took the shoot but other player says and sees different. Hitbox is Hitting a player and seeing the blood effect but player is still alive even tho' the replay recorded his blood effect and he is still 100HP when u watch it on replay ). players swallowing bullets. Updates.Cases a lot of cases. Optimization.They say the game is getting more optimized but trust me its not.The first 100 200hrs of game we're let's just say more optimized.I could go on and on with this so im just gonna write it like this U playing normally with some lag and out of nowhere u see Chinese s flying and coming out of the mountain for some reason and saying ''CHINAAAAAAA NUMBA 1''. REGION LOCK would save every ing server but nooo let Chinese inside EU servers bcz Chinese for life. One match your buildings can load other match its just like puke even tho ure standing next to it. Cheaters everywhere and these guys doesnt know how to make proper anticheat that will prevent them from flying and shooting through walls ). People killing you even tho you went behind the wall trust me guys its not tickrate. He has ing steering wheel attached to his bullets so he just turns them around the wall to kill you. Optimization is so good that these days u cant even load into match u hear people around u but ure still on loading screen and I personally love that &lt 3 . Jumping from a building will kill you but jumping from a ledge that is as twice as big as a building will give you 30 dmg.

2018-02-10,1,2,277,False,Not Recommended,Dodged the game for a long time but so many people told me to get it and how fun it is.I had some fun in the first 10 hours but now I'm fed up with it for the following reasons I don't play online Multiplayer games to play alone that's my personal preference and the Duo/Squad fight system is just atrocious in my opinion. Headshots do not kill they'll most likely just knock the player out and that can become really ridiculous. When I was playing a Duo with a friend we got into a fight in a bad spott (we were in a valley and out opponents were holding a hill crest) I downed one of them twice and the other one once but they always got each other up again and I didn't even had the chance to finish them since they were always behind the crest as soon as they got downed since they permanently only peaked out with their heads. Yes this is basically an ArmA mod and positioning is quite important I understand that but if I turn out as the better player I still have no chance to make any use of it. When you play with 1 2 or 3 friends you have the choice to drop far away and just loot for the first 10 20 minutes or you drop in a hotzone and most likely lose atleast 1 in the beginning and have him wait for the rest of the round. So you try yourself Solo get a few kills and end up being killed over 200m with Ironsights and a 100% accuracy straight through a bunch of treetops and you aren't even able to see yourself in the deathcam.So if you're lookin for a fun game to play with your friends I wouldn't recommend PubG but if you're lookin for something to play alone from time to time and can accept the fact that you'll stumble across a hacker a but more often than in other games go ahead I guess you can have a great time. PS. I run the game on latest mid range hardware and the performance is good but every 4th 5th game I get stuck in the loading screen which is quite frustrating if you play with friends and want to drop together and people told me that the server tickrates are terrible but I cant confirm this from my own experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-09,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,PUBG The times where stuff is happening (firefights car chases etc.) PUBG is extremely intense and adrenaline pumping.The times where stuff is not happening (80% 90% of the match) It's monotonous and ing boring.As well as most the matches being painful uneventful slogs the game is also very unpolished. At least once a game some sort of problem will arise sometimes costing me the chicken dinner. I'd have to say the worst part of the whole match is the drop phase (In which you skydive from a plane and then parachute to the ground) I GARENTIE YOU that 7 times out of 10 you won't drop where you think your going to. Players that are good at dropping are really just compensating for the t. It's also telling that the mobile version runs better than both the Pc and Xbox One versions.The gunplay is actually pretty good with a verity of firearms and attachments (compounded with the rarity of the actual gunfights them self) each one is pretty unique and rewarding in there own way.The graphics are murky and ugly as all (on low) and even if you do have 2 Titan X's to run this game at ultra (This is pretty much the new Crisis in those regarded) they still don't really look appealing (you play this game for the gameplay and only the gameplay by the way).The last thing I want to talk about is the developers. In terms of updates to PUBG the devs have only made very minor performance improvements to performance and almost nothing else (apart from that one time they added a map) then they add new skins and and expect the community to believe that there making huge progress with the game (there not). Each update only makes miniscule steps in the correct direction. They have a bunch of new stuff planned for 2018 but unless they fix the base game until until then I struggle to want to support PUBG.If you looking for short bursts of adrenalin buy it. If you don't stay far the away from this game. It's also overpriced for what it is (nearly 30). In high sight I'd buy it for 16 20 maximum. I'd say wait for a sale but it never goes on sale and never will.To fix this game all they need to do is Fix the performance Fix the Drop Phase Fix the servers Fix the graphics Fix the amount of content included Fix the Price TagAnd then and only then do you have a good video game.2/5,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-07,0,0,130,False,Not Recommended,Don't bother.I only have about 100 hours of the PUBG experience so grain of salt and that stuff. Before release I would have recommended PUBG to anyone who's a fan of FPS' but not so much after release and the failing patches that followed.The reason why I say this is the bad Netcode Desync and server issues that have not been resolved since beta nor mentioned by developers or Mr. Unknown himself. Brendan's opinion on PUBG being in permanent beta doesn't give confidence in either his capabilities or his team's to address the issues and/or request from their clients. Customisation is irrelevant. A couple of races a few skin colours some hair choices. At the end of the day you're going to look like everyone else.The lobby doesn't work. It hasn't worked since beta. Every time your friend logs on and you want to invite him Refresh. Can't matchmake Refresh. Text is broken and instead of sentences it's a jumble of matrix looking symbols across your screen Refresh.They had a poor example of rain and fog weather effects not long ago. Rain was terribly loud and in this constant loop. Fog was unrealistically constant and just a pain. After some data mining and realising a lot of their players were leaving matches when put into rain/fog they decided to fix it. By fix it they didn't add the option to have weather effects in the lobby they didn't fix their weather effects based on user feedback they simply removed it which has left a chunk of their community longing for that feature albeit broken.Jumping out of the plane was alright now it sucks. It used to be that you could easily land 3 4 km's radius from the plane's flight path. But I guess that made early game too loot friendly and as one does forced players to land in a much tighter space where 50 people will die in the first 5 minutes of the game.I think looting is one of the best features in the game. On my latest game I was killed by a guy with a suppressed AK with lvl 3 helmet and bag through an iron sight. So it just comes to show you don't always get the good loot but its great fun battling early game for better gear.Getting into a vehicle opening doors and vaulting in PUBG is a game in itself. You press F (interact) to get into a vehicle and nothing happens. You press F again and your character jumps in and out of the car.You stand by a door and press F nothing press F again the door opens and closes in your face like a rude poltergeist REALLY doesn't want you there. You stand in front of a window knowing you can vault through. 10 jumps later you assume that there must be an invisible wall only for your squad member to get through the window first try.When your opponent gets the better of you you'll notice in the death cam there's a 1 2 second delay. For example you're looting and suddenly you drop dead on the floor. Your first instinct is to watch the Death Cam only to notice your opponent has fired 5 shots before any of them registered. When their potat.. servers eventually caught up you died immediately.Concerning the Death Cam after being killed eventually you have to scrutinise every detail of that cam. Did your opponent's aim snap to you did your opponent have any or less recoil than they should after shooting did your opponent see/know/guessed where you were was your opponent's movement speed in any form higher than it should be etc. Seeing as PUBG's BattleEye anti cheat system is nothing but a CPU hog and doesn't seem to know the difference between a script and System32 files. Instead of improving on their anti cheat system as they probably found it fruitless they decided to find and charge the hackers directly. After 120 arrests and 30 cases and an average of 1.5 million players' monthly reports the game is still swamped with cheats.And my latest peeve in PUBG. Microtransactions! We all know what those are. After playing several matches in PUBG you earn Battle Points which is cumulative based on your skill. With these Battle Points (BP for short) you can either customise your character (irrelevant as mentioned above) or buy loot crates. Loot crates give strictly aesthetic items BUT NOW they give you a random loot crate one free to open or one key to open which cost a few dollars to get an item worth $0.64 in the steam market. You see the 404 logic not found error here? Why are loot crates and market purchases our only options? Why is there no PUBG store in the lobby to buy aesthetic items? Why does a virtual leather hoodie cost $1000 in the market? Why knowing that hackers are mainly hacking to win games and items to sell them on the market for ridiculous prices are you not seeing the flaw in this system?And my biggest problem with PUBG is that it feels like sniffing bad cocaine. You know it's very bad but you keep trying hoping the next time might be a little better.TL DR Wait for other Battle Royale titles to be released before purchasing PUBG. The competition might give them some sense to improve or at least fix their title to avoid other better titles to revert their current player base to an actual working title.PS It's been longer than a year after release and still the game is a complete buggy mess.

2018-03-22,0,0,540,False,Not Recommended,"This game is like an abusive relationship.Starts out well and you're having some good times yet after some time something changes (this game showing you it's awful technical side) and you start enjoying it less and less.You want to love it you really do and you get these moments where you think you do but actually you ing hate it and never want to have anything to do with it ever again. And yet after some time you end up booting it up again expecting some great times with your mates yet most of the time you just get angry dissapointed and very very salty.A big chunk of games you die as soon as you drop because someone else got a gun before you or leave because your mates died and you don't want them to afk for 30 min.Another big chunk of games you loot/loot+kill everyone at the drop point and then play running simulator until one of the later circles.And the whole time you're just waiting for that one game where everything aligns perfectly you loot well kill loads do some sicks moves and win.And that's fine and is how this game genre works (the rng in looting the midgame downtime) but the last thing you need (when you're already super easily frustrated) are technical issues and oh boy boy oh boy.. this game is riddled with these.The optimization and framerate while way better than prerelease seems to be getting worse with almost every update they put out. (don't forget that all of these updates are anywhere from 1.5 to 9 gigs big lol and are usually just backend changes).The loot lag at the start of the match at the point where the performance of the game is absolutely critical and every second matters is ridiculous and cuts short plenty of games. Same thing when it comes to weapons not loading in until you've went past them and you end up getting blasted by someone who came from the location you were just at a few seconds ago. The parachute feels and acts as if it's made out of bricks and sometimes while landing flings you across the map like a slingshot let's not even talk about the constant random fall damage that would get you anywhere from 95% to 10% hp before you even got to loot a single item. (thankfully they've seemed to fix that in one of the recent updates let's hope it stay's that way).The worst of them all has to be the abysmal hit detection in the early game you seeing blood splatter all across the screen checking the death cam and seeing the game not register the shots at all. (once again especially in the early game when it's absolutely critical that the game performs well)The cheating issues which loads of players have been talking about endlessly.The high latency players usually chinese ) because of whom like this happens). https //giant.gfycat.com/GenuineGleamingBufeo.webm (i don't know how effective this change actually was but atleast in one of the updates they've started grouping people into games by their latency).And these are just the biggest and most obvious issues over the 500 hours i've played i've seen way more problems which most of i can't even remember but here are some off the top of my head.Falling through the map randomly (usually after doing a jump with a vehicle) not being able to rotate camera the weapon scope having no indicators vehicles exploding just by touching certain objects slight contact of a vehicle and player resulting in the player being flung 5 meters and getting knocked teammates having no markers above them getting stuck in walls upon leaving vehicles climbing on top of a box in the water and dying...if i had the will to think about it some more i could come up with a dozen more issues which ruined a match or a few in one way or another.I mean this would've been somewhat fine if the game was still in early access but this game claims that it's fully released (and you'd expect that it would mean the game has a certain amount of polish to it) but i guess they just had to sell some extra copies on christmas. And i'm sure the developers are working hard at fixing these issues but we should be judging the game by what it is not what they're trying to make it be or the effort they put in it. As a cherry on top the game also had ""paid"" lootboxes since early access which...really...is unacceptable imo trying to get more money out of their customers while the game still isn't even finished for 1.0.And yet even after all these criticisms.... i believe new players wouldn't feel as if these issues make the game unplayable.(atleast for the first few hours or dozens of hours because they only stand out after they ruin your games a lot of times)So i'm a bit torn on this one honestly clearly i've played it a lot so there is some appeal to it. I can't say that the game doesn't have great moments especially (atleast in my case) when you play with friends and you fill the prematch and midgame downtime with some banter spend games driving over people chasing the box being a crossbow assassin and getting some chicken dinners every now and then. But really.. i don't think we should be supporting companies like this. Companies that put cosmetic lootboxes prerelease banning ""confirmed"" stream snipers releasing an unfinished product. ( or atleast stop supporting them considering how much money they've made already ) )Oh well while this game has executed this genre better than any game before it there's still a long way to go until we get a BR game done right. You can see that slowly but steadily this game is on decline both when it comes to streaming it and playing it players are sick of it and have moved to fortnite which clearly means that bluehole is doing something wrong. So if you ask me just wait for someone else to perfectly execute this genre or wait for bluehole to sort it's out and make this game great.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is one of the most usntable and glitchy pre alphas I have ever played. Considering this game is only multiplayer and the fact probably half of the games I play I cant load in. When I do load in the game crashes a lot of the time. Walls are glitchy as hell jump on one and you can be stuck for eternity. The play zones in my opinion are hit and miss sometimes zones will allow for a good fire fight other times players will spend majority of the game running just to be killed by getting stuck on a rock. Angles of vision seem off some players having the ability too see you round corners or over hills when you can look over them (the amount of times I have been shot around corners due to server lag is ridiculous) First aid kits are also too common you can shoot a guy 20 30 times but as long as he has 5 seconds to himself he can keep coming at you like jesus reincarnate.

2018-10-11,0,0,608,False,Not Recommended,I am amazed by how much I have tried to stick to this game.The game could have added very little and I would have stayed in it for thousands of hours but it felt like with every patch after 1.0 they added something I liked and messed up 30 systems within the game. It got to a point where there is no legitimate reason I can justify putting my limited gaming time into this game. Ridden with bugs updates that just destroy the game auto server assignment that puts you in a server with 200+ ping cheaters (even thoug I must admit this has gotten better since launch) RNG ridden mechanics unworthy high risk high reward situations a developer that honestly looks like it does not care about us about the people supporting their product.The map design is alright for Erangel and Sanghkok but on their Miramar map you pretty much see people for the first 5 minutes then walk around aimlessly for 30 minutes just to see the last 10 players standing the rythm on that map is straight up an insult to the players.The localization of the product is also a mess and I can t believe that it still looks like a rushed product. Thanks for inspiring better developers to get into this genre tho that actually might make me come back into the Genre even if you don t like Fortnite much (not a game for me) there are a lot of games adding the BR mod to their franchises and it surely will be better experience than this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It was such an addictive exercises but as the time went on people started to notice that this game had many problems with it (Many the Optimization and the cheaters that infested the game). I ignored all of it because i truly loved pubg and i never supported any other BR game. AND IT WAS LIKE THAT UNTIL TODAY. PUBG decided to ban my friend from the game. He tried to contact pubg support and basically they told him that they dont really know why he got banned.

2017-08-01,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,"Not a bad game however apparently the mods hand out bans for ""stream sniping."" Using legally avaible information such as a publicly available stream to ""win"" a video game with no real life cosequences may be rude but it should not be a bannable offense. I base this opinion on a couple obvious problems with the ""banned for sniping"" argument. The first is the burden of proof how do you know they were sniping can you prove it? Players of a high skill level in games routinely get reported for cheating I believe there was even an example of this in the news around the launch of Overwatch where a particularly skilled player was called a cheater by other pros only to be vindicated in the end. The stark reality that humans are petty and the mentality of ""I is streamer therefore I best player so if I die that guy cheated! So i use community as weapon!"" is something that should not be encouraged. The second is that even if someone is sniping that is not a legitamite reason to ban them no one is forcing the streamer to do so they could use a delay to help alleviate the problem and furthermore the size of PUBG alone would seem to favor the streamer by making matching with them very unlikely. All in all the position taken by this game's management clearly states they care more about appeasing the top personalities who show interestest in the game rather than the vast majority of their playerbase and are willing to ban players to soothe the egos of said personalities.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's early acess arn't bugs suppose to be a prevelant issue needing to get fixed? Instead the developers ban people who encounter them (even several people who took video footage of bugs and reported them got banned)!Furthermore the majority of the threads reporting bugs consist of fan boys telling the person who has the bug that IT IS THIER FAULT &amp NOT THE DEVS. The most common of which appears to be shifitng the blame from the dev to the player via they need a ssd or that they need more ram (when the OP of all these threads the majority of time met or exceed the listed min. system req.).(2)Next you have ridiculous live stream bans (esp the ones involving cars). This isn't a fault on the player but has to do within the streaming platform were the strongest influence is money &amp user growth.For starters there are the obvious issues TONS of he said she said finger pointing (I watched one of the streamers who was Called out by someone who got banned and EVERYTIME they got killed or shot at they were calling stream sniper this and that).People are essentially being penalized for nothing and the TOS needs to be changed to include a statement where streamers who are live do so at thier own risk and that any streamer before even being allowed to file a complaint must show that they wern't live but instead had a delay in thier broadcast by X amount of time (like how any MOBA does).But instead of using the supplied data for the use of modifying thisgame into something better like most things these days the devs instead seek to shut down any change in favor of $$$.Speaking of money this game includes gambling (loot) boxes that charge you real money as if you were playing a F2P game. $$$(Also the optimization and bug fixing has still yet to show themselves but you can rest in peace knowing that new gambling boxes are on thier way out towards you!)DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOUR SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO PLAY FORTNITE,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game itself can be fun but depending on your viewpoint the bugs can either ruin your experience or enhance them depending on if you're tryharding for wins or if you're just trying to have fun with a squad of friends. The biggest issue is the ability to play the game from Oceania as the OC server itself is a baron wasteland for solo/duo players who are then forced to play in the Asia/SEA servers which have a massive number of cheaters/hackers that go unpunished and if they are punished there's no way you can tell if you report them.Edit So PUBG Corp have made changes that tell you if a player you reported is banned which is nice. A new issue that's arisen is the inability to choose which server to play on. You now play on a pre determined server and as someone in Oceania that 100% means I get put in a game with exclusively SEA/AS players and there's nothing I can do about it. Absolutely horrible.Overall only play this game if you got it as a gift and don't spend a dime on it at all.

I dont know if its due to the Chrono shift or if the enemies cant sync up in our reality but its going to be hard to damage them.

If you Park next to any object (fence barrel wall etc.) then the car will not like it and it will start to rage attack the offender or just roar. Also game have anomaly ""Springboard"" like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R and if during the trip you missed it you can fly up a few meters even if you were driving on a flat road. Do not believe that all people in the game. In fact there are creatures from the other world which only represent the model of human behavior. But when theyre in danger they use their powers. Here is an incomplete list immortality self guided bullets vision through the walls teleporting to any point at the request of the owner the transformation of any land transport in the flying fast movement (Sonic mode). Also these creatures though deprived of reason but has a sense of purpose evolution and rapid reproduction that even developers can not cope with them. What would you not think that you can easily win just by developing strategies for survival and knowing the subtleties the game pumps you a special poison. This poison can distort your perception of the world due to what will seem that the picture slows down or there is an effect of framing leads one to suspect the Bush gave the enemy makes you think you're safe lying in the grass however actually lie in an empty field. Also this poison is able to give you a false trajectory for grenades and you throw it out the window and into the wall false hope of causing damage to the enemy although you do not get on it or just do not shoot (hallucination) periodically you will have the feeling that the game is physics.Like a cherry on a cake the game has its own screamer.

The last few good things they've done was balance weapons and add map selection (since Miramar blows). Welp these GENIUSES decide to get rid of map selection and then they sue Epic because they've shot themselves in the foot so much they ran out of ammo.

2017-12-22,0,0,34,False,Recommended,When I started playing this game it was plagued with bugs and issues However the devs have been really consistantly patching and have improved the game by a substancial amount. A few months ago I may not have recommended this game but now I cant recommend enough. I would get some friends on board though because this game isnt even half as fun playing alone or with strangers. (most of the time)Pros The game features some very realistic sounds and the directional sound is as much a mechanic of the game as movement. Great job with that.The mechanics of the game are very good always keeping you moving and questioning your next move. Its very pretty in terms of graphics. Its quick to pick up and hard to master. There is a large amount of skill involved in getting good at it.Game is in continual development so a lot of new content is getting released monthly so far.Bullet drop and bullet damage is pretty consistant Ive found. Learning the different guns is a challenge but youll soon find your favourites.Its a great game to play with friends most of the time. It can suck when you die at the very start and have to wait for everyone else. But sometimes youll spectate the funniest things.Good inventory system.Very accomplishing when you do get that chicken dinner.The cons The game still has some bugs mostly with vehicles and interaction button (F) however the devs are pretty quick to patch em out.The damage you take from vehicles is infuriating. Its a one hit kill most of the time and there is no roll implemented in the game at the moment so vehicles can be OP at times. The driver can then loot your stuff with no damage to it unlike when you are involved in firefights.The controls can be clunky and there are quite a few of them. When you start playing its quite a large learning curve in this aspect.The quick pick up mechanic (F) is clunky at times and actually hinders you in a rush.There is no free customisation to character When I started I didnt know this and just accepted the default look thinking I could change cosmetics later. This is not the case.Flash hider compressor and silencer are not entirely accurate to how they perform in real life and there is almost no difference between the angled grip verses the handle grip it terms of accuracy.Sight distance even at full in settings isnt very good yet. When you are sniping with an 8x scope or higher you can see the full details but when its drawn in while you move positions or reload you generally will lose your mark in a green blur.No roll mechanic. They have implemented the climb mechanic recently but there is still no roll mechanic. It may not ever get released in the game but I feel its needed if they continue to have a one hit kill against vehicles.Overall This game is great and well worth the purchase if you are planning to play with friends. The interactions you have with randoms is well random. Some people are overly cooperative others will kill you to get the gun you just picked up. Some people suck at the game but are funny to have around others are just the worst people imaginable but are amazing at the game.The fast paced machanics and the feeling of getting that chicken dinner will keep you playing even if the game is full of bugs. You'll have the greatest highs and the worst lows while playing this game. 8/10 chicken dinners from me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The thing that made me buy this game was streamers. I enjoyed the game up to now. Even though I lost every match I played it was fun to play this game. I am not a guy who downvotes every video game etc. This game is the thing I downvote.The main problem of this game is CHEATERS!!! Also there are other reasons why you can't enjoy this game. You can't play because someone has written some code to make auto aim or hit players behind obstacles ( I see those cheaters every game I play especially in TPP Squad Mode in Erangel map). You have option to report players who cheat but you can't see the result of your report. Even in ETS2 Multiplayer (which is a free mod with the collabration of people who works as volunteers) you show/see your evidence as a video of your report and the result of the report in their website (ban kick etc.). I don't know if they written an algorithm to block spam reports (someone may report every lose) As a result I don't believe that they can handle millions of reports in a day. (since it needs money to hire people to look for reports) To conclude if you are not a cheater you can't enjoy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-14,0,0,784,False,Not Recommended,"Pubg has been one of my favorites ever since I picked it up back in april of 2017. So it's been over a year and the game is in full release. This is to be taken lightly though as the game is still riddled with bugs and instabiltiy problems. On my backup pc I can't even play this game (crashes past launch) due to the mentioned bugginess. The game is fun though and I've racked up my fair share of hours so far and soon will reach 700 hours. My problem with the game is the way the developer handles it. The departments for bug fixes and patches appears to work slowly at best and often take months to fix glaring issues with the game. While the ""in game purchase"" side of the game is flourishing with constant updates and patches to ensure that the up and coming players have their fair chance at spending 60 dollars to buy a skin that my 10 year old cousin could design better. Basically the customizables feel rushed and cheap at best. In comparrison to another game with skins Counter Strike comes out far ahead as their cheap skins look reasonable and function well with the game. Pubg's ""Cheap"" skins are anything but enjoyable and are a bear minimum that needs to change. Gameplay wise the game runs fine on my pc with over 90FPS but occationally stutters here and there. The movement is clunky and the weapons feel like your character has never lifted in his life making for extremtly bouncy rocoil. I feel the spirit of this game died on full release back in December of 2017. The original crowd that plays this game has mostly either left or only occationally comes back to play. Personally I logged at least 16 hours a week playing this game before the full release but with the change in gamestyle and desync issues I stopped playing anywhere near as much. To save the game the Dev team needs to cater to those who play the most of their game and stop listening to Gaben on how to make money. Listen to your playerbase or like many other big titles around you will lose us all together.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I never exploited the game or cheated in any way i saw that Macro keys and key loggers also where forbidden so i avoided those as well. Later that afternoon i message the PUBG support team asking for more information on my false ban and if it was possible to get it reviewed so it could be lifted. the reply i got basically said that they where aware of my acount restricion and where unable to reasses the restriction and could not provide me with any more information on my ban as it is against their rules. After a couple of emails each asking the question of ""is it possible to get my $30 USD refunded back to my account as a have been falsly banned"" they avoided the question to the point where i gave up. The game itself is fun however both battleeye and the PUBG support team are useless. im giving this a thumbs down purely for this reason.

2018-05-22,0,0,351,False,Not Recommended,Honestly...I love this game. I like it more than fortnite if that's why you've started to read this review. But that's just me I'm not a fan of the building system. With this game the gameplay is solid. The gunplay is decent and the looting system is acceptable. It's your standard good graphics battle royale. There you go. Why am I giving this game a thumbs down?Because its stupid microtransactions loot crate + key system. I already paid for this game and now as I put my hours in it it shoves countless chests in my face asking me please please sir...please put more money into my mouth so that I can be better than fortnite and you can get another pink TShirt. Don't get me wrong folks. I actually have made money off this game 80 dollars to be precise from getting a good customization item. However I feel that this system of crates+keys when already paying half the price of a AAA game is abusrd. You do one or the other. Not both. That's why this review is difficult to pinpoint. I love the game I love the gameplay but I hate how the developers are trying to make the money from it. There are much better ways to go about it yet they choose the key+crate clown fiesta that just annoys the living crap out of me. It feels as though especially lately I get at LEAST 75% of my crates as locked crates requiring me to pay $2.50 dollars more just to get that TShirt. Honestly I want to say it feels like more 90% but I don't want to be making this review seem too hyperbolic. TL DR Great GAME. Horrible Marketing Strategy and Dev's aren't focusing well. If there was any other game similar to this game and Fornite (without the building aspect) I would support it over this game at this point...but this is what I'm stuck with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-28,1,2,28,True,Not Recommended,Shame on bluehole! the game costs 30$ and you don't get a worth for this price. I mean come on the game made over 540 million dollars there should be noe excuses. The servers are mega I think pubg servers have something like 16hz tick rate while fortnite has 20 and csgo gets complaints that its server refresh rate is 60hz. I also sometimes teleport back and forward which feels like high ping when playing on my local servers when the ping is supposed to be lower than 50ms. The game has been waiting for an optimisation patch because you need like a gtx 1080 to run this game smoothely. Now I actually think that this game has been poorely programmed because the game runs like absolute and I don't think even an optimisation patch will fix it. The gameplay is something like 95% running 4 percent looting and 1 precent shooting. So most of the time you end up getting killed after all that hard work of looting. Car physics are I feel like vechicels were invented for pubg funny moments on youtube. There are many more other things wrong with this game.

2017-04-18,0,0,296,True,Recommended,"I'll start off with an in game moment that got my heart pumping I start off sitting in a plane as per every match waiting for my two other buddies to pick a spot to drop in on and start the hunt for weapons. They drop...I drop a little late. They yell through the mics where they are heading but I fall short. A broken down temple surrounded by ruins separates me from my comrades...I see 3 other players (enemies) drop within the ruins surrounding me.I hit the ground and instantly scramble searching for a weapon unable to find anything. My friends tell me they can't make it to me until they do the same and that it would be a few minutes. I hear footsteps near me...I run and hide and see two guys run past me. I wait for them to be outside of earshot and run the opposite direction into the center of the ruins. Moments later I find a double barrel shotgun and 10 shots. The second I turn around one of the two I had seen earlier pops around the corner with an uzi. Too far away for the shotgun to be of any use I try to dodge the barrage of bullets getting hit until I'm at a sliver of health. He has to reload...I charge him with my shotgun and unload two into his head. I can't believe I made it...Then his friend comes around the corner charging me with a crowbar (he must have not found a gun yet). At this point a pebble thrown at me would kill me...I hadn't had a chance to reload either so I run around a corner and end up cornering myself. I start reloading...the guy is within a few feet...one hit and I will be dead...Then a split second before he swings I unload two shots into his chest as he falls in mid stride to the ground mere inches away from me...I meet up with my buddies and wonder what will happen next...It's experiences like these that really make me appreciate this game. I am not saying it is perfect in any way it has a few glitches (nothing I would find game breaking but this is my personal experience) but for how recently it was released it runs very well. Also I have yet to have a bug or glitch (besides perhaps disconnecting from host once) affect my experience.Recommend to those who play The Culling H1Z1 King of the Hill DayZ (For style of combat I find PUBG to be very similar)Pros Guns feel realistic (bullet drop spray recoil etc) Fun competitive play with Duo and Squad options (I personally prefer playing with friends over solo but solo is still fun) The game does provide a ""Rank"" System if you can call it that with the ability to acquire cosmetic items (at random) with in game currency acquired from doing well in matches. It gives some motivation for coming back and playing more matches.Cons FPS Rates are not always constant I hear this quite a bit but it doesn't affect me terribly. I am using a 960GTX no the game does not look pretty at that but I get a consistent 60 FPS with occasional small lag spikes. Matches CAN be quite long occasionally. You can pretty much choose the length of a match based on where you drop. Reward System As mentioned earlier it does provide cosmetic items that you keep permanently from match to match however ALL the cosmetic items you can get in a ""crate"" (what you purchase outside of a match) can be found within a match on the ground. It seems to defeat the point of spending your hard earned currency on clothes that anyone can find on the ground in a match. No they don't get to keep it after the game ends but you get what I mean.To be honest if you have been looking at the game for awhile watched the gameplay seen what it has to offer and are on the fence.

2017-12-22,0,0,582,False,Not Recommended,Alright... holy I bought the game with my fathers credit card back in November 2017. Ive owned this game for a year now and I have to say when I got the game it was super fun I mean there was occasional like spikes but it never messed any gunfights or anything it'd maybe happen once a game. THEN came the updates and I stopped playing for a month or so. I loved the game when I got it and with the crates and stuff I actually made my money back from the game. With hundreds of hours I can say in my opinion that the game has decreased in server perfomance. I used to have an i3 6100 and a gtx 950 and the game ran at about 60fps on med low settings now I have a gtx 1060 6gb and a ryzen 5 2600x and the game can run at about 80 120fps on high ultra and people complain about the optimization but I think its not bad for a massive map.The cosmetics they added such as the suicide squad for a price is just stupid. NO ONE ASKED FOR SUICIDE SQUAD IN PUBG and they added it and its very SAD! I dont want to come home after school and play this game anymore I would honestly rather play fortnite than this and Im 15. I strongly dont reccomend you waste your money on this until its either on sale for at least 50% off or the reviews for this game are positive. The dovelopers keep adding random no one asked for and (exept sanhok) they arent focusing all their attention on the de sync or other major problems. They did add this thing called Fix Pubg and its just them putting up the doveloper notes and I think that they should stop all of the cosmetic updates and focus mainly on the gameplay once the gameplay is near flawless then add useless like suicide sqaud outfits.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Rubber banding is still a problem. Everytime I land on a roof it rubber bands me off of it or gives me damage. Also developers choose the dumbest time to do maintenance on the servers. Learn from Blizzard and any major pc gaming company. They do maintenance when most players aren't playing. Each new update these developers manage to mess up something else or remove something they can't fix. Nowhere near Esports ready. I'm pretty sure the developers don't want to get rid of the Chinese players because after they ban them they just rebuy the game.

My PC handle GTA 5 on high very high MSAA x8 but when i use anti aliasing on medium my pc stuck at 50 55 fps. You know the most factor of the game is FPS. I just want more fps on my 1000$ PC. This game has gone so far on the road and still going on the way. You can beat a battleroyale game with another battleroyale game. This game pushes me to buy a new graphic card or mobo I mean should I pay a lot of dollars for this 30$ game? Is that gonna worth? If i should I need to work like one month for the pay in my country(Turkey). I really dunno. Fortnite has advertised everywhere man and they pay streamers to play it. There are some reasons to people watch prefer fortnite like my latest sentence. I know Fortnite and PUBG have got different play styles but everyone comparison. They must know keys are gamers. They must do things for gamers. Because we paid we played and we judge. That's our rights. If you got still need to fix it so why you bring skins soo early? I dont wanna explain about players in the game like camping(stand like tree for 20mins with shotguns). To avoid prefer playing FPP but it is not the fix.

I tryed H1Z1 and somehow I like it more because it was more fluent to play smoother... but rapidly I started to noticed how arcadelike and limited it was... but started to get the hang of the battle royale games .. came back to battlegorunds one more time.. and wow finally saw the light... still abit clunky in the movement but so much deep and enjoyable as h1z1 in my opinion.So actually yeah I changed my mind and I have a good time with it.I would only like to see my achvements in a better way like H1Z1 preseason showcase where i See my best matches.. here the stats has a rather underwhelming presentation... also no progression feeling.Old Review First time playing this kind of game.The movement it s very clunky compared to other first/third person shooters.Gameplaywise I dont like how after 5 minutes already the play area starts to get reduced so if you happen to be at the edge of the map at the beginning you almost have no time to looks for weapons and gear as you have to start running towards the middle. In my opinion we should have at least 10 to 15 minutes before start reducing the play area.This game could have a good potential after a couple of more months in development but at this stage and for 30 dollars i dont see it being worth it. On the other Hand a lot of other people seems to enjoy it... so my opinion doesnt seem to align witrh the experience with other people.. I may be missing something.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-20,0,0,509,False,Not Recommended,The game would be fun if the North American servers were not ridden with Chinese players who eat 12 13 AR bullets in the chest and face before dying. The game would be fun if the latency issues because of Chinese and other Asians players playing on servers they should not be on because their country ruined it for them. The game would be fun if I wasn't being shot 2 4 seconds after I peek because Asian servers are terrible and so all of their players play on North American servers giving them distinct advantages over the North American players making the game terrible and all around not fun. Would not recommend buying unless it goes on sale for around $5 other then that it would be a waste of time.Months after this review was written and the game has been fully released and nothing has shown improvement the developers have all around said the customer we already made our money. Sounds are beyond broken in the game since people who are right next to you running will sound like they are on the floor above you. The game is at most a broken start up game that has hidden its true intentions of making money that is it. The developers have done nothing to improve the game in any aspect and have since gone towards a more traditional route of milking their customers dry by adding weapon skins worth money. In all this game is not worth the time and effort to play and I pity those who have had to sit through over a full year just to be given a big middle finger to the face by Blue Balls Corporation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-10,0,0,57,True,Not Recommended,"This game really is a disappointment. The reason why it's disappointing is because it would be a great game if only the devloper would iron out all the huge issues that make this game bad. Some of the issues are TERRIBLE optimization. Probably the worst I've ever seen. I have a 7700k an overclocked 1080Ti and 16gb of DDR4 ram and I'm also running the game from a Samsung 960 Evo M.2 SSD yet this game still runs like absolute garbage on LOW settings. There's also constant screen tearing everywhere. Servers (or the EU server at least) are laggy. I have 23ms when I play LoL on the EUW server and I have about 25ms playing Overwatch on EU servers. When I play either of those games I can enjoy them at low ping and with no packet loss but on this game I feel like I'm always playing at over 100ms plus packet loss. I'm unsure as to what my real ping is because unfortunately the developers haven't been bothered to implement visible ping. But whatever it is it feels bad. This one isn't really an ""issue"" but is just something that I personally dislike. I think the map is too big (for solo mode at least). I played quite a few games today and honestly I probably only saw an average of about 4 people per game. I've made it into top 10 a few times while only having 1 or 2 kills. The reason why is because this game is basically camping simulator 2017. You camp wait for the next playzone to reveal itself get into the very edge of the next playzone then repeat. If you go around looking for other players to kill you just massively decrease your chances of winning. Combine all this camping with the huge map and you end up with quite a stale game where you don't really see much action at least in my experience. I had games where I'd get an early kill then run towards the next playzone for 10 minutes only to get sniped by some guy with a Kar98k. It's just kinda boring.Now all this being said if the devs sorted out the god awful optimization and maybe sorted out the servers too then that would already change this review to a recommended one. There's also a new map on the way. Hopefully this one is more interesting and isn't needlessly big. Right now though I can't recommend this game. It has a good baseline but just isn't finished.

This means that without an SSD you'll never even see the plane that drops you off. You'll be stuck on a loading screen with sound until you get automatically kicked out of the plane meaning every game you'll be thrown out to the egde of the map usually with a cluster of other so affected players.

2019-01-19,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,I give a ton of credit to PUBG for shaking up the shooter genre this game mode was a breath of fresh air that I feel really drew a new level of interest to first person shooters again. One thing I really appreciate about PUBG is how social of a game it is as the downtime lets you chat with your squad (if playing with one) and essentially just hang out while you decide what to do next before your next expected (or unexpected) combat encounter.Everything about the mode itself is brilliant where this game falls down for me is just the core combat (the controls the feel of the weapons and shooting) it felt so off and janky to me that I just could not enjoy the game. Everytime I killed someone it felt like luck and anytime I got killed it felt frustrating.If they clean up the feel of shooting in the game then I would probably feel better about recommending it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Since fix PUBG 95% of these glitches have been fixed and even though every patch brings in more bugs than it fixes its in a lot better shape than it has ever been.However given the unreliability of the developers and their weird priorities i find it hard to recommend anyone to pick this game up.

This would be fine except to have the privilege to have a random chance at getting an item you have to both earn enough in game currency to buy a Loot Box and then spend real money on a key to open it. Otherwise the only thing you can do with in game currency is swap your character's model and skin from a set selection. Having no progression system would of been fine. Having a loot box system also would of been fine if you didn't have to buy in with real money. As it stands you pay a big chunk of money to play a game that earns you the right to pay smaller amounts of money for a chance to get cosmetic items. This kills the game for me.I could overlook the buggy animations and netcode wonky feeling gunplay and incoherent art design but the implementation of microtransactions is the rebar that breaks the camels back.Edit Welp they added an Event pass. They copied Fortnite's Battlepass charged the same amount for it and it's only useable for only 4 weeks as opposed to 10 contains less stuff and has temporary conent. THIS IS A FULL PRICE GAME.

2018-03-03,0,0,284,False,Not Recommended,"It is an addicted game of course but I feel that the gun drop rate are sucks even you are reach in a big city. Riding motorcycle also easily to get crash due to the high sensitive terrain even you are drive it carefully. Some of people can kill me due to ping and latency. When I watch a dead cam the killer target his cosshair backward my walking position not a forward position. And honestly to say content itself are same (Parachuting get a guns spoted or be spotted and killed or be killed or maybe you may be killed by a player using programs) those cause boring afterwards even some partner are able to create a custom map (normal play and zombie mode)._____________________________________________________________Add comments in 9th June 2018WAR MODE Honestly I think this mode is good for practice. You jump down with a gun find someone and shoot them. Not only for shoot practice but this mode encourage you to find a good location and realize a potential location for taknig fire or spot. Game duration is quite well you can try again and again. I like it. GUN DROP RATE ISSUE I still find no guns in a big city (or it difficult to find one) I feel like a gun drop rate in beta test is more likely higher than current. CHEATING ISSUE Athough Bluehole are trying to Cheaters in every games. Today I found someone who killed me in War mode using painkiller while walking!? OMG! What should I do? Just accept it? C'mon. If the developers are intentiaonally to deal with cheaters you should add ""Report"" button in War mode too. GAME CONTENTS Look same jump out finding a gun shoot someone or being shot by someone got a rage because you can't find him or maybe they are cheaters. Also if thsi game can add some fresh contents e.g. mini mission during play 50 (Attackers) V 50 (Defenders) or Make a futuristic maps would be more attractive. I still feel that this game has more potentials to make it isn't it.______________________________________________________________Add comments in 30th June 2018TEAMKILLING ISSUE AND COMMUNICATION ISSUE Some people may got experienced from teamkilling I got experience more recent when I played in Squad. of course I reported all of them. But how can we ensure that those people will got ban? Last time I played with a player and he did not talked in English. When no ones respond to him he started to fire to his teammate. ESPECIALLY IN SEA SERVER. I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IF A DEVELOPER TEAM CAN ADD SOME PLAYER PREFERENCES (SUCH AS LANGUAGE PREFERENCES) IT NECESSARY BECAUSE THIS ISSUE RELATED TO TEAM COMMUNICATION DURING GAMEPLAY.GUN DROP RATE ISSUE It looks improved. But to be honest I think I can see more chraters than a gun in a big city.______________________________________________________________Add comments in 25th July 2018CUSTOM ROOM CREATE ISSUE This feature might be good for a normal players to play or practice him or herself or playing with friends. It should be good if we can add bots to play with us. However there are many players creating a custom room but cannot playable because no one join to a game (It needs at least ten players in each round). This feature now is beneficial to Streamers to play with their followers. Also there are some pproblem during gameplay (especiall. in warmode). However this update might be a starting point for create a game playing with bots in the future.GUN DROP RATE ISSUE I cannot find a gun even I launched in a big city. If this is a kind of bad luck this game is a kind of a lucky trial game.WEATHER ISSUE I like this update issue much because I miss foggy condition and rainy condition. And these condition is good to practice your ear during play.GAME OPTIMIZATION ISSUES Still needs improvements especially when you driving motorcycles and riding in a mountainous area it still split easily. Gun direction also need to improve as well some players shoot behind a target but still hit.COMMUNICATION ISSUE As a mmo games there are many nationalities in games (esp. in SEA server) So there are many languages in games such as Chinese Vietnam Korean Thai English and so on. I recommend the developers add a language preference during matchmaking. It might be good for communicate in team during gameplay. As you see I'm not recommend this game and I keep updating my review in this game. Because I really like this game I learned a lot of tactics during play even good or bad but this is a good experience for me in BR games.

2018-04-26,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"Disclaimer 1st Beginner's perspective.(viewed tons of Guides and Videos before I hopped in since the game lacks a practice/single Player mode to practice and build muscle memory/get used to Keybinds/get comfy with the levels etc.)I'll try to keep it short the Game has three killer factors that made me uninstall it again.1) Tactical Movement vs. Time Pressure vs. Environment vs. Scopes/NoScopeI've played enough FPS Games to know how to move not draw unneeded attention avoid total newbie mistakes etc.So I enjoyed never dying a ""complete and utter n00b"" death for what it's worth and typically survived to the innermost circle xDHOWEVER... While some parts of the Maps allow for tactical movement more often than once I've found myself with a Timer and the border of the white circle pressing in my rear but nothing but an entire open field ahead with 1 2km of ground to cover until at least the next rock.In any other Game I'd be like ""darn that's going to be slow crawl through the foilage to the next Tree"".In PUBG however I only ever saw plain flat desert and (as usual) no Vehicle for the ""I'll take my chances and bet on speed"" approach.And at that moment anyone with a good Scope was easily able to take me down which isn't surprising and I fully expected it to come.Problem is at this point the Game offers no alternatives but sheer luck. Either everyone within a potential firing position is distracted or engaged onto another Target already or I'm dead meat end of story Not even spread bushes to advance to and the time wouldn't allow for such slow movement anyway. Circles are pressing. All the time.At least for me (perferred Play style) it all falls apart at that moment. Environment doesn't provide enough cover vs. Time Pressure.And IMHO the Scopes (considering the typical engagement Ranges and very limited Weapon availability/choices) seem a bit of a Balance killer due to the massive impact they have on the 250+m engagement capabilities.Without scope I couldn't even barely spot any other Player at Ranges where others with x4 or better scopes enjoy easy Firing Solutions making me a sitting and clueless duck with little chance to fight back.Dunno would be neat to have a few Binoculars scattered around everywhere ( Lvl 0 gear found everywhere).2) Audio System and Audio FeedbackThe Game seems exclusively produced for Headsets it seems.I enjoy a quite potent 5.1 Surround System but despite playing on Volume levels &gt way&lt higher than I'd deem comfortable it always felt like the ""Positional Audio"" used by the Game kept falling straight onto its nose.Even perfect case unsilenced Weapons Fire in the distance gave at best a 45deg Sector to identify the direction of the Gunfire.For everything else I was practically playing ""deaf"" which is a huge disadvantage.Plus there's absolutely no indication of how far any own Noise (i.e. Movement on various Ground types) propagates so at all times I could be rumbling around like a deaf Elephant and unknowingly drawing attention.Had plenty of situtations where I got surprised but literally couldn't figure out where to aim reactive fire in time.The result was obviously inevitable )3) Speed of getting killed / Survival Time under fireIn most cases (unless it was an engagement very shortly after the drop) I did due to two to max. three/four hits judging the Game's own feedback for getting hit. With Lvl 2 gear in 100% condition.Combine that with above factors and I basically ended up playing like 10 Minutes tactically moving and getting my gear in order then at some point dying within 2 3sec being engaged from considerable distance. That's not even enough time to take (non existing anyway) cover. So while the idea is interesting the RNG based looting IMHO severely flawed Audio feedback System balancing issues (Scopes) and the often too limited environment in my Opinion can too often and predictably lead to a long looting Phase cool tactical movement parts (some call it walking simulator)... all ending within 2 3 sec in a 100% anticlimactic death xDIn a sense an okay experience but the Tactical shortcomings and reliance on luck while being pushed towards a random Map Center and RNG chances of finding &gt any&lt cover at least to guard some angles from the battlefield really put me off.Disclaimer #2 I'm fully aware this description and assessment comes from a low skill level and I'd probably get better after putting more hours in. No hard feelings and I played it just for fun anyway never cared about ""chicken dinner"" or points or anything else.I simply saw no point in continuing right now since the experience (due to listed limitations) wasn't as fun as I had hoped it'd be. And I don't want to buy a 40"" 4k Display purchase new High Quality Headsets or maybe set all GFX settings on my RX580 to low to increase the likelyhood of picking up those few moving Pixels in the distance eariler while walking/running.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also I like the pseudo realistic setting reminds me a bit of playing Operation Flashpoint all those years ago. However from the ""Am I having fun?"" perspective I can't recommend it at the moment. Performance is abysmal in FullHD on an i6700K and a 1070 if you consider that the graphics are functional at best. But the biggest thing making me not having fun is playing for quite some time and then getting shot in the back of the head by someone who had the luck of finding a 4x scope. Yeah if I have a 4x scope the fun is on my side but I would prefer a balanced game allowing for different playstyles than ""Get the sniping equip first"". Forcing people to enter complexes could do the trick since then close combat weapons would make sense. Bottom line kinda fun will keep playing every now and then to see if they fix stuff but not really overwhelmed for my 30 bucks.Also you really have to be up for some hurt like playing for 20 mins collecting stuff and then dieing without having a real clue why.

2017-08-01,1,2,464,True,Not Recommended,This is actually a decent game with a lot of potential....What makes it is they let the hackers roam free theres no kind of reprocutions or even anyway to report hackers. So 9 times out of 10 when you confront someone even if you get the drop on them they shoot once and of course its headshot (even if they arent looking at you or even have their gun out). That and the fact that you cant jump over small walls or even out of huge windows so you get stuck on the dumbest trying to dodge or run from someone shooting at you. Even with all that its a fun game to play with friends just dont get too serious with it,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now the game WAS good in my opinion and I feel like the community loved it and that it was what they wanted you had fast action and you also had decent time. Sure it wasn't optimized but it was acceptable due to it just coming out. Then I took a break from the game to play some other games but in that time they managed to make the community worse and the game doesn't feel like it does anymore. It isn't anymore optimized it might actually be worse at least out of personal experience. Also I feel like the new wave of hackers needs to be dealt with before the game gets updated with new maps or guns and they shouldn't ban left and right for no reason as I highly doubt everyone they ban has really stream sniped. I feel at this point even if they fixed things the community would still be toxic about this event.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game is buggy as all hell (Not always a good thing) leading to some interesting moments such as having a body gyrate their hips through a car onto my lap Needless to say I won. Chicken Dinners are mighty tasty Cosmetics such as gas masks or general clothing do NOT clip and actually change the shape of the cosmetic based on what you're wearing say a level 3 helmet and a gas mask the gas mask will have a different shape so as not to clip into the level 3 helmet.Terrible Things. The game is completely unoptimized Developer cares more for making new ""content"" instead of making the game optimized which is more important than a new fancy gun or cosmetics Developer broke promise and completely lied breaking Rule #1 of Early Access Games Promising not to implement Microtransactions until the game leaves early access. Buggy as complete hell (Not always a bad thing) Cars. LOADING. The game even on SSD has trouble loading and rendering buildings allowing people to look into buildings using first person view grabbing weapons through walls shooting through walls etc. Hence why the developer should be putting every second he can into optimization before any other stupid Game is fun. Worth the price? Maybe. With the amount of bugs in it? Definitely not wait until PlayerUnknown realizes how terribly optimized his game is.(UPDATE)Game has become more optimized but nowhere near the ""1.0"" mark they should be shooting for.

2017-10-19,0,0,329,True,Not Recommended,This Is a great game great idea... except for connection issues. every other game I own runs just fine online but when it comes to puk bg it just has so many issues when trying to enter the game I have great internet and a solid personally built compuer but no mater what there are issues when trying to enter the game initially or trying to enter a match Ive had things happen where it just freezes on the loading screan until im almost hitting the ground and habe thenworst position to not loading at all then theres the issue that once you land the buildings do not load despite the map never changing I've owned the game for three or four months and still no changes it only gets worse it actually ran better when it first came out. this game is not worth the money they are charging for it anymore and with the money they have made you would think they would have improved on this but alas there seems to be no hope for improvement. I'm just about done with dealing with it. not worth the money there are plenty of games similar that you can get that don't have these issues and have other game modes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-08-15,0,0,213,False,Not Recommended,Haven t played a crap ton of hours but based on what I have played this game needs a lot of work. Bugs desync (caused by poor netcode) poor anti cheat software and the below average performance just litter this game has and will make you rage at times. And no I don t have bad internet (100+Mbps). You can sometimes spray a full mag right with your sights right at an enemy and just not kill them. Alternitavly you could be in the end game just to be killed by a hacker halfway across the map wasting 20 minutes of your time. The new Fix PUBG is a step in the right direction but from what I ve seen soo far nothing has really been fixed that is major. The sounds controls and graphics are all average.On the plus side getting to the top 10 is very exciting filling you with an adrenaline rush and playing with friends can be fun if the servers aren t acting up that day. And getting that winner winner chicken dinner is a nice way to end that gaming session.The general gameplay is by nature reliant on luck but skilled players can still consistently win. But the odds are always against you as you have to survive out of 100 players so don t expect to win most of your games.The gun physics are different compared to most games. This game favors ADS (Aiming Down Sights) compared to using crosshairs. Just if you came from a game from Counter Strike like me prepare to use this functionality a lot more frequently. There is also bullet drop and velocity which adds a whole new aspect to combat especially long range combat and gives the game a higher skill ceiling.An addition to the main game I would like to see is maybe a sandbox mode or something to help improve predicting bullet drop/ velocity at range.To conclude if you want this game really bad or have friends that play this game hardcore buy it. You will have lots of fun. Just know that you will experience a bunch of glitches and bugs that can ruin your experience. But to the unsure buyer or the one who is looking to buy their next game but doesn t have lots of money to spend skip this game for now.

However the crates that are currently available are highly populated by paid crates causing my whole inventory to be filled with paid crates while having zero keys. I understand the business behind the decision but it is in no doubt a factor that ruins the overall experience of the game.

I've had a lot of fond memories with this game as well but recently it has been getting increasingly frustrating.Optimisation has somehow been getting increasingly worse with each version. Places like Rozhok that once ran smooth as butter on medium to high now run at choppy frame rates on low. Several bugs are still present in the game that still haven't been fixed or publicly acknowledged.Servers have been getting significantly worse. Sometimes you can't be matched into a game without refreshing it sometimes you'll get in but your mate won't.Paid lootcrates. Why are paid crates rolled in the same category as regular crates. You spend several games building up enough BP to get a random crate which is then locked behind an obligatory $2.50 purchasable key. What's worse is that these payments are the only way to get a large amount of in game visual cosmetics.Between the increasingly poor performacne deteriorating servers and paid lootcrates it's almost mind boggling to believe that this is the game that topped steam sales and most people online for a significant amount of time last year.

Even jumping in a crowded area people will hide like cockroaches and try to listen your footsteps.3 Absolute garbage optimisation and low performance for dirt ugly graphics. (edit) 3.5 Originality and creativity is NON EXISTANT in PUBG. It's just 100 people play hide and seek in a desolate 2000 era graphics map where nothing happens 0 events 0 quests.4 Shooting is plain and simple. Calling it realistic would be the best compliment but it s not realistic. It s not balanced either.5 Weapon balance is awful. It s clear as day developers cannot decide if they want to implement a realistic damage and bullet physics or fun damage and bullet physics. 6 Camping like a rotten corpse wins you the game while running around and fighting is fun but you get killed easier.7 Laggy foreign players who will shoot you through corners because the game favors the shooter no matter the lag.8 Great example of how indie developers can succumb to greed and create lootbox system on a 30$ a pop game.Verdict 1 out of 10 for battle royale games.

2019-01-30,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,Hello I've been a PUBG player for some time now. I am in several Discord servers dedicated to PUBG and I played almost everyday. I have loved this game since it's launch. But recently I've seen a huge influx of negative reviews. A lot of them are quite accurate I hate to say. Unoptimization vehicles and network issues are most of the complaints. I can attest to most of this. I've experienced a lot of issues with PUBG before but I still enjoy the game. But is it too late to turn back and make PUBG great again? Is it too late to bring back the player base? What if the new map doesn't bring back players. Just my thoughts and I wanted to see if anyone else is thinking the same thing. I would love to hear what everyone else thinks. We're getting closer and closer to PUBG's demise if the developers don't fix these issues. Can we have confirmation that the developers will work on making the game better and actually fixing these issues?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-28,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,So this is a paid game that locks the loot you get after each match. To unlock it you need to buy individual keys that cost 2 19 euros each. This from a game that supposedly made millions. Not fixing bugs not improving their product. Their first order of business after launch was to implement this crap. Sounds fun to you?Second problem is more a genre problem than a pugb problem. It's basic common sense. When you play something in the lines of COD with 10 vs 10 matches if you have 1000 concurent players where 10% are cheaters some matches will have cheaters some will be good. On something like Battlefield matches have way more people but because of the objective based nature and diferent skirmishes going on in a single map you can still dodge the cheaters after you identify them. But on something like pugb a battle royalle... the same pool of 1000 with 10% cheaters (100) will be divided in 100 men matches. There will be a lot less matches with the same pool of players andchances for each and every one of them having some of those 10% cheaters increase tremendously. Add to that the battle royalle mechanics where only 1 wins and you have no way to dodge that one cheater in your 100 men match. Bottom line in pugb getting to the last 10 is finding the cheaters. Is this cheap brain dead 1 vs all game where every match you do nothing but running around for 15/20 minutes to get to a 30 second fire fight against a hand full of the surviving cheaters and campers of each match(then rinse and repeat all over again) the new shooter genre nirvana? Seriously though how low can a genre get?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2019-02-08,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,After playing PUBG on my Android phone for about six months and liking it I thought the PC version would be a winner. Wrong! The mobile version is way more fun (better menu system and more intuitive controls) but more importantly runs much better. The PC Steam version is sooo glitchy. Most times I end up stuck in the air floating on a parachute and not able to even land on the ground. I have a few clips of this.Also you need a top spec PC to really run this game. In my opinion the minimum specified 8GB is not enough. Also you will need a super fast internet connection or there really is no point buying this game! My internet connection is pretty decent but was getting a lot of lag anyway.Going back to the mobile version you can use settings to automatically pick up a specified amount of items. So for example you can set it so that you pick up 250 rounds of a specified type of ammo. All you do is run/walk over the ammo and you automatically pick it up. Once you get to the specified number you wont pick up any more. You can do this with med kits cans etc. In this version you have to individually point to and pick up items (by pressing a button). This makes game play really tedious and takes away the fun. Developers! Another point in the mobile version you get little footprints appearing on the map when you hear an enemy approaching. This is useful as you can home in on direction easily making game play more fluid. Your team mates' footsteps will not appear on the map in this way. Also useful. In the Steam version there is no way to tell which audible footsteps are whose meaning you have to focus a lot more. I think this makes it less fun. Leave all that tactical stuff to Tom Clancy. The same applies to gunshots in the mobile version your enemy's gunshots are marked on the map giving you a rough direction (unless they are using a supressor). Developers!One more thing you will get head shot ed through a wall by someone using botware (cheating!). I think they are now trying to clamp down on cheats but there are still loads for sure! This does not really bother me that much. What does bother me is the numerous glitches and tedious game play!As other people have said this has a lot of potential. Good graphics good sounds smooth action (when it actually works) nice concept etc. As of right now however I would like a refund and to uninstall this lame duck of a game. Stick to the much better PUBG mobile on android. Try it you will see what I mean.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-08,0,0,489,False,Not Recommended,I love PUBG. The game is still fun sometimes. This game has such unique gunplay and the satisfaction of getting a kill in a game like this is fantastic.It's so unfortunate that this game is being completely mismanaged. This game costs $30 and I do not regret spending that money but the game's microtransactions are horrible. No you do not have to buy the skins however that's the only thing you can work towards in this game. Over half the crates that you can buy with the in game currency cost real money to open. You can't even trade the skins anymore which kept the CS GO community alive for years. They introduced an event pass that costs money and gives players something to work towards but if you don't pay money nearly all of the rewards are temporary and the rate at which you earn XP (f you don't pay) is stupidly slow.If we ignore the MTX's the game is still broken at a fundamental level. The game still has a rediculous number of hackers and the networking for this game is unacceptable for a game that has made over $700 million dollars and has been out of early access for 7 months. The amount of desync especially in highly populated areas will have you tearing out your hair after you get killed even after ducking behind a wall. For the 8th time in a row. Or picture a shotgun battle where you land a shot at point blank range before your enemy shoots on your screen but then you die you realize that the game never even registered your shot. And let's not even talk about the frame drops that are still happening in close quarter fights and in urban areas (where it matters most).My recommendation is to save your money. Go preorder/buy Battlefield 5 or go play Fortnite. You'll pay $60 for BFV but have meaningful progression multiple game modes and be able to play on servers that aren't a bag of potatoes. Fortnite will give you a better quality experience and its FREE. At this rate this game doesn't have much time left.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-10,0,0,321,False,Recommended,"Since the release of this game it has added plenty of new weapons 2 new maps and a decent anti cheat system (it took a while to fix cheating problems). But this game has some flaws such as horrible desync in matches the ability to play on servers with high ping which makes gameplay frustrating the item drops need to be fine tuned slightly and the worst of all the ""Sanhok Pass"". This was a quick cash grab for those who want more customization. It was released too early with an army of bugs and no major patches as of me posting this. There are quests that done count progress are insanely difficult and time consuming and worst of all the items for ""free players"" cant be unlocked after level 16 of 30 if you bought it on day 1. The maximum progression points you can earn daily is 200 for free players and you need 400 to level up 1 time some rewards just give you extra xp towards your level and you gain exp based on how long you survived not the placement or kills you get. The crates system is an ok addition because about 25% of crates in this game can be unlocked without using in game keys you need to buy with real money so I don't have a problem with it. But in the end I enjoy playing this game with a group of randoms or friends because the strategy and planning needed for squad matches is addicting to me. The fear of an enemy always watching you is thrilling in solos and the maps are all fun to play in my personal opinion.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-03,0,0,9024,False,Recommended,Source IGNPlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds didn t invent the last person standing formula that s made it one of the most massively successful PC games in history but over the course of a nine month long early access period it certainly turned it into something special. 100 players drop onto a sprawling map and fight to the death using whatever weapons they can find within a shrinking force field. This simple bare bones take on the Battle Royale style deathmatch foregoes the fluff and high time investment of most hardcore survival sims in favor of fast accessible action. The result is a tight focused no frills experience that s as exciting as it is unpredictable and where no two games are ever alike.PUBGwastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as you and up to 99 other players airdrop onto one of its two 8x8 km maps from the back of a large aircraft. Part of the genius of each match s arc is how heavily it weighs every move you make and it begins with the critical decision of where to land. Jumping early along the plane s randomized flight path lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition but risks placing you farther from the parts of the arena where the fighting will likely funnel as the boundaries contract. Jumping late might distance you from other players giving you some early breathing room and a chance to forage for loot in peace before entering the fray. Depending on the angle of the flight path jumping right into the center especially in large cities and other loot heavy spots could place you right in the middle of the action with some of the most trigger happy opponents.The tension mounts during the descent as you get a good look at the swarm of players in your vicinity but things really pick up the moment you hit the ground as everybody (no matter where you land) scrambles for weapons and gear and the killing kicks off right from the get go. Item distribution is partially randomized and learning the spots on the maps that are likely to spawn military grade weapons and attachments is a good early strategy to work out on your own with a team of up to four or using the many fan made resources that already exist thanks to PUBG s hearty run in Early Access. You can t count on finding a good gun early to keep you safe but unlike similar games like DayZ where you could potentially go long tedious stretches without finding a weapon there s bound to be something worth picking up no matter where you drop. Backpacks for holding more items a handful of protective gear like helmets and police vests medical supplies melee weapons and a good mix of firearms are in good supply.But no matter what gear you find PUBG excels at creating a reliable and streamlined space for your adventure to play out while also allowing for a thrilling level of unpredictability. It isn t out of the ordinary for someone with only a pistol to take down someone with a fully loaded SCAR L assault rifle since good gear is only half the battle the other half is wit.As players outsmart each other in deadly games of cat and mouse those still standing are forced into ever closer proximity within the confines of a deadly shrinking force field until just one player or team is left alive. Victory (accompanied by the coveted Winner winner chicken dinner! screen) is an exhilarating reward matched only by the suspense that emerges from the battle to achieve it. But even if you die early jumping into a new game is always quick and easy. In the ZoneThe deadly moving force field that contains the arena and occasional airstrikes marked with red on the minimap add a consistent sense of purpose that drives you toward conflict and with it an exciting set of options. You might want to prioritize reaching the center of the circle to make the next incremental reduction in size of the survivable area easier to deal with move slowly along the borders to pick off stragglers as they rush into the open to avoid the oncoming doom or even hide in a building until you absolutely have to move letting everyone else kill each other so you don t have to. Hopping into a vehicle like the speedy but vulnerable motorbike and buggy the sturdy closed top UAZ or the slow but durable van among others is a quick fun and conspicuous way to cover a lot of ground and can result in some hilarious and explosive encounters. Either way you re encouraged to stay on the move but still have a set of options that lets you pick your pace. An aggressive approach is just as viable as a cautious defense and the practicality of both playstyles is refreshingly liberating bringing new sets of challenges that are just as fun to plan around and tackle as the next.The incentives to stay on the move no matter your chosen pace forces ever more dangerous encounters with increasingly skilled (or lucky) survivors condensing the action and ending a match after around 20 minutes before it can get bogged down by campers or other distractions. Action isn t hard to find if you re looking for it and impossible to avoid for long when you re not but PUBG manages to put enough space between encounters to keep those quiet tense moments of cautious exploration intact.The two large maps aren't the best looking environments in gaming but they do provide much needed variety on the battlefield. Both the forested island of Erangel and the sunny desert of Miramar boast an assortment of small towns large dense cityscapes and rural industrial zones ripe with loot. There are some parallels between maps so as not to restrict your options when you re dropped randomly into either one (the server picks for you). For instance the small military base on an island off the coast of Erangel sees its match in Miramar s remote military camp for the high risk players looking to compete for high level equipment right off the bat.But both maps have their own unique merits too. The abundance of trees on Erangel provides plenty of cover even for groups of four while the sparser rockier Miramar makes moving across open areas on foot and in vehicles much more dangerous. While some areas in Miramar feel more isolated than even the most secluded spots on Erangel the diversity of elevations more interesting city layouts and some great map exclusive weapons like a sawed off shotgun that fits conveniently in the sidearm slot more than make up for it. Adapting to new challenges and making last minute decisions based on each of these factors is part of the fun. But no matter what you re facing an abundance of loot in even the smallest buildings in both maps ensures hunting for a weapon is never a frustrating task which not only keeps the playing field balanced and fun for everyone but ripe for all sorts of thrilling confrontations.You might find yourself involved in a frantic shootout in the woods or on either end of a deadly hunt across a dense city or town. You might even find yourself holed up in an attic listening for the slightest creak or scape to indicate a nearby presence shotgun in hand. The use of sound to build tension and alert you to nearby enemies is one of the ways PUBG forces you to stay attentive and tactical rather than treating every round like a fast paced shooter à la Call of Duty or Battlefield. Play long enough and you can learn the subtleties that tip off when another player has been in a place before you an open door or an unusually dense or sparse pile of mismatched loot are telltale signs you should watch your back. All these layers merge to build a shooter that s invested in creating smart nuanced survival and understands how even the smallest moments of your story build up to create the larger adventure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-19,0,0,378,True,Not Recommended,This game has great gunplay. The shooting feels fair and most weapons are balanced fairly well. The revolver could use the ability to attach a scope to it to make it a little more viable and the Silencer feels a little too strong at the moment with literally no repercussions for putting it on but minor complaints. My major problems come everywhere else in this game. The unit collision is so bad i dont have words for it. Vehicles can hit what looks to be nothing and go flying in the air. You bump into a team mate while running and you come to a complete stop. If you try to raid a house you and your friend will more often then not get stuck on each other trying to go in because the hit boxes are terrible. The De sync issues are so bad it makes the game borderline unplayable most days. Server lag has only gotten worse since launch. The Blue zone moves way too soon and hits way too hard too soon. It pushes players to the center way too soon and I find myself running from the zone more then trying to engage other players. All of this on top of the well known FPS issues. Overall I think this game has potential to be great it just has a lot of very glaring issues that make it incredibly frusterating. It has a bright future with the rate updates are rolling out But i just dont think its worth the money at this moment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If a game dev can't run decent anti cheat on the unreal engine then it's time for that dev to find a new line of work.Hence why i say...the only there care about is the almighty dollar...ontop of this there are a whole host of other issues but I'm not waisting anymore of my time with this game to list them all but I'll give maybe a couple....They keep saying they want feedback on their forums but every time anyone gives ""honest"" feedback...ie telling them why PUBG is still broken they just temp or perma ban you from the forums for giving your ""honest"" feedback that they asked you for.For every 2 steps forward bluehole take with PUBG they take 8 10 steps backwards...and then they just put out more crates for stupid cosmetic items to appeal to the damn hackers and anyone dumb enough to play the market place for these items.there are 5 things that would honestly fix PUBG in a way that the masses may be pleased...1) Get rid of the GOD DAMNED market place for cosmetic items....Fine to let people buy crates with there own BP...but cut out the whole selling crates and cosmetic stuff for PUBG on the market place....everyone knows that is what breeds most of the hacking problem.2) Region Locking and Ping Locking are really good ideas....but you know the better idea....HARDWARE BAN THE ING HACKERS...that's right...assign a hardware code to a random piece of hardware on a players computer when they log into the game and the anti cheat program scans there PC for active cheats....so that way when they get banned it's via that hardware code and not just the account...and if it's random hardware they won't know what piece of hardware the code assigned to was banned so if they want to play the game again they would have to actually go out and buy a whole new PC...which could amount to several thousand dollars every time they get banned...Please don't tell me that wouldn't make anyone think twice about ever hacking again...Hell you can also include your Region and Ping locking into that aswell...and really make a statement to the cheaters.3) Listen to your community...people are giving you a whole lot of feed back and most of the time you either seem to ignore dismiss or take an arrogant attitude towards your communities feedback even when you ask for the ""honest"" feedback...you might not believe it...but there are people in your community who still think this game has hope...and some that even know what there are talking about when they give you technical feedback because maybe they work in this type of a field for a living and possibly know a little something about it.4) Get some developer persons in there that know how to code and develop games...because I don't know what zoo or circus you got the current trained monkeys from...but they haven't done much except for throw on things for awhile now...I mean let's face it.....""For every 2 steps forward bluehole take with PUBG they take 8 10 steps backwards"".....that's not really how you develop a game now is it?!and last but not least...the 5th thing they can do to possibly save this game...5)...FIRE BRENDAN GREENE...I mean I'm sure there is some kind of board of directors or something...every company has some way of getting rid the top dogs when needed...FIRE BRENDAN GREENE...he is an idiot whom will in the long run bury bluehole and PUBG Corps....FIRE HIS !!!Do all of those things....and PUBG might stand atleast a small chance at some kind of a long term future....but if you don't....then I would not plan on it having more than another year...and that's at best.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Trying to play with friends is also nearly impossible because almost every match someone is going to crash or lag out. For how fun this game could be it is incredibly frusturating to have to keep dealing with these same issues update after update. Honestly I would be much more understanding of an Early Access title if they weren't already moving towards tournaments because to me that signals that the game is complete.

So Chinese hackers where allowed to ruin the game so that the company could make money on people buying the clothing items online at places like ebay from the hackers who did not earn them.

2018-02-28,1,2,78,False,Not Recommended,Defining the Battle Royale Genre. As we approach a new year a fresh trend enters the established medium of gaming Battle Royale. PUBG is the catalyst for this uproar being responsible for spawning even newer titles (or changes) such as Fortnite Rules of Survival and the H1Z1 controversy. + The Pros Vehicles Out of all the battle royale games that have been released thus far this has the widest variety of vehicles to choose from all with their own upsides and downsides. Granted control whilst driving can be a chore (or unfair sometimes) but otherwise it's satisfying to use.Gunplay Once again PUBG has the best gun control that any battle royale game has to offer. Not only that but I'd argue that it's gunplay is more effecient than other FPS focused titles in the industry. Replayability This game can be out right addicting and it never seems to disappoint me every round I play (with some exceptions). With friends it's only more enjoyable. So if you're searching for long term investments for any particular game this is a must have in your wishlist. The Cons Hackers Although I do believe that players have exaggerated this issue it still maintains its relevance in the general experience. Throughout the pros I mentioned that most of the rounds I encountered were enjoyable and engaging. Suffice to say the exceptions to that consistency is this particular issue.Variety If this game was still in Early Access I wouldn't have pointed this out. However PUBG recently released a full release with a major update that enhances its graphics and optimization. On one hand the optimization issue that was profound in the previous version is adjusted. On the other hand the variety in maps and weaponry still feel somewhat lacking. For a $30 game there should be more content. That's not to say that the rest of the gameplay doesn't make up for these glaring flaws. Final Verdict Whether you hate or enjoy the Battle Royale genre I would recommend anyone this game. There's a lot of enjoyment that can be had with this game especially with friends.EDIT This review is outdated due to recent business practices.

2017-11-05,0,0,263,True,Not Recommended,I have one simple question. Why do people still play this game when it is still broken? I have 200 hours in this game and i finally decided that its time to uninstall. I understand that this game is still in early access so they are to fix most of the issues. But if they really cared about the game they wouldn't be trying to squeeze every dime they can by spending all their time on making invitationals for the game rather than FIXING THE GAME. It's been 3 months since i have purchased the game and they have yet to fix any problems with the game. Everything still is so messed up. The gunplay is awful and is never consistent. Just youtube video's of the game and i garuntee you will find more videos of the game being broken than it working correctly. I mean hell Just watch their first invintational and it was broken then. Its a sick joke that we spend $30 on an early access game to begin with and they dont even have the respect to fix its main issues before making compititions for money..

2017-11-05,0,0,1276,True,Not Recommended,This game has become like Pokemon go. Remember the original craze people playing the game obsessively the extensive media covreage the hype. Pokemon go's player base shrunk very quickly after launch due to server side issues stability scalability and stangnating game play. Sound familiar PUBG fans.Development on this PC version of this game has slowed to a crawl. Work on the game has shifted focus to the XBox release of the game most likely canabalizing their existing core team to port the game. The game publisher could not resist the money Microsoft were prepared to throw at them for an exclusive title to lift up their stagnating platform.Due to the poor architecture and implementation of the game (poor performance and buggy) it has now become inundated with cheaters. Anti cheat functionality was not implemented as a core part of the game and they relied too heavily on a third party anti cheat detection system to save them from the bad guys. It would be like Microsoft creating Windows OS but not hardening their code against exploits with the naive belief that the anti virus software of the day will keep their customers safe. Exploit prevention and exploit detection are two differnt things. Exploit detection systems only work after your system has been compomised often too late after the damage has been done.Based on the very sparse amount of information coming out of Bluehole their abyismal community engagement and management you cetainly get the sense that there does not appear to be a long term strategy to build a long lasting community platform around PUBG. If one was to interpret Blueholes actions to date it appears they are mainly focused on maximizing profits in the short term while investing as little as possbile in the long term and minimizing risk to their bottom line. They even split off the game into a seperate corporation PUBG Corp away from the parent corporation Bluehole. Perhaps to firewall themselves off from liability and creditors once pubg eventually crashes and burns.I also get the sense from the big Twitch streaming personalities that interest in the game is waning. Where in the recent past Twitch streamers were streaming PUBG as their primary focus they are now actively moving on to other games and streaming PUBG less and less.TLDRPUBG has helped define a new Genre in video games that is here to stay thanks PUBG.

2017-11-22,0,0,432,False,Not Recommended,At the time of this review January 1 2018 I cannot recommend this game. Since the 1.0 launch PUBG has been dealing with an influx of hackers and Chinese server hopping to the US. 99% of the hackers you see will have Chinese names. Those from China that aren't hacking are desynced so badly that they begin teleporting around not taking damage or landing shots on you from behind cover. This can especially be seen from 2am est to 7am est. The new death Cam and replay features are great in the fact that you can see who is willing using no recoil etc. My team just played 4 games where we were completely decimated by hackers who weren't running armor or helmets with only 30 or so people left. The replays show the shots not having any effect on the guys while they twitch to each of our heads. I refuse to play this game until R E G I O N L O C K is a thing. It will help mitigate US players from having to deal with desync and will lower the amount of hacking US players will have to deal with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,1,2,304,True,Not Recommended,Let me start of by saying this game is a blast. It's fun by yourself. It's more fun with friends.And it's the best battle royal style game out right now.You just have to have a yolo mentality and have fun with it. If you are trying to take it seriously and get mad easily then this isn't the game for you. It's good for one offs for 15 30mins at a time you can binge but if you get frustrated easily then you won't have fun.I have a blast playing this.BUTThere are currently issues that escalated (in my opinion) after PUBG passed DOTA 2 for most concurrent players online at once. First of all the servers went to from 9am noon EST it's basically imposible to play due to servers getting flooded with people. I don't think the devs expected to have this many players on at once and I don't blame them. I expected this game to just be another game that will never leave alpha but after such a good reception I have hope.Second if you look at any top comments you'll see that the devs will ban anyone accused of stream sniping or trolling streamers. They aren't joking or blowing it out of proportion they cater to streamers and will ban as fast as they can report you. Of couse it's BS beacaue the odds of you joining a match with a streamer that you can find in game is almost 0%. But whatever.Also there is a ridiculous amount of chinese spam. On the discussion page in matches just screaming moon speak at everyone. It's ear spliting and awfull.But honestly if the servers were fixed this would be a recommended review. I have a lot of fun playing despite everything I just said. I love just driving around honking my horn and running people over.

2018-04-19,0,0,882,False,Not Recommended,"Cpu 3570k Gpu gtx970 Internet connection 10Mb download 2Mb upload Very consistent ping (to google) of around 30msIt sems to ridiculous that I have played so much of this game. It started with wonderful potential. It had a incredible feeling of tension and catharsis and all of the buggs were forgiven because it gave such a unique and powerful immersion. I played enough to get addicted to that feeling. There is nothing like the sensation of a chicken dinner (which means a win for the uninitiated). Especially a hard fought chicken dinner. Through all of the frustrations I have found two facets of combat that are ruining the gameplay for me. Both relate to the fact that all desync and bugginess seems to be amplified during combat. My skill (which is fair to middlin') only applies a small percentage of the time. Half of the time combat goes something like this I will fire two headshots at somebody facing the opposite direction. After I fire the two shots I die then I hear his shots then I see him turn around to fire at me. In these cases I had no chance other than to hide in the grass until the end of the game. MORE important this kind of problem is the opposite side of combat. I no longer feel good about my successful combat becuase I can see the elements of desync from my opponent. Someone will be aimed down sights at me for 3 seconds their head peeked around cover and not fire a shot. I will have time to stop running aim fire 2 missed shots and then kill him. I don't feel good about winning these fights and they are more and more predominent. Even more messed up is the fact that I play this as a way of hanging out with some friends. They don't see what I see or they choose to ignore. I WOULD RATHER PLAY GAMES ALONE THEN HAVE PLAY THIS GAME WITH FRIENDS. I try to play with them and I immediately get salty. I can't help but get frustrated when the entire game is looting for 20 minutes and finding nothing running for 10 minutes and then experiencing the combat that I've detailed above. Granted I have the option of always dropping in a populated area but the poor gameplay is much worse in the beginning and so I skip the first two steps and just die outright. The release of the ""Savage"" map gave me hope. It was far less buggy (ironically test servers seem to function better) and the presence of loot made the game playable. When the test period ended I went back to getting Miramar (large desert map) which is awful in comparison. We drop in one of the bigger towns (El Pozo) and loot for ten minutes. Three of us find one M16 two shotguns and only two vests and a helmet between us. I admit that this was an especially bad example. If 90 percent of the game is going to be searching for a lobby waiting for the plane parachuting out of the plane failing to find a gun in more than a dozen locations and running to the bluezone (while avoiding the redzone) then the other 10% (combat) NEEDS TO BE CLEAN! After several years and and million of sales they show no signs of fixing it. If they fix the desync and make this game playable (bluezone inhibits combat more often then encourages it there is no loot and lagggggggggg) I will give this game a 9/10. Right now it can't be properly rated because it never graduated into being a full game it is still a buggy demo.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-13,1,2,432,False,Not Recommended,PUBG was a lot of fun initially but continual issues... cheating bugs and server connectivity has left a lot of people disappointed. My friends lists were always lit up with people playing PUBG... not anymore. I never tried playing Fortnite but today I started playing CoD Blackout which I bought specifically for the Battle Royale. It's very similar to PUBG but a much more enjoyable experience because it does everything its supposed to do. So far my impression is that the game community is largely a migration of former PUBG players rather than the abusive little punks which CoD has a reputation for. I do prefer the PUBG style and find it a much more imaginable and relatable theme as opposed to the more military style of Blackout. It's far more expensive than PUBG but you kind of get the quality you pay for when comparing the two especially when considering that I haven't been able to load a PUBG game at all recently due to poor region management. Regardless of future updates and dev reassurances PUBG has suffered reputation damage beyond repair and it will not be able to keep pace with competitors. The best thing about PUBG?

Was it a glitch was it a hacker was it just desync from the bad netcode? The lack of a shooting range or kill cam makes it very hard to get better at the game.Additionally there are questionable descisions being made by the developers. Resetting of your game mode (mainly Solo FPP) after every match hasn't been fixed since the release of FPP + your server resetting after the latest monthly patch. Post processing being forced on everyone because they couldn't fix a bug on the new fog map so they rather deploy it with a workaround.

2018-09-09,0,0,425,False,Not Recommended,If someone asked my opinion on PUBG when it was first launched(as EA) I would've recommended the game no questions asked. PUBG managed to score the golden zone in terms of FPS action player growth and tense drama. It left me with many fond memories playing both solo and with friends.However in the current state of the game I'm afraid it is very difficult to recommend the game to anyone. The reason being mainly hackers. You WILL meet them. And in a game where it is so difficult to get results the feeling you get when you are playing in a game where you actually have a chance to score 1st and discover someone is walking faster than a car at full speed and headshoting everyone from 150m with an SMG is just... very discouraging.There is just no excuse for this kind of service in a game that sold this well. Along with breaking promises of not monetizing the game pre launch as well as updates which come at the speed of which a cherry blossom petal falls from it's tree it is a very depressing thing to see when a company fails to invest properly in their success and takes the easy road of greed.If you are wondering if you should jump in the wagon now you shouldn't.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-07,0,0,176,False,Not Recommended,"Ok I'm done. I was just killed by a guy who I emptied an entire mag into who just shruged it off and one shot me with a shotgun. The worst part is this is not the first time. I love this game to death but I cannot recommend it. I only play it for the memes.The lag is abysmal even after a year of patches and promises to fix it. It doesn't help that the developers refuse to talk about the Chinese players who play on western servers creating a laggy experience for eveyone (paragraph about the cheaters below). Instead of fixing this problem the developers label people who ask for it to be fixed as ""racists"" to ignore the problem. I don't think they care anymore. I don't think they'll fix it. Oh btw they've been going through reviews and removing them because they're ""against the community guidelines"". What a joke.It's not like they really do anything about the cheaters either. You can see them on the leaderboards so the devs have the info they need. They just don't do anything about it. According to the operators of the game's anti cheat 99% of banned cheaters come from China (link below to an IGN article). Now I don't promote region locking. It won't work because of VPNs and there are a lot of legitimate Chinese players who are a joy to play with in squads but that's too high for any decent game that wants to own the genre.This game and the people who ""develop"" it is so incompetant that I am very close to quitting it. I'm writing this review to appeal to the developers who can't quite seem to understand why their competitors are outclassing them and to anyone who considers buying PUBG. This game is still early access and you shouldn't purchase it.The core game is brilliant which makes this situation even sadder. You know how it works already there's no point describing it. The problem is even the brilliant base isn't that solid anymore. The develpers get angry when other competitors imitate them and are suing because an app because it uses fryingpans like PUBG. Yeah they ripped you off but good luck arguing that point in court.If ""PUBG Corp"" (formally Bluehole) want people to play their game then they need to fix their problems and stop launching legal actions against other developers. Regardless of whether they're ripping you off they don't have the cheaters you do. The latest update has lowered the broken lag issues a bit and the upcoming Savage map is a dream to play. I am still excited for this game's future but it's a long way from being worthy of your $30 when there are free experineces that are less broken (looking at you Fortnite). The lootcrates are pretty bad and the gambling scene it created is terrible. Thankfully the developers are working to resolve this. After 8 months of allowing it to continue.You are not on top of the genre anymore PUBG Corp. Fortnite is and it deserves to be because it's nowhere near as broken in it's 'Early Access"" state as PUBG is in it's ""Full release"". You are becoming arrogant possibly jealous of Epic's success and it really shows in the often sporadic nature that you conduct yourselves. Your Esports scene will go nowhere as long as your servers are broken and people will continue to leave every day. Fix your game and you will find that people come back. Until then you're beyond a joke to me. Maybe you'll fix things once you realise you're quickly becoming the next H1Z1. I'm sorry to be harsh to people who have made a game I have gotten hours of enjoyment out of but I feel like you only care about the money now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not really much negativity to tell... well till 1.0 was released.You got a large influx of cheaters on 90% of the games you play. Developers removed and changed the stage their game used to be at its pristine ( in my own opinion) Removal of weather day of time effects and breaking of their current network coding and coding in general. There's a lot more issues of your shots being registered when you're shooting somebody. Picking up objects or waiting them to render in can also happen occasionally. Personally i think the biggest issue of them all that it feels mostly all what happens in game is relevant what happens on your client. I.e the server relies on your client side data to confirm whether you actually shot somebody or got shot first before you'd get to kill the opponent. Never ending issue what has felt has been the hackers running rampant.

2017-08-19,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,This is a fun game as other have said which I would agree. The big problem is the game requires microtransactions. Let me explain. Did you just slog through 10 rounds so you can get the better one of the two possible reward boxes? Great! Now pay $2.50 to open it. Wow! I just paid $30 a few hours ago for the game.

2017-08-30,0,0,636,True,Not Recommended,Initially when I got this game I thought hey what a great idea for a Battle Royal. Later I realized the developers knew exactly what they were doing baiting the entire CS GO community as well as the Rocket League community into buying rare one time offered crates on the sole idea that they will be worth something one day. So now there is a dilemma most players spend time trying to harvest crates more than actually working on skills in this game. I've been watching the steam market and this game should be called Economics Simulator. The developers have gotten so caught up in the money they have been making from the market and crates that they completely forgot to update it. Now there are problems such as Play Doh building and so many bugs that players can literally run over squads of people with a car while they are inside of buildings. This game had a lot of promise but greedy developers always know how to ruin a good thing when their only goal is double decker blumpkins and powder filled nights at the club. Stop cashing out and work on your game please You made it but you haven't made it that far.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However atleast there are more guns and animations! Bugs that make the game unplayable have been around for months without alleviation. Buildings don't fully render early game (if at all) causing a huge disadvantage to players who get this issue like myself. LOD system is trash even though Simplygon is good. Networking is beyond buggy. There is no indication of what the player's ping is. 3 crashes and 2 deaths due to lack of buildings loading in properly today. The aiming is inconsistent upon armor not always damaging properly or hits being registered in general. Jump shots are super accurate however over the shoulder shooting is not accurate. When jumping out of the plane and pulling the parachute other players 'chutes do not always render leading to a supposed safe are to be unsafe. These are a few of the bugs afflicting the game. Its in rough shape and not worth getting in Early Access. I am definitely getting very tired of this game and playing it less every week.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,403,False,Not Recommended,After putting in over 200 hours on this game I can say that I do not recommend it. The game for starters should not have been released in the state it is. Its creator Brendan Greene has worked on other battle royales such as H1Z1 and has worked on Day Z. He ultimately ending up selling PUBG to a chinese guy. And no I'm not making this up he got his money and ran. Also PUBG uses Fortnites battle UI obviously Fortnite uses it better and is overall a better free game that's not riddled with hackers.The game of the year nomination was ??? Questionable I mean the game wasnt even released yet there's rubberbanding bullet registering is a joke vehicles are a mess and not to mention the hackers. Their system is actually so bad that a buddy of mine downloaded a hack to use against the hackers. Basically you PUBG not worth 30 dollars its more fun watching the PUBG WTF clips and China is not number 1 you guys you have your own severs.

2017-07-18,0,0,332,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. After 170 hours of game and top 97 on rank my experience Major Technical Problems Runs bad on any rig Memory Leak make it impossible to play with less than 8 gb ( even with 8 gb you have to reset the game often or play until it crashes out of ram) Crashs loads of them. Devs won't set priority most of their team is worried with non core gameplay like mods and such. Stuttering and framedrop is a big portion of the match it really ruins the game experience Cheaters are not that rare Ban are inconsistent as fak because they aren't being reported via game but via players externaly. Major Core Gameplay Problems (IMO) Circle RNGRight now the area that limit the game borders (whitecircle) is totaly unfair and broken. The first 2 3 circles are totaly okay the problem is the small ones. They are the opposite of strategy and will make your game a gambling with frustrating outcomes.You have 3 outcome's scenarios from the rng 1 The circle closes at your position. You'll probably win cuz your positioning is better and people will have to move through hell and firefight to get at you. Thats pretty much it. People will die trying to get in the safezone and you just need to fight half squad or 3 man squad. Mind thats occurs 3 5% of the games. i have more than 160+ matchs at season 2 and happend like 5 times to me. I won every single one.2 Circle wont close at your position and you have to run for it. What should be okay if you can predict it but the RNG factor you up most of the times. It's basicly impossible to deal with open areas at the final circles without a car. At 15 20 people left it's basicly suicide to run over the open field you will probably die before find cover cuz other players get lucky at the circle and will shoot the hell out of you. If you're GOOD at trading you can still win... but your chances are crushed near 10%. This is 70% of the game. 3 End circles are at the center and you have enough cover to move on using strategy with terrain knowledge what makes a fair scenario. that's 10% of the game and very satisfying when possible... but the RNG will you on the next close up or just closes at you. At both situation it wont feel fair even with a win most of scenarios are &gt Circle rng &gt Team A are at Cover &gt Team B have to run for it &gt If team B moves early will die due to the lack of cover &gt If it is too late will be ed up by the blue zone unless have a car&gt if you have a car the noise will give your position and probably 1 2 members will die inside the car&gt Pray for the rng god for the next circle&gt Closes at unfair position again for team B&gt Team A is again inside&gt sad.jpgEither you are TEAM A or TEAM B it is unpleasant to see that outcome no strategy just mindless runing at open fields cuz you cant do about it while the other team are at cover w8 to you.Thats NOT strategy you can't predict the circle it's pure gamble.People argue that's lack of planing by players and it's not. You can try to predict the next circle but the one after that goodluck. You can try to predict the worst case scenario? Yes you can. But the outcome is the same. If you are really good at shooting you can outcome the situation with pure shooting skills like most streamears do. And well.. that's less than 1% of the playerbase. I'm okay at shooting at 97 general rank and 1k killing rank i can say people aren't that good. And if you're not well...We get back at the RNG gamble. Unfair and cold as . 3'rd person camera Well it can be used by both sides at trading but at some spots it's basic the most op thing in the game. At corners it's impossble to see players using the camera advantage and you have to get at that corner in some situations. It's unbalanced and can be use by both sides but at corner's is impossible to overcome unless you have a shotgun the enemy is really bad and you are really fast.At some 4x1 situation i won because of the corners... it's just not right. I did not overcome their skill i just have wall protection with vision of enemy aproach unless 4 guys come at once what i doubt in close areas they have to granade the out of me and hope i get kill'd. Community problems Support sucksDevs won't reply your bug related topic very often even if its about memoryleak.They will just erase your post and claim that they have enough for bug reports mine ins't necessary. Dont even bother to post on steam instadelete basicly.Bad support to people who plays with good hardware but poor performance horrible optimization at all. Toxic playerbaseUnless you really like to play solo duo and squad is no good if you aren't playing with friends. People are toxic like everyother gaming comunity. Dont even bother to comunicate. They'll TK sure you can report them and get their asses banned but it's not a solution IMO. What about the GOOD part?Well the game is fun to play at short time period but really frustrating at long term. Rng has this false sensation of victory that's rare to occur and will keep fresh at most times. Feels good but when you realize that's not smart and fair the fun goes away.Yes you can get better and better at shotting but in this game positioning is the most important thing in the game. And if lucky is at your side well... good! If it's not sad. Do not spect fair outcomes it's really rare.EDIT Macros are a problem right now people can do it with no problem whatsoever.

2017-05-24,0,0,21,True,Recommended,"When I saw this game I literally said ""another DayZ...""A few days later I saw my friend playing it. I asked him how it was and he said ""great""...I had extra $ in my steam wallet and decided to give it a try...ReviewThis game is actually really good. To be honest I worry if they are going to change it too much they could ruin it. The spawns the balancing are really good. The ambient is also well done and it feels the way it should be. I can't say about performance but it's doing fine for me.One of the things I like is that you can approach the game in different ways. You can find a nice rifle prone in the bushes and snipe or wait for people to kill each other and only engage towards the end or you can shoot people up without hiding risking more but getting more points if you pull it off.Dev feedbackThe only few things I'd suggest to the developers...1. Increase the time before the 2nd and the 3rd circles. It feels like they go too quick for how small the area is. You're literally fighting more against time than players.2. Randomize circles locations a little more...there are areas I still haven't explored because the circles are usually in about the same areas. Also...very important...avoid bridges towards the ending circles. At that point it's literally all about good rng...if you're on the wrong side of the bridge you either get sniped or die outside of the area.3. Very simple but please add a voice chat volume slider so we don't have to stand kiddos screaming in their mic at the beginning of each round.4. Later on please add more maps. I can see myself getting bored of the same map eventually.5. Most importantly don't change too much. The game is really good. I like the balance spawns the concept and how you can only unlock aesthetic that way every match is fair.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-24,1,6,316,True,Not Recommended,"This game was great especially being in early access. I still recommend it but when I bring up PUBG I also bring up how the Devs are creating this beautiful game into a kindergarden. I understand rules help people get along but in a game thats TAGGED for being SURVIVAL...YOU SHOULD BE READY TO SURVIVE.Devs shouldn't have to hold your hand to keep players happy. When I found out that you could now be reported for team killing I was genuinely upset. I'm not one for team killing BUT to put up a protective barrier to players who cry because the ""partner"" they thought they had blew their head off is ridiculous. Like I said this is survival. That's the best part of the game. Your heart starts racing you talk to your squad make sure they're cool. THATS the rush of the game. I've been team killed but I've always expected it to happen sooner or later. Am I upset that those players killed me their own teammate. HELL NO. It's the game and when you take the game away from people you'll lose base players that thoroughly enjoyed the game before it was ponies and rainbows. And with this stream killing ITS CALLED SURVIVAL. If you're dumb enough to publically show your position YOU derserve to be shot by everyone on the map.

2018-04-14,0,0,216,False,Not Recommended,"If this game didn't sell as well as it did it would be an embarrassment. At it's core PUBG is fine but it was executed so poorly that this game is garbage. Loot Spawns The complaint I hear the most about is the spawn rate of loot and until today I had no problem with the loot drops but after the three matches I played today my opinion has changed. First match loot and entire apartment building walk out with a shotgun and die instantly. Second match go to mansion and loot a whole building again walk out with a shotgun and die instantly to someone with an m4. Third and final match loot SIX count em SIX buildings in water town and only walk out with a 9mm the other person water was so bad that I managed to tag him 3 times in the head with my 9mm if I had ANY OTHER GUN I would have killed him. I can understand not having a rifle in every bulding BUT NONE IN SIX BUILDINGS?!?!!?? Honestly stupid.Glitches I don't even know where to begin with glitches in PUBG. There are too many to count and too many to remember. But one particular glitch I do remember was when I was in the top 5 I had a kar98 and was sniping people from a roof. All of a sudden I get stuck in the floor and can't get out die to the zone. This is commonplace in PUBG and I can't believe the devs have let this slide for so long. I understand with AAA companies patching out glitches isn't something that will make them money but with a dev team comprised of modders and people who have experianced what it is like to be a ""gamer"" ( that word but it's all i could think of) in the modern day you would expect them to show some decency and patch their glitches.Tick Rate I'm not quite sure as to what the tick rate in PUBG is but I know it's low as . Alot of the time you can spray a whole clip at someone for only 5 of your bullets to hit. hit reg is awful.Bullet Penetration oh my ing god. This is by far the worst thing about PUBG. Bullets don't penetrate through ANYTHING! You see that twig over there? Yeah it can probably block bullets. All the time I die because I can't hit someone through the ing wooden handrail on stairs for them to chuck a grenade up and for me to die. I'll address grandes in a second but for now let's talk more about bullet pen. The fact that a CHAIN LINK FENCE can BLOCK SNIPER BULLETS is actually . I don't know why I don't see more people complaining about this. The fact that a shoot doesn't have ANY bullet pen in 2018 is beyond stupid and again if the game didn't sell as well as it did I would call this embarassing.Grenades oh boy the frag grenade not much to say about it other than if you hear one land next to you as Kenshiro from fist of the North Star says ""omae wa mou shindeiru"" or for you non weebs ""You're already dead"". If a nade goes off anywhere within a 20 mile radius of you you're dead. Nades are basically a free kill and are the one piece of gear that is littered all over the map.And finally my last point of contention MIRAMAR Who the actual shipped this map? Miramar is by far the worse map in any game I have ever played. All the guns it introduced are All the vehicles in the map are And all the towns in the map are Just a map overall. And if you try to remove the map from your game files you can get vac banned oh boy my favorite.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Instead of relying on your entertainment from the game they've now decided to cop out like the majority of triple A titles and use addiction to get your money. It's only a matter of time until they add some copy and paste rank+ladder system (bronze silver gold etc.) to get you hooked on a never ending cycle of rage and addiction. And take my word for it this game isn't leaving early access any time soon if at all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,106,False,Recommended,It is difficult to describe why the open nature of this world s huge map plus its realisticly modeled weapon mechanics and urban environments(with every building being enter able) create some of the most intense moments in gaming I ve ever had so I will describe two of the situations that I ve found myself in while playing this game. These sequences are not scripted not carefully crafted by an omniscient developer but are a result of dynamic emergent gameplay that this game delivers often. 1)I am looting a small house managing to find a Beretta pistol and a single magazine s worth of ammo before hearing the roar of a car engine driving nearby. I crouch and peek out the windows just in time to see a dune buggy stop its driver get out and run purposefully towards the building. He is holding an M416 rifle and wearing a welder's helmet. Terrified I sprint into the bathroom and close the door hoping to hide. I hear the front door open and his footsteps as he clears each room of the house probably searching for ammunition. I kneel in front of the bathroom door every sense on alert my heart about to beat its way out of my chest as his footsteps get louder and louder and the bathroom door swings open. There is a perfect silent moment as he stares at my character too surprised to react that is abruptly broken by the sound of me emptying every single round I had of 9mm into his chest panicking and not ceasing fire even as his lifeless body slumps against the wall. I had inadvertently set a trap not one out of careful planning but one of desperation.2) As I am sprinting across a hill top carrying my beloved SKS I hear the snap crackle pop of a rifle round breaking the sound barrier as it whizzed by my ear. Judging by the faint gunshot report I concluded the shooter was at an extreme distance and I ran and hid behind a tree. Many rounds hit the tree s trunk and I even took a couple hits to the shoulder as I cowered behind it and using the 3rd person view I surmised he must be in a nearby church s tower using the same thought process of Private Jackson in Saving Private Ryan That s where I d be. Leaning over from cover I aimed and fired into the tower but since I only had the iron sights I had no idea if I was hitting him or not. I cowered behind the tree and hoped that he would get bored and find something else to do. After 5 minutes of patient hiding I sprinted out to the church and not a soul was to be found. I never knew who was firing at me or what happened to him. The more I play the game and the more I ve learned about the importance of stealth it is likely that another player drawn to the sound of gunfire ended up taking him out.Is this game perfect? Not quite I have been randomly disconnected from servers and it needs optimization. However the moments in this game are unlike anything I ve ever encountered in another game before other than something like DayZ. These moments are the reason why Battlegrounds is already a resounding success and if what I ve described to you sounds like a good time I recommend picking this game up and join in the fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-11,0,0,529,True,Recommended,This game is absolutely nothing new or top notch not well optmised and buggy but even with all that it is great fun. Playing with friends with voice comms always gives me my share of laughter but playing solo is the real deal though. When you reach that top 10 in a solo match your heart is racing you are listening carefully thinking hard watching the circle and all that just to get your hands on that delicious chicken dinner. This game still needs lot of optimisation because even with a 1050ti and an i5 4th gen I see a lot of fps drops and a lot of times the building textures fail to load after parachuting. Even with these issues the hype train about this game is real. 2 million concurrent players on Steam in not a small deal. I am excited about the future of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-10,0,0,55,True,Not Recommended,So after 26 hours I got my first chicken dinner which means I have nothing to prove myself in EA and I Can wait for full released game thus this review. ( I just hope I didn t kill any streamer )Game is a battle royal genre which means you get dropped on an island people killing each other and try to be the last one survivor as playable arena gets smaller by the time.This is not overall game review for everyone but players who love stealth silent predator playstyle. Game is most of the time the most played game on steam there are plenty of reviews you should have some rough info about this game already by this time.1. My biggest problem in this game render distance of grass is terrible. Every player who has at least 2x scope can see you across the map. If you want to go across field forget about crawling your best bet is to just run zig zagging if someone is shooting at you and ghillie suit will not help you either. If you want to cover yourself from unwanted attention of sniper your best bet is tree rock or a house not even bush will save you. Render distance of grass is set aprox. 100 m so you might be fine for closer distances but bevare of players using foliage setting on very low. It is still kinda dense but only when you are very close. Always keep your back against the solid object because no matter how hard you scout area in front of and behind you you are still very visible from distance. My advice is move through areas with trees where they cast shadows if you have not equipped bright colored clothes. 2.Clothes. There are microtransactions in this game and those are clothes. Some say it s cosmetics and it doesn t matter. But believe me it does. You start with shinny clothes and people who unlocked nice dark camouflaged clothes are in advantage right from the beginning. You land after parachuting from plane and right from the beginning you shine around like snowman in desert. It s good to go where no one does but loot might not be worthy and you never know who is around.3.Sound. Almost everything makes sound. You are not gonna tip top I tried that as I was hitting WASD gently but fast like woodpecker still making noise even turning around makes noise. You better camo your footsteps with plane passing by. It s different when it s rainy. You re not gonna hear anyone outside running. Silenced guns are good when shooting from large distances but loud close. When you hear someone coming best thing to do is just freeze and wait for him getting better position or cover is bad idea because you immediately give away your position when you move 1 meter and there is no problem shooting through walls like they are not even there.4. Framerates. When you suddenly encouter player close to you you might get huge lag spikes which might get you killed because those miliseconds of reaction time matter a lot and you are not able to do anything. Frame drops are really common in EA games but spikes like these cannot be acceptable. I do not recomend getting too close to the enemy player as you might experience tearing. gtx 1060 i7 700hq 16gb ram playing on medium setting and framerates jump from 80 fps to 25 in split of a second.4.I m solo player and luckily for me there is a first person mode for solo players as well. In my opinion third person view in games like this has no place as it breaks the immersion giving huge advantage when peaking around corners or checking area around you.Engaging head to head in stealthy playstyle isn t the best option. I was able to win by stalking players circling and killing them from behind.This is the game when you don t know if you want to recommend it or not.If you add other problems like banning stream killers bugs and glitcher texture loading problems and poor performance it s easy to not recommend this game. But that s fine it s early access for now. But how can game developer make micro transactions and make esports tournaments when game is not even finnished that s beyond me ridiculous some would say.If you like gun blazing hunting players engagin in combat head on and enjoying game as it is I recommend it for you. If you are sneaky like me enjoying stealthy playstyle It s hard to recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's got fantastic shooting mechanics a highly rewarding Battlepoint and win system. There's nothing quite like getting a Chicken Dinner in this game as opposed to any other shooter and I don't know why. This game does have a few genuine problems unlike irrelevant issues that people bombard the review section for like adding paid crates (they went to funding the tournament and whatever was left over was going to charity) stream sniping bans and banning those who edit the configs or use macros. The real problems with the game are the extreme unoptimization. I rock a GTX 1060 6Gb i5 4690k 16Gb of DDR4 RAM an it's on a 500Gb SSD yet I'm only getting 60 90fps with Mediumish settings. There's the lack of ping lock which allows people from other regions to use their lag to an advantage in game. There's an abundance of cheaters though I've only come across about 10. There's a whole lot of bugs but I haven't come across any other than the default to Asia bug. Overall though this game is really consistent and tons of fun but you really do need a pretty good rig to run this game decently. If you have a good rig I highly suggest you pick up this game. It's got first person and third person modes allowing those who prefer either perspective to play alone though for third person mode you can switch between first and third freely. As I said earlier the gunplay and replay value is really the best parts of this game. The RNG based gameplay keeps weapons fresh and fun and makes sure there's always opportunities to use each weapon. The Blue Force Field is always comepletely random and so are the random special crate drops and deadly Red Bomb Zone making sure every match is an entirely different fun experience. In short this game has it's issues though they're almost completely overshadowed by the overwhelming amount of fun you'll have playing this game and I highly recommend anyone with a good rig buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,1,6,325,False,Recommended,"I've been playing the game since it first ""came out"". But now that it had its official release today i decided to write a review about what improved and what didn't.Because it seems like this game is having a bad time when it comes to reputation at this moment. The reviews are mixed and people are p*ssed about the fact that it was released being in the state it is currently in. And i can totally see that. The game is still buggy to some degree and f*ck i wouldn't really call it stable.Still all the time i've been playing there was only one issue that really got me mad...and that is the performance. To even scratch the 60 FPS i had to put all graphic options down and hell it was still dropping to 40 at points.But since the big update today it runs smoothly at a constant 70 FPS on Ultra. And that they added the climbing really changes the Gameplay in a good way.The new map is debateable. I'm not a fan of desert areas at least not in games. They don't appeal to me visually and always feel bland. Though i must say that after seeing the same map and places for over 200 hours this change is quite refreshing. They overall worked on the visuals and the whole game just looks better now.But again i'm still having the weird bug of building needing too long to load. So long that people have enough time to get weapons while i can't do anything. That destroys some rounds and is just frustrating.Then there is the problem that sometimes even if the buildings load fast enough (Hallelujah) the character just kind of refuses to pick up stuff. (Might both be because my internet is a big C*nt at times i dunno)Last Words PUBG is far from perfect and i do know that. But after games like DayZ or H1Z1 i wasn't expecting this to be perfect. I'm not sure if they should've gotten out of early access today since it still needs a lot of improvement. But it's fun and that's the only thing that matters. Be honest here if you wanted a ""perfect"" and ""great optimized"" game you wouldn't even look at this kind of game. I just wanna say All the negative reviews are right but don't be scared of it having them. It's enjoyable and changing in a good way (at least how i see it).

2017-09-09,0,0,349,True,Not Recommended,"I have put almost 300 hours into this game and I absolutely can not recommend it for a variety of reasons 1. Absolute early access hell. I bought this game right when it came out and the devs constantly showed their lack of interest in the playerbase after they got their money. Horrible server desync horrible policies abandoning update schedules and most of all developing consoles versions of a game that is is EARLY ACCESS for PC players.2. Garbage policies. I have won MANY games the majority are screenshotted on my profile) but I am by no means a good player. I play with the same group of 3 other people EVERY night and I am far from the best but I was greeted on the 9th of September with a YOU ARE BANNED message. Other than being not good at the game I play with &gt 5 Mb/s down which is purely a detriment to me as I often lag beyond the point of playing(not the game's fault). It is almost like they just ban everyone that has been reported which leads me to my next point.3. The community is garbage. The streamers (Stonemountain etc) are whiny unfunny losers who whine and complain when things don't go their way. It got to the point where players would honk the horns of their vehicles around streamers and the would get banned for ""Stream sniping"" even though there is no way to tell a non teammate's identity without killing them. This is an absolutely ridiculous policy. If you don't want people coming and trying to bring some comedy to your unfunny stream with a disproportionate amount of players viewing don't stream. And if that means you stop collecting your NEETbucks and go get a job that is just how it is. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of talented and funny streamers but the fact that their complaining can ruin the experience(IE ban) other players that have no idea what is going on is ludicris.4. Balance is an issue. The loot spawns are incredibly disproportionate and there becomes a point like in several Battle Royale games where the RNG completely takes away skill or lack thereof. I have landed in places like Tunnels(shelter) Crater(prison) and gotten 0 weapons or armor but one person that enters a small shack gets a Kar98k and headshots both me and my partner. No developers actually seem to be interacting with the loot balance in a positive way instead choosing to add weapons to airdrops like the Groza which differ very mildy from other more common weapons.5. Vehicle movement is glitchy and annoying. I can't stress how many times that my team and I have been driving through the ""hand modelled"" fields outside of po i and had our UAZ(jeep like vehicle) completely tip over and injure all of us. This sometimes even costed us a match we had a likelyhood to win. The best solution to make a only the most logical response to tipping a military vehicle throw a frag grenade at it and get in AFTER the esplosion so that the car can magically tip itself over again damaged but driveable.These issues are only scraping the top of the barrel with the issues with this game. I imagine I will get several responses stating to ""leave the game alone it is in early access"" but to that I say this Early access is a scam. With the exeption of a few absolute gems it has been nothing other then a cheap scheme where ""optimistic"" developers cash on on the hype for the game and then slowely fade away into obscurity leaving the game to die. Despite what PLAYERUNKNOWN says the have already abandoned some of their schedules for much needed updates and fixes that would make the game playable. but instead they choose to develope console versions ban innocent players and act like they anything other than stealing the money for a project that will likely never come to a finish as the playerbase reaches 1 million people that jumped on a hype train. It was fun at times but this ban and all of the garbage the push on the playerbase is completely unacceptable and if I could get a refund I would in a heartbeat.edit I am currently unbanned. My review will still remain negative. The fun I had and the hours I put into thius game outside of the first month or so were with friends. The enjoyment I had was not really because of the game but the people i was with. This game CAN be fun I never said it couldn't I simply stated the way things are from the point of view of someone who has actually put enough time into the game to have well rounded opinion. If you are with friends and want to kill people go for it this might be a decent game for you.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The start of the game I found a nice M4 Custom it helped me all game with a x4 Scope and Red Dot that I switched in between. This gun is great in close range and long range so if you find it you won't regret it.Overall the game runs great I upgraded to a GTX 1050 just so I could play this game smoothly. Gameplay is really fast paced time is your biggest threat(along with players who land beside you). The servers have a bit of latency so you can get hit even when behind cover you really need to learn to play around this. There are lots of diffrent guns all with their own stats on range and damage. Snipers are crazy one shots sometimes even with a level 3 helmet.The map is quite large and you'll never see the whole map before the first circle alot of buildings and cities are scatterd around the map. There are also lots of open fields which you should avoid as much as possible.The only thing that can stop you from finding weapons is the RNG on loot. I have found no weapons and only attachments or random ammo inside lots of buildsing so get lucky!I really enjoy playing duo matches and look forward to playing in Squads which are made of up to 4 players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

All the reviews pointed me out of the direction of this game as do most with early access titles. But PUBG was different...After a few cocktails I said screw it and picked up the title. BOYY! The heart renching adrenaline that I got while playing is what kept me addicted. Even with the heavy stress for mediocre graphics and the Pixelated late loading houses I couldn't get enough! People is really what makes this game fun. Sure the map may be the same but every game is different and depending on where you jump options are endless.Graphically the game is decent. Well rounded and doesnt shy away from details. Although The memory tole that the game takes will have you wanting to get another 8 gigs of ram if your sitting on 8 already or god forbid 4. As with most games loading time can be a pain if your running off of a HDD but this can be heavily reduced by purchasing a SSD.Bugs are not as big an issue as they were previously and the developers fix issues regularly.

Most of the game you are just running searching for supplies instead of ""battling"" other players which is why this game should be called running simulator 2017. There is frequent hiccups and stutters while playing the game even if you have a good computer and also it's been reported that there are countless hackers in the game still.

A lot. Yes the game has issues as of now. It is not yet well optimized. It does have hackers and cheaters. There are still bugs around.All three of these issues must be mentioned.But The game is early access and the developers (as every developer team would of course) are saying they're working on optimization. Right now they're pushing for the first stable version they call it PC1.0 coming out in a few weeks. For a lot of players that behave a little like toddlers that's not enough they want daily optimization updates.Hackers/cheaters are getting banned every day.

""There will be no microtransactions in early access""...from their own FAQ and a few interviews iirc...but here we are just days away from the first microtransaction crate to be introduced to the game under the guise of 'charity' and 'funding a tournament'...please this is a test for how much money they can milk out of their playerbase. They are using us to fund the tournament passively so they don't have to cut into the hundreds of millions of dollars they've already made off us buying their game. It's a sad joke. P.U. himself has been handling this situation very badly as well saying things like ""I don't see the problem here"" and ""So we can forget about the crate drama now you know car horns are coming right? kappa""...it's ing disgracful. He has also stated that the final game will have no free crates...so you will have to pay $2.50 to open a crate which will contain A SINGLE cosmetic item at random with the possibilty of duplicates. A whole outfit could cost you upwards for $25...as much or more than the game itself. The money has went to his head.

If not hope you like Not having textures when you drop into the game. Trying to pick an item up from the ground and it not appearing in your inventory for at least two seconds. Cars stopping on a dime when hitting another one. Motorcycles being more likely to kill you while driving than other people . Massive framerate drops for absolutely no reason (especially after updates). Random game crashes usually while starting a game. And many more.Not to mention the fact that 90% of your enemies are going to be Asians who seem to not understand that there's dedicated servers for all of them.Don't buy this game.

2017-07-17,0,0,232,True,Recommended,Ok so i absoloutly love this game to bits hence the high amount of playtime that ive got on this game. Graphics are quite good but the performance is the proplem which brings to have to lower my graphic settings to very low and ive got a decent graphics card (GTX 960) so i shouldnt really be expierencing fps below 60 but sometimes it goes down to 40 with high settings. I personaly feel like the hit regestration is quite terrible and that i find my self missing alot of shots that ive lined up perfectly on perfectly still targets. Another problem that seems to be going on in this game is me geting shot right after ive gone behind cover which absoloutley should not be the case alright?Over all i would rate this game a 8.5/10 (pretty high score in my opinion) we will just have to wait for the developers to optimise the game to a proper state. But! for 30 dollars the game is not at fault and plus it is in alpha state after all and has provided much more content than its rivals such as H1Z1 (which is a terrible game btw). All and all a very good game for the price tag. Thank for listening/reading my 2 cents on the matter. It has been i ''HippityHoppityWomenAreProperty''.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The out of play zone doesn't punish players nearly enough. Lag and client side hit detection cause massive disadvantages in fights. The Dev team is witch hunt banning players. Before they fixed the bug where players could see and shoot through buildings they added crates and keys. The game is addicting. It's fun. It's entertaining. Play it with friends. You'll have a great time. Play solo? You're going to see and feel all of the games issues. You'll end up just waiting for your buddies to get online.UPDATE Netcode seems to be worse. No idea why.UPDATE 10/09/17 Building not loading for people with game on a HDD is still a thing. Can still be exploited. Both using call outs and just plain shooting. Speed hackers aren't being banned but people using the horn are. Client side hit detection is a massive issue still as well. Bullets clearly hitting people but not actually doing damage because of ridiculous pings. Do not buy this game. They released crates and made it an esport before they could get rid of the buildings not loading and hackers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-29,3,3,543,True,Recommended,My friend leads as we exit the three story building. With body armor backpacks helmets 5 kills under our belt already we sprint out congratulating each other as conquerers of the town. Ten seconds later we round a corner of a nearby building.My friend is slain by a shotgun shell to the face. I fire back with my M16 tagging the enemy quite heavily. The solo murderer of my ally quickly flees likely looking to tend to his wounds. I pursue him with intent to make him pay for my fallen brother.I see enemy is in a corner gun pointed at the ground attempting to bandage himself.I shoot off a shell from my shotgun.He falls.I loot the enemy for his ammunition and meds and quickly flee the scene silently mourning my friend's death. I promise to him that I will win this battle royale and avenge him by taking out all the enemies that I see. Not too long later two players enter the outskirts of town on a buggy. I hide behind a corrugated metal wall watching their movements as they enter a two story building with a balcony facing my direction. It must have been over 2 minutes before they decided to show themselves again. One of them opens the balcony door and crouches behind the balcony wall obscuring everything except his helmet covered head from view.I decided to take my chances and open fire with my M16. I walk out from behind cover exposing my entire body while madly tapping my semi automatic rifle hoping to get a lucky headshot on the enemy.Some of the bullets whiz past his head while the rest embed themselves among the balcony wall. He and I both know I am nearing the end of my clip. As I run out of bullets and start to reload he stands up and sprays his bullets toward me. I run and jump back to cover unscathed. After I reload I walk backwards and retreat taking potshots at him so he cannot fire back. I duck and weave through buses and broken walls.I do not flee.I look for an optimal position to take another battle.The enemy soon grows restless as one of them walks out of the building searching behind walls and buses looking for me. His path leads him to me crouched under a wall watching his every movement.As soon as he gets near I stand up and end his life with another shell from my shotgun. I once again reposition myself as his ally will be looking for me. I find another wall to hide behind and try to locate the second enemy.I see the player timidly walk out of the house. He reluctantly searches the area not wanting to get killed in the same way his partner had been. He certainly has no idea where I am but I can clearly see him opening the huts nearby. He crouch and slowly creeps up to the side of a hut that has a door facing me. He is holding a shotgun aiming it at the door oblivious to what is about to happen to him.If he goes to open the door I will have the perfect chance to take him down from behind. He does exactly as planned.I walk around the corner of the wall and get behind him. He opens the door of the hut.I point the shotgun to the backside of his head and I fire.He falls.The entire town is silent. I am victorious in my battle and left as the sole conquerer of the town. However I do not feel like I have won as I think about my fallen friend. WIth 65 players remaining the road ahead is very long.I take a deep breath and leave the town mentally preparing myself to face the future combatants on my own. 10/10 No other game has been this exciting for me and my friend so far.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The problem I have is regarding to why it is so demanding to render all these terrible graphics with ""VERY LOW"" rendering distance. When I am parachuting down to the play area I always experience all these unrendered and mesh looking structures with nothing inside of them and after a minute of pure lag and destruction to my performance all of the mentioned structures finally render and I can go on about my game.Everytime I encounter an enemy I for some reason receive lag spikes when I aim down sights towards them. I see someone and as soon as I aim down my sight whether it'd be a red dot sight or an 8x scope and my game justs detect this large impact to the client side.During a match upon exiting there is such a high rate for me to crash where the game is unresponsive and stuck on the loading screen. (like how hard is it to just execute a function telling my client to send me back to the main menu screen.)For the community it is really mixed between middle aged people in there 20s or 30s and somewhat uncommonly some teenagers and younger. The community is most of the time great and sometimes anger fills them and they start to fire at you back verbally or even physically (in game) if taken to that level. If you decide to let auto matchmaking kick in for a match of Duo or Squads you are likely to get someone who are cooperative. Very rarely you will get matched with someone who will be uncooperative based from my experience.When you're on the PUBG discussions specifically the ""Looking for Players"" thread you won't have any troubles finding a player more than likely but if you're the one looking to be paired up with someone. Keep in note that there are a lot of discriminant people (based from my experiences). When I say ""discriminant "" I'd like to mention that others are always looking for someone for a specific age your leaderboard positions the amount of hours you've accumulated in the game or even your gender. There are also a countless amounts of communities trying to recruit you to join their open and public Discord server. Also the people you meet are most likely going to abandon you (meaning that they will never speak to you) unless you really stand out to them in a good way. (like why can't we just all be open about who we want to play with). For me I'm just a typical person I only talk when it's necessary and so far pretty much all the people I met from the discussions has never bothered to talk to me again. So think of the discussion as a way to find a temporary partner.From the first months of release for PUBG it hasn't been such a pain to run. It was manageable and really fun to play at the time. PUBG was very responsive and they announced future updates before they were released. Many of which teased the community.PlayerUnknown was releasing monthly updates which was great! It was not until a couple months later that they stopped implementing updates that the majority of the community enjoyed. The updates which were just a couple or patches and bug fixes were unbelievably storage consuming. I'm saying that updates range from 5 to 10 GB.All in all I enjoy this game. If it wasn't for the insane amounts of performance required that it took just to run this game. Along with the lack of support to address better updates that improved performance upon this game. To sum this game up if you're planning on buying the game at full price it's essentially investing $30 on a poorly controllable and widely customizable character struggling to run around a huge island filled with 100 people with a progressively and painful closing blue circle that closes in a randomly generated area where remaining players are looking for a ""Chicken Dinner"" which is a phrase to commonly emphasize the winner of the match. The farther you get into the game without dying the higher reward you will receive as an in game currency known has ""Battle Points.""update u can check my pc specs on my steam profile and you will see that the game is honestly trying to kill my computer purposefully lolanother update so there's this new update adding emotes and ever since... i have not once got my pubg to start working without crashing on the pre match loading screen. i've been consistently looking at numerous forum posts for 6 hours trying to find the fix. anyways quality game",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-05,1,3,722,True,Not Recommended,I HAVE OVER 500 HOURS IN THIS TRAINWRECK. I know what I'm talking about. I've played copious amounts of solo duos squads solo duos and solo squads I know exactly what this game has to offer.PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was released in early 2017 and provided players with a game concept that most hadn't seen before it was truly fresh and saw its massive success from not being as buggy(?) and cheap looking as H1Z1. But now the honeymoon period is over the premise has worn thin and the gameplay is stale. More and more people are uninstalling complaining and leaving negative reviews a once overwhelmingly positive game is now at mixed. But wait this is one of the most successful games ever how is the gameplay getting stale when there are monthly updates and patches? The answer is the root cause of every issue in the game and will be the reason the game eventually loses its playerbase the answer is its developers of course. The curtain has been lifted and we are seeing who the Wizard of Oz really is an incompetent South Korean development team called Bluehole that made a few mediocre MMOs and mobile games spearheaded by an egotistical lead dev known as PlayerUnknown who is more concerned with spouting off his game's playercount (who are mostly internet cafe uses from China) and getting into twitter fights instead of fixing his deeply flawed game.Deeply flawed you ask? Yes. Every facet of this game is flawed. Every. Single. One. Let's go through them. First you boot up the game you will immediately see an ugly main menu that's fine though ugly main menus don't make a game bad though they are common with early access games. But you'll notice has a refresh button the reason being is that the menu constantly crashes and glitches such as not being able to join friends games when you click ready it cancels your teammates ready up status to the play button not being there (which just happened to me 20 minutes ago) or your goddamn character being naked for no reason. THIS IS JUST IN THE MAIN MENU. Next you get into a game you're faced with quite possible the most annoying lobby area ever conceived of in a game. Muting all players is essential in this part if you don't want to hear terrible 'China number one' jokes. But then you still have the noise of 30 guns being shot at once (in a game where gunshots are deliberately louder to help with finding action around the map). PlayerUnknown is at fault here for not putting more than 10 seconds of thought into what a player has to experience before every single match. It is truly annoying and sets the tone for the rest of the match you re about to play. Now you parachute a common occurrence is to glitch into any and every piece of environment sticking out leading you to cutting away the parachute and losing a chunk of your health in fall damage. This is no exaggeration this glitch happens constantly and has no foreseeable future to stop. We are only getting startd with the show that is this game. Next you run into the two main mechanics of the game after landing looting and shooting. Looting during the first minutes of the game is hilariously bad unless you use tab to drag items into your inventory you are guaranteed to pick up clothing pointless weapon attachments or stun grenades before the precious assault rifle on the ground. This strange loot prioritisation coupled with lag crippling lag during the opening moments of a match take away precious seconds during an already frantic rush for weapons and can often lead to you dying before even reloading your weapon. Then there s shooting and just like ARMA shooting feels like an afterthought like they ve added a floating weapon to a player model. This is in stark contrast to any AAA shooter where the shooting is a core mechanic and feels fluid. For months after release a problem persisted where after the bullets leaving a gun when being shot would not even go where the reticle indicated they would go after the second shot. Months. Wasn t this game trying to be a mil sim in the vein of ARMA? Then you have the gun constantly failing to aim past railings and windows an obvious result of almost every asset in the game being bought off the Unreal store and not actually built around the player models. The damage from the weapons is also inconsistent where you can shoot someone in excess of 8 times while missing their armour and they will live while other times you can kill someone in 3 shots. Every fight is unpredictable and frankly it feels disgusting how much fights rely on randomness. PUBG s most core mechanic feels clunky forced and unpredictable. Then you have driving the fact that the majority of PUBG highlights and fails videos consist of cars exploding and flying into the sky demonstrate that the driving in this game is just barely functional but due to the size of the map you ll be driving for a large portion of the game. Lastly you have the graphics and performance. You HAVE to play on the lowest settings if you don t have a fantastic gaming rig. You re going to be playing under 30fps if you try to make your game look anyway decent on regular specs not to mention you WILL crash. Now that the game s on the lowest settings the once beautiful Unreal engine now looks like a Vaseline soaked mess. Textures look muddy and the lighting is at the bare minimum. Being forced to make it look like this leads to a very bland looking gaming experience the game world never once wows you or surpasses mediocrity. But even with terrible graphics on low settings Blue Hole s spaghetti code and nonexistent optimisation still causes the game to still run like straight fluctuating between 30 50fps depending on where on the map you are. Does this sound like a fun gaming experience? Well it actually can be when these problems SOMEHOW don t come together to ruin your game and the reason it can be so much fun is because the Battle Royale concept is so fresh and addictive. But instead of us consumers getting a polished game which is consistently fun PlayerUnknown has chosen to milk the cash cow while putting very little effort into the definitive game of this genre. Blue hole (now more accurately referred to as Blue Balls) and PlayerUnknown made huge strides at the start they frequently listened to players and made changes based on their complaints and added fun and relevant content where it made sense (new guns first person on each server). Now we are 7 months on from release the game is still a buggy mess it is still one of the worst performing games I have ever played there are no new gamemodes and no new maps the game is as content bare and unpolished as it was 7 months ago. It s so disappointing as the game is GENUINELY FUN. I got my 30 dollars worth but you will get bored of it within days just as I did. The concept is great but a great concept can only carry a game with terrible gameplay so far. It s sad to finally loathe a game you once loved but after this disaster AAA developers will know what mistakes not to make and release a truly quality Battle Royale game that will bury this turd. I just ask. Why oh why couldn t these changes be made with the amount of success PUBG has got? WHERE DID YOUR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS GO BLUEBALLS? It s truly interesting how little the game's success has actually influenced the game itself. So I guess the moral of the story is DO NOT TRUST A MONEY HUNGRY MODDER AND INEXPERIENCED DEV TEAM TO MAKE A GOOD BATTLE ROYALE GAME.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Does the company behind PUBG plan to replace parts of my PC because their game destroyed them?? Doubtful they only care about getting their money from micro transactions (like they said they wouldn't do!)I would reccomend the game if it was working properly and if the creators didn't bold faced lie to the players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-11,0,0,105,True,Not Recommended,I used to recommend this game. I don't anymore and that's not only because of the microtransactions.PerformanceI am aware this is in early access but there have been ongoing performance problems that haven't been fixed for months. They've actually gotten worse. I have an NVidia GTX 970 and I cannot run this game at medium graphics at more than 80fps. At the lowest settings which are significantly lower I get 100fps at most. Maximum settings give me 20fps if I'm lucky.I choose to play with medium graphics with high render distance and low lighting. I get about 80fps at most which commonly drops to 50fps. In cities or with other players around me I sit reliably in between 30 and 40 frames per second.The concept and longevityThe concept for PUBG is very interesting. A harsh and realistic kill to survive kinda thing. I have no objections to the concept. The only bad thing I would really say about the gameplay and execution of this concept is that it does get dull fast. Every match has the same routine. The process doesn't feel repetitive it just feels to me like I'm waiting for something interesting to happen and I could just play another game and not waste my time.Maybe if the game had a real progression system I'd be more willing to play it (see the last section of this review). When I stop playing PUBG and start playing something else I feel genuinely impressed by how much better it feels than this game which brings me to my next section The feel of playing the gameSomething I value a lot in the games I play is responsiveness not just in UI but also in everything I do in game. My three most played games in my life are Overwatch LEGO Universe and Hot Wheels Velocity X. Overwatch has extremely polished character movement and lots of attention to the little things that make the experience enjoyable. LEGO Universe is the only MMO I've seen that paid any attention to this stuff and it felt great to play. Even Hot Wheels Velocity X a budget starved game from 2002 intended to be shovelware has very responsive controls and animations that make it enjoyable to play even now.PUBG's feel is different it's stupposed to be realistic and harsh. But they should also feel good to use. They don't. The game is not responsive. When I use the user interface it feels like something I would have found a few years ago on ROBLOX sometimes even worse.I was looking forward to first person servers because I thought the game felt bad partially because of me not being used to its third person. Turns out first person was just slapped onto the surface of the game and it feels horrible delayed inconsisent. Bad coding which I will touch on later.Car handling is cool though. I like it a lot. Reminds me a little of APB Reloaded which is surpisingly a good thing. Still sometimes it breaks and you go flying go tumbling run into an invisible block randomly explode flip over spin out rubber band teleport...BugsYes it's listed as early access. Should it be? No. With how much the developer caters to streamers don't be fooled by the early access tag. The developer is updating and maintaining this game as if it is a released product like Overwatch (except with much less support or community involvement). Most of the changes to the game that are made are almost meant to make this game worse to play. The developer doesn't care about how good it feels to play.The servers that host regular users are slow and buggy. They cut out crash and cause client glitches commonly. There's a whole list of bugs I could include in this review but when writing it I discovered Steam's character limit. But trust me when I say the developer does not care about fixing bugs unless he absolutely needs to. And he doesn't need to if the game's listed as early access. Then it's fine for the bugs to keep piling up especially because the streamers' servers aren't ruined by them.I've seen disorganization like this before in my adventures in technology where the developers struggle to keep everything working. It's a sign of disorganization lack of optimization and overall bad code. I would be surprised if you opened this game up and found organized code that ran well. What you'd really find is a jumbled mess of things slapped together without much effort or planning.The developer of the game said publically that he doesn't usually play the game or even really games in general. Consider that.The developerHere's a little more elaboration on the developer's interests. There is graffiti all over all the houses in game and it all depicts different streamer logos and advertisements for pro teams and popular players. It makes me wince at how much the developer panders to streamers. He doesn't pay any attention whatsoever at the bulk of his playerbase.In interviews he always talks about the skilled streamers as if it's his game's entire audience and purpose. Streamers also get priority servers over regular people. Where a good streamer can reliably place headshots and whatnot it's a commonplace thing in average servers for you to aim directly at someone even if they're running in a straight line for you unload your mag and not hit a single shot for no discernable reason.Then there's the worry about paid content. Specifically in rare non streamer community contact PlayerUnknown said in his Discord server that he intends to eventually make all cosmetic items paid because he doesn't think of cosmetics to be a feature of the game so it should be separate.This brings me to the butchering of the game's progression system...Progression systemThis game has little to no progression system. What do I mean by this? Well Overwatch has lootboxes you get all the time from just leveling up in addition to competitive rank level and more. PAYDAY 2 has different skill builds to try out money to make heists to try achievements to get. These things tie these games together giving you something back for playing the game adding more depth and variation to the experience.Now let's look at PUBG In early August you could get a tiny amount of coins from every game. Sometimes you could open a few boxes a week after hours of playing and you'd be lucky if you got anything at all.Then in mid September you could find about 50 people AFK in every match farming currency for Steam market exploitation. That ruined the game. The developers fixed it however by butchering the amount of coins you get from every game so you couldn't farm as efficiently.The result? Well the amount you gain from each match was cut to the ground and the prices for boxes hasn't changed at all. So good luck getting anything. There is now no progression system through this game nothing to keep you playing nothing to tie each match together. Every match becomes even more of a pointless waste of time waiting for something to happen that somehow is supposed to make the past four hours worth it.But it's not worth $30 and it's definitely not worth your time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-22,1,3,2802,True,Not Recommended,First impression crude but amazingly fun game format great playing with friends the first month. Second impression Full of bugs they say will be worked out clunky lobby and team matching system (has a refresh button because it often doesn't work) laggy/glitching in the start of rounds and at various times weird physics (recent signs of improving)Most recent impression and why I've rated this thumbs down TOO MANY HACKERS I played 10 rounds and 5 were ended by speed and headshot hackers. Literally the same person ran around the map killing over 40% of the players with a headshot. Approx 5 10 players killed by one player every few seconds matches that used to be 20 30mins to have 10 remaining players are now down to 8 players in 5 10minutes. This has singlehandedly ruined the came. The bugs I was patient for since it's early access and because of the sheer amount of fun the game was. Now however you can't play a fair game long enough to really make the time invested to learn it worth it. My recommendation wait to purchase and see if they come up with remedies for the hacking.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is more based of getting your loot first whereas H1Z1 will see you with a gun almost instantly. Also gunfights in this are much more slower just like Battlefield. Alot of time i have played this has been spent running to the zone. The few gunfights i have encountered 90% of them have been a simple shot or so when they arnt looking.

But there's no ooomph to the gunplay no good feedback and I'm often too busy fighting network and startup issues to really have a good time. Not to mention the sound is really out of whack positional audio simply does not work and you get little to no feedback from where you're being shot.

2017-04-23,0,0,113,True,Recommended,I really enjoy this game and I feel the developers are making strong efforts to fix the issues happening in the game. There is a controversial thing though that the developers will ban you (from the forums) if you complain about the hackers in this game. There aren't many of them (yet?). Everything feels pretty balanced aside in this game and it's what I've really grown to love. If you have a shotgun it's generally considered a pretty weak early game weapon however in the late game you can use it in close quarters and still one two shot someone making it scale pretty well. The game has quite an Arma feel to it (because the game oridinated from an Arma mod). On my high end PC I'm getting none of the issues people are complaining about other than server lag every now and then (but they're making efforts to fix it).It's a good game that keeps getting better because unlike most early access developers they're actually updating it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But here's the thing when you actually play the game you'll somehow overlook these flaws because of how fun the game actually is.

2018-03-04,0,0,457,False,Not Recommended,I'll start off by saying i've played FPS games like CSGO battlefield Rust COD and Arma 2/3 for countless hours and i consider myself a decent player in these style of games. My pc is better than the recommended system specs and i have no technical troubles with the game. I enjoy the game concept and many aspects are up to the standard of what you'd expect from a game that made probably over a billion USD. I generally kill 5 15 players after a good start but die for reasons that shouldnt be a problem. I would definiatly play more if they could fix the current problems. But here's a bunch of real reasons why you should not play this game Input is extremely laggy / unresponsive (aiming using ads) Camera is glitchy (passenger camera is unbearable and flickers) You need a $1000+ graphics card to get consistent fps above 100 on medium settings Movement is unresponsive and annoying in general. Hackers are still a problem. The anticheat isn't even stopping game modifying cheats (movment speed and spread accuracy cheats) like every other game would. Looting is also still terribly unresponsive and basically requires you to open the UI and drag everything instead of just using the keybind. 90% of players will irrationally finish you instantly for no reason instead of trying to kill other immediate threats making your proably 20 minutes of looting a waste. (why not have invinsibility for 2 seconds? this would make so much difference) The control settings are WAY to over complicated and dumb literally 30 different sensitivity options for different sights vehicles ect. Not to mention the UI for customizing the controls and settings is annoyingly small so finding anything quickly is a giant hassel. Parachuting is still so unrealistic and glitchy. Why when you get near the ground you magically slow down? also when you are 100% going to land on top of a building you will often just teleport to the ground or worse just fall and lose half your hp. First person mode camera is even more unrefined. The new map espesially is way too big. Player's who try to play passivly will spend 30 minutes looting probably just to die before even seeing someone. The zone mostly gives the players on foot no chance. there are way too many open areas which are basically a garanteed death espesially on the new map. A less random more balanced zone would make sense. Or maybe bring back weather? those games were always interesting and different where stealth was fun and nessesary. Stun grenades suck and grenades in general are extremly time consuming and often risky to throw. The trajectory lines are inaccurate sometimes and also regular frag grenades are Over powered in general. Im fairly certain armour and helmets have no effect on frag grenade's damage. Random clothing spawns everywhere with no actual benefit in picking it up at all. This game is way too random unresponsive campy unbalanced and unfair (especially thanks to cheaters) I can't reccomend this to anyone with an average level of patience and expectation until loot+vehicle spawning is more consistent looting itself is intuitive and balanced hackers are not a constant problem and they make the overall feel of the game more responsive.It feels like they have given up on the game they made their crazy profits and now they barly update the game. They could easily resolve various problems or actually improve the game itself but they simply just dont care. Sh*t game fortnight is better any day.

To my shock horror what I read turned out to be true and I'm devastated that this game is eventually going to turn into another ""one of those"" games that solely rely on players with a huge wallet purely looking to pay to win as opposed to playing to win.In terms of performance nothing great is expected for an early access game. Yes there is going to be minor and sometimes major flaws that will be worked on alongside performance issues. That was expected and I fully accepted that when purchasing the game so I have no quarrels when it comes to performance being a tad bit behind schedule.Another thing I've come across is players being banned for disturbing a streamer during their money grabbing streams. That's the whole point of gaming is it not? Just because you're willing to put your commercially bought face on the internet whilst talking absolute garbage and in some cases blurting out racist terms when the chips are down in a game (wew PewDiePie!) does not mean you should be banned and ultimately removed from the playing experience. I am once again finding myself disappointed and distrusting of the game developers because of this and hope this was just a minor mistake and should not be repeated. If however it is repeated and players are banned for ""ruining"" some idiot's stream in other words beat said streamer in a gunfight then I highly doubt I'll be playing this game any longer.I had high hopes for this game but if microtransactions are going to be implemented as planned and players are banned for ""stream sniping"" aka playing the damn game as intended I don't think I'll be trusting this developer with any future updates or projects he and his team behind the implementation work on.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-04,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,Had high hopes for this one but I suppose the hype plays its part. As it stands right now I cannot recommend this game for the simple fact that it's rather disappointing when it comes to core concept pull off methods and optimisation/resource allocation priority even though my rig can handle it with ease. Unnecessarily high requirements for such a widely praised high audience game.You spend 85% of your game time looting/foraging for gear that you may or may not even be fortunate enough to need. Provided you pass this boring early to mid phase at all you'll spend the other 10% dropping items to free up inventory space and/or seek shelter from the circle. The 5% that remains at hand is you actually playing the game gun in hand and hoping you make it to the end a joke of a concept at this stage of early access. Same old rotations over and over again same base principles of loot and hide. The input/controls feel lanky and delayed nowhere near the responsiveness of similar shooters that do it far better. The atmosphere is decent for starters but there's room for improvement. It feels shallow and superficial it doesn't get me into that gunslinging mood that Dirty Bomb or CS GO boast.Now as a company Bluehole is practically non existent among sacred names so all is taken into account. They have a lot to improve on with Unreal Engine. Yet they did seem to get their marketing right as it turns out streamers manage to do most of the heavy lifting since they always cater to a wider audience far better than any gameplay demo coming from the devs. In that regard no bashing is intended simply observing the trends that prevail nowadays. It matters not how good or bad a game is as long as streamers play it. No sugar coating needed either.Wrap up Plenty of potential on paper poorly executed. 30 well spent.Exactly how PUBG came to be the most played game on Steam still eludes me but certainly the playerbase knows best. After all 1.6 million people surely cannot be wrong. Masses are always right right?If the devs do manage to prove me wrong in a year's time then I will update my review. Otherwise save your money.*Update 13 Jan 2018Decent optimization added vaulting new map tweaked recoils. A step in the right direction but movement still feels clunky.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-27,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,PUBG is a really fun game definitely worth the purchase. However in the last couple of days PLAYERUNKNOWN himself has said that they will be adding a CS GO crate and key system to the game for cosmetic items. The profits of this will go towards the prize pool of a gamescom tournament for PUBG. This game is one of the best selling games on Steam do you not think that the developers would have enough money already for the tournament? Apparently not. Worst of all PLAYERUNKNOWN said in the past that this game won't feature microtransations until after it has been officially released. Meaning he has lied to the community. This game is still in early access and they are adding microtransations aboslutely disgusting. Although I enjoy the game and will probably continue to play it I cannot recommend it to anyone else as the game hasn't even been finished yet and the devopers are already trying to take as much money out the wallets of players who have already payed 27 for an unfinished game.TL DR The developers are adding microtransations into the game. The game itself is still in early access.

Also with this current controversy involving Fortnite's battle royale mode BlueHole has demonstrated a lack for professionalism that should not be accepted in this industry whether it is from an indie developer or a triple A one and let's not forget the whole ""stream sniping"" thing that any negative review will mention.

In addition to this the supporting characters are bland murderous amalgamations of cowardice and hatred who fail to effectively convey the deeper meaning of this game.

2017-12-01,0,0,348,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is arguably one of the most overhyped games to date. The servers are a mess the anti cheat is garbage and the devs are slowly but surely becoming money s that are able to even give EA a run for their money.Before I start on the negatives I may as well list the few positives below + Joining matches are fast due to the high player count.+ Combat can be rewarding when the game isn't lagging.Now onto the negatives which can make this game more unbearable to play after the first hour. PUBG's servers are buggy and clunky as hell. Once landing on the ground your objective is to get into a building or structure and find a weapon to often combat other nearby players however the game lags so hard for the first 10 30 seconds that opening doors and looting take two three times the time it should normally take as the doors take extra time to open and items take several seconds to be placed into your inventory. The buggy servers can also have a major impact on combat which I will discuss below this. The main reason combat is frustrating as hell is mainly due to the hitreg which is abysmal. I've noticed quite often that each time I have been shot on occasion the bullet that could have killed me that clearly hit my chest does no damage to me or the vest which gave me time to get into cover or return fire and kill the enemy player(s). The gameplay can be quite boring especially during midgame and even more so if you dropped in an area with few players in your vicinity. You can avoid this problem by dropping into areas that 20 40% of other players drop off at every round such as the school shooting range. But this often gets you killed and rewards you with few points anyway. The BP/reward system most ing annoying thing about this game. You are rewarded many times more points for placing higher than being active within the game and fighting other players. Thats right. You can camp houses without having killed a single player until you finally die around top 15 and be rewarded with more points than someone who gets 3 5 kills and dies early on for at least trying. Theres no reward for skill only for being a patient buttmonkey. The game is riddled with hackers. One in every five to seven games I either witness or am killed by someone running faster than some vehicles can drive who also happens to have walls and/or aimbot. Battleye recently reported that they banned 25k hackers on PUBG within a day and those are the ones who were being blatant as about it. The game developers Bluehole have promised to exclude microtransactions from this game until it makes a full release. However around 1.5/2 months ago they released microtransactions for unboxing crates. The game developers also listen to whatever popular youtubers/streamers say whenever they witness or are killed by what they believe to be streamsnipers and hackers. I remember reading one occasion where a player was banned simply for driving and honking his horn unfortunately nearby a streamer where he claimed the player was ""harrassing"" him. Countless other bugs and glitches that are relatively minor (i.e. vehicles not flipping if turned on side or upside down UI freezing/lagging not being matched with other random players if auto matching is enabled for duos/squads). These bugs will also not be patched until near the start of 2018 as bluehole themselves have announced. WTF bluehole? YOUR GAME IS IN EARLY ACCESS!In conclusion PUBG is not worth your purchase until the developers own up on their and start to fix everything listed above Don't buy this game under any circumstances even if it goes on sale until these problems are addressed. For most average or casual players it is essentially a looting simulator with a few player encounters here and there but in the end you die 99% of the time. Edit The community is also a carbon copy of the Counter Strike community it consists of edge lords hackers and annoying s so if you dislike that then that is another reason to steer clear from this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Going to have to see extreme improvements over what's left of thier ""6 month early access optimization"" in order to recommend buying it. As of now ing around with friends is the most enjoyable aspect of the game. Don't try to take it too seriously or you'll just end of frustrated. Really don't understand how sub 10 server tick rate is acceptable in 2017. May 1st 2018 addition 404 days and more than 712 MILLION DOLLARS later... it's still a hot mess. Yet to see consistent tick rate &gt 30. Somehow they found a way to make the Unreal engine look like junk. Still die after reaching cover still die to super bullets Still see blood while bullets didn't actually do damage Still get projectiles already down range canceled out because the server decided the opponent fired first the list of beta issues yet to be fixed or even addressed goes on...Let's talk about looting. First of all fix the god damned loot tables. Why are there 1000 pistols when you often cannot find a rifle after searching 5+ buildings? This doesn't always happen but it's way too common of an occurrence. They did finally remove clothing spawns but they failed to clarify wether or not they replaced those spawns with more weapons gear meds or nothing at all. More foregrips seriously? Everytime I loot a house and see multiple grips but no gun I add another drop of despair to the bucket. Honestly 2 variants is more than enough. Is this supposed to be ""Jerry's Military Surplus Looting Spree"" or a BATTLE royale game? I don't understand why they don't find the same issue that I do with the possibility of not finding any decent weapon (imo atleast an ump or rifle) in an entire block! Extreme RNG looting should be reserved for ARPGS. Give us some balance.I've given up on hoping for improved melee. Walking backwards is still the hard counter to every melee weapon.My biggest gripe currently is the ingame movement. Why does it feel like complete Why is it glitchy af? Bluehole either needs to work closer with Unreal devs and hire some coders that have experience with the engine or ditch it and give us Pubg 2.0 with an engine they can work with. Idc if I have to buy it again seriously. It's 2018 you've had enough time and WAY too much money to not have came further than this. Movement should feel fluid it's vital to an enjoyable gaming experience.Mr. Greene don't give me that t line ""you can't throw money at developement"" you sure as could have hired 100 devs and weeded out the bad eggs by now instead of putzing around.

Bonus remember when the developers thought it was a good idea to add latency to picking up items because people who didn't pay attention to how good people play didn't know that they could drag in the inventory instead of using F to pick up items? Seriously? What made the developers think that was a good idea?I'm tired of the idiotic loot tables that leave you with just a pile of clothes vertical grips and P92s while AR shots are being taken all around you.Most of all I'm tired of the excuses.

2017-09-02,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,This will be a very short review as the game is in it's early access stage. The combat feels clunky the weapons are boring movement is pretty good except when you're stuck trying to get over a fence (Yes there will be vaulting in the future) cast iron pans deflecting sniper shots at point blank costing you chicken dinner not to mention having to set the game to lowest of low in order for it to even run smoothly(ish) whenever you're in combat frame rate dips (could depend on my rig) which will make you lose half of the fire fights (note coming across someone camping or having someone run past you) in the end you're pushed into a little circle where the person who has the lucky circle spawn will win. Forcing you to come to a person will get you killed in most cases. I do not think the net code the desync or anything of the like will be fixed when the game hits full release but what do I know? Oh yeah the minute of lag fest before every game (30 minutes of running around and trying to get loot only to get owned by someone) makes me want to vomit.Wait see if there's a change then buy because as of now it's just not that good./EDIT Been putting in some more hours into the game to see if I had given it a fair review and here it comes again gunplay is wonky and boring guns the same mouse movement seems like you've been put in a vat of jelly no idea if there's a hidden mouse smoothing option enabled but it's impossible for me to find a comfortable sensetivity. Hit detection is in one instance you can three shot kill an unarmored opponent with your m16 but literally the very next second it takes you 8 shots. Snake game is boring as leaving you losing an half an hour long WAIT FEST to some placements of the circle and some lying prone waiting for you. 60% of the game is running around and trying to find gear and running from circle to circle 30% is getting killed by someone from behind and 10% is actual enjoyment. Also EVERY time you die and return to the menu you've got to sit through an arbitrary loading screen and their splash screen. Dumb as all hell. Air drops Completely worthless as they're always dropped on the border of nowhere and is just a pvp magnet (which in itself is fine but boring to have to sit and camp this objective for 10 minutes only to have a chance at the new weapon that comes with updates). Loot crates (the ones you can buy with PBcoins) are underwhelming. I've bought 7 over the course and I've gotten the following beaniex2 blue combat pants ((Tbfh skinny jeans aren't combat pants)) baseball capx2 striped tshirt (the one that looks like a Russian Sheldon would've used) white dirty wife beater. And the return on the items are around 30. Given that you have to pay ridiculous ammounts for them and the return makes it obvious that mini transactions are going to be huge in the future. Getting stuck on a corner while parachuting losing the five second advantage you had over the other guy (who for some reason got to deploy his parachute closer to the ground than you) and having him kill you while you're playing with your balls in the air while pressing F to cut away parachute does nothing. Don't count on sound to help you at all nor the visual cues of getting shot it's not very accurate and will leave you scratching your head when you think they're shooting you from the side but they are actually shooting you from behind.Peakers advantage is ing stupid. People shooting and killing you before they even turn the corner. Also the fact that people from fudging Dubai can que on EU servers is beyond . Game is unoptimized. All to be expected. Don't buy it.

Rather than patching region locking optimizing and working on small details the company would much rather continue making crates and now designing skins for weapons.

2017-10-14,0,0,421,True,Not Recommended,I have been playing games for over 9 years now. This is by far the worst game I have owned. This game encourages low skill tactics has inconsistent damage and has massive latency problems. The servers run extremely poorly as well as in its current state the game is NOT ready for play. There are multiple game breaking glitches such as textures not loading when you land forcing you to stand outside a house whilst others loot and gear up to kill you. Even the simple act of aiming and shooting is broken. I will click and the gun will not go off I try to aim and the player will refuse to ads. The level of incosistency of damage is ridiculous. I once shot someone wearing a level 2 helmet and level 2 body armor once in the head and twice in the body with an sks and he suvived. I once shot someone without any armor or helmet on with a 1911 3 times and with a mini uzi 3 times and he survived meanwhile 1 scar shot to my level 2 helmet insta kills me. The gravity is also so unrealistic you jump and you're in the air for like 2 seconds that's so long especially in a shooter where every millisecond counts. It also takes your character soooo long to get from prone to standing it's painful to watch. The latency is also so bad I've been shot around corners and through rocks because the servers are so poor. Loot spawns are also sometimes very bad. I once looted 8 houses and the only gun I found was a 1911. You also have to press your face up against a door to open and close as well as it will sometimes teleport you to the opposite side you were on. Sometimes doors also appear closed on your screen however are actually open. I have not yet suffered because of this glitch however in time I'm sure I will. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS NOT WORTH A SINGLE PENNY. Even if it were free it wouldn't be worth the time playing it. Until they remove all of the game breaking issues this game should not even be considered playable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The last three games I was killed by hackers EASILY verified from the killcam (Kinda a giveaway when someone kills you with an UZI from 200+ meters away with zero misses with ONE burst). It has gotten to the point for me I can no longer play the game. It just isnt enjoyable. I'm done feeding the trolls at this juncture. Im sure Bluehole doesnt give a **** though since they already have our money. If they are making any attempt to curb the hacking they are failing miserably.At first it was rare enough to shrug off.

I probably wouldn't have bought it myself because I am not really into the whole concept of Early Access. That being said I totally think it's worth the price tag. What you receive A third and first person action survival shooter that throws you into battle with 99 other players A fix for your craving for intense squad battles really fun with friends free kitchen utensils which can also be used as a shield against incoming gunfireWhat might bother you Microtransactions in its current state of development (Doesn't bother me too much but apparently they promised otherwise) Low tick servers client side computing for some features (necessary for games of this size) Not quite optimized yet for all machines Overall I can say that my view on Early Access hasn't quite changed but that I may need to look at every title individually and go from there.It's a fun game and definitely worth your time.

Miramar on the other hand is full of loot and cars but is even worse for pacing and technically a much worse map. None of the weapon attachments have never done what they say they do and when they say that they have balanced something by doing 'x' in reality 'y' has happened. For example after a big patch the M16 was terrible so they claimed they reduced the recoil but when the community actually tested the gun after the recoil reduction the recoil had gone up to higher than before the patch due to the fact the developers have no idea what they are doing.I think this games survival (in the west at least) will come down solely to the upcoming Sanhok map.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Let me list these problems for you. The banning system is absolutely useless the amount of hackers I come across is incomprehensible. The hitreg is just atrocious I have hit someone several times on my screen for seemingly zero damage and the amount of times I've peeked and then returned to cover and a full second after I've gone behind cover I get hit. It just makes absolutely zero sense. The optimisation holy moly is this bad. I previously had an RX480 installed and could only get 20 30 FPS so I upgraded to a 1080Ti and now I get 40 60 like how is that even possible I've got more intensive games than this and they run massively better.If these problems are fixed I will definitely come back to this game and enjoy it again but as it stands it just isn't playable.

When players try to restart the game and rejoin it stops loading at the first loading screen.On poor game design the tickrate of the game is significantly below the majority of other multiplayer shooter games leading to players getting shot after entering cover.I greatly enjoyed playing Battlegrounds style gameplay in arma 2 and 3 but this iteration while easier to play is far too buggy and hacker friendly to reccomend to anyone.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You will love this game if you like one or more of the 3 following games DayZ The houses are similar and the loot is not that easy nor hard to find. The looting part of this game has a DayZ feeling definitely. The Graphics are similar aswell.Rust When I find a weapon and add scopes to it (especially the snipers) i get so excited. Just like in Rust. I feel like i am ready to go and kill as many people as possible. The combat system reminds me a bit of Rust aswell. H1Z1 KotK/Arma BR The Positives of the Battle Royale Gamemode on both of these games. PlayerUnknown made the Gamemode for both of them anyways. Now many people have an issue with the Lag. It really depends on what kind of PC you have. If you check the Devs' posts you can see that they are doing their best to improve the Performance. If you are not sure whether to buy this game or not because you think it might lag i would say wait a couple of months and see if people with Specs similar to yours see any improvements. There are many bugs and Performance issues in the game i agree. But keep in mind that it's still in Early Access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-08,0,0,1086,False,Not Recommended,This game is a lot of fun with friends and could be great if they fix the things that actuallly matter.1) Cheaters are absolutely out of control in this game. Any given game has a 50+% chance of having a Chinese hacker or 5 in it. Nothing like playing through the entire round getting 6 kills only to be killed by a UMP headshot from over a kilometer away while in a building behind a wall.Bluehole refuse to region lock the Chinese players to their own server and allow them to rampantly cheat on every server ruining all of them completely.2) The net code in this game is an absolute amateur joke. Refreshrate of 17hz is laughable. Be ready to lag frequently and die to bullets 2 seconds after ducking back behind cover.Honestly don't waste your money on this game if you have not purchased it yet. Bluehole have shown no real determination to fix the hacking or the brutal online performance of their game and are now trying to get it onto PS4. Thank god Sony shut that down. Maybe now they will focus their efforts on fixing the massive problems instead of worrying about selling more copies in another pllatform.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-19,0,0,174,True,Recommended,When I first purchased PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds after months of being pushed by my friends to get it I thought it was going to be a grave mistake of mine. However my expectations were completely flipped around 180 and I can't say enough about this game. I don't have many hours in the game compared to other hardcore players but I feel like I've played it enough to give a solid analysis. My experience with PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is akin to no other game of it's type that I have ever experienced. It is an addicting game that has refined the Battle Royale genre and rakes in thousands of new players by the week. The fundamental concept is easy to grasp You and 100 other players fly in on a plane and drop down to locate and capture supplies and take each other out one by one until you are hopefully the last one standing in the end. The amount of variability and variety in each new match you play makes this game GREATLY replayable. This replayability is greatly enhanced when playing with friends as close quarters firefights quickly become nerve wracking when ammo becomes scarce and medical supplies are sparse.There is a wide variety of gamemodes in the game beside the usual single duo and quad matches. These types can also be mixed and matched with First Person Only servers which makes everything seem more up close and personal. As with any game in Early Access there will be skepticism the 1.0 release is nearly upon us and this will bring not only many bug fixes and new features but new vehicles and a fresh new map as well. I can only imagine how this will factor into making this game a much more solid polished and refined experience in the not too distant future. If you are looking for a last man standing shooter that has seemingly endless replayability with constant updates and additions I couldn't recommend this game more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-10,1,3,207,False,Not Recommended,The initial phase of the hype has been long over and the grim truth of reality has finally set in. The game with so much potential was wantonly wasted through poor patching lack of attention to the community and the most ridiculous micro trasnactions and premium passes. I had this game ever since it was available on Steam and here are the huge red lights I had for this game that at this point I don't even know why I am even playing this game. 1. Erangel was still riddled with bugs a few months into release. There were so many moments where I would die in the most comic ways such as blowing up cars that hit the miniscule objects such as rocks and hills being stuck on doors and falling off of maps proning to heal. And majority of these issues especially vehicles ARE STILL NOT FIXED.2. It takes them almost 6 months to release a new map and the quality of that map to this date is absolutely atrocious. Miramar generally consists of these few places Hacienda del Patron Pecado and San Martin. Rest don't even matter. Los Leones for anyone without a 1060 or RX 580 should prepare to have sub 60 FPS and play a slideshow. For the first few months the entire city was unplayable and even today it's barely better. The rest of the map is a complete joke. There are too sparse item distribution for the players to feel ever sufficient or prepared for combat and the open map ensures that there will be deaths that the player has no proper counterplay. It's the definition of an unenjoyable experience. To make the matters worse they refused to add extra vehicles to the map for ages and even now it's not consistent enough.3. Korean companies such as Nexon have been notorious for micro transactions but Bluehole is sure fighting for that spot with their crate system. While the distribution of the percentages for earning crates is unknown 80% of the crates I have received required a key to open. In games like Battle Royale players always wish to have some form of progression system that distinguishes the experienced veterans to new players. Fortnite achieves this by using their Battle Pass system to grant skins to players who grind the game more than other such as the John Wick or the Max Omega. PUBG doesn't believe in the progression with their crate system and the Premium Pass. To talk about the crate systems the possibility that one gets a good drop even on the paid crates is pitifully low so there isn't even a gaurentee that spending money on the game will grant the player good cosmetics when in Fortnite there is no luck involved in progression whatsoever. The Premium Pass was the nail in the coffin for the attitude of Bluehole for many players since MAJORITY OF THE COOL COSMETICS EXPIRE BY THE END OF THE PREMIUM PASS DURATION. What is the meaning of this? Compeltely disappointed at a game that could have been a major breakthrough but managed to be put six feet under due to lack of management and terrible developers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Only ran into a few cheaters once in a while and you actually had a decent chance at winning if you had the skill. Since the release of 1.0 all you see are Chinese Hackers on this game where they see where you are every time and doing various other cheats. This game is now absolutely horrible.

2017-07-27,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,Can't recommend it at the moment as there are too many things wrong with this game.For starters we have the poor performance. Yes it's an open world game with high render range but even then you have games like The Witcher 3 which not only look better but have a lot more going on at the same time while running much much better.Next the gameplay. This is subjective because I just can't seem to find the 'hook' that catches my interest and to keep me wanting to play the game. I don't like having to run around a huge map looking for loot just to get gunned down by some random player whom you never saw. Just not my cuppa tea.And the bugs.

2017-04-22,0,0,83,True,Recommended,Bought the game hour after it was released on steam and i was very excited!I started it up after a quick download and i noticed that the starting screen was a bit laggy but i wasn't worried yet because it was the first time running and there might be something loading in. The menu looks nice and i like that you make a group easy and edit your character.i checked the settings and it was on high for me (Not sure if that changes if you have beter specs that it would recommend ultra).First time playing! It was one laggy experience and i didn't really know what was happening so now i started to get a bit worried buildings wouldn't load and i could barely walk around but after a few minutes it would load the map a little bit more and it started to get a little bit better but still with huge framedrops.To be honest i wanted to return the game to steam because i was just unable to play not even thinking of competing with other players about life or death. I stopped playing and was just waiting to see if there would be an update/patch soon and it came! After the latest update they did not only make the game able to play for me without any form of freezing and framedrops but they also added new content now me and my friends can finally play the game (we have the same specs in our pc's).Now i am really excited to see where the game goes and how it will run after a few more updates the gameplay is really great and i love that they put it on unreal engine 4 it looks really nice and the fact that you get ''knocked out'' and if you don't get killed while you're in the downed state your friend might be able to pick you up ) you can still crawl around.After all i'm glad that i didn't return the game to steam and i will stay following and playing this game.Really nice job!Sven.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Whilst there is great value and fun for a squad or duo of friend/s the game itself can become quite boring. The repeated feeling of looting for 30 minutes to realise you havnt seen any other players which is astonishing considering there is 100 players on the map turns into quickly realising youve been shot from players who are camping in the ""Blue Circle."" Rinse and Repeat. But hence that is the game. There isnt a better feeling in any game right now of when you find a kar98k fully deck it out Im talking 8x with bullet loops and silencer to be ""clickin heads"" all over the map. Every gun has its own feel which i personally think is the reason the cod games have died. It takes a certain amount of skill to get kills rather then bunny hop/strafe jumping and spraying off the hip to get a +15 (Promod cod4 can i get an amen).All in all the game is fun and is worth the purchase.

2017-08-11,1,3,232,True,Recommended,This game is good cuz if ur friends are good then u can win but if ur friends are bad than dont play alot with them so u win more ok? good. first step to playing blayerpunknows gattlebrounds is that u have to win. the way to win is to make sure you are the last alive. to do this instead of killing other players u just hide and wait for it to be only u and another. Then you catch them by surprise and then u win. U have t0 loot houses so u can get good guns and meds and armor cuz if u dont then other ppl will get them and u will lose. The only good play is to win so loot and hide and win. u can kill others but its unecessary cuz u will probably get 8 kills but have bad friends so u lose cuz they all die and dont help you. i recommend buying Playerunknowns campgrounds because the shotgun is a 1 shot if ur close and that feels good so u should feel it too. also if u get a airdrop in the game u can get a sniper that 1 headshot ppl and u can win. there are clothes but they do nothing so theres no point in spending real money to get them but people sell stuff for 900$ so u can if u want. In conclusion this is a good game and im proud of everyone who wins. it is better than h1z1 king of the kill because h1z1 has unrealistic cars so u can jump without dying and that is stupid and bad. So buy this game and we can be happy thnx win pls.UPDATE i hav put more hours into the game and won more times so i have more advice for the people who struggle. TIP 1 If u lose to others wen fighting just let other people kill them frst tht way u can have advantage on weakened other people and loot evryoneTIP 2 buy some gud players on ebay and use them to help u winTIP 3 get better at hid nd seakTIP 4 Just play alot nd youll do fineIf you liked this review punch that like button in the face LIKE A BOSSS!!!

The game has so many problems that will never be fixed. The combat will never be smooth ever.March 3 2018 Still can't recommend this game. Everything about it is so arbitrary.The main part of the game is literally the least fun part of the game. The combat is beyond awful it's unbelievably bad. Comat Arms had better hit boxes and hit detection. You'd think that the full release of the game would fix some of the performance issues but Bluehole has actually managed to do the complete opposite. The FPS lag in buildings make the game unplayable at times.Let's weigh the pros and cons for a moment.Pros New map is fun and there's a good selection of weapons.Cons Combat is so so bad. It's laggy and inconsistent and it's just not fun. Looting is literally more fun than actually fighting people. Hit Reg is probably the worst in any game I've ever played. It's so arbitrary. You could shoot a guy 3 times in the head and he could live. It's laughable. Servers and movement are still super laggy despite them releasing 1.0. The FPS lag in some buildings is a joke. It's so so bad. I use a quality HyperX headset but the audio in this game is terrible. It's often impossible to know where shots are coming from. High amount of cheating. Encounter cheaters on a regular basis.This game could be so good but it just isn't. It's like they've put time and resources into every other aspect of the game but the actual combat and servers. It's the worst part of the game.Hopefully Fortnite or another Battle Royale kills pubg.EDIT Shot a guy 3 times with a Kar 98. Twice in the head once in the body walked away completely fine. Awesome.

Shrinking area of combat constantly leads to huge advantages and randomness vs. winning by skill.Bad Amazon Cloud services is not complete issue it's the physical locations of these cloud services in North America. They have no Amazon Cloud locations in Canada or Northern United states the game servers are virtualized and not dedicated and they don't allow for you to setup dedicated to play on. I feel like there is two games of pubg the one's that are close to the cloud server areas and the ones that are not I live in Central canada and the ping times seem (50 80ms)ok to the amazon cloud but I believe there is massive server issues of optimation and virtualization (Dynamic servers do not do well with Virtualization) that really compound with the medium level of lag to make your game feel like your playing 150ms 200ms ping (old school dialup). They try to hide it with interpolation but you can tell by the rubberbanding and no look instant engages (your running after a guy instantly turns and fires at you you don't see it and it's not a cheat it's server code that allows him to look but does not let me know visually that he is looking at me)Sound Creeping and camping You can't walk quielty enough for ppl not to hear you even in a large firefight it leads to the sitting and camping guy having the advantage so you get this hurry up and wait game that happens over and over it's just who can wait the other one out there should be a super low speed walking function that can't be heard from 20 ft away secondly some materials should make it quieter to move through. Your in giant windy field of blowing grass but the guy 30ft to the right can hear your reposition a foot.Right now I do respect the genre and I really want this game to succeed but if they can't get away from the amazon servers and add more servers in a northern environment after selling 4 million copies I can't recommend for now.

2017-10-23,0,0,35,True,Not Recommended,This actually my first review. This game is so terribly bad it actually made me want to write a review. I have a pretty decent high end system and specs that have handled any game I ve thrown at it while on the highest quality settings. PUBG however runs like absolute garbage!! After doing some research and reading other reviews I found that I m not the only one having that problem. This is especially infuriating when 30 seconds into the game you die because the lag is so bad you can t even defend yourself and most of the other players are using cheats or plain trolls so don t give a crap about being a decent player. Use lack of weapons and vehicles to the point which makes the game purely a game of luck instead of skill. You have to get lucky or be able to see the future and land inside where the circle will be hope and pray there s actually weapons there as well or you WILL die trying to get to the circle because there s no vehicles to get you there before the circle kills you or you will die on the way by either someone using a cheat to be invisible or because you have no weapons. With that being said I think this game has HUGE potential and could be one of the best but ONLY if they fix the connection issue. Make weapons and vehicles more readily available and eliminate the people making it no fun for anyone else. As of right now I strongly do NOT recommend spending any money on this game or playing it at all for that matter until some serious changes are made. If you like the battle royal style and haven t played it yet I highly recommend getting Fortnite. It is also early access but for one it is free! Two it actually can be played and runs VERY smooth. Three there is ample supply of weapons and materials to actually be able to play the game for more than 30 seconds. Four the players there are decent humans and play by the rules without cheating like the people in PUBG. That is all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-28,1,3,1604,False,Not Recommended,So as you can see I have put more than 1500 hours in this game. Let me say that originally this game was great yes it had it's bugs and it's hackers but you got to play on a map you enjoyed. The games were more evenly matched than they are now and you generally had a good time playing. Fast forward to June 2018. This is no longer the case. After taking out map selection the game quickly went downhill as their continued push to force people on miramar increased. Not only did this cause them to lose a good number of their players they didnt seem to catch onto why people were leaving. Brendan was very vocal in the beginning about his no lootbox policy. This has quickly changed as the game now has no good clothing options unless you pay more money for this game. The game has become a money grab for Bluehole and will likely die out due to a company who does not listen to it's community while at the same time adding more and more lootboxes. The games gunplay mechanics are wonderful. Unfortunately due to its management's lack of interest in the cause of it's declining daily player base this game will die. They have shaped the game towards new players and getting as much money from them in the first couple months as they can before they end up leaving. This game has its moments but as I and my squad continued to try and get on Erangel in our 14th game attempt we decided to uninstall and leave it for good. Bluehole will likely go bankrupt due to its lack of quality management which means that no matter what you do in this game its only a matter of time before the servers shut down and we lose all out virtual crap. Bluehole is seeming more like poohole. Thanks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Addicting. The cars isn't suck. Being a camper is fun (i love camping). The gun isn't suck (i have a bad aim on cod/bf but i can kill more than 5 person). This game is like hunger games but with no magic. The swimming is suck (too slow 2 times death cause swimming too slow). Autism people on the plane who screaming like 90 00's metal band. Unreal engine is to heavy to run on my pc. (i play on very low setting except view distance is very high). I hate when rains come i cant hear the footstep.

This game is a solid game that forces you to learn quickly. It has a steep learning curve for beginners who have never played any sort of Battly Royale type game before. At first it is super frusterating since there are sooo many people who have many more hours into the game. But the key to this game is to practice. I Havent had any server lag issues as of yet. My complaints Bugs such as your parachute catching the side of a building oddly dropping a couple of feet and losing half of your health. Playing on a NA server and getting non english speaking squad mates . UPDATE 3/31/2018 While I'm currently 101 hours into PUBG and I still suck very much. What is happening? You do an update on something worthless and the you cant even access the lobby for hours. When you do your character is #unkown. STOP with the weapon skins emotes events.

2018-01-02,0,0,191,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Terrible game. Nothing works need to use third party programs to tweak visuals so you can see people. If you don't use them you're at a disadvantage. Same with audio. Need to tweak settings to ACTUALLY hear EVERYONES footsteps not just a few random people (You can always hear your teammates 100% of the time walking. Other people sometimes you can sometimes you can't). They band aid fixed rubberbanding by increasing everyones latency by 200 which makes hit reg horribly rng.In 3rd person on NA servers you get about 16 hackers every round. We're talking full esp wall hacking headshotting spinning 360 headshot from 500m out without scoping with a pistol without scoping or adsing. They can choose to set where the circle ends or choose just to know where the end circle will be. They can instantly use meds without the channel time they don't need to wait for boosters (Energy drinks Pain Pills) to heal. Usually a booster heals over time slowly. They use speed hacks jump hacks teleports.The maker of the game says he will not attempt to curb the rampant Chinese hacks because it would be racist as not all Chinese hack. It would also reduce game sales and player count if he did.After all that when you do try to shoot someone that isn't hacking that you see and that doesn't see you they're hard to hit because you have 200+ ping and they have who knows how much cause 60% of the population playing is Chinese and have ???+ ping to the server. They can kill you without you ever seeing them aim at you or stop moving. On their screen they stopped and crouched and popped you in the head/chest 5 times and then reloaded and carried on. While you were standing there like a dumbass whiffing shots at where you THINK you saw them. And thats if they're not hacking.Not to mention the tick rate on the servers is bad as well which makes the game even more sensitive to higher pings.If you do find someone thats not in your group from NA playing on NA you group up and try to kill the hackers that are remaining in the round cause you're in the top 10 somehow.My friend bought this game for me and I want his money back.

2017-06-27,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Before I start off this review isn't fully negative. Honestly would give this a 50/50 recommendation but (for now) I'll have to give it a thumbs down until I see improvement.I found this game to be pretty fun especially with friends. I have no experience with other battle royale games like DayZ or H1Z1 but from what I've played the game it's mechanics and in general was just a fun game to hop into and see what sorts of you can get yourself into. The game is very hop in hop out if you loose/die with no penalty aside from maybe a hurt ego or disappointment.The game offers only one map which the plane flies over on a different trajectory each time meaning you'll most likely not land in the same places. I found each new game/round to be unique to it's last with some rounds being action packed intense fun to slow (and sometimes boring) ""waiting for stuff to happen"". Each new game was pretty diverse. ...Now onto the bad of the game.The game isn't well optimized which can make even decent pc's struggle to keep a steady fps. Certain mechanics or actions (I found) lag spiked my character and this overall poor optimization is biting at me since if the game wasn't poorly optimized I'd probably be really enjoying myself.Aside from fps issues there's also some audio static/stuttering with certain sounds vehicles and even gunshots with just detract to the rest of the experience as well. The game is still in early access (and people are quick to jump to that defense) but these days I have trouble accepting it as a plausible excuse as things such as general optimization should be fleshed out before a game is released to the public.All that being said Some people have reported having little to no fps or sound issues and the developers seem to be constantly updating/patching the game so only time will tell where this game will end up. As a final verdict I say hold off for now at least until they fix all their major optimization issues. However if you have the money to spend and the game does interest you then I suggest buying it trying it out (to see how it performs with your rig) and then decide to return or keep it based on your experience on it.tldr The game can be fun (especially with friends) but it's constantly being contested with it's poor optimization.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-29,1,3,8,False,Recommended,"I get hyped to play some pubg. Try to land on a house. Parachute is stuck as my feet dangle over the flat roof bearing a mini 14. I cut away my parachute hoping to hold the marvelous semi rifle in my hand. Suddenly my life flashed before my eyes as I soar past the roof after being teleported 30 seconds into the past without a parachute hitting the ground. I emit a pained moan yet I lost not health and I'm standing upright. Trying to move forward but I'm stuck. My chest hits the ground as I look down at my ankles broken in 15 places my healthbar flashing red. Atleast there is no beeping alarm sound for that I think. I move up to the door ever so slightly annoyed as two broken keyboard lie next to me on the ground. My hand reaches for the door. It doesnt open. use use use The door finally moves. It's in a quantum position. I can see inside yet I can't move inside. I'm flabbergasted gasping out ""schrödinger why have you failed me.."" under my breath. Like a usb I use the door two more times to ensure it's finally right despite there only being two options. I can finally enter looking around on the bottom floor. Suddenly I hear footsteps feeling like I'm in jurassic park I run to the gun infront of me. A revolver with 15 bullets. Amazing. I pick it up and start reloading only to see the ammo appearing in my pocket 5 seconds after I grabbed it. My revolver fits an incredible amount of 10 bullets before I decide to stop. The steps are really close and I'm almost positive he didn't hear my mariachi band of metal clanking bullets. Coming to think of it where did they come from? The revolver was empty and I didn't drop anything. A foot appears in the door my senses come back to the important part the danger the enemy. I can see his barrel and his foot in the doorway waiting for him to enter my line of sight more before I start shooting. He's unarmored! What a miracle I might just win this! I think to myself shooting him in the head. The bullet hits him right in the face as blood splatters from his leg. Suddenly he shoots back towards the stairs. Yes he's not even shooting at me! I think catching some pellets in my face. Barely alive at 10 hp after he shot at me without even looking at me which is quite rude to be honest I make my last resort to running back to the room I found my weapon in. The door is still open so I can finally leave. He wont be able to get me out there with just a shotgun! Running for the kitchen I make it as he only just enters the room shooting as I'm already behind the wall. I'm safe! Let's just get out of her Killed by ngrf4gt with Shotgun. Better luck next time.

2018-01-02,1,3,381,False,Not Recommended,Game's dead by the end of 2018 latest and let me tell you why.Edit It's been a while since I wrote this review. Now in March 2018 the game has lost the monopole of a good BR game with Fortnite Early Access on the other side. I can clearly recommend to anyone who wants to play a rather tilt free chilling and fun game Get Fortnite first. If you like it MAYBE try out PUBG. If you dont like Fortnite MAYBE as well try out PUBG. Games are totally different from the way you have to play them to actually win Fortnite is a lot more fast paced wild and hectic compared to a rather slow gameplay in PUBG. PUBG has a rather more realistic setting (can't say PUBG is realistic but in comparison to Fortnite this is da real stuff) but as well a slower movement mechanic. Fortnite offers the feature of creating cover right when you need while in PUBG you are caught in the open when caught in the open. So you are forced to think about your next step next move or next shot a bit. Might be a game for some high level tacticians who are calculating every possibility and then decide where to go and what to do. Yet problems I mentioned in the review are still there are still relevant to me. The issue with the community is something you hope to have it resolve itself but I think it has become less cancerous nowadays. Anyway read below for the shortened version of my review or even lower to read the full review. Thank you. TL DR I've been playing since the closed beta did enjoy it very much even with its bugs. Those were annoying sure but not as annoying as such a huge community with mostly stupid far too young and cheating people. The reasonable good and nice players have become a minority just as in CS GO. A community this big an anti cheat system banning players after they have played 150 hrs+ and a horrible launch are beautiful signs of self destruction. Money has been made the game can die slowly now. First The new map YOU CANT DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO PLAY IT?! Way to open there is no cover no structure no chance to play the game in your style. If you like to go for a slow approach loot and chill you can't. There is not enough loot on the borders of the map or in smaller areas to have a slight chance of reaching even top 20. If you like to rush for kills like an idiot again a loot problem. Luck has always been a factor but on Miramar you need more luck than gamesense or skill to kill others. If you want to have a smooth mixture of going for the kill and staying patient you're either getting gunned down by a rushing dude you've never seen or heard before thanks to so much other noises on this map or your getting sniped from 300 400 1000m. Probably with an AK. Silenced. 8x. The new map has so many flaws you can either chill in a house with a shotgun to win the game or snipe yourself into madness. Once your position is given away you're immediately getting by 3 4 people shooting at you from a fair distance. Seems like fun nah thanks.Second It's been getting worse since I started playing. Every now and then there was a patch or an update older bugs have been fixed (sometimes) and new have occured that made it worse to play gave you worse performance or ended up in some other bullsh*t. The game has crashed frequently since then it still does way too often for a launched game and it always will crash. The Patch Support is there yea. But it's like not supporting that much sadly. A little Gameplay Side Note So when having a brainstorm on other negative aspects I noticed that the gameplay totally suffered over time. The decision to make a spray pattern completely unpredictable was so weird in the first place and made rifles right from the start a nice yet weak option. But implementing Marksmen Rifles (SKS Mini 14 ...) made Rifles so irrelevant. You won't need a rifle to win the game you could aswell go with a marksmen and a pistol/SMG. The marksmen can deal anything 10m+ everything below is pistol job. You can spray yourself into oblivion with any Marksmen as they have way too much ammo in a mag and a natural high damage output. Don't get me wrong the Marksmen have to be this way. They are fine but rifles have become to weak to be valuable nowadays. You need way too much time and effort to fully equip your rifle they are inaccurate and have flaws from 100m+ all this making them irrelevant on the new map Miramar. Lastly The community has gone down to the wire dear guys. Or has it? I have been experiencing so many far too young players far too stupid and far too lucky players lately. Surely there are still many nice people out there but the pure mass of players streamers fans and haters and therefore as well cheaters has made this game AIDS. And being killed by a lucky HS getting screamers and squeakers in the plane and those people screaming like they're getting bitten by a million snakes in the ballsack is... no words... (YES there is a mute function NO I am often playing duo or squad alone and therefore need to hear random teams talking) Let's have a quick mindgame (I'm making up numbers based on experience and for the cause but they are actually close to reality) In average you're getting contact with about 10 people in one single SOLO Q game out of 100. You've been playing a lot lately and now you're taking results this is where the fun part starts assuming you haven't made contact with anyone twice and have had every single player each once in your lobby. This will result in having played against 100% of all players but only having made contact with about 10% of them having died to only 1 % of all players. So no matter what's your experience with ingame community is it's wrong. I'm therefore wrong as well but the amount of times you believe to have been killed by a cheater seems to be so high. At least it's been for me this way this is just a personal non fact opinion. Whoever read until here thanks a lot I appreciate you withstanding my long and painful view to the great game it has been once. Right now I can not really recommend to buy it but if you're starting the game now you might make different experiences than I did. I'm pre caught by the time in the closed beta might be influential yet reasonable. I will still continue to play it every once in while and when the fun kicks back in I'll have this review edited.

2017-10-26,0,0,2025,True,Not Recommended,So this game has many ups and downs. I would first like to start by saying if you enjoy Arma 3 Battleroyale you will most likely not like this game. It completely lacks realism things like bullet penetration bullet damage bullet ballistics armor deterioration and pretty much everything else that was good with A3BR is brutally skewed in this game. That being said the more cartoonish nature of this game does make it much more accessible to the average player than A3BR. Beyond that this game is quite bad and I say this having logged many hours. Hit detection is awful lag is constant (regardless of the server you choose) hackers run wild with aimbots and vehicles can be completely unpredictable. It could be possible to enjoy the game if this is was your first swing at a battleroyale style game but for anyone that is expecting a rewarding experience I would advise to look elsewhere. Hopefully Bluehole can fix a lot of the bugs before they release the game but even with flawless performance this game would be medicore at best.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-13,0,0,342,False,Not Recommended,I love pubg however there are a few critical things that need addressing.First of all there's the Chinese problem. And no I'm not being racist but it is severely impacting every mode of gameplay.Solo You see ping abusing in multiple games with not great netcode. Most of them however fix that issue by either region locking or otherwise. It has been getting increasingly frustrating landing muiltiple point blank shotgun shots and then getting taken out by a pistol.Hacking is also a major issue. It's reported that 99% of pubg hacks come out of China and that is extremely noticable even in NA servers.When asked about region locking the brain dead dev playerunknown said he wasn't going to promote xenophobia in the form of region locking Chinese players to AS servers. This is a joke.In duos and squads it's also an issue. Although this one is preventable by joining pubg LFG discords sometimes you just want to play squads or duos from the games. 90% of the times I've chose to do so my entire squad only spoke Chinese. Given that communication is the major aspect of the team gamemodes it destroys the experience.My second and major gripe with the game is the stupid map. How difficult is it to implement a preferred map setting? Miramar (Desert) has a much higher play percentage which means that it takes upwards of 10 Miramar games to find one Eringale one. This leads to players getting burnt out of the new map and stop playing due to it. This includes me. I had to join and leave 13 Miramar games just to get one on Eringale earlier today. I joined the game and got killed almost instantly by someone very suspicious. Hopefully Bluehole can actually listen to the community as games like Rainbow 6 and the battlefield franchise has done or their game is going to go all the way down the deep end and sit with H1Z1 as bigger better BR's come out.I will not be playing this game until these problems are addressed and frankly I won't recommend it either.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-08,0,0,275,False,Not Recommended,Most of the game's early access problems have been solved except one Mass cheating and server hopping by Chineese players. For whatever reason Chineese players choose to play on NA servers and teamkilling any non chineese squadmates. They also make up the vast majority of Cheaters. The fact that cheating is so widespread like this is ridicoulous. When players asked for a region lock (a very reasonable request) the devoloper responded by calling us racist. At the very least they should be forced to play on their own server. If not for this problem the game would be Alright. But this problem is really ruining the game for me and thousands of other players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-21,0,0,227,True,Recommended,I had been avoiding this game like it was ebola but a friend convinced me to buy it and it is a really good game.You dont need to run it on a god tier PC and you dont have to play on very high quality. I play on low and the game is still good looking fun and enjoyable.There are some good sides and some bad sides The pistols are not great but they are meant to hold you over till you find a real gun so I get it. I know some people have had issues rendering buildings but recently they seem to be fixed. Parachuting long distances takes practice but if it did not then I think there would be a big problem. It's not that hard to get a Chicken Dinner you just need to play smart even if you are poor at aiming. It's over all a good game with good hitboxes and fair aim mechanics the devs have stated they will never implement spray patterns like CS GO. This means engagments do not always favor the guy with 1 000 hours in the game the one who knows ever spray pattern and can hit you while jumping backwards and smoking a joint since he practiced. It's not that hard to get good at the game and learn the usefull game sense mechanics that can help you win. As of late October and the majority of November the servers have been under a large amount of stress and a heavy load. I find that some times the servers are a bit laggy and other times they are fine.Bluehole did an amazing job with the game it keeps getting updated all the time and the devs plan on supporting the game after it is fully released out of early access later in 2017.Over all my experiance with it has been good I would rate it 9/10.

2017-03-24,0,0,364,True,Not Recommended,This game... This game here... It's okay but has many issues... It is like a family member or friend who has some issues metally either that be literal or figuratively. Now you want to hate them but you can't because that would be wrong you either know that person has potential or you know they have a better side to them and that is exactly how this game is. Let me make a list of all things wrong with PLAYERUNKOWNS BATTLEGROUNDS. 1. Server Latency issues... At the start of every game I always get lagged back and forth running into things and getting killed this even sometimes happens a little later on in the game. 2. Client Side BS. You will die a lot 95% of said deaths will be when you jump behind cover while in combat and even though on your screen you are behind cover to them you are not and yes it is very annoying. 3. Camera controll and bugs. Many times I run into a choppy camera or a camera that goes into my characters head while aiming down in third person which has proved to be my downfall... 4. Content Now there is lots of content but little verity in play area so the game gets very repetitive at times and makes it feel like a drag to play. 5. Gun play is good but bad now I am saying its little BS that gets you killed like when switching over to the left side camera your left hand does not hold the gun so you end up shooting a wall and not the Jack in front of you this is more annoying then it sounds... This game is both amazing and trash I would wait to get it as I have faith in the Devs to improve the game over the early access time it is not a product worth $30 at the moment please people wait for a more improved better game before buying this golden trash.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-13,0,0,638,True,Recommended,One of my most played games and it's still in early acess. The concept is simple you jump out of a plane and chose which area of the map you want to parachute to. Once you hit the ground it's everyman and his dog for themselves. The aim is to survive as long as possible and become the last to survive or become the last team to survive. As the game progresses the map will spawn kill zones aka the blue zone being outside these zones will damage you. So make sure you run like Usain bolt or atleast run like Mo Farah as you try and run and gun your way through this game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-03,0,0,100,True,Not Recommended,The game itself is great! It's a lot of fun when everything works out the way you want it to (i.e not randomly getting oneshotted in the face from 200 meters away). However the game is faced with a disgustingly huge issue optimization. This game runs like complete garbage on my $650+ gaming rig. The game is plagued by frame dips and pushes an undesirable framerate even at the lowest settings. PUBG is extremely buggy as well. Some of these bugs are hilarious but there are some that are legitimately game breaking bugs in the game that anger me beyond belief. The most significant of which is the game's failure to load in textures for the first 30 seconds to a minute and a half of game time. The buildings are inaccessible due to this which causes gearing up to be absolutely impossible. Opponenents who spawned near you can of course pick up weapons and then kill you. The only option is to land in aspot with little loot and just wait the full minute and however many seconds until you can grab scraps. It's dismal the bugs need to be fixed and the game needs to be optimized or I'm going to be done with it. Now the good new is the game is only in early access which means that the game is probably going to be cleaned up within a few months for the official release. I dearly hope this is the case and the developers keep at it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I honestly suck 4 times I have been in the Top 10 once I was no 2nd place usually I make it to the last third and get murdered from somewhere. And still this game has a certain genius feel.Why? You live for these moments in a game where you do the same you usually get from someone far superior. Like driving over someone with a UAZ how has really good equiment but can't manage to shoot you out from the car. Of camping on a balcony and wait until somone is in the adjacent room looks out of the window does not see you (but you can because of 3rd person) he turns and gets killed by you. Or you and some other poor guy drop in the same group of buildings you find a gun first and hunt him down.My amateur tips for beginners Ignore the crossbow. Seriously.Car physics are a recipy for desaster motorcycles in particular.But great for getting in the zone from a bad choosen spot. Motorcycles are fast and loose control even faster.Air drops are usually cleaned out by someone who gets there with a fast vehicle and the camps it to kill anyone silly enough to think one minute after it touches ground you might have a chance getting there first. Yeah right.Inhouse fights are usually won with the mirco Uzi the UMP or a double barred shotgun. Just dont miss the shotgun.While you aim down the scope or iron sight with the same button you sprint (usually shift) you hold your breath to aim better. In the heat of battle I usually forget.Grenades suck. they take long to draw aim and throw. maybe if you throw it in a room with a camper you can manage some worth.All in all a sick genius game where you are drawn back to without any rational reason. You try to win you die to someone superior BUT once I a while you smile.And yes this game gives out adrenaline like candy. I only played ""singleplayer"". Maybe someone will read this and invite me to a clan or unit to play duo or team. I suck and will go now to get killed. 5/7 Would buy again!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm sure they could still limit how many you get by requiring the winning points still to get the crates and just give the keys for the low low price of $0.00.For this reason I'm jumping on the hater bandwagon and downvoting.

2017-08-25,0,0,57,True,Recommended,"It's pretty good.I'll recommend it because it's fun at times but other times it can be downright boring. There's heaps of potential here. The mechanics and concept are pretty simplistic in nature though they can be a little annoying to grasp and the game isn't very friendly for new players especially solo and I don't mean that as in the community isn't very friendly (I play solo with voice turned off so I wouldn't know) I mean the game itself isn't very friendly to newer players.While the mechanics are simple the learning curve is steap due to the the fact that you have to learn everything on the fly and since there's no ranking system no levels to earn or anything like that you find yourself in massive matches with players far more experienced than yourself. It's only a slight negative really but it does make it a bit of a chore to learn.One of the issues I have that is basically the only major issue from my point of view is the way the play area works. Every so often the game will reduce the play area this area keeps getting smaller and you have alimited amount of time to get yourself to that play area or you'll end up taking damage and if you're too far away that damage will eventually kill you. This in itself is a really awesome system I love the idea of such a large map that continues to funnel players in to smaller areas so the action is pushed in one direction BUT the annoying part is you don't know where the first play area is going to be located until a minute or so after you land.I personally think that the very first play area needs to be marked before you eject from the plane at the start of each round. I can't tell you how many times as a new player I have been caught of guard by a play area located ages away from my selected drop zone with no vehicle in sight leaving me to have to run toward it often being so far away that I die before I get there. They give you a beefy amount of time to make it there but sometimes you just get bad luck and all hope is lost before the game can even get going for you.When this happens it just sucks the fun out of it and turns from this really amazing battleground battle royale shooter to a sprinting through the woods type simulator that ultimately ends in your death because you're way too far away. If the first play area was marked on the map before you eject this would not be an issue and you'd be jumping straight in to the action from the word go rather than feel lost. Something that is the absoloute worst is being sniped. It happens quite frequently where you will spend 90% of your game traveling from one spot to another without encountering an enemy only to reach your destination and be picked off by a guy who was lucky enough to select the correct area from the start of the game and has been there getting set up he has his weapons his gear and he's all cosy just waiting for people to stroll in you've only just got there so you have no idea the guy even exists until he pops a shot at you and then it's all over and it feels like you just wasted your time.It's just not fun to run around for ten minutes and get taken out by somebody you can't even see and cane barely even hear their gun shot they are so far away.The game is something that could cater to a numerous amount of play styles but with the things mentioned above you're only real option is to hop in to the first major town the plane goes over so you're get at least some action.One thing I do love is that they have a first person perspective (FPP) only mode where all players have the first person viewpoint. I'm not a fan of third person multiplayer and while the option is there to use either third or first in a regular game you'd be at a HUGE disadvantage using first person as the enemy will be able to tilt their camera to look over walls and through doors while you won't be able so I'm glad they have a first person exclusive mode.The reward system isn't very rewarding. Basically the way it works is that you compete earn BP (The in game currency) and buy cosmetic loot crates with that BP though each time you pruchase a crate the amount goes up so if you can't do good consistantly then you end up having to play a ridiculous amount of rounds in order to buy one chance at one loot roll as each crate will only give you ONE consmetic item and the prices go up to around 7k for a crate to my knowledge which makes it near impossible for the casual crowd to earn these cosmetic goodies at an acceptable rate.On the one hand this is actually pretty genius as people are playing for the simple fact that they enjoy playing. It's not about rewards or having some stupid prestige rank or whatever people just jump in because they are genuinely enjoying the experience but at the same time if you are going to offer up some form of reward then it should be at a level where each player regardless of skill level can earn the rewards consistently. Obviously those of a higher skill will earn these rewards much quicker as it stands now the 'reward' system clearly favours the hardcore and dedicated rather than the people who just want to jump in for a bit of fun from time to time.You can of course part with your real money and purchase these items off of the steam market place but have you seen the prices for these cosmetic items? They are insane.I can reccomend it but just know that it's going to take you a while to get in to it properly and you have to learn absoloutely everything while in the thick of it.While I do enjoy the game I do not agree with the practices of the developers in how they stroke the shafts and ego's of those popular streamers who chose to stream their game. I don't watch these streamers but banning people because they killed a streamer whether it be stream sniping or not is just disguting banning people for ""Harrassment"" because they honked their horn a few times near a streamer is also disgusting giving streamers exclusive rights to create their own custom games is disgusting. The devopers care more about the people who stream this game and those who watch those streams than they do the average player.Also Microtransactions in early access after you've sold one million copies is ridiculous. I also heard (note 'heard' as in I'm not 100% sure if this is true) that when the game launches crates are no longer going to be free which with how they currently work I take that to mean that you will require keys to open all crates and much purchase these keys via real money. Again this is a disgusting practice. You have sold over ten million copies of a $30 game and charge $2.50 per key to open unique crates which even if only a small percentage is buying them you are making a lot on just those keys alone yet you are going to make people spend even more money?",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,"Let me start off by saying that this could be a great game *could* be if only it had been produced by an actual game developer. The general idea is sound and the emotional payoff if you somehow manage to win is great. But it's all spoiled by a chronically awful... well everything else.The game dev(s?) have taken a game engine designed specifically for FPS games (Unreal Engine 4) and somehow miraculously managed to make it the most unsatisfying FPS experience of all time. Bluehole? More like black hole because you'd have to be a collapsed neutron star to suck this much at anything. Like really it must take some next level wizardry to conjure up something this terrible and get away with occupying the top sellers list for so long and very nearly get away with a GotY award. Shame there's no mention in that spellbook of such arcane words as 'netcode' or 'hit detection'.""Walking simulator"" the steam tags say. Well they're not wrong driving? Have fun tripping over a pebble on that perfectly flat looking piece of land doing a barrel roll and killing your entire squad. Combat? You'd have to be some special kind of insane to want to engage in any of that where the melee consists of... well it doesn't and the ""gunplay"" consists of a lucky draw of ""who shall the almighty netcode RNG gods favor today?"".Did your bullet which you saw clearly go through someone's eye and splatter blood everywhere actually hit? Roll a D20 and find out.Are you actually safely behind that wall hiding from the player rubberbanding around like an acid trip gone wrong? Probably not.Did you actually pick up that weapon you already clicked on 4 times? Try again.To all you prospective purchasers I'd suggest you wait for a AAA company to inevitably produce a battle royale game of their own.

So much cheating Hitboxes/hit reg so many times ive shot people in the feet only to find their helmets broken or lost fights entirely after seeing 4 5 blood spurts Game rules are not defined Servers crash or go down on occasion and no not for maintenance just randomly. Happened to me at least 3 times in my 30 or so games Weapon damage seems like a roll of the dice I constantly get killed by a single bullet from AR's or snipers yet whenever i shoot someone it seems to take 4 5 to down i understand that lag and such play a factor but this happens nearly every game i play and is just unacceptable i drew the line after getting one shotted by a kar98 in a moving buggy with a level 3 helmet and full health Vehicle collisions are downright stupid almost always leaving one vehicle untouched whilst sending the other flying to god knows where Spectator mode is broken whilst watching a teamate ads or sometimes just move showing them aiming at a completly different area then they actually are 3rd person viewmode gets very very ""cramped"" so to speak whenever you go inside a building giving the player very poor vision of anything surrounding them switching to first person is even worse as it feels clunky and nonresponsive Optimization. I know its been said over and over but this is a major issue that bluhole is facing nearly every player suffers from it and it is so incredibly frustrating to go from 60 fps on a game like gta 5 on ultra to 30 on pubg on low not only are you sacrificing the looks of the game which tbh are not anything special but you are barely getting anything from it afterwards Helmets. This point is much more a issue that i experience and do not think most of the community will agree but imo the way that helmets should work is that the helmets durability should replace the health of the players head meaning that if taking a headshot with a helmet the helmet gets damaged whilst the player takes very little or no damage from it until the helmet is destroyed pretty much a head pan with durability. i feel as though this can be balanced by lowering the durability of helmets but even with this being said helmets of levels 1 and 2 can only stop 2 3 bullets (in my experience) and this imo is not in any way unfairWith that being said the list is concluded for now. I believe i have addressed most of the problems the community have faced as well as those that i personnaly face whilst playing the game. I am however very dissapointed in bluhole for not fixing these glaring issues yet for goodness sakes its july and i still cant leave the plane without my game freezing. This game has been the top seller on steam since the day it came out making millions whilst being in early access. The only game i have ever seen do this before was the infamous Dayz standalone. Fix these issues bluhole get competant admins we in the community know damn well you have the means the rest is up to you and for s sake dont fall to the same level as Dayz.Edit So i've just recently learned that bluehole have decided to push out their paid cosmetic cases and such in early access before they completed the game. I honestly had hopes for this game but this was the last straw there is no other way to blatantly show how little they care for the community and how much they care for money than this completely taking a on their promise not to do this until the full release. Bluhole has made it clear they are in this for the money they may say the money goes to their charities and tournaments but thats t to date they have sold over 6 million copies at 30 dollars each before the game was even complete. Thats where the money for these tournaments would have come from if bluhole actually gave a and didnt just care about milking the consumers for every penny they could. At this point we should just expect the games development to come to a sudden halt down the line and playerunknown will dissapear just as rocket had did.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Microtransactions were intended to increase the longevity of a games lifetime meanwhile the devs introduce them in its infancy which makes it clear that they are aware that the life is going to die fast and hard and as soon as streamers stop playing the game so is everyone else.Rather than fixing issues and making the game function better or have more replayability they have opted to artificially prolong the game in a way that allows them to put in minimal effort towards completing the game and ride out the popularity till them and the game are forgotten.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you in any way support the gaming industry and dont want it to stagnate because developers can get an easy way out of finishing games,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-05,1,3,1811,False,Recommended,Best game I ve played in years for originality. I know battlerounds isn t the first game to use the battle royale formula but it seems I chose the best executor of the concept. When I first bought battlegrounds I had no expectations. I had around 1 600 hours in CS GO and wanted to play an open world survival game. I read that battlegrounds was more of a shooter than a survival game which at the time wasn t what I wanted. I watched a few videos and read a few reviews detailing the mechanics of the game and thought eh this sounds fun and novel enough to spend $30 on. 600 hours later and I m finally playing my other games (I stopped playing Witcher 3 Divinity Original Sin 2 Prey CSGO). I will probably never play CSGO again as Valve doesn t take care of their hacker problem and I played CSGO since the original game s beta which I installed from a PC Gamer disc sometime around 2000. With Bluehole enforcing a 1.5 million player ban for cheating since PC 1.0 I m hopeful that they will manage their community better than valve ever did. For the most part I find the community in PUBG to be okay. As a comparison CSGO was filled with racism sexism xenophobia and bigotry. It wasn t uncommon for people with white supremacist names to be spewing bigotry. I ve had to team up with a fair number of bigoted players in PUBG but they are easier to deal with because if I don t want to play a match with someone I can back out without a penalty. Also a nazi thrives on stupid people supporting their t inflammatory statements so when they don t have someone backing everything they say and actually have to use reason to argue their argument falls apart. Or you can just make fun of them for being a nazi the choice is yours. As far as trolling goes I ve encountered that only in random squads. Every so often you end up hitting a squad that has two really intentionally annoying players or someone who wants to drive everyone into another squad to be killed. Duos people are pretty cooperative because it s a little awkward to be an aggro when it s just you and your teammate and nobody else to witness the LOLs. I ve met a few solid steam friends through duos.As far as looting goes the game is pretty shallow here. There is no crafting. It s a matter of figuring out which guns work for you finding them and finding your preferred mods. I ve won games with very little loot and I ve lost games level 3d out with suppressors on my AR and sniper rifles. But looting isn t what the game is about really it s about teamwork and working with the terrain to gain an advantage over your enemies. Enemies on the hill behing a house getting shot at by guys you don t see inside of the house? Run up during the firefight and clear the house or wait in ambush for the team to loot the bodies. One thing you learn quick is to not engage everyone you see. You re here to survive not get kills. Let your enemies do the work of killing for you as you have no stake in which team lives and dies in a skirmish. And wounded players are a few bullets less you have to waste.While you may develop favorite places to drop and find yourself in a regular loot cycle where the circles force you to move is what keeps the game dynamic. You may start at the same place in two back to back games but be forced to move in opposite directions for each. When the circle gets small tactical decisions like should we take the house at the center of the circle or the hill at the edge? Become a matter of critical importance. Goddamn it we should ve gone dead center to the house while we had the chance is a pretty commonly used phrase that I cap a failed game with.Gun mechanics there are more realistic weapon ballistics than instaclick games like CSGO (sorry to make the comparison it s just the shooter I have the most experienc with). Understanding bullet velocity/drop and weapon mobility are all important. What you click isn t always what you get. This makes the game more challenging in my opinion and I like it. I m annoyed that maximum foliage isn t a mandatory thing as the game would be so much more interesting if you could hide in the grass. Most players turn it to its mimimum value so hiding in the grass is useless until the final circles.Vaulting can be clunky. I ve vaulted off a 3 story building when I was just trying to jump onto a ledge and landed right down between two enemies I was trying to get the drop on (but not like that) a few times and needless to say that s incredibly frustrating. Anyway go buy the game. If you haven t tried it by the end of 2018 what kind of gamer are you even sweetie?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And now the new map is coming which is great to play on but with it ""Event Pass"" is coming I think it's like Battle Pass from Fortnite . I don't like the idea of that because the game is already pay to play where Fortnite is free to play so it's alright for Fortnite to have a pass for cosmetics .In PUBG it seems like the pass is not only for cosmetics but also likely for the new map. If you wanna buy the game buy it when they fix the fps ping and likely remove the idea of the ""Event Pass""Otherwise the game is great .

2018-09-28,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,This is a fun game if it wasn't so broken. 1. The lobby. I cannot tell you how many times I have had to click restart lobby due to the game not registering that my party has clicked ready up. How this is still an issue is beyond me. That a fully released game which is pushing micro transactions on you and forcing you to buy keys for crates while ignoring performance issues is this broken is unacceptable.2. Desync &amp lag compensation. Read every other negative post. You will hear the same complaint described 500 different ways.3. Hackers. Ever been snap head shotted by another player through a forest where 50 trees are covering any aspect of your hit box but someone can lock onto your head and fire back to back shots with no recoil? Or had a flying car chase you as the hacking group does a Harry Potter drive by? Or been shot from a guy across the map in a closet with a double barrel staring at the wall? This game is infested with hackers. Things have gotten better but it s still frustrating that all this anti cheat client software PUBG comes bundled with isn't working.4. Lack of optimization. I run a pretty beefy rig but the game engine is so poorly put together it can't take advantage of anything. You would think with PUBG using the Unreal Engine 4 a proven game engine that they would be able to make something decent but that is too much to expect.5. Paying for keys for locked crates. Greed. Pure greed on the developer s part to get any money they can out of you.6. Constant stream of cosmetics. This company needs to realign its focus. I understand different departments are at work here but from a community perspective how does pushing more and more micro transactions look when content and QoL patches are sparse and often end up making things worse than they originally were? The game should be stable and optimized before moving onto sucking the community dry of all its money for cosmetic pieces.7. China #1. If there was a game out there that would make you xenophobic against Chinese people this is it. They love to crack games and use any cheats or mods they can to get an unfair advantage over you. Apparently it s a normal thing in their culture. 8. The PUBG v. Epic lawsuit. What even. Do some research. This developer s line of focus is so misconstrued with its priorities. See above points for where the developer does or does not focus its attention. They have a track record of choosing the wrong front to fight on and the fronts that need attention being routinely ignored. Closing This is a good game. The developer had a great foundation and did well on initial success but they have failed to capitalize on that success and are losing its player base essentially PUBG is just riding on their initial success and taking all that momentum and driving it into the ground. Fortnite while similar but radically different has taken a large share of PUBG s player base and when CoD launches later this year with their battle royale I d imagine that another chunk of the player base will move on. This game is slowly dying out granted it while retain its die hard player base but as you can see from user counts from now to this time last year the count has dropped significantly and will continue to do so.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You could possibly add some tense music combined with the amazing sounds that this game can provide. On the other hand it is a game full of bugs glitches and a bad ban system.Moreover replay option should be added so that if we doubt that someone killed us by cheating we could instantly report him and help the developers understand those types of hacks.Furthermore some of the players are really offensive. I dont really like to mute when i play squad because there are people who really enjoy the game and they want to cooperate in order to win.

Its NOT just another survival of the finest the game presents itself with dignity and a fine polish for its early access. NOTE We should all be aware by this point in time of how early access games work when it comes to getting the game set up and running fluidly. I have spent the last 11 years on steam most of my life at this point playing competative shooters. I have played nearly every FPS i could get my hands on from CS series Battlefield Quake Halo TF Americas army The Specialist COD and countless F2P titles. Before I get into talking about the game I have to warn you... The skinny jeens for combat pants is a bit strange to me but with an open mind I continue on!Beside the before mentioned issue I have to be honest with you.

PU BattleGrounds allows for a fair fight starting right out of the gate all 100 players for the match are hauled in on hulking plane. Once you reach land you are free to jump when you see fit. This allows players to instantly go for the spots they enjoy the most. I was never a fan of randomly falling from the sky with little control or awareness of where i was going anyways... The overal gun play is what I have found to be the most enjoyable. Realistic balistics! Bullets drop with time and distance guns must be sighted in for longer shots and you MUST AIM if you wish to not be taken by suprise and controlled my your enemy.The action is heart pumping the sounds are clear and everyone has a fair chance at winning the match.Cosmetics I think PUBG has truly mastered the art of Cosmetics. The clothing options are plenty for a game of this design. We arnt talking about CSGO style crate drops that other games have taken to with a micro market that ruins the economy for the game. For every match you play you are awarded a varied amount of points that go to opening a cosmetic crate completely free and easy to obtain your first few crates will. However finding clothes while running around is easy enough and by the 5th minute of gameplay you should already be clothed and ready for battle!Armor You are allowed ONE helmet Body armor and backpack! In other titles in the genre you would be able to hoard these and use them to replace your hurts. In this case you are only able to have one at a time and you must decided which to take. This makes the overall combat feel much more realistic if you rush into combat you will die... Take it slow and choose your battles!Cars Beware of this you cant jump out of the car at Mock5 and expect to survive! I have seen countless people die due to this and i feel it is completely needed. There was nothing worse then when a player could jump out of the car and shotgun your face off in just a few moments without taking a single bit of damage from the tuck and roll.DO NOT JUMP FROM YOUR CAR! slow down and park behind a tree or something people.Attachments Guns can have countless attachments on them from sight changes and forgrips cheek pads for sniper rifles. Your playstle is your own!Overall I am a HUGE fan for PUBG I have yet to experiance something that I felt altered the Fairplay rules. The community is of course filled with the same class of folk that played all the others. Hateful screaming children with nothing better to do then degrade others.. The community sucks but not at the fault of the game itself... Its the internet boys what else should be expect?If you read this and decide that its the game for you hit me up and we can duo!

2017-04-30,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,I really want to enjoy this game which is why having to give it a negative score saddens me. Most people read the negative comments to find out what exactly is wrong with a game. Below is my list. Movement and combat both feel very floaty. Neither are particularly responsive. There also seems to be a slight latency between the keyboard press and the action. These often make me feel like I died in a situation where I would've been fine in any other game. They're also the reasons why I'll be getting a refund after posting this review. Playing is more frustrating than it is fun. Even a high end PC will struggle to reach proper framerates. It is an early access title but people should be aware of this. If you're playing above 1080p then be prepared to put all the settings to low in turn making the graphics look nothing like in the screenshots or even downright hideous. 30 is too much for a game like this especially in this state. The game shouldn't have been released yet. One can tell that this game will take some time before it is complete. By that time the popularity may have died down and most people may end up just experience this broken and frustrating version.I also have one particular gripe regarding the game mechanics. It's not the only one but early access generally smoothens out these things. Camping is too powerful. Once you have obtained the equipment you need you're better off avoiding other players rather than fighting them. This may be more realistic but I would still make it so that players are rewarded more for their kills.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Play Fortnite instead or get one of those new battle royale games coming out of AAA studios.This game had so much potential all wasted due to the lack of effort from the developers. Where do I even start? PUBG is full of game breaking bugs Chinese hackers and to top it off the devs keep introducing new (not to mention useless) in app transactions. This is the first PC game i've ever played to employ TEMPORARY PREMIUM COSMETICS you pay real money for cosmetics that just expire after a period of time and have to be bought again.The battle pass introduced isn't worth it either. If only the devs could focus on fixing the game there would be some chance of it being able to compete with the rest out there. Textures don't load till a couple of minutes into the game even on hardware running at relatively higher specs. The game physics break hard and often. Cars go flying. Grenades go through walls. Recently there have been server desynch issues as well.Honestly at this point i'm fairly convinced that Blue**** is only trying to milk the game to the last of its moments and has already given up on trying to save/salvage it.

I love the game. its great. it definitely could use improvment but that said it is in beta stage.It is not worth $30 it would be more like $19 but either way its still a very fun game!In terms of looks it has a nice looking map. It looks alot better then h1z1. The concept is exactly the same as h1z1 kotk accept instead of the rotten looking gas it is a electric field which i must say is very nice.It is not as arcady as h1z1. It is more pleasent to play then h1z1. You can mute the voice chat meaning there is no mean trolls or anything which i find makes it a much nicer user experience Motion blur unticked by default DYes there is lag on servers but again its in beta therefor not finished.

2017-05-09,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,I like this game I really do. It's fast enough paced to pick up for an hour (games last 0 25 minutes). Unfortunately all the fun you can have in the game is literally taken away from you at the most annoying times with constant frame drops CTD's and even hard locking (steals cursor alt tab does not work force restart is required).I would be OK with a lot of this but it's a 25 early access game the developer should reconsider his price until the game is more stable.EDIT Returned after 7 months of not touching it after hearing about a new map and Xbox release. I thought that perhaps it was out of early access but no still the same thing. Unoptimized (varies between running perfect for me to barely running at all) buggy unplayable mess that is overhyped simply because every other attempt at a Battle Royale game has been worse. It has no competition therefore it can be just good enough to pass and frankly it is JUST good enough to choose over Arma Battle Royale. This is all it will ever be marginally better than the worse out there.Don't waste 25.

2017-12-06,0,0,23,True,Not Recommended,Oh I haven't written a review for PUB GEE? Well here goes.I can't recommend this game to begin with due to how shoddily the whole thing is put together. I don't tolerate crap and just because I've had a few entertaining experiences with this game it doesn't mean I can just say 'get the game you'll love it'.PUBG is kind of like smoking. People smoke because other people are doing it maybe just as a social kind of thing. Maybe you're one of the outliers and you do it because it 'keeps you calm' or some such but whatever I'm not here to talk about it. This game is like that sort of oddity where a bunch of people are playing this game just because other people are playing this game.I can respect some aspects of the game I'm not gonna say it doesn't have redeeming features having basically copied note for note most if not all of the gunplay elements from ARMA III (a series in which Bohemia Interactive have been attempting to perfect the military simulator) the FPS elements are at least tight and work okay. Hit boxes lag compensation and such are up in the air but considering this is a game that connects 100 different people from who knows where in the world to one server I think you can forgive some of this stuff.However I'm not gonna forgive them for making an Unreal Engine 4.0 game that runs like a complete dog looks like a game from 2004 while it's doing it and punishes you when you turn up the graphics by basically making it harder to see by adding more foliage and such. So you might as well play on the lowest settings anyway even if it looks like crap. Enjoying the scenery after all is pointless in a game like this.My PC sure ain't top of the line anymore I'm running an AMD 7990 (yes the dual GPU card) and an i7 3770k. Not like awful can I can play Doom (2016) on the maximum settings at 60fps. That's sure not amazing and I bet a more modern system might do better but with PUBG wowee on the absolute minimum settings possible I barely get 60fps at all and even then I get spikes of 50 and lower when I guess slightly too much is happening on screen.Let me talk a bit about the experience itself some since that's kind of one of the highlights. It's okay. Most of the time you just sort of doddle along and occasionally you pick off one or two guys by yourself. When you play duos same sort of thing but you'll be fighting more duos and squads. Sometimes maybe you'll be able to take down a couple of duos on your lonesome but squads might be out of your reach. Now once you're playing squads you're really in the serious PMC sort of territory where you have to start playing serious if you want to get anywhere.Winning is random. Sometimes you get great circles! Sometimes you get awful ones and you're hiking across the entire map since of course the game refused to spawn you a vehicle. Sometimes however... you're in a squad with two friends and some guy you got because nobody else was around. Then you just happen to get some great great circles some fantastic gear and all kitted out you go and face the last dozen guys. Maybe you tag a few you don't really lose anyone then all of a sudden you win. It just comes out of nowhere. It might feel good but it'll always be a surprise that first time.The excitement you feel after that first win can never be matched. Yeah and I mean it too you win again it won't feel the same. You'll just be kind of satisfied maybe. By the time you've won a dozen times it won't even mean anything anymore.I understand this game's in early access. Yeah I get it. Maybe if they ever finished the game and made it really great I could give em a nice kind review. But that's not right now so for now I say Stay away from PUBG. It's not really worth your money. If you have to buy the game play some games win a match stop. You'll feel better for it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-24,0,0,847,True,Recommended,PUBG is very promising in that the game itself with its concept/art style/design/gunplay is great. But the server issues bugs and overall optimization are creating a rift between the playerbase and the developers. Bluehole has undoubtedly put together a great battle royale but only in the rough draft form so to speak. They need to focus on polishing what they have instead of creating more roadblocks in front of them (adding new maps guns vehicles clothing). When they create more content while the game is still buggy and laggy they give the perception that they dont care about the overall performance of the game. People have been rating this game negatively because they are impatient with this poor performance and want to fully enjoy this game! Bluehole is not a AAA studio but the time is ticking for PUBG as they have had a large sum of time and resources to get this game to a steady level of performance. If they cant deliver on optimization and server issues the big AAA studios will release their own battle royale crushing this game to where it will be forgotten.

2017-04-17,0,0,682,True,Not Recommended,It's definitely trying to be H1Z1 KotK 2 but it changes quite a few things.It's got a huge map a pretty good weapon variety with a good amount of attachments for each the vehicles are more scattered the hit reg is pretty solid and there is an attempt at some realism. You need to add the attachments to your weapons in your inventory you can lean to peek around corners movement feels a bit realistic and you can blow out the tires on the vehicles. Playing with friends is made better through a ready up feature and also when you're shot you don't die right away so that your friends can revive you.The map is very big so there isn't much time to loot gear and outrun the shrinking boundaries you can often get killed before being able to spot the enemy switching guns can often bug out and leave you with empty hands waiting for it to fix itself and there are long load times when leaving a match.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-26,0,0,509,False,Not Recommended,"Okay so i have been playing for almost 500 hours with little to none beiong AFK and this is my review. To start there are 2 types of ways to play this game A.) You play for thrill of the kills B.) You play to win even if its with 1 kill we'll come back to this later. I first started playing this game un aggresive and landing/running away from anyone I saw. I ended up with a few wins in my first month of playing this way. As I got better I started landing school and got a few kills but would later be killed by a camper. I would be mad but accepted the fact that people played a diffrent way. But playing recently I realized pretty much anytime I die in TPP/FPP it is due to a camper. The 2 gameplays don't mix well and rewards players B for being scared and being ""smart"" as many campers will tell you. When they added war mode I had much fun just killing not worrying about the end result but that was quickly ripped away from us. Talking with the community many people don't enjoy the game and feel like it is an obligation. There are many things this game can fix/add to make the experience enjoyable for everyone but decide to add new maps such as mirmar which is a disgrace to PUBG. Overall there is to much to say about this game and after buying it and playing for so long I would recommend your better off saving your money and just watching Shroud play. Please let me know small or big things that bug you hopefully Player Unknown or BlueHole see this and take all the suggestions to save the sinking ship.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game even shows blood and bullets being emptied. Can someone kindly just explain to me how the actual F...U...C...K am I supposed to have any chance AT ALL if my view shows me actually shooting whereas I basically just die without ever having a chance?It is mind boggling that such differences occur in the same game on an isolated and pre cached server. It is making it absolutely unplayable and totally unfair as I will only have a chance whenever the server dictates it.Adding to that... It is pathetic to see such a big company who have made absolute millions not being able to fix errors. Look at some of the other 15k + negative reviews made recently all pointing to the same thing...Let's add more Cheaters... Oh my dear sweet baby Jesus there are an insane amount of cheaters in this game.

2017-12-27,0,0,407,False,Not Recommended,Edit 2 (9 months after intial review) Every point still stands. Servers are better yes but chinese players are still rampant. Before the increase of tickrate you couldn't really tell if the person was lagging or if it was just pubg being pubg. The increase of tickrate makes it insanely obvious that this game should not be clientsided in hit registry. Playing AGAINST chinese players is now unfun as they're able to hit you after you've been long in cover because hey it has clientside hitreg on their laggy end they could see you still in the open. I understand region locking china would not fix the issue because of VPNs being a thing but maybe match people of equal ping? Make hitreg serverside like CSGO? Lock chinese players to a specific client like CSGO?Edit Another thing to add against buying the game is hackers are now becoming successful in their attempts. Before they might hack at the beginning but near mid game they'd get banned leading to a fun end game. Now they can last the entire match insta downing you from across the map with shotguns. Also you'd thing that playing the game on a weekend on NA servers would up your chances of finding English speakers but no it doesn't matter what time you play the game you'll always get Chinese speakers.Unless you'll enjoy playing solo or have enough friends to play squads or one to play duos with I would not recommend buying this game. Most of the players you get match maked with speak Chinese leading to no communication in a game that really does require it. Unless they add a new client to Chinese speakers to exclude them from invading NA servers (CSGO style) or somehow region lock them out of playing Duos/Squads on NA servers it's not very fun to play. Most English speakers on NA servers tend to not group with randoms for this very reason leading to almost no chance of finding anyone that speaks your language.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-11,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,PLAYERUNKOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a badly made battle royale game which is pretty much the same as the other battle royale games on the market but is even more of a 'sit in a tower with a sniper rifle and wait for people to walk past' simulator than the others (H1Z1 for example).Firstly PUBG is ridiculously overpriced for what it is especially when all of its competition is free to play. PUBG should cost half of what it is now at most if not free as it is still a glitchy mess riddled cheaters and bugs which is also why it shouldn t have been released as a fully completed game the fact that it went out of early access is just so that Bluehole could grab even more money than they already had with such an expensive game. Secondly PUBG s maps are far too big for battle royale as you will play for 30 minutes or so only to get shot in the back of the head by a sniper so can t even see which I find to be extremely frustrating and a massive waste of my time. There isn t really that much more to say about the actual game as it is just spawn and try and kill the other 99 people apart from the fact that the graphics are quite poor considering it was created in 2017 there s nothing that sets it aside from other battle royale games apart from its weapon attachments.Finally Bluehole shouldn t have added micro transactions so early in the game s early access when a game adds micro transactions it just shows how money grabbing that company is and Bluehole isn t an exception especially with the game s ridiculous price as I mentioned earlier. Also the fact that PUBG now dominates the steam market with its mostly worthless skins annoys me as it makes it more difficult to find things that I m looking for.In conclusion PUBG is rip off considering its price and I don t recommend this game for primarily that reason it's also the only game I really regret not getting a refund for.P.S the new map (Sanhook) is ugly and looks amateurishly made it is also just another way for Bluehole to suck in money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-15,0,0,938,True,Recommended,I haven't played that much yet but here's a review for if you're deciding to buy it or not.Upsides Hours of fun gameplay either solo or with squad/duo (Automatch possible). Big map lots of places to find loot and enough places to hide. Not a lot of microtransactions they're only for clothes right now lol. Fairly simple keybinds for gameplay and vehicles (cars motorcycles) Instant matchmaking. Very fun to play with friends. Rewards in crates which you can sell on the market (Currently for about 1$)Downsides Movement/climing can be confusing. Graphic issues such as buildings not rendering I have to turn textures to ultra and the rest to low in order for stuff to render before I land. (60fps overall) Optimization isn't great. Seems boring at first takes time to get used to. You will die a lot. Apperently Developers are banning for exploits and stream sniping which is unfair for an early access game. Looting takes most of the time. Hit Detection isn't perfect.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game should be priced at 14.99 not 26.99 for a game that's far from being finished.Edit So... The game comes out of early access despite the fact that it's still in early access because it still has god awful performance issues cheaters with of course lootcrates and microtransactions being shoved in there. Considering the popularity and the amount of money this game has made you would think that they'd hire top talent to have all of the problems fixed?Nope. Despite the fact that the playerbase wants China region locked to decrease the high level of cheating the main dev's response is pure cringe and illogical its clear that the main goal here is to get as much money as possible whilst the popularity is still high. He calls people who speak out against this xenophobic despite the fact that he's completely unaware that China is NOT like the western world. I'll just leave it at that...This game hasn't gone on sale/been reduced once either.

I played it once which was a whole new experience then again then again game kept changing it's course. It was pretty much fun. Met a lot of people even made some friends from the same city.But still game was incomplete optimization sucks still but for the sake of gameplay me and my friends kept playing this. While the game kept updating on weekly basis it was nowhere near of optimizing gameplay. Not to mention the netcode and desyncs. I kept believing that they would make this game better i used to play this game in high ultra settings with 50 60 fps. Last i play this game(not recently) i couldn't get stable 60 fps on VERY LOW settings. Then i stopped playing this game hoping to return to it in the future when they would get their heads out of their butts and fix this game.But my nephew 14 years old boi played from my account and pc. So few days ago he was playing. And ran up to me says they banned me. I was outraged obviously my neph didn't knew how to cheat teamkill or abuse to get perma banned. I checked forums bunch of people got banned because of their anti cheat malfunction. In the end they unbanned me but i highly doubt i would be ever returning to this game ever.That's my 2 cents on this game if you want to spend your money on this game i would suggest spending it elsewhere hell try free battle royale games.P.S.

A little while back I began to notice the huge influx of chinese invading the EU and NA servers. They enter into our lobbies screech at the top of their little lungs and start ranting about F**king Your Mother. Worse yet they bring over some of the worst forms of hacking humanly possible like wallhacks aimbot speed hacks and recoil hacks. They have no regard for our servers and come into them lagging out of their minds and murdering our people leaving us wondering what happened. They also do not care if they ruin our experience because their servers are some of the worst I have ever played on. Hackers on every game obnoxious chinese screeching that may sound quite hillarious at first gets old when all you hear are a bunch of Asian people screeching out of their minds that china is number one.

The fact that they prioritised monetization over fixing bugs in early access is beyond me especially with the introduction of new bugs that have developed after that update (connection problems and invisible buildings) which I have experienced personally in addition to banning players for using those bugs when it might not be intentional.Also they suck up to famous twitch players by giving them freedom to ban whoever they want. Yes stream sniping is bad sportsmanship but they know the risks of going in to those games and it is hard to enforce this as you don't know who actually might be stream sniping or honking for that matter (everybody honked when that patch came out....) and who's not.

De sync and hackers everywhere. Unplayable most of the time and let's not even talk about the FPS of this game. Most of the time it's dropping a lot especially when you are about to fight someone. Guns also don't work correctly. You can shoot someone multiple times 2 seconds before they see you and they turn around and kill you with an SMG? What happened to all my other bullets that i shot?I did buy the vikendi survivor pass and while it does give some pretty nice cosmetics the missions are way too long and tedious. The thing is most of the time you cannot do that task more than once per game. Sometimes you have to repeat dropping in the same spot 50 times before you can actually achieve something in a mission.Daily missions also expect you to play 6 hours a day to get anywhere most of the time at least. Although i do like the ""progression"" in this game the way to progress is just annoying and not feasable. You need to spend way too much time for something you pay 10$ and have access to for only 2 months.In conclusion fun game if it works right ( which it doesn't most of the time because of ping and desync ).

2017-12-30,1,3,238,False,Not Recommended,"(wall of text TL DR its fun with friends but not worth $30 for being MP only and having awful core optimization/mechanics) I really have to give this game a thumbs down but do be warned that it is after 200+ hours of gameplay. PUBG is hands down the best battle royale game available but the problem comes from core gameplay being unreliable most of the time. If you are looking for something to spend $30 on and get hundreds of hours out of this game is for you. If you are looking for something to be competitive about then this is NOT for you. The main pro of PUBG is that its fun to play with friends and is a good mix of tactical and fun while having relatively short matches and offering a variety of experiences. Everything else is a Con. The optimization is laughable the servers are unstable the hit registration is worse than early CSGO matchmaking and to top it all off its infested with hackers. The game is touted as being ""e sports ready"" (yeah its a meme now but still) while being a game based nearly entirely off of RNG. Get past the bugs and at its core PUBG is still just playing the lottery often times you will be frustrated to have looted entire sections of cities while receiving nothing but low level equipment and no spectacular weapons only to be killed by someone who managed to find a sniper rifle and 4x scope. As a player who enjoys a competitive experience I simply cannot play this game for more than afew hours at a time before becoming annoyed with the nigh impossible situations constantly thrown at me by the game. I also simply cannnot play for more than afew hours at a time because the game will crash or have some other catastrophic bug causing the client to become unresponsive or getting booted from games without the option to rejoin. To conclude its great to play with buds (but thats only because there arent many AAA co op options out there right now) its unoptimized and its basically playing off of the common human gambling addiction to keep you looking for that great loot.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Although it can be slightly entertaining to spectate someone who can instantly heal spin 180 degrees and headshot another player with a Kar 98.Note to devs while banning cheating accounts is a great short term business move (I'm sure you've made millions on cheaters simply repurchasing the game) the actual loyal player base will eventually give up on the game and it will end up like MW2 a game where the competition is only about whose hacks/cheats are better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Physics in the game have absolutely no effort put behind them if you walk down a 10cm ledge it can either throw you 5 metres forward or just kill you. Car mechanics... I dont even want to get into that but ill give it one example you drive into another car one flys 200 metres away the other one glitches under the map. What bothers me the most is the absolutely S**T system that you cant even choose the map you want to play literally what the hell is that. And thats not all the system behind it is so awfully made that you can get the same map 50 times in a row because the devs most likely dont even understand how to make something switch every time a person plays 2 maps is it really that hard to make it 50/50 if you are so incompetent that you cant inplement a system to give players a choice which map they want to play.. Also most selling game of 2k17 or 2k18 i dont know and i dont care the money you have made from it should be enough to develop 50 different games that all work flawlessly but instead you just wh*re the hell out of that money and dont even use it for the game development.

2017-12-17,0,0,262,True,Not Recommended,words can not describe how dissapointed i am in this game. it got so much praise so much respect and so much fkn money yet after all this time the game has been out it is still one of the worst looking most poorly optimised glitchy and hackerfilled games currently on the market. Lets just put all the hype this game has received aside and look at it the way you would and other game.The movement mechanics are pure trash. there are free games that handle movement better. i would prefer csgo level movement mechanics to this an open world game where a small bump can cause you to stop in your tracks then you jump but for some insane reason you cant jump forwards unless you have forward momentum so you jump in place... gta does it better and its literally a joke how bad gta does jumping.The weapon mechanics. Leaning is next to useless bullet drop and weapon kick are so so different from any other game and so unlike anything you can expect that most gunfights consist of constant misses with people squinting with there tounge hanging out there mouth until enough shots hit. you can be a GOD at any other fps/shooter but this game will throw you for a loop everytime. this alone does not ruin the game and if the devs really want to have a weapon system like this then fine while it may not be for me or alot of other people some may enjoy it and in that case all i have to say is that its a little clunky in comparison to just about all AAA titles. It was very frustrating however spending 10 min looting just to potato someone for my whole clip and die for the first 50 hours or so of game time.The servers the optimisation the glitches the crashes and the hackers while being significantly improved since launch are still very obviously present and in my opinion have not been improved nearly enough for a game that is still bringing out entire new maps and weapons and has so much money to spend on making the game worth the hype. Dont be fooled by the statement that there is seperate teams working on fixes and new content both teams are apart of the same company and the talent has been assigned by that company if fixes are slow delegate more staff to the team in charge of it. saying there seperate is not an excuse.in conclusion the game in itself has received so much praise that people including me for the first 200 hours ignore the issues with the game but when you really think about what makes a good shooter game PUBG just does not tick enough boxes. I cant tell you how many times ive thought 'its just because the game is in early access and is new' but it has been long enough and the painful truth is that PUBG just doesnt measure up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-25,0,0,410,True,Not Recommended,"17/11/2017 UPDATE The game is now again riddled with hackers. I recently played 2 games in a row and in both games I was killed by a hacker. The first was speedrunning around the map and autoaiming people's heads the second instantly killed me with an M16 that was firing 4 5x faster than humanly possible I could tell by the sound.TL DR Avoid this game if you are a competitive person. There is too much RNG and too many bugs for anyone to take this game too seriously.As far as I'm concerned this game wont ever get a positive review from me. There are just too many issues that the devs don't care about and instead of fixing them they'd rather add cash boxes to the game to suck more money out of us. Pathetic.My main issues with the game are below 1 There is no real anti hack implementedThere are WAY too many hackers in this game I would say over 10% of the population is using some type of ESP aimbot or antirecoil macro I've had them on my team when I have queued for a group with strangers. It is blatantly obvious because their cursor will immediately move towards the head and they can lead shots on vehicles with insane accuracy. They can headshot someone running up on them that they didn't know was there until half a second earlier. I would honestly say I come across a hacker every 3 4 games. Can be quite annoying being killed by someone who knows where you are without you even moving.(UPDATE 11/7/17) Hackers are still very common now they run around racking up 20+ kills per round with no punishment. The leaderboards is littered with them.2 The developers ban people on the forums for expressing any type of distasteIf you look at other reviews there are quite a few people being banned for stating that there are too many hackers and that it is unacceptable. Seriously devs you're going to ban people from your game because they show interest in seeing it improved? Pathetic. Stop doing this. (I know it might not be all devs but having any devs that do this is unacceptable. Remove them.)3 The game needs to be optimised betterThe game crashes spontaneously even on the best of cards. I've posted threads on the forums and reddit about it and these crashes seem to be affecting everything equally. Running on lower graphics seems to help FPS but not the crash issue.(UPDATE 26/5/17) Performance patch helped a lot but still much to be desired!(UPDATE 4/6/17) Performance is better but crashing is still FAR too common I'm talking 25 50% of games end in an abrupt crash. Also the server's latencys go up and down making for an inconsistent experience.UPDATE 27/7/17They are now adding microtransactions to the game when they promised that would never happen. As far as I'm concerned this game will never receive a positive review from me if the developers want to nickle and dime us.____________________________________________________UPDATE 28/7/17 SummaryAfter over 160 hours played I can safely say that though this game can be addictive and it can be fun I do not recommend it to people based on 4 reasons 1 There are too many hackers and they only get punished when people post video evidence. I have stuff to do I don't have time to find hackers for you Bluehole.2 The game runs alright but often drops down to horrible fps for no apparent reason. (I run a GTX1080 and i7 7700k cpu and I had my fps drop down to 7 during a gunfight for first place. Couldn't aim or even move.3 They are adding microtransactions after explicitly promising not to do this until after Early Access. The excuse is they are ""funding a tournament"" Oh? What happened to the literal 50m+ worth of money you made from sales?4 The game is largely latency based. If someone else is lagging they have an advantage while peaking. They can peak out from a wall shoot you and even if they haven't even appeared yet on your screen you die. You can pump them full of 5 bullets but if on their screen you've already died all the bullets you just hit them with never happened on theirs so they take 0 damage. This basically encourages camping and the game becomes very boring. I've noticed in the 2 months of playing players have slowly become less and less aggressive with people now sitting in buildings for entire games. Can't blame them though the game encourages it with this lousy network coding.5 Too many games end in getting killed by the blue wall due to slightly miscalculating and not being able to outrun it. The blue NEEDS to be outrunnable at all points in the game. I don't care how much damage it does but dying to it has ruined too many awesome moments for me to be okay with it. This is probably my #1 reason for not recommending the game. Dying to the blue is simply not fun. It should be used as a tool to group everyone together not an actual way to die.6 Armour and helmets do absolutely nothing at all. You can get 2 shot KO'd while wearing the best armour in the game. Why did I just spend 20 minutes looking for this gear if it isn't going to protect me? If you want me to spend time looting then MAKE THE ITEMS USEFUL. Multiple times I've been 2 or 3 hit KO'd by an M4 or M16 while at full HP and wearing full level 3 gear. It is very very tilting.7 To add to the reason above attachments do almost nothing. Look up a ""Attachments PUBG Guide"" and you'll see that over half the attachments in the game (which is what you spend the whole game looking for) do almost nothing or literally nothing. Some of them actually make recoil WORSE if you'd believe that. Bluehole you expect us to spend 20 minutes running around looking for items then make the items worthwhile. Right now every game is a waste of time.8 Too many bugs to list. If you've played more than 10 hours of this game you know what it's like to die to a glitch. Vehicles shouldn't be shooting into the sky and jumping out of a car going 2mph shouldn't kill you.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-14,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,"This game is a cool concept but has several huge hurdles to overcome before it's worth the $30 asking price. I'll outline them as best I can. LagThis game is SLOW. Everything but the actual gunplay seems unpolished and awkward. From opening doors to picking up items and even joining a game the input is clunky and unresponsive. This is a huge issue in a fast paced shooter such as PUBG where being able to pick up a pistol after you parachute is the difference between life and death. Expect a half second delay time whenever you press ""f"" to do anything if it even registers that you pressed it at all. Map LoadingTo optimize performance PUBG renders distant objects with less polygons which is a common practice used in games since you're far enough away to not be able to tell the difference anyways. The issue is that in many cases after parachuting down to the ground the high poly models have not loaded yet making every structure ""bloated"" and putting you at a huge disadvantage versus players who have already loaded the models. These low poly models' faces often go OVER loot obfuscating it and forcing you to wander around with your inventory screen up just to tell what's in a particular building. Main MenuThe main menu is a mess. For some reason it takes 40 seconds to load upon startup and after games. I'll admit that they've definitely cut down on menu load time(it used to be much worse) but it's still annoying to have to have an additional minute added to the wait time in between games. The frustration with losing a match can easily be mitigated by hopping right into a new one but this isn't a very streamlined process. If possible I think PUBG ought to work towards putting you in a new match immediately after the death screen but that's probably a long ways away.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Flaws that you ignore at first because of the hype still there after 400 hours. And there were a lot of flaws. They started to fix them. They started to listen to the community but it was too late. They only started to listen to the Com when players started to quit. Before? Everything was ignored. You had the feeling that they wanted to lure out as much money of the players as possible. They would add Crates and Skins all the time. Crates that you could only open with keys which you had to buy. They would add everything to generate more money. But did they care about other things? Things that people complained about? No. I havent played this game in months and lately they changed a lot of things but they did it because people like me were gone. They were forced to do something to not let the game die. And this is why i refuse to comeback to this game or to support it anywhere in the future. Why i write this review? They added a ing BattlePass now something that isnt worth the money. Something to get even more cash out of the players. This is disgusting and i want to warn you do not buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-08,2,3,150,True,Not Recommended,Crashes all the time simple things like titles for settings dont make sense. garbage game deffinetly overhyped. Combat in the game is bad cheaters are everywhere. Super laggy gameplay random fps drops and I can run arma 3 no problem.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-26,0,0,421,False,Recommended,This is a very good game! It's way better than Fortnite in my opinion. People are just giving it bad reviews because they're bad at the game assuming everyone are cheaters or running the game on a potatoe. It runs perfectly fine when you have the right internet and PC specs. Next time when you buy a game make sure you read the requirements for your PC before buying the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-11,0,0,314,True,Not Recommended,Over a year later and this game is still trash. Feels more like an RPG than an FPS. Weapons are extremely unbalanced bullet drop and recoil is over exaggerated which leads me to believe the developers did no prior research before developing this successful joke. For example the fact that a 7.62 round shoots at the same velocity as a airsoft pellot is beyond me. Want some tips? Go straight for the 9mm SMG's as they seem to be much better all around weapons than anything else in the game or any 5.56 rifle for long range shooting. Makes total sense...Netcode is still complete garbage. No consistency ever. Everything is desynced and I feel like I'm literally playing a third party mod of some game except this game has tons of resources and budget at this point to where there's no excuse for these idiot developers to get off their and actually finish the job. I don't expect them to as Player Unknown is already developing his 2nd game. Way to finish the job before starting something. I guess this is what we have to look forward to in the gaming community Lazy idiotic millenial developers producing a game cashing out and refusing to do anything beneficial for the community that bought in to it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,402,False,Not Recommended,"Pre ""ballistic optimization patch"" Fantastic game has a good future ahead of it. Strongly recommend the purchase they have a plan for the game's future the gameplay is fun if a bit laggy and the tactical realism makes the kill and wins sweeter than any game I've ever played. Post ""ballistic optimization patch"" Game is now ruined. Bullet drop off is majorly changed bullets often don't register due to the new recognition system which is supposed to change damaged based on Head/Limb/Torso hits. Exiting a vehicle is instant teleport there's no animation so in combat you have no idea if that's what they're doing until it's too late to reposition. Unless they majorly change this supposed ""ballistic optimization"" this game is not a recommendation from me. Edit Some people are arguing that the new ballistics are in the test servers. Yes they are but they're being deployed to all servers in a mere 6 hours (at the time of writing) and PUBG Corp/Bluehole is turning a blind eye to the garbage the new system is despite being told by players top professional players (Dr. Disrespect Shroud etc.) Bluehole needs to get their crap together or this game is dying mid to late 2018.Some people have told me the devs are working on a fix. I'm going to tell you exactly what this game needs to be fixed 1. Clothes as loot Gone. Make clothes static as part of the buildings not something that gets in the way of getting guns.2. Guarantee some form of weaponry in every building Pans Machetes pistols AR Grenades etc. GUARANTEE. This will make looting a more enjoyable experience as the extensive ""10 minute loot for a 1 second death"" will be virtually gone. 3. Remove shotguns their no aim Instant kill nature ruins the early game4. Increase server reliability. This is a no brainer.5. Add map selection to remove the unenjoyably matches for those who dislike a particular map.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-15,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,It's a good battle royale game honestly and it's fun to play with friends.However I'm giving it a negative review because of it's item shop policy where you spend your earned points on a crate and there is a RANDOM chance you will get a crate that you have to PURCHASE a key to open. I have useless crates sitting in my inventory now taking up space and infuriating me whenever I look at them.Just make keyed crates and non locked crates separate purchase categories.

One hacker in the game and you just waste 20mn and lately there has been a lot of Chinese hackers game often has login and server issue. It is terribly optimised with big frame drops chinese player do not have servers in china so they play NA and AS servers with lots of lag.
