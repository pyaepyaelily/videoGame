2017-06-16,0,0,301,False,Not Recommended,"http //gtaforums.com/topic/889348 openiv/Edit They have since backtracked on this decision. However the reason this happened in the first place still stands GTA Online is deeply infected with the disease of microtransactions. It is filled with increasingly bloated prices for stuff that's really not that worth it while all the missions continue to pay out pathetic amounts in comparison (even the heists hell *especially* the heists considering the time and effort they take). None of this is for a sense of progression or ownership. It is entirely to inconvenience and annoy you so that the microtransactions look ever sweeter. The microtransactions which by the way will not last you very long either. This infection is bad enough that it is seeping into the singleplayer. Even before the major incidents such as the above they have neglected the singleplayer. Constant updates and new (expensive) content for the multiplayer but none of it made its way over to singleplayer. No sign of any expansions or anything for singleplayer. They just threw it out and forgot about it because there's no extra money to be made there. If ever there were a case against microtransactions it is this game. It could have been so much better. It should have been. But corporate greed intervened apparently unhappy with merely being one of the best selling games of all time across 3 releases. Let's just reiterate that last part **they sold this game 3 times over and are still not satisfied with the money they made**. It serves as a sad representation of the ""AAA"" game industry as a whole. So yeah even though I like a whole lot of this game this is staying negative.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,224,False,Recommended,Rough launch with the size being so darn big and the install taking so long for so many to have issues starting the game is disappointing. That said I played this game on the PS3 actually bought a PS3 for this and Red Dead. I was shocked and amazed at how awesome this game was on the PS3. It looked great ran great and once the initial online kinks were worked out it was a blast to play online also. I was excited to try the PC version because I love my PC way more than any console and I was super excited when they decided to release it for this platform. I had one problem after the preload I had freed up about 90 gigs for the install of this game but it ended up using almost 120 during the preload to install process effectively screwing up the install for lack of space. Either way I got it working and since then it has run flawlessly. As soon as I started this game I had a bit of a shock it felt like a whole new game. This game looks so good runs so smoothly Online works well load times are fast and really it blew me away with how it all felt. I do have a couple of issues as of right now First I was really hoping for Animals to hunt in online. Something I've wanted to do for a long time it could be added to this version no doubt I just hope they do. Second they need to work on keeping friends in servers together we had the problem of friends being switched to another server while we were in the same cars and playing together in free mode. Third they need to have an option to move the free camera while driving without it snapping back to the predetermined view.So in all my complaints are very minor. This game is great and you won't regret buying it if you do.,Grand Theft Auto V

I don't really like online tbh too much of a grindfest wich is why i played with mods.However with current evolvements concerning the mods in this game I have no choice but to make sure as many people as possible steer away from this game.Don't get me wrong even though I'm not the biggest fan of online I do know a lot of people who do. But if you want to buy this to play by yourself possibly with mods you'll be dissapointed.For people who do not know why there are all these negative reviews check these videos from ""OfficialNerdCubed"" (Or you know use google)Initial response https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_okFollow up https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 9u_Nw1l4YjQ",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,350,False,Recommended,The singleplayer in this game is most definitely one of the best campaigns to ever come out of a video game. It tells multiple stories that all work together to blend into one amazing and enjoyable experience. The story starts at 100 mph and keeps going at the same speed and even when it does slow down the action it does so with such amazing grace that it's still enjoyable. The story also features so many unique characters that while they aren't all relatable the game definitely finds ways to make you feel for the likable cast. The system of having three protagonists also makes this game a unique one and each protagonist is unique with their own personality problems motivations friends etc. The city of Los Santos is also well designed and varied and is bursting with life at every turn almost like the city itself has its own personality. This awesome campaign is also supported by an amazing soundtrack featuring both original songs as well as licensed songs and even the radio stations add more life to the game as well. The singleplayer of this game never once disappointed me and time and time again I return to play through it again. GTA V is one of the greatest achievements in gaming if not the greatest in this decade. The story is stellar the acting and gameplay is solid the graphics and city are beautiful and the music shines at every moment. This game deserves your 60 dollars just for it's singeplayer campaign aloneAs for the online... Ehh it's enjoyable for the most part as long as you have friends to play with,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-06,0,0,586,False,Recommended,GTA V One of my favorite games of 2015 but with its fair share of flaws Overview In GTA V there's a massive range of things to do in multiplayer and a nice amount of variety in the world you play in. The game also runs well with most of the launch issues having been resolved. However there are several flaws with the game that although not always ruining the experience they certainly hinder it. In terms of the story it seems like a really good experience and having three main characters works quite nicely but I haven't completed it myself so I can't say much about it.However Take Two hates fun. First they make everything in online rediculously expensive so you either need to buy shark cards or get money from mods. Now they've given the OpenIV team a cease and desist order essentially declaring modding GTA as illegal. Update to the modding situation After a discussion between Rockstar and Take Two modding GTA is allowed again as long as it does not impact multiplayer and does not use or import from another IP (such as adding the Red Dead Redemption map to the game). Pros Runs nicely with just occasional FPS drops in grassy areas (running an i5 4690k GTX 1070 16 GB RAM with most setting on max at 1440p and MSAA x2 enabled) Wide variety of things to do online New content is free (although much of it can only be accessed using money from Shark Cards or modded in money) Really good story mode (from what I've played) Looks great Cons Online uses peer to peer meaning if one person lags everyone feels it. This can also completely ruin missions like team deathmatches as if someone is lagging the combat is a complete mess With several people in a session the game becomes very demanding on your internet connection and with some content being exclusive to public sessions you may find that you're unable to play all of the online content if you don't have a high speed internet connection If someone disconnects or their game crashes during a heist tough luck you have to go back into online and start it over again Custom races or jobs must be added from the Social Club website and cannot be added in game Menu and lobby design is very poor you have to go back into singleplayer to start a Private online session and heists can be very frustrating to play forcing to restart if a player disconnects or their game crashes Some content costs absurd amounts of in game money requiring you to spend real money on Shark Cards or getting modded in money FOV in first person mode is very restrictive and any mods to increase it will result in a ban if used in GTA Online,Grand Theft Auto V

I stand with the protest group of other modders against Take Two's idiotic move against Open IV modding./end of editEasily the best entry in the series to date. Memorable and interesting characters along with neat new mechanics such as the special abilities and character swapping. As PC ports go it's mostly a top notch job with a few quirks such as goofy mouse+keyboard controls for a few things. In almost all cases a controller will remain the prefered method of play at least in single player. GTA Online tends to require the more precise aim of the mouse.Few notes of warning though the load times can be pretty intense if not running this on an SSD and there appears to be some sort of memory leak as frame rates will stay 60+ for a few hours then plummet dramatically.,Grand Theft Auto V

Surely it has some flaws but what a rare gem this has proven to be. If you're only going to buy one game in your entire life make sure it's this one. I'm short on superlatives to describe every little detail but believe me when I say there is no better more complete game out there.*** UPDATE ***I've spent about 1000 hours ingame now an estimated 200 hours of single player 400 hours online and 400 hours in loading screens and waiting clouds. Nevertheless I enjoy playing the game and I appreciate the continuing addition of extra content so much I even bought a Shark Card.

If you don't... well.ORIGINAL REVIEW Constant texture pop in/disappearing textures. Constant crashes. Amazing game but no good if it can't actually be played properly.

It is to use the mildest words possible extremely consumer hostile. Especially when you consider the fact the the makers of OpenIV went out of their way to make sure it was mpossible to use their mod with the online portion of the game! As such I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you are only want to play online...I sincerely hope the publishers see the error of their ways and instead opens up the sngle player game for modding perhaps even with Workshop support as a ways to make ammends. If they're smart they see the value of a vibrant modding scene and instead of blocking attempts to expand the game hire the makers of OpenIV to make modding the game easier and better. That way you could expand the life cycle of the game well beyond the expected unmodded lifetime...,Grand Theft Auto V

I run a single gtx 980 and the game runs smoothly at a constant 60fps on very high and ultra settings. There are occasionally fps drops here and there but nothing that would affect gameplay. I had two instances where the game crashed but it was on two different parts instead of the game freezing over and over again on the same part. All in all this game has been a blast so far and the graphics are amazing. Haven't really tested the online yet but will soon! But so far I am really enjoying the single player story. I am sure that patches and updates will be released to address all of the crashing issues so grab this game either now or in the future.

I'm not here to call you guys/gals bad names or anuthing of the sort i just want to bring some problems i have been experiancing with the game. First off the game has crashed 3 times for me for no reason i made sure every driver was up to date and still get this problem my PC can handle this game i have played every game i have on steam and origin with high settings at around 60 67 FPS no problem. Second the game likes to freeze on and off it dosent last to long it will have a moment where lets say within a 30 second time frame it will freeze on and off. Third now this just happened thats why i writing this the game crashed and i loaded the game back up and my saved game from the story line has been damaged and i have to started from the begining i was at 19.8% into the story. Rockstar you have pushed back the release date a couple times which i have no problem with that because you wanted to make the game the best it can be for us PC guys/gals and for the game to have these types of problems after all the delays is inexusable im not off cause i know you guys/gals can fix this but the fact that these problems exist annoyes me after the long wait. i know not everyone has these problems but alot of us do. By now im sure you DEV's have been told all this but just in cause i wanted to (hopefully) let you know other then that the game is beautiful and im still in love with the game and Rockstar.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-18,0,0,866,False,Recommended,Great game overall single player is fun but the story doesnt seem that great in terms of the writing. However everything in this game is well executed and done with a attention to detail that is not found in games now a days.Gta Online is free and doesnt require any payments to be made. It is also very well executed and builds upon the work done by red dead redemption in terms of online play. I've bought this game twice once for ps3 an once for pc. The game is very well supported. however i must warn of a few things. Though the online is free it feels very much like a freemium game. if you wanna buy some of the better content you have to really grind for it for a long time or pay through shark cards. This is the only major drawback i find about the game. That to earn money you must grind as none of the really fun activities pay well. If you wanna play online to just have fun with your friends go right ahead. If you wanna start now an buy amazing stuff. Best of luck its gonna be one hell of a grind.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-18,0,0,288,False,Recommended,"If I were to title this review it would be GTA VIRGINS FIRST TIME!I've never played a GTA game before for two reasons. Outside of Heat and Goodfellas the whole criminal/mafia genre has never done anything for me. Also GTA V is first person or third you can choose. I don't really like third person over the shoulder games. So why start now? The world.I love sandbox games. Let me explore a great big world and blow it up er...interact with it. GTA V has that oh my dear sweet lord does it have that. Los Santos is detailed and huge. No you can't go into every building but you can go on top of every building and under a lot of them too. You can walk from one end to the other if you want though you'll probably be using one of the abundant vehicles from bicycles up to fighter jets. The city is visually beautiful with a wonderful day/night cycle and weather. Sitting up next to the Vinewood (Hollywood) sign looking down at the city you can almost smell the trees and hear Bob Seegar singing Hollywood Nights.Sound and music are very well done from background noise like wind and traffic and 'splosions to the radio and television stations. Theres real music in there but also a whole lot of well done parody. After playing this game for a few hours and then watching t.v. the commercials will jump out at you as the t they are.The NPCs are hilarious in there detailed banter to each other and to you. Even when your stomping there And you will this game is all /about/ ultraviolence. This is what got Rockstar such criticism. That and how woman are portrayed and black folks. I haven't heard the N Word this much since Quentin Tarantino in Pulp Fiction.That brings me to the story line. I didn't come for that but I'm impressed with it. You end up playing three different characters. You don't get to build your own ala a Bethsda game. You start out playing a black dude named Franklin down in da 'hood. Like all things GTA its over the top but theres enough realism to make you believe and have that suspension of disbelief kind of immersion. Later you play Michael a ""retired"" Mafia sort and Trevor who I could have cared less about but I think they were going for a Christopher Walken style psychopath. None of these characters are good people nor should they be in a game like this but I found them sympathetic. They are trying there best in a ed up world that demands they do ed up things simply to make it day to day. Not that such things happen in real life of course.If you want a story its in there and in fact your going to have to play at least some of it to unlock game content but if you just want to cause mayhem you can do a lot of that from the git go. Well you /do/ have to go through the prolouge/intro but after that your left to your own devices. And such lovely devices.Guns rockets grenades boats helicopters tanks and MORE!I have to say I'm enjoying it this is a truly immersive experience Los Santos has been built as a parody of L.A. but with incredible detail and dedication. My only is that I get some small screen tearing even with Vsync on. Well the price is another . They made a BILLION dollahs in three days do they still need to keep the price this high? No no they don't. But I'll pay your admission fee Rockstar and then I'll wring every last bit of fun from your creation! Hollywood is nothing /nothing/ compared to video games these days its a walking talking corpse that hasn't fallen down yet. Most movies with the investment that Rockstar put into GTA V never come close to this kind of sales. Apparently people worldwide want to go to a place where they can go buck crazy with no consequences unlike there real lives where they do what there supposed to.Would I reccomend this? I would its been completely reworked for PC and I haven't even said anything about playing it Online mostly because I don't care about playing it online but from what I've been told its either great fun or dealing with the firey trolls of the world using cheats and feeling smug with keyboard courage. YMMV but I'm not going there.Now go forth and enjoy some truly inspired video violence!System Specs i7 4790K 16 Gigs Crucial RAM 980TI G1",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-25,0,0,253,False,Not Recommended,"Hooooo boy...where to start with this one.GTA V a game I originally bought on PS3 probably would have bought on Xbox One or PS4 and then bought once more on PC is third person (Or first depending on your preference.) sandbox where you cause all sorts of trouble whether on Single Player or Multi Player. The thing is beyond optimized(I could play this game on a GT 530 of all things) and its a game where they put attention to detail making it a grand experience for those with high end PC's. The main expereince however is GTA Online. Now as most you are aware you may see the many negative reviews about hackers in public games which why I consider GTA V a ""Friends Only game"" I feel that the multiplaye can feel a bit intrusive if your constantly going server to server trying to find a game without a hacker and probably gets as bad as Payday 2 trying to join a normal game. If you have friends that play this game play with them the experience if much more pleasant that way.Anyway I'm willing to give a thumbs up for this game sure the way they handle sales is a bit uncomfortable but then I realized Rockstar is one of the ""Console preference type"" of companies that do better on consoles than on PC (They are rather strict on hackers on consoles I recall).If your the type that needs a game to be on sale at a low price to buy I would suggest you at least keep an eye as I believe there was only one sale so far at 40$ so I doubt theres gonna be another sale soon so make sure you wishlist it and get that email cause it seems the price drop will probably be as odd as Day Z or Company of Heroes 2.UPDATE Due to the whole modding controversy I have decided to give this game a negative review.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,282,False,Not Recommended,It used to be a good game but their recent move on stopping people from modding the game is very bad!Modding gives games longevity it gives people freedom to create their own things and make their own things. A lot of the created content like cool photos and machinimas have been done with mods. I think Rockstar themselves have shared and praised some of this fan content that was made with the help of mods. I really hope they change their stance on this and give the modding community their freedom back.Other notes if you don't care about modding Single Player story is OK but nowhere near as good as the previous games. Online can be fun if played with friends but the cost of everything is ridiculously high (they're obviously trying to get people to buy Shark Cards with real money.) Hackers have been a problem since launch and Rockstar don't seem to care. If you're playing online expect to get teleported to random locations and killed a lot by random things. Loading times have also been a large issue of the game. They have improved slightly since launch but they have always been and still are a big problem for a LOT of people. Sometimes it just takes long sometimes you get stuck and sometimes it randomly kicks you from a server into single player.,Grand Theft Auto V

Highly recommended by me.Online is best played with alot of friends.

Basically threatening a lawsuit should the Open IV development team not comply. This was because Open IV allegedly allowed for the multiplayer form of GTA V GTA Online to be modded causing unfair experiences for the players in the session. These allegations are inherently incorrect as the Open IV development team did everything in their ability to prohibit users of the program from entering a GTA Online session.Take Two's actions have crippled the GTA V modding scene and Take Two's own relations with the PC community as a whole.

But even with a mod like GTA V Redux you can't miss the blind ignorance that is Rockstar They don't listen to their community at all and this game is optimized to run well but not look good. The shadow draw distance is garbage. Shadow quality is garbage. Shadows are a massive issue. If they're not for you then please help me before I light myself on fire.On a more pleasant note the story gameplay etc is all amazing. GTA V is a masterpiece. EDIT I remember having a ton of issues with shadows and still kinda do. I tried to use mods to fix it but now mods are illegal? Are you serious?

2015-05-13,0,0,112,False,Recommended,EDIT2 After Take Two &amp Rockstar going back on their war against Open IV and OpenIV re addding their download link I have reversed my previous reversal to a positive review.EDIT Removal of the modding community from the game is painfully stupid and/or greedy. I've changed my review to not recommend.GTAV is the best non mmo open world game of all time. Better than Red Dead Redemption better than Skyrim and better than Fallout 3.While story isn't great it's good enough. The characters are great though no question. All of the main characters (and most side characters) are very memorable.The open world isn't filled with boring repetitive nonsense like most open world games these days. It feels populated has character and its different areas feel very distinct. The side missions a lot of the times introduce you with interesting characters.On PC it's not the best looking game but it does have some great looking parts to it. The draw distance can be incredible with the right PC and the lightning/shadows are very well done. The textures and character models are unexceptional but sufficient (it's no Crysis 3).I played all of the game on foot in first person and the shooting wasn't perfect but pretty good for it not being designed ground up for it. The driving with keyboard isn't the best but you can't really expect much in that way without analog input.I rarely play these types of games more than once and I'm on my second play through right now. Cannot recommend this game enough.,Grand Theft Auto V

FIRST YOU DON'T SOLVE YOUR MASSIVE HACKER PROBLEM THEN THE BLATANT CASH GRABBING DLC AND ""IN GAME CURRENCY"" NONSENSE BECOMES EVEN MORE UNBEARABLE AND NOW GETTING RID OF MODS!?!?!?!? THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE STILL PLAY YOUR GAME NOW IS BECAUSE OF THEM YOU DUMB S!!!!!most of the negative comments i have observed have had to do with either the game not running on certain video cards or the DRM policies that Rockstar have enforced. I can't say much about the video card situation but as far as the DRM policies with Rockstars social club i have few problems. Yes if you are someone who moves a lot or lives in an area where an internet connection is difficult to maintain then you should probably not buy this game but if you are like me and are gifted wtih an internet connection of a major city you should definitely buy this game.the single player is amazing by itself and offers great story gameplay and one of the best life simulators you could ever buy. there is so much content and so many things to do that i honestly have probably not done half of them and i have spent 30+ hours on the game. the Online mode is a bit of a mixed bag though. Free mode as always is a blast and the best part of the online experience. On the other hand the missions hiests TDM and every other scripted or standard online feature are painfully average after the first few times playing through them. hiests are difficult to set up through online and often will take so much time due to how ""hard"" (i call it unfair) the hiests can be at times. This leads to an even bigger problem relating to money and leveling. the money required to buy upgrade and get the best gear buildings and everything else is excessive at best and the only viable way to make money is to do the painfully average missions over and over again. the leveling is also a huge barrier to any of the really cool stuff the game has to offer as its all barred behind player levels. this takes hours upon hours of grinding the most boring part of the online experience. its really hit or miss with the online where if it hits you will be having one of the funnest online experiences you have ever had and if it misses you will have one of the most average/boring onine experiences you have ever had.its collectivly a 9/10 that peaks at 10/10 with freemode and singleplayer (a majority of my time with the game) and dips to 5/10 with the boring online missions (a minority of my time spent with the game). thankfully the boring online modes are not a huge part of the whole game and you will spend most of your time in freemode and singleplayer. P.S. change the flight controls if you are using mouse and keyboard the default is truly awful with the num pad.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,731,False,Recommended,"While the base game and online game provided by Rockstar are entertaining to some degree GTA5 Really become's a gamers game when you can join thousands of other gamers partaking in various mods and projects which are set in Rockstar's engine and world.These mod developers communities and players know and understand they're playing a Rockstar game. Rockstar and Take2 has already collected the total payment they can from the player with the exception of ""pay to win"" online content. There are no attempts that I've ever come across to misconstrue any mod as being anything but an customized enhancement to Rockstar's incredible creation.Not only do these mods and their communities (previously) adore Rockstar for creating such a canvas for creation but these modders are pushing the game to its very limits. The modders create and add things to the game beyond Rockstar's capability as they have a very finite amount of developers and a very finite amount of time those developers are hands on code. It just seems common sense for any game publisher to embrace promote and empower a modding community which has grown around one of the publisher's products. These modding communities mean longevity of the games staying power in the market but for a publisher like Take Two it means increased future sales from those not necessarily interested in the base game but a mod which takes the game's original concepts and flavors them towards a new audience. In my own case I bought GTA4 on PC strictly because of LCPD FR years after the game release.By Take Two throwing its weight around trying to shut down the very communities which helped it become the powerhouse it is they showed that the decisions being made by their leaders and legal entities are coming from a cess pool of bad ideas. It shows Take Two is strictly money motivated and really doesn't care about its players in any way beyond their money. It took Rockstar going to them and conveying the thoughts and feelings of the players to get their cease and desist quasi recinded.If the ""good idea"" was a cease and desist an attack against all GTA5 based modding communities. Imagine what the bad ideas are at Take Two.Finally Take Two tried to kill hundreds of content creators on YouTube Twitch and other sharing sites. Nobody wants to watch the base game but not everyone has the time to keep all sorts of different modded versions of the game installed as they like the featurs of various mods.A few years ago I'd say buy this game on its merit alone but now I'd say buy this game because of the mods and the communities around those mods.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,64,False,Recommended,UPDATE Thank you R* and TT for solving the issue with OpenIV and listening to your most loyal fans. I love your work and with single player modding back I can recomment GTAV to everyone! Take Two decided to basically forbid Single Player Modding after allowing it for four years destroying the entire community in the process. The reason given was some vague relation to OPENIV being also used for Multi Player cheating. This should technically be impossible so the real reason behind it is probably to draw more people into MP and ultimately to sell more Shark Cards.Objectively speaking I don't think this is good business. Take Two should work with the community and enable them to deliver high quality mods (Mod Kit) and not against them. I believe there is much more to gain if Management decides to embrace the Modding Community. Over protectionism of a brand never helps. I personally don't care about MP. I have never played GTAO and never will. I do however enjoy SP content a lot and I love the mods out there. Killing SP DLC is a huge blow to me and probably a NoGo even though the game is great. R* and Take Two promised SP DLC in the beginning but never delivered. This wasn't great but it wasn't a big deal either since there was plenty of Mods for SP to choose from.Killing mods ultimately kill my GTAV experience because I like to mod my game into reality (Real LA and so on and to have real Cars available)I do not recommend buying the game anymore.

2017-06-18,0,0,110,False,Not Recommended,Take two Interactive have royally screwed up this time with their anti modding policies taking down roughly 60 70% of mods that used OpenIV and I can thoughly say I won't be supporting a company who does this kind of take down without even contacting the OpenIV team to talk to them. And I don't think they realize how much modders actually keep people buying and playing their game for so long. Bad move on Take Two but not just that Rockstar themselves backed away so quickly to let Take Two to have all of the blame and Rockstar is a subsidiary of Take Two. They're the SAME damn Company in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,0,0,58,False,Recommended,Newbie to the GTA series The only GTA game I ever played was the very first one that came out in 1997 on PC. I decided to buy this one due to all the hype and the much talked about graphics improvements. I have never been this satisfied paying $59.99 for a game I've barely knew anything about much less played. The level of detail put in this game is amazing. Everything from the graphics to the story line truly impressive. This is the type of game that you don't have to worry about completing in a day. I am looking forward to playing this game for many months. There are small issues here and there that I noticed as far as bugs in the game but I anticipate they will be fixed in the near future. If you are on the fence about this game I definitely recommend it. As a newbie to the series I am glad I pulled the trigger on this one. Funny acting great story line impressive graphics tons of missions awesome online multiplayer and it will push your high end card(s) to the limit. 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,1230,False,Recommended,Certainly GTA despite being an extremely late release the improvements to this game are pretty strong! Pros The FPS feature makes a great improvement in playability and experience for it may help players who are used to FP shooters not feel completely alienated being forced into 3rd person and driving any vehicle from the inside delivers a nice touch of depth (working odometers in a non racing game.... wow).Further more the story for this game was great! This is to GTA V as a whole (meaning pc/console) anyone who hasn't played through it already anticipate a solid story if you plan on picking this game up. Single player content is loaded.Cons More of a personal gripe I've found myself switching between my xbox controller and mouse/keys due to control complexity.

They just want your money and invent more ridiculous ways to get it from us consumers. They abandoned SP entirely no DLC no nothing the SP game is the same when it came out almost 4 years ago on the PS3 and 360. They made up this MP scheme with ""free"" DLC yeah good luck with grinding the money to enjoy it but guess what you can buy shark cards and to put these shark cards in perspective you can buy the most expensive car and tune it for like 40 and that's ridiculous So the creative people of GTA community has outdone itself and created one of most active modding scenes.

2016-11-23,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Well I did not expect this. I've never followed this game series. I recall playing the third installment a few years ago and getting bored out of my brains very quickly so I made nothing of the latest releases. However over the last two years I've been introduced to the world of virtual reality and have learned neat tricks to get games without built in VR support to run in any headset I want.Long story short I fired up GTA V in virtual reality on my HTC VIVE using a tool called VorpX. The experience is absolutely incredible. This is not the sheer KMS boredom I had experienced trying out GTA 3 on a screen... the very start of the story mode made me feel like I had just spawned in the movie Fargo sadly with my character's heist ending up as badly or worse. Two minutes later I'm walking in streets that errily remind me of the time I visited the Santa Monica pier.From amazing graphics to impressive performance and good god what incredible mouse input mapping... if this game is be gold for those gaming on screens in VR it's freaking platinum!Here's an unlisted video of my initial VR test with the game.

The story line is great but it's the online play that is disappointing. If you don't have any friends that play it then it's a grind fest to make any serious money to get the nice toys. I've spent more time avoiding trolls that own tanks and armored vehicles than actually playing any of the challenges. In one session I was just standing around thinking about what to do next when a troll would keep killing me over and over. When I went into passive mode the troll would drive up into me blow the horn for 2 minutes and then finally drive off.You can also waste real money to purchase in game cash to waste on virtual goods which is what R* is banking on. IMO it's not worth it.TL DR Get it only for the story line and if you have friends that play it. Trolls cheats/hacks and overly priced items make the public online worthless.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,I've been installing mods on PC for two decades now and as much as I liked this game I have to stand firm again this recent attack on mods by the triple AAA industry. From take two to bethesda publishers are trying to find a way to stop or monitize mods and we must abhor and punish this behavior otherwise it will run rampent across the industry. I don't honestly believe that any of this will make a difference publishers have show time and time again from gross pre order culture to bogus DLC content that they don't have any interest in what gamers want and are only interested in protecting their own profits to the detriment of anything else. However I couldn't sleep at night if I didn't at least try to make a difference for the good of the hobby that I hold dear. If we ban together we might be able to make a impact or at least slow it down some. Plus honestly GTA Online is kinda a mess.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,149,False,Not Recommended,This game is totally unfun in multiplayer and that's what it pushes you towards with Take Two Interactive doing everything they can to make the singleplayer even less fun for example issuing a cease and desist on a huge singleplayer mod platform basically disabling most mods. Absolutely consumer unfriendly behavior. Just look at the microtransactions for multiplayer and the grind if you want to avoid them.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,94,False,Not Recommended,A great single player story and a horrible online multiplayer experience designed to make Take Two as much money as possible. Because of this you can expect to be bored once you finish the single player story and get this Take Two has now decided that mods for their game are illegal. So I highly recommend that you do not purchase this game. Speak with your wallets don't give them another dime of your hard earned money.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,Take Two clearly only cares about your $$$$ and nothing else not the loyalty to the franchise not the countless hours youve spent immersed in the GTA world and certainly not the hard work you put into making the experience better for the GTA community.

2017-06-20,0,0,886,False,Recommended,I've always had such respect for two companies rockstar and bethesda. Msotly because of the fact that their games are amazing but also due to the fact that they never end when you beat them the mods make them keep going on forever and ever as long as people keep making them which they will forever. When I heard that rockstar was taking them away from the game I was shocked. After having the game3 be so succesful on the PC for almost 3 years what reason could they have for taking them away? one of the only reasons I come back to the PC version is because of how superior it is to the console version theres so much extra content created by the community all of this is being snatched away from us in an instant and it's unacceptable. Don't get me wrong it's a great game but I cant recommend you buy it on PC rather than console as it really has very little advantage over it now.Edit Good job rockstar they brought back the mods,Grand Theft Auto V

All in one there is always a thing to do in the Online ..CONS.LOTS of hackers money baggers freezers god modes. All in one every 1/4 players probably uses mod menus because Rockstar don't really give a about the hackers in the game.The loading screens in the online are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long i give Rockstar 60 for this game and they don't fix the loading times no no no sir.. They add more things so it can be more glitchy and buggy every new time you load the onlineSOOOOOOO many kids that only ram the first places in the races there isn't a sportsmanlike game here boyzz.SOOOOOOOOOOO many russians that just can't stfu so you can hear your mind... no no no sir. you have to listen to russian music and блеът every time someone Commited Suicide. All in one in my opinion NFS 2015 is better than GTA in almost every aspect GTA is leading only by players hackers and unused content that just fill the loading screen with 10 minutes loading for just connecting to a sessian. If i had the money for GTA or NFS and i had none of them i would've bought NFSOtherwise my GTA opinion if they fix the loading time ban the hackers and money baggers.

Nothing like this has occurred since Gunrunning making it very enjoyable.Taking down OpenIV was a step too far however this decision has been reversed hence the now positive review. This game has an excellent single player campaign (I haven't finished it yet however) as well being very enjoyable to play with friends as long as you don't mind some of the intense grinding required in order to afford even basic luxuries.,Grand Theft Auto V

This is a genuine review.I was very late in getting around to playing it but I am astounded by this game. I've never enjoyed a GTA game this much since I discovered San Andreas for the first time. I wish the story mode was longer but maybe I enjoyed it so much that the story mode just whizzed by. The choice of 3 different playable characters is groundbreaking.

2016-10-25,0,0,468,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE Due to the extremely inappropriate policies the developer/publisher has against modding and the gaming community I have to redact my recommendation to buy this game I cannot recommend giving money to companies that do not respect their communities and outrighting banning modding a game even it's singleplayer is rediculous.The singleplayer campaign is an absolutely amazing experience the mouse and keyboard controls are decent and you can swap between them and a controller on the fly easily the game is graphicly intensive but beautiful even on lower graphics settings.Online mode is fun alone or with friends with no shortage of things to do while cheaters are still an issue and rockstar has had questionable actions regarding falsely banning some people while at the same time failing to stop real cheaters. However Online is still very enjoyable as much so as the singleplayer.In online mode THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONS through which to buy in game currency in online mode only it does not affect the singleplayer campaign in any way however and there is nothing you cannot get with microtransactions that you cannot also get just by earning money in game. that said earning in game money can be grindy and a lot of the new content released for free for all people who have the game is still expensive and obviously meant to encourage players to spend money on in game currency.All this said the game I believe is still well worth buying epessially so if it's on sale the singleplayer and online modes are both at minimum 100's of hours of entertainment and online with friends is very enjoyable as well even if its not perfect.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,331,False,Not Recommended,"GTA Online is an awkward clumsy dissapointment. There's no server browser and finding other players to play heists and other missions with can take ages. In game items are extremely over priced and it's entirely unreasonable how much real life money they charge for shark cards. The original single player game came out over two years ago yet they're still charging full price. And now they're going after modders like that will do anything to stop the rampant cheating situation.Sad how a few years back I put so many hours into the San Andreas Multiplayer mod just to see how far short the official GTA Online release came compared to what modders freely and willingly added to the games. Devs are greedy bÆstards who allegedly cut off and stiffed one of their own long time employees over royalties. Like they didn't have enough to share. Really ironic when you consider the game is all about robbing people. Guess it takes one to know one.

2017-06-15,0,0,259,False,Not Recommended,I feel as though there should be two separate entries here for a review seeing as the single and multi player aspects of this game have been such different experiences.The single player is nothing short of incredible. San andreas was always my favourite GTA game to this point constantly making the player feel as though they were the centrepiece of their own action flick. GTA5 is a continuation of this trend supplemented with the return of RPG esque character stat progression that has profound impacts on not just the gameplay mechanics but even the narrative as NPCs respond to changes to your character s various proficiencies. The environments are spectacular and varied the world is bustling and reactive to player actions this is a genuinely excellent single player game. Thoroughly recommend.Now for the multiplayer. After I finished the single player story I enjoyed carrying out heists and missions with a few friends. This is the best way to go about such things as communication is critical for many objectives and attempting to go at it with a random player will have you beating your head against a brick wall. The character progression allows players to access more weapons and customisation options as they reach higher levels from gaining experience namely by participating in world events competing in races and completing heists and missions. The online support is also *usually* exceptional. I lost a few items in game due to bugs and had them restored within minutes of raising a support ticket. This was fine up to a point but having spent just over 100 hours in multiplayer alone I completed a heist last thing at night with the intention of purchasing a new in game property. I woke up the following morning to discovered I d been banned for 4 weeks with no reason given whatsoever. Here s the *fun* part a ban resets your character progress. Your stats in game currency and property are all nullified. This includes any in game currency you ve purchased with their shark card system. I attempted to raise a ticket with their online support with no answer at all. I contacted them via twitter and had no response. The only time I finally had someone respond was by finding a helpdesk number and contacting them querying why I had been banned and whether I would receive the in game currency I HAD PAID FOR or whether I could expect a refund. The lady politely informed me that due to my breaching of the terms and conditions I had been banned and that I would not be able to receive my purchased in game currency and that I would not be able to get a refund. She reassured me that if I was to avoid contravening the terms and conditions in future then I would not be banned again. but how am I meant to not do something that I do not know I have done I said.She stuck to her script reiterating that I just had to ensure I never did the terrible thing (that neither of us knew I did) again.I said this was ridiculous and asked to both raise a ticket and speak to her supervisor. She hung up.So yeah. I ve taken my research with a pinch of salt but essentially it appears *anything* that hooks into the game executable whilst it s running has the potentially to get you banned. This includes performance overlays such as FRAPS or MSI afterburner. In my case I was using radeonpro as opposed to the standard AMD software.So enjoy the game (it is excellent) but don t invest a single penny in the micro transaction system unless you have a fresh install of windows with nothing other than Steam GTAV and GPU drivers installed. I can't recommend this on the basis that the support staff were rude and unhelpful and whatever anti cheat system they run caused me to lose over 100 hours of character progress for no apparent reason whatsoever.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,308,False,Not Recommended,Take 2 have decided to remove modding from single player in an effort to kill online modding. What they did not consider however is that single player modding and online modding are two separate techniques entirely and by shutting down OpenIV they have done nothing but remove single player modding fun. Where once they promised to allow modding on the PC version of the game they have now completely and utterly ed their fanbase out of sheer incompetence and ignorance. For shame. I'm sure they will continue their money grubbing anti consumer practices for years to come and RDR2 (which will get a PC release after consoles have made money) will be plagued with the same nonsense.,Grand Theft Auto V

They never fixed the cheating problem and now every lobby is populated modders and trolls only a friends only lobby will let you attempt basically any of the public world missions.Now that Take Two has decided to kill mods for GTA single player it basically kills the replay value of the single player game it will force you to attempt to do things online once you beat the story after a weekend. Problem is that you will only find a few normal people outside the Chinese guys that mic spam and leave at the first hint of trouble sending you all back into 20+ minutes of matchmaking. And the modders from all over the place that will cause you're game to crash cause glitches in appearance on charaters and vehicles that often take months to go away and they can even steal you're hard earned or even paid for DLC cash if you attempt to do anything about it.

Seriously.Don't get me started with the hackers spawning anything and everything including tons of cash when I started playing. Just join an online session look for player activity on the map that looks out of place generally player activity at the airport. If none jump to another random session. Almost guarenteed to find one lobby with hackers at any time of the day.GTA V Sales at a ""Discount"" is technically a discount as basically you're getting 1.25Mill online cash for free when buying the game at FULL price.

SHARK CARDS ARE OVERPRICED and they are trying to firce us to buy them as if they whernt making enough money already out of the game they take your money away so you have to buy shark cards to buy all the new things they released in the new update. this was the day the update came out.so yea 2 days after the update and im already getting hackers in the servers doing the same old thing of spawning all the players in a small circle and killing them all.RockStar if you think you are so tough and cool why dont you ing come fight me irl ill beat your down.Thankshope you ing read this and get cancer",Grand Theft Auto V

Take Two are purely attempting to take all the fun out of Singleplayer and force you into their bs online mode. Want to buy a supercar? Have fun grinding the same bs mission with consistent idiotic randos who constaly die and force restarts. Oh and don't forget all the waiting when online want to join a mission? open your phone and go make some popcorn it takes that damn long to load. Having mods for singleplayer were essential to the survival of this game one should be able to modify their own property with the tools the community provides as long as it stays in an offline mod.

Now I wanted to play it again on PC with enhanced graphics but after playing it for 20 hours I can't get past the damn launcher and the cancer that is their social club that I honestly couldn't care less about despite playing all their games. I've seen the various suggested ""fixes"" for my problem and they're all things that have an iffy chance of working that I don't even care to try in the first place. One person was even talking about reinstalling windows. Yeah no.Just a suggestion get rid of this u playish social club nonsense that nobody could care less about Rockstar. Edit I'm changing my review to positive because I managed to resolve the issue and the game is awesome but the social club nonsense should be optional and should not prevent you from accessing the game when it doesn't work.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,1) The game focuses on multiplayer. A lot of the MP content is only in MP not SP so a lot of the content pushes you to MP unless you have mods (see #6).2) The loading screens can take anywhere between 15 minutes and 30 minutes.3) $60 game with microtransactions. A lot of the expensive things in MP will take months to earn the money for if you don't buy shark cards.4) MP is riddled with hackers.5) I personally didn't have too much fun with this game. Sure it can be fun with friends but the SP seems bland and I don't want to risk going into public servers with all the hackers so when I don't have friends on I don't even touch it.6) Take Two esentially outlawed mods for this game by issuing a cease and desist on OpenIV which is the largest mod tool for GTA V. I personally never used mods but most likely most of the sales of the PC version was people wanting to mod and on behalf of them I am adding this to the list. A lot me included think that this action is Take Two forcing more people into MP and have them buy more shark cards. I even wouldn't be surprised if they start charging money to be able to even play even after the initial $60 purchase.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,852,False,Not Recommended,"Dear Take 2 Congrats on taking a game that was pretty good (and with the community's help AKA modding made it soo much fun!) and turning it into complete crap. Hope you do good with sales after this! Actually I hope you don't do well! ) It's what you deserve for this. Your reveiws were mostly possitive and sales were up but you got too cocky with E3 and messed up. We use Open IV to do stuff that you have never owned up to making because you all are just in it for the money and don't care about the players. We use it to add in off road vehicles (something you guys won't add more of) and we also use it to help a 4 year old game look more up to date. And btw all you did by this is just made us mad for no reason. Those of us who have it already can still use it. So basicly you guys just pulled a typical three year old ""This is unfair!"" move. And to those of you thinking about buying this game forget it. The missions are good but everything else is done for. Online? Nope taken over by modders and also Rockstar will ban you for just being in the lobbies with them. (which is something you can not control.) Also you can barely make enough money to by an appartment unless you pay them wayyy more. So just do yourself a favor and go buy something like Player Unknown's or better!""We love you Open IV team and we won't stop till you're back up XOXO""",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-09,0,0,227,False,Not Recommended,"Here is my first review. Read that for a bit of a rant.Let me start out by saying that this review does NOT reflect the single player campaign The single player aspect of GTA V is great. The online aspect of GTA is what ruined this game for me.I was amongst the many who lined up that day all those years ago for the midnight launch of GTA V on xbox 360 and PS3. My friend and I split a copy of it for PS3 and didn't get to play it until the following morning when it had finished installing. We played a bit of single player and ing enjoyed it. Driving around in the latest graphics and stuff was fun.Years later when it was finally released on the PC after much fighting with Rockstar about what platform it should be on we got GTA V and GTA Online for the PC and boy have I hated the game ever since.The online element of the game pretty much forces you to interact with other people to make money and thus progress at all. What with the CEO and MC businesses all requiring players to paint a neon flashing bullseye on their and say ""Please blow up my hard earned stuff"" just to earn a bit of money. Then there's the heists that takes this already hostile community of players forces them to work together (which 9/10 times they wont they will just screw over the host the first chance they get) and then laughs when none of it goes to plan.There's all optimization in any of the coke/meth/money businesses interiors meaning my 25fps becomes ing 5 fps because you buy our shark cards.And remember that quip I made earlier? The one about a hostile community? I wasn't ing kidding. There are players who are like level 250 or something who will spawn end game equipment such as attack helicopters tanks armored cars with turrets miniguns etc just to with you and your day and there isn't a god damn thing your level 30 can do about it because all you have is an SMG and he has full armor increased health and access to literally every offensive weapon and vehicle in the game at the push of a button.""But just ignore them or find a new session"" Good luck playing the game ignoring the half a dozen people looking to kill you because you cant fight back. Also good luck finding a session without half a dozen people looking to kill you! ""But you can make private sessions"" which don't allow you to do any actual money making activities because you we are rockstar.If it sounds like I'm angry that's because I just spent 5 god damn minutes starting up the damn game only to have some jackass try to blow up my armored karuma as I drove it back from the mod shop after customizing it to my liking then switch sessions to a friends session where 2 guys literally gunned me down just to blow up the drugs i was delivering for a friend they targeted me because I was the lowest level and then proceeded to talk about how easily they managed to 2 v 1 a guy in a slow as dump truck from half way up the road while sitting on their motorbikes.I'm done with this game until Rockstar grows a pair and starts rewarding players for playing nice with one another instead of ing up their day. (Or in other words on the day hell freezes over every planet including the dwarf planets in our solar system align and half life 3 releases or to be even more consise Never)My newest addition is below.So recently I'm sure you've heard of Take Two Rockstar's publisher for GTA V GTA IV and Max Payne 3. Especially their decision to send a C&amp D letter to developers of third party mods and their tools. I guess modding is a big no go or they are planning to introduce paid mods... who knows?",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-15,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,"This negative review is for GTA ONLINE. GTA V is a fine game. GTA Online is rife with hackers. Apparently RockStar is doing nothing about it. Not at least in the several months that I have owned the game. Every time I log in some little twink is using his hacks and dropping enormous windmills all over the city to slow everyone's frame rates. Or they attach a camp fire onto your character which never goes away so you instantly catch fire wherever you spawn. The elegant hackers will just blow you up randomly. Basically there are several of them every time I play. Nobody seems to ever want to do missions except for the two heists..""prison break"" and that labs one. Oh and I hope you love load times. Youre gonna get a lot of loading. Especially when you try to join a mission and someone quits just as the thing starts. Thusly forcing you into an enormous loading screen making the whole futile chore of joining a mission into a waste of about five or six minutes. For me this happens about a third of the times I try to join. There have been nights where I couldnt join any games. Today is the 15th of December. I am writing this as I download the update which includes new houses to buy an yachts.... I hope they added some sort of anti cheat as well. Otherwise screw your yachts RS.",Grand Theft Auto V

Modders are pretty common but it's rare to have griefers now that will get you banned. There's a lot of.... interesting things that happen when modders are around. Anyway it's good fun but I say if you haven't picked it up by now find some friends that want to play it. It's way more fun cruising around with friends or even just hanging out in game. There's plenty of just random little things to do not to mention the movies TV shows and radio programming they've put into the game to flesh out the world. I do recommend it but be prepared because life in GTA Online is not fair. You have to have a sense of humour about it all otherwise you're just in for a world of frustration. It's all worth it when everybody just decides (without even speaking mind you) to have one big all in brawl downtown. Just pure unadulterated fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

Those simple aspects can cover the entire game along with a lot of other things.

Way to go. If this is how they are going to operate from now on then I will not be buying any further games from them. Other companies have taken a positive look at mods in the way that they increase the life span of their game which in turn increases future sales. Unfortunatley there are still some coperate idiots who have little to no understanding of the gaming industry and this shows when they do tard stupid like this.Well done to you Take 2 Interactive.

2017-02-24,0,0,113,False,Recommended,"If you look at the vast majority of negative reviews here they are full of people complaining about hackers in GTA online and / or getting banned ""without reason"" before hating Rockstar's customer support. I've only played GTA V online on the Xbox One for &lt 6 hours overall so I can't comment about the online experience of the PC version.However don't overlook the single player game. This is without doubt the best GTA game to date especially with all the fan made mods out there to keep the game interesting and new.In short the story is fantastic with some great voice acting characters and scripting (as we've come to expect from Rockstar). The missions are varied and fun. The graphics are beautiful there's loads to do you're no longer forced to do ""Cousin why don't you take me bowling"" type missions that we got lumbered with in GTA IV you can go everywhere on the map from the start there are more vehicles planes and helicopters to fly (even submarines to pilot) three (awesome) playable characters instead of one businesses to buy and run.. and loads more all set in a beautiful and living environment. Even just mucking about in Los Santos is fun for several hours.If you want to play GTA V online read other reviews here but if you want the GTA single player experience this game will certainly not disappoint. Personally I've never been much of a fan of GTA in an online environment for me GTA has always been about the single player and that's where this game really shines!",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-24,0,0,385,False,Not Recommended,I enjoyed parts of this game. This is to say that not all is better in this than e.g. GTA4. Actually as a whole GTA4 was better than GTA5 including the storyline basic game mechanics and controls. As a technical detail while the game looks really nice 4GBs of RAM and good old hard disks will result in the game stuttering as it from time to time loads new graphics. Music on the radio channels were again well selected but too much rap/hip hop for a music enthusiast to enjoy.If you are hesitant whether to get this game I strongly recommend getting it only for the single player story mode. Keep away of GTA Online as it's filled with juvenile idiots with better equipment constantly killing you for fun and Rockstar may give you a ban for arbitrary reasons without ever explaining what one did wrong. Propably for not using real money to get in game stuff. Personally I am going to avoid Rockstar games from now on as their current direction of their games and ways of operating are not what I expect as a customer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-24,0,0,13,False,Recommended,This is another title I formerly owned on console and now play on PC. The steam community is nuts for this game and I can see why there is so much to do and play. The tons of mods and custom games in GTA Online is staggering. The game looks really good on PC compared to what it looked like on my Xbox 360. I love that the game comes with both GTA5 and GTA Online that's two whole games for the price of one. I got so caught up in GTA O and the online racing that I forgot all about the base game included LOL. Everyone knows this series so there is not much more than needs to be said if it can be done in a game chances are this game has it all. The load times can be kind of a headache as it takes a few minutes to get online and then into a game and then into a race. I also wish there were more music station choices (where's the metal station or anything kinda heavy?). Overall this was a solid buy for sub $30 that I spent on it.,Grand Theft Auto V

As far as single player its great it has an awesome story with great gameplay missions and memorable characters. The only con to this game is the online I have been banned 3 times and I am now perm banned on GTA Online because I received money that had been hacked into the game.

2017-06-16,0,0,365,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V singleplayer was amazing. It's only logical that when they update the game it updates both the SP and Online but hell no. They specificly dont update SP so that people would go play online. Oh and did i mention that Online is a micro transaction hell hole? Well yes. They just keep releasing expensive stuff (that you would need to grind for ages to get btw) and basically the only real way to get all the new stuff is to buy shark cards (spend real money to get ingame money). "" How bad can it be?"" one might ask. An average SUPERCAR COSTS 15 EURO!!!! And thats not even the top end supercars....There was a way to experience all the new updates by using mods in singleplayer. All the new files were already in the game so you just needed to activate them in singleplayer using a few harmless mods. Ofcourse because its singleplayer and it doesn't affect other people's experience you could mod in all kinds of stuff from real life cars to being ironman. GTA Online is full of hackers that ruin the whole gaming experience so i spent most of my time on the game playing singleplayer. Oh and Rockstar has no clue how to fix all the hacking problems. Why? Maybe because they are swimming in money because of all the shark cards or maybe they are innept at maintaining they're game.(It might be both but who knows). Because of these hacking problems people even created alternative multiplayer platforms.All of that is now sadly gone. Gone because they specificly targeted OpenIV mod team that created a mod tool which is the only reason around 70 80% of SINGLEPLAYER MODS EVEN WORK. So they basicly butchered the whole modding scene. And they did it because apparently the tool allowed people to hack online.(The tool itself does not allow to go online if you have any mods installed). And guess what. ALL THE HACHERS ARE STILL ING THERE!!!!At this point in time GTA V is a huge cash grab that's totaly not worth it because hackers constantly ruin all that you spent your real life money on. Modding (which was the only saving grace for people that already bought the game) is now destroyed.

2017-06-16,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,"Where do I start? I first bought GTA V for 360 when it came out and uploaded my character to PC when the game came out. I would still say that the main campaign is still great overall but since R* hasn't bothered adding any DLC or support for SP or expanding the experience while entirely focusing on GTA O I would say that I should review GTA O more than just the SP. It took them years to finally release heists which to many including myself were lackluster. Making money to buy the content in the new DLC for GTA O has been a Sisyphian task for years in GTA O. R* has historically nerfed payouts from missions while simultaneously increasing the prices of items in DLC content. The open world can be fun for a little while but you will run out of things to do (besides spawn killing randoms or being spawn killed ad nauseum). Most of the missions are cut and paste fetch quests with little variety. The inclusion of fan made missions did little to really improve the overall online experience. Years ago R* introduced ""Shark Cards"" which are in game microtransactions to buy fake money with real money. That further exacerbated the unrewarding nature of any vanilla/DLC content. It takes millions of dollars to begin to have fun and buy whatever you want in GTA O and the money goes very quickly. New content has you invest millions for only tens of thousands in return unless you are willing to do boring inherently flawed missions over and over and over. This leads me to my biggest gripe with how GTA V turned out the lack of meaningful content beyond surface level reskins and restructured planned DLC that ruined the shelf life of my time with the game . R* planned 3 single player expansions initially but that fell through in 2014 when the team lead as well as many that worked on it left with him. This signalled the beginning of the end of GTA V's promising future content. It took them 2 years just to release heists after promising them a month after launch whcih were reskinned/restructured missions from the 3 expansions I am overall disappointed with how the game has turned out and the future it lays out for GTA VI. R* is more focused on manipulating people into buying micro transactions than producing great content.",Grand Theft Auto V

I've purchesd this game at full price 3 times now. Once on Xbox 360 once on PS4 and once for PC. I have also given an abusrd amount of money to the micro transactions for the PS4 GTAV Online store. That stops now. I will not purchase anything else from Take Two until this issue is resolved. If modding games like GTAV gets thrown behind a paywall...

2017-02-16,0,0,369,False,Recommended,I've played most of the GTA titles released since GTA 2 from Playstation so I'm a big fan of the series in which every game surpassing the predecessor I could say the same for GTA V that managed to keep all the good things we all love on a GTA and adding even more to impress fill with joy any gamer who wants a crazy adventure on the streets of Los Santos.A world bigger than anything made on the series and not only bigger but alive too not just on earth or sky but even under water! it's astonishing the number of things you have to be done in this huge world things that go from treasure hunt to crazy events and minigames you can spend an eternity filling all goals.This is the first game of the series that introduce the concept of multiple main characters which makes the campaign history way more rich with the strong contrast between the character s personalities and their background histories a concept that goes through from the character s issues being always funny how these characters react to the other's behaviors when their participations get crossed it's not the first game to make this however is one that made it quite well.The multiplayer mode is one way to extend the fun playing the game with a variety of things to do which repetition represents no problem all the called 'heists' which is multiplayer missions are incredibly enjoyable to be done with friends. Although still there is a quite another amount of activities on the entire map the customization systems and improvements you can make grip o will to keep playing more.In resume GTA V is one ultimate game experience and storytelling available today a standard that everybody from today will certainly take as a goal which will be hard to match.I absolutely recommend this game!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-26,0,0,466,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a thrilling experience. Both the campaign and online mode can take quite some hours of your life leaving you with awesome memories. The campaign literally had me up for 18+ hours for 2 days and I don't regret playing it. In the middle of the story mode you get that impulse which tells you that you NEED to finish it. I felt empty inside quite some time until I finished. The missions are not too hard but very entertaining. GTA Online is the bomb. I started really and I mean REALLY confused looking up a lot of stuff just to get started. You have to get a garage a car and an apartment (if you want your own heist room and wardrobe). As you play through it you discover many things that you didn't even know you could do and they weren't there for you in the campaign. Until you reach level 25 30+ you won't be noticed by other players and there's a good chance that even friends will ditch you for a heist or something as people think you're a noob and didn't even start the campaign yet thinking you're some dude that saw a YouTube video and wanted to play online really bad and bought the game. When you get over level 30 you will slowly become a respected player and more low level players will want to team with you. You can easily make friends and rule Los Santos together. I think I met over 40 nice people in 150 hours of gameplay (at the moment) and they're now my friends. I can spend 15+ hours on GTA Online and I won't get bored 1 second.I've bought it for 59 99 EUR and I don't regret it. There have been quite a few sales putting it up for 49 99 39 99 or even 29 99 EUR but if you really want it you can buy it at the normal price. If you don't want it that bad you should wait for a sale as they're quite common.10/10 I say go for it!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,85,False,Not Recommended,This game was great! A ton of replay value thanks to online mods. Mods truly extend the depth and immerision of GTA 4 and 5 that rockstar cant't deliver on it's own without attaching a hefty price tag for a sixtenth of the content. Due to the resent events with Rockstar and Take Two I will never buy another game that has to do with either. Greed will kill your game! Youtube Steam and Twitter is rife with your money hungry ways. We already know Red Dead is going to micro transactioned out the If Rockstar does not stand up to this it's going to gut the company. Your investors know money you know games! for s sake. Do you think I'm just in love with Skyrim Fallout New Vegas Fallout 4 GTA4 and GTA 5? Hell no! I mod the out of them and make the game the way I want it to be. I download and donate to passioniate devlopers of mods because they feel the same as me. I can no longer recommend this game for the soul and simple fact that I don't agree with the way the entire company is going. Free content my Shark card or your not going to get anywhere. And I ask the fan boys of this game before they bash this all to pieces please look at the big picture. The game is $60.00 and they are leaning towards in game transactions more and more and more. Please Don't defend and perpetuate this cycle. Modding is the only freedom we had. I will never own another game that is touched by Rockstar or Take Two. Love you all.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-21,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Honestly I was never fond of the idea of buying a Grand Theft Auto game. I've played them before and never found them appealing what so ever in any aspect. I would've never given this game a chance though if I wouldn't have gotten it as a present on the PS3 a good while back. Holy on sticks was I glad that I had this game forcibly shoved down my throat. This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. It would easily go on my top 10 list. It's just ridiculous how addicting it is whether you're playing singleplayer you're randomly shooting other players/civilians/yourself on multiplayer or you're playing minigames with friends. The story is generally unpredictable funny and crazy as hell and every action and mission in the game is satisfying. Almost everything about the game is just really good and this is what every AAA title should strive to be like. I don't have many complaints at all and I did not hesitate to pay for a second copy for my PC. I easily am playing through the campaign again and I've nearly choked myself to death with laughter while playing with friends. 100% recommended even at full price. The only real downside is that at times the matchmaking can be god awful especially when doing heists.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have to say though I have NEVER had more fun playing any game in the franchise. This game was meant for and is absolutely perfect for the PC. I am able to play this game flawlessly and it's absolutley beautiful. A great feature that I want to highlight is the ability for first person gameplay. Every other game I've ever played in the GTA saga has always been a third person sandbox and adding this feature has made the game feel brand new and even more exciting. All credit goes to rock star for making a game that has been endlessly replayable.,Grand Theft Auto V

But GTA V defnitely hit the nail.Absolutely great characters beautiful world. Impressive feeling of a living and breathing enviroment. A truck load of different stuff to do and to explore.For someone who is new to the GTA franchise the games starts a little slow because you need to find into the world and at the beginning you're only loosely guided by the content. But after one / two gaming hours the game takes on speed and depth very fast and really opens up to the player and never lets you go until the end of the campaign.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-24,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Singleplayer is fantastic and this game is worth getting just for that alone. Multiplayer is still getting big updates which are for the most part very fun to play and adds intersting content but they're a few problems with this game however. In multiplayer the cost of buying a single new car is incredibly costly and while it is doable with the businesses it gets super grind y and will take hours to afford. Another problem is that singleplayer hasn't gotten any updates for years and the updates it did get were just new cars and clothes and stuff no new campaigns or anything like that even though rockstar did promise singleplayer DLC. I do absolutly recommend the singleplayer and while the multiplayer is flawed I recommend it as well and I think a lot of the complaints about it are valid but often exaggerated.Also the hours it says I have for this game on steam is not very accurate because I almost exclusively play this game on Xbox and have hundreds of hours on there.,Grand Theft Auto V

Outstanding.However.I am dissappointed that Rockstar has only seen fit to tend the GTA online money farm and has abandoned 2 crucial elements to good single player content 1. No single player DLC? They didn't come anywhere close 2 using the entirety of the amazing map they created the possibility for other scripted storylines inside of Los Santos are endless. Perhaps it isn't as profitable as selling Megalodon Shark cards with some foolish part of me wants to believe that there's still some artistic Soul at Rockstar.Episodes from Liberty city was superb and I think Los Santos deserves the same treatment.2. NO GAME PLUS? This one seems far more simple. Give players an opportunity to replay the entire storyline with unlocked weapons the money from the first playthrough and tougher enemies. Perhaps allow them to set different default vehicles in the game plus as well. It would be simple.I'm not going to say to avoid buying this game I waited for a long time to purchase it and I must say it was money well spent.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,612,False,Not Recommended,Used to be fun but eventually the content added that cost too much to reasonably grind for allowed people who pay to have such a ridichulously massive advantage in GTA online that it was no longer fun. Any race joined had a 50/50 chance of the person running it to enable custom cars because it would give them the advantage. Any new vehicle that was remotely fun or new would be hidden behind enourmous paywalls or a decade of grinding that it was the equivilant of seeing the neighbour kids get a pool...such it was fun to imagine what it would be like and maybe every couple weeks they would let you use it but you could never actually have the real exipirience of owning it. The final straw came with an update that added several fun gimmick vehicles that jumped had rocket boosters attached to them or was basically a faster tank. Instead of being purchasable you would be forced to own a specific newly added property in the game which cost alot then you would have the oppurtunity to lower the price of them by grinding through random missions untill you had a CHANCE of doing another set of missions that would give you the one opputinity to do a mission to get a discount on said vehicle. OH and did i mention that all these missions were forced into public servers which means YOU you dont get to have fun you have to attempt the mission 100 times before eventually you get a server without s in it so you can do the mission without being instakilled by a jet or some in a Ferari with c4 then once you finaly complete all that...the vehicle becomes 10% cheaper. then you have to earn that other 90% by grinding some more and by that point 30 hours of your life is gone and you sit wondering why you arnt playing literally any other game.

Between microtransations and awful grind for money most people will be unable to compete with older players. The best ways to make money are in the open world and most of the time you will be targeted by people in jets which can instantly kill almost anything with very little counter. If you do manage to shoot them down they can simply go off the radar or into passive mode while they go and get another jet.Take2 also took legal action aganst the modding community justifying it by saying it was for game security while doing almost nothing to combat the hackers and scripters you can find in almost every server. These people can kill every player in a server over and over or even get them sent to cheater lobbies. Only buy this game on %50 off or more sale if you have not played singleplayer. Do not buy if the only reason you want to play is multiplayer. You will never catch up to older players unless you drop hundreds of dollars for shark cards or pay for a scripter to give you money.

2015-12-30,0,0,1161,False,Not Recommended,"Rockstar's Games are no longer developed for the Gamers but for the shareholders. It is at this point that you should look at the dismal state of GTA 5 and boycott Red Dead Redemption. You know it will be the same old fun sacrificed for corporate greed.In a recent review they stated the following Take Two s actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players. This is all a lie. They only care about selling shark cards. GTAIV is dead because of mods and they never cared but where there is cheap money to be made off a few vehicles they suddenly have an anti modding stance.At literally every single point in the development of the game the developers sat around a table with a list of features and said ""Right how do we make shark cardsy sell?"" Lets make literally everything cost extortionate ammounts of money. Players have to invest millions in DLC content to be able to start making any money. This one is a big one! Here are the costs to play the ""free DLC"" rockstar has kindly developed for us. Hesit content Apartment with planning room $500K 1.1M. CEO content Office $1 4M. Warehouse $250K 3.5M. BIKER content Clubhouse $200 472K. Businesses $650K 1.852M. IMPORT/EXPORT content Vehicle Warehouse $1.5 2.85M. GUNRUNNING content Bunker $1.165 2.375M. Mobile Operations Center $1.4M. These prices do not include any upgrades. The upgrades can double the ammount of money spent. The bare minimum to spend to be able to play all of the DLC missions is about $6.665M. Thats buying the cheapest of every single warehouse business office clubhouse to be able to even start playing what is supposed to be a DLC that allows you to earn money. Return on investment is so low you are basically working a job for virtual currency... When a player Dies it costs $500. Hospital bills are an important part of game immersion! Also this does not include dropped money the fee is just charged straight to your bank account this is usually taken out while your screen is black after death but if you are quick enough you may just see the red numbers at the top before they disappear! Over my 1000+ hours played this has cost me millions. Even goofing about with friends it is $500 every time. It all adds up. When a player dies they drop whatever ammo is in their gun. If this happens to be a rocket or an RPG then the person who just killed you has now got it Every day a player has to pay ""property maintenance fees"". This is so fun! I've always looked at games and though ""I wish i could pay digital bills! its everyones dream come true to escape from their daily life only to realise they now have to pay bills in video games also! Every day the player has to pay their mechanic. Yet sometimes I can be calling him 10 meters away from a road and he says ""Sorry I can't get to you"". I PAY YOU $300 a day you lucky flicking gibbon Players have to constantly restock on ammo. They can buy it directly from the Interaction menu meaning in a drawn out fight especially against a jet or an insurgent it is common to spend upwards of 20 50k on rockets timed explosives proxy mines. Vehicles can cost up to 2.8M. This is not including anything on warstock just normal vehicles. This means that spending 69.99 on shark cards will realistically get you 2 3 sports cars. You pay for the fastest vehicle but in reality most of them seem to cap out at around the same speed. Selling anything results in a huge loss of value. Sure we pay bills because it is so realistic but a city center penthouse apartment halfs in price when sold? Vehicles mods have to be rebought if you change the way your car looks. Unlike clothes you have to rebuy everything whenever you change your wheels bumpers spoilers parts which could cost up to $80k in the case of some mods. Clothes don't seem to be an issue? But say if I want remove my spoiler I have to pay what I can only assume is MY MECHANIC the one I already pay a couple of grand to remove a spoiler which I then assume he throws into the nearest dumpster or re sells. Pearlescent paint is expensive. Say you have metallic blue and you want to add a pearlescence. You would think you could just select the colour of pearlescence you want but NO! ""Pearlescent paint requires a metallic paint job"". So you can't straight up buy a pearlescent paint? You can't just buy the same paint again as ""this mod is already installed"". To fix this you need to buy a different paint then re buy the paint you already had THEN buy pearlescence for that paint. Players pay once for the metallic paint which can be at the most $10 15k. Then they have to buy the Pearlescence which can be ANOTHER $10 15k. Say if you are experimenting with colours? Every tweak requires you to buy the respray. I've spent millions playing about with colour combinations with different metallics and pearlescent colours since the game first came out. Players can't sell Property Pegasus vehicles Yachts or any DLC infrastructure. This ties up Millions of dollars for some players. with a limit of 5 properties to buy from dynasty real estate you have to downgrade to a shack in the desert from a penthouse apartment just to get 50% of your money back. The DLC properties alone costs millions just for the ability to do some missions and cannot never be sold.Brain dead morons will tell you that Rockstar owes us nothing and to be grateful for the tens of millions of in game things we are allowed to purchase. These people are the cancer of the gaming community and are encouraging bad development practises.",Grand Theft Auto V

This was not intentional no one has been banned for using single player modifications and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage disrupt gameplay or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized they may be broken by technical updates cause instability or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.""And I agree with what you wrote but really here is the thing. OpenIV can't do to harm GTA Online maybe there is less people playing GTA Online because they have more fun in singleplayer but they bought the game some probably pirated it. But even if they did pirate it most of the mods require you to have a LEGAL COPY of GTAV. Don't let Take Two you up rockstar buy yourselves out GTA V is going to get ruined for the most part if you let this go down.And please do pay some respects for the content creators on youtube/twitch struggling af with this.Well that is all to the OpenIV team I fully support you which is why i wrote this. This is just ruining the HUGE modding community of GTA V don't buy this game as this is going down. Take Two is screwing it over with online gameplay and anti modding policys.*drops mic",Grand Theft Auto V

Плюс только из за сюжетного режима в нём провёл основное кол во часов. Наверно это из за того что я начинал играть ещё на Xbox 360 и игра уже приелась и надоела.

2015-05-07,0,0,266,False,Recommended,The single player is pretty ing good but its been dumbed down from the older games. Alot of missions are skippable if not all of them and there are checkpoints. The game has been casualized for the mainstream consumer but i still enjoy it and the missions offer alot of variety. The story is not that good its good enough but the story in gta 4 for example was way better. Im not too fond of the mutiple endings it should've just been 1 ending.The Multi player is a mixed bag it can be really fun with friends but the missions don't offer alot of variety the main thing it has going for it is the heists but once your done with those then its hard to still find stuff to do. The dificulty lever is higher in online than in single player but this also means that every party member needs to have their together which is ok with friends but it can be really annoying with random people. Alot of the cool stuff that you can buy is hidden behind massive in game money ammounts this is of course implemented so that people will buy the sharkcards (microtransactions for in game money). So its either grinding the heist mission untill you gathered alot of money or paying up this is what annoys me the most about the online experience. There is also a big problem with cheaters but if you plan to only play with friends this shouldn't be a big deal.Overall i reccomend you to buy it but not to expect much from the multi player if you don't have friends to play with.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-29,0,0,271,False,Recommended,What else to say but what one expects? I love it! Albeit I'm nearly addicted to using the Script Hook V mod on it to blow up all the police I can random passersby etc even the handful of experience with vanilla story mode is fun as heck! Though the one problem I keep running into (besides my computer not being good enough to handle even really the base graphics set) is everytime I attempt to enter the online mode the game crashes. So I'm unable to derp around in freemode and as a incompetent and insane dork I cri evry tim.

However this is by far the best game of the series yet and I can't believe anybody who says otherwise. The singleplayer story was well done and brought characters in that I became attached to like Roman from GTA IV the multiplayer was revolutionary as there has never been an open world RPG set in a modern setting as well as this one and so much more. I'm writing this as it is 50% off which is an absolute steal. Easily a 10/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,0,0,358,False,Recommended,Quite possibly the best game of all time. This game broke 6 world records within its first week of release for a reason. The trailer uploaded nearly two years before its release got over 40 million views on YouTube alone. I have played this game a lot. A hell of a lot. I had it on Xbox prior to me owning my PC. I have to say although the PC version is the best with all the advanced graphics settings and 60fps I enjoyed it throughout and I will continue to enjoy the game. It seems sad and quite worrying how far away the game's release actually is and watching the trailer gets me re hyped in a sense and makes me want to play the game again. The game has so much variety in terms of gameplay scenery map design as well as missions and things to do in story mode and GTA Online which receives occasional updates that add new game modes and content. For some the game gets boring but as long as you have some friends online who are willing to play the game will feel fun and fresh once again. Or you could just have fun travelling around.Grand Theft Auto is one of the most well known series and Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of a modern masterpiece.,Grand Theft Auto V

Got about 1000 hours on the consoles and the one thing i learned playing THAT LONG IS THE GTA ONLINE IS THE BIGGEST GRIND LIKE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! You can grind for days straight just to buy one thing you want. Oh thats right I forgot you can get easy money in gta online.... if you pay them for FAKE MONEY! 100 REAL DOLLARS CAN ONLY GET YOU 8mil in game. you can only buy and office and a full sized garage for that little. what about upgrades for the office garage cars guns clothing AND MORE! All you have to do IS GIVE US MORE MONEY! This game is SO OVERRATED! I've also heard that people with over 1000 hours in game were PERMA BANNED FOR NO REASON TOO! But I see characters that are over LEVEL 1000! Yea there totally legit didn t mod or glitch anything. There ban waves ban more innocents than actual modders hackers or exploiters HOW PATHETIC! I recommend this game to anyone who is brain dead loves to grind is rich or just wants to WASTE THERE TIME WITH GRIND! Rockstar needs to shape up!

2016-11-27,0,0,534,False,Recommended,Before I even start any sort of review I'll answer the question you're searching the reviews for. Yes the game is worth a buy however I would grab it while it's on sale. While this game has an endless amount of content it's online (which most people play for) resents you trying to love it. So if you're just here for the single player go for it. Otherwise grab it on sale. Grand Theft Auto V what a brilliant game. An amazing story lead by three unique and well written characters. Fun gameplay a near infinite amount of things to do from playing tennis on the court to staring at in a strip club. This game can only be referred to as a master piece and I can recommend this game enough for just the singplayer. Even if it's been a bit neglected from all the updates the game is getting. With such an amazing singleplayer the multiplayer is already set up for success. Taking an MMORPG like approach to it's open world multiplayer it has missions and just as much (if not more) customization to it. On surface level the multiplayer should be just as great as the singleplayer as some of the missions and heists set up a story for you. But through all the incredible amounts of detail if you play long enough you start to notice the cons more than the pros.This multiplayer connectivity maybe it's just me but I've never had a good experience with it. I get dropped on multiple occasions in the middle of events missions and heists. Not only that but the first person while amazing to play in was horribly implemented. Movement can make your head spin just a bit as you try and scale something and the camera makes about ten sharp adjustments that only obstruct your vision more. The multiplayer community is also not the greatest. While the more seasoned players are likely to understand your pain and be nicer a majority are just s. Like how some after ing over the heist for the tenth time leave meaning no one gets a chance ever again. Or worst of all the hackers there are an excess of people who decide to hack in this game and while it is being dealt with it's not being dealt with efficiently. I personally think a no tolerance rule on hacking is reasonable but that's just me.Regardless the multiplayer is great fun and is constantly getting new and excicting content. Personally I'm hoping they add more heists. With these glaring issues this is why I think the game is not worth $60.TL DR If you're here for the singplayer grab it on sale if you can but go for it. If you're here for the multiplayer definitely grab it on sale because you'll have fun but the game will hate you for doing it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-27,0,0,741,False,Recommended,What can't you say about this game?Graphics 10/10 Nothing else like it on the market. If the textures look better in another game it's because the world is insanely larger in GTA V. If the world is considerably larger in another game it is not even within light years of looking as good as GTA V.Gameplay 10/10 Controls on PC are intuitive enough. Controller is a bit easier and more intuitive but what you can do with a mouse and keyboard once you're used to it is absolutely second to none. No lack of content. Never has been never will be.Sound 10/10 Top notch in every way. Realistic guns awesome explosions insane engine noises and the dialogue is so next level I would need to write a book on how excellent it is.Online Community 7/10 I live in Europe and constantly get thrown into lobbies with annoying Russians. They suck and are easy to kill but they attack you at the most inconvenient times because they are terrible and can't play fair. It's fun to sometimes just stop what you're doing and mow them down but they're also constantly screaming in lobbies and deathmatches and things. Only thing I can really speak against in GTA V but I guess that might be a Europe only problem from what I can tell.Overall 10/10 It's been out for years but it's the best game on the market to this day by far.

While it is clear some features present in GTA San Andreas/GTA 4 were likely cut to have the game possible to run on Xbox 360/PS3 there is still a great deal of fun to be had here especially online. While I don't enjoy much playing with randoms or in public I do play online quite a bit in closed friend sessions. 1000+ hours and still having fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-26,0,0,236,False,Not Recommended,Played the game for about 200 hrs enjoyed it a fair bit besides running in to hackers frequently but besides that an alright experience. Then a month ago I log in and I've been suspended for a month. Why? No clue they didn't tell me.So I patiently wait a month to enjoy the game I purchased full price about a year ago. Yesterday was the day I got unbanned. Opened up the game to find that my character had been deleted (rip 200 hrs of progress) and decided to make a new character to have atleast be able to play the game with my friend who just bought the game a month ago (he had to wait for me to get unbanned to even enjoy his new game). On that new character I couldn't seem to join any server with other players I could just play online solo. Was frustrated and quit the game for the day. The next day I log in to find that i've been permanently banned from GTA Online. (http //i.imgur.com/b7RLKuH.jpg)Still don't have any idea why I got banned in the first place and certainly did not break any rules yesterday when I returned to the game. The only reason they're so adamant about banning people left and right is because they wanna make their $$$ from people buying in game money for real money. Hackers giving people money loses Rockstar money since they won't be buying it from them but instead we have innocent people like myself getting our 60 game licenses taken away from us.How convenient that the game is 50% off right now huh? ing ridiculous.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-07,0,0,58,False,Recommended,Many people may see GTA as juvenile but I believe otherwise. There is a lot of passion art and quality pushed into this game. Just the city of Los Santos is quite frankly an amazing place to drive around in. You can see the detail put into every corner of this game. The gameplay is solid too though sometimes the AI is a little cheap.The story is fantastic though not without plotholes. The characters are all great and not once did I feel anything was forced or cringeworthy. What I love best though is just driving around this game world. I'm a big fan of racing games and lately I've been finding it more difficult to find racing games that's for me. This game is certainly the Need for Speed killer since it literally ruined Need for Speed for me and perhaps many others.The downfall is it's online experience. Online used to be great but hackers simply makes the experience unplayable now. So if you're getting this game to play GTA Online don't bother it's dead to anybody who'd ever want to try and enjoy the experience the way it was meant to be played.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-07,0,0,211,False,Recommended,Overall the gameplay and story mode is awesome but the money system and free roaming side activities needed alot of improvement. The stock market especially needed the most attention as thats where players will try to get their money. If I would to suggest perhaps some method to control the market fluctuation or bring back the drug dealing feature in GTA Chinatown Wars. Also if the rumor of the ability to travel from one place to the other is true maybe allow players to smuggle contraband or firearms to other places to trade for an extra income. I don't really understand why Rockstar decided to remove the vigilante paramedic and firefighting mission as it allows for an extra gameplay hours and players could do some side jobs instead of constantly focusing on the main mission. The heist mission is a great add on for the game but it should not be only limited to the main mission. My suggestions would be allow players to conduct a heist during free roaming just like in Godfather The Game.As for online I would rather remove the online feature and replace it with some additional features for the singleplayer. The online mode perhaps has its uniqueness but when playing open world games I prefer to explore it by myself. Anyhow I'm not using the online feature very much as I can hardly connect with other players on a mission.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-22,0,0,324,False,Recommended,"People talk about GTA V as a game riddled with modders in every server that repeatedly kill you. This is untrue. Recently from what I've seen the amount of modders has dropped immensely. It isn't often that I find one. If you do encounter one they may drop you money but don't worry about this. If you want it removed send a ticket to Rockstar Support and they will remove it (One thing they actually can help with). If you like the money but don't want it removed (as it always is eventually) just spend it as fast as possible then sell those things to ""launder"" your dropped money in a way. However I have had a game breaking bug for about a year. I've sent multiple Support tickets and nothing helped. It turns out that Windows Firewall blocked it so all I had to do was disable it and it worked fine. Tl dr Modders do not have a major impact on gameplay and this game is worth it",Grand Theft Auto V

I'll make this short and simple.Pros 1. Very optimized good if not great scaling for SLI/Crossfire users. Weird memory stack for example your 4GB card and you're using 2 GB of VRAM 4GB being used out of your 8GB vram. (just a weird glitch not really using that much and vram cant stack on this game)2. Campaign is very fun if you bother to give it a try!3. Online is great to play with friends.4. Mod support/can use mods (single player only)5. Graphics are so beautiful for a 2013 game!Cons 1. GTA Online is such a grind now horrible economy! Your $100 of shark card in this game is nothing to be honest.2. Filled with occasional online modders that can ruin your experience3. This game is not alt+tab friendly and can crash at random when doing so often. 4. Worst loading times I've seen5. You can disconnect randomly and the chances of this is 2/5 sessions you join.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-11,0,0,283,False,Not Recommended,This is about GTA Online as I've long since beaten the story.1. Rockstar systematically removes everything that's actually fun in the game (cargobobs can't lift anything anymore for example).2. You barely make any money doing anything in this game.3. Everything costs millions upon millions of dollars to the point I have to grind for several days to purchase ONE item.Essentially whenever new content is added I get so disappointed knowing that I'll never get to play with it because it takes days of grinding to afford anything. Yes theoretically it is possible to save up for it but there's just no end in sight to the grinding. Not to mention that actually enjoying the game costs money (destroy a vehicle and you have to pay quite a bit to get it back sure it's realistic but I don't play GTA for the realisim I play it to escape reality).So really just stay away from this game. It's garbage. Rockstar only cares about making players buy Shark Cards and that's blatantly clear.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-23,0,0,424,False,Recommended,This game is amazing. The teams that worked on it have done a good job perfecting the game mechanics and polishing the graphics. The singleplayer story is great and overall well made. The multiplayer has been updated multiple times and all of the DLC items are available for all of the players without needing to mkae payments with real cash to get a new car or motorcycle. Even though the community is currently bashin Rockstar for banning mods and so on I think it is great. When there is a zero tolerance policy with modders we non modders can finally enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played. One by one the modders will be banned and we will no longer be blown up by those idiots who have nothing better to do. And the newest update with a flying motorcycle is really fun. I like flying that thing around the map doing all sorts of stunts. The game is fun on it's own and you can enojoy it even if you don't have friends to play it with.

2016-11-30,0,0,420,False,Not Recommended,I wrote a paragraph on how frustrating this game is but it felt to long of a rant. I didn't buy this game for the singleplayer and probably will not play it.Hackers (or modders...) Some are passive which is okay I guess but some use god mode and very rare and powerful weapons. It is VERY annoying confronting these hackers.Money drops My friend has so much it's a joke hydra buzzard a lot of things and he's around level 150. I have nothing in comparison. And now they're cracking down on hacked money and resetting peoples bank accounts so those who didn't get a chance will have to play fair now. If Rockstar took away items that were mostly bought with hacked money there would be LOADS less Hydras buzzards and tanks.Connection issues There are times which it's okay but when you're in a middle of a gun fight and you get kicked back to SP it's not okay. One second of bad lag kick to solo lobby. And it doesn't help that I recently lost an MC group of 6 because of this and was about to sell my coke...Please don't buy this game at full price (unless you're getting it mainly for the singleplayer I guess) The multiplayer has a lot to it but it just gets so boring and half of the content isn't worth doing because of the reward.I have failed to shorten this...EDIT this game is still and makes me wish I never bought it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,396,False,Recommended,Before I start most of my gametime consists of GTA Online gameplay. I have played the entire story two times or so. The singleplayer story is good. Good enough to play it once or twice.But where you can spend your hours is in GTA Online. You can team up with friends do literally whatever you want. Race/fight/stunt you name it. The game has it.The limiting factor of what you can use in GTA Online is the same as in real life MONEY. If you want money you need to grind and grind and grind. OR You spend real money to buy ingame cash (I really hate that). So you grind. The upside of this grinding is the good feeling you get when you finally buy that long wanted helicopter or car.But I wouldn't have played this much if that was too big a deal. I love the game. Always loved GTA from the first GTA. I dislike their current policy on OpenIV (I'm sure you've heard of the story). But I still like the series. I'll continue to support the game.

2017-06-16,0,0,760,False,Not Recommended,"This review is specifically for GTA O. Online punishes the player solely for playing. Either a player is punished by being forced to grind continuously for money or by buying a ""shark card."" Fun and convience to the player are sacrificed to convince people to break down and spend real money. The best legitimate way to make money in game without glitches will grant you about 2.2 Million every 8 10 hours of play time depending on how effecient you are. You can definitely make more than that if you try but that seems to be about the average when doing warehouses. WIth that 2.2 Mill a player could afford to buy something on the cheap end. You could buy a good car or apartment/office with it but it will always cost you more money to upgrade your car office etc. than the original price. The other option is to buy a shark card and spend $80 in real money for 8 Mill. That's more than it is to actually buy the game and even more so considering there's no reason anyone should buy this game at full price 3 4 years later. That 8 million could afford you a new Gunrunning bunker MOC plus a couple of the newer vehicles not including all the upgrades. There's nothing wrong with games that are focused on grinding. People play them because the grinding seems worth the value to them. However this just isn't the case with GTA O and should never be for any GTA game. Online seems like a great idea because online multiplayer is just how most friends are able play together these days. I just want to go into Los Santos and do hood rat stuff with my friends. Instead players are punished for doing anything that is outside of grinding. If you want to call a jet then it will cost you money. If you want to shoot down a jet then it will cost you a lot money in ammo. If you want to blow up a car who's been driving around camping you then it will cost you money to fix it. The more appartments/offices you buy the higher the daily fee and more money it will cost you. Having fun in this game is meant to drain your resources and make you go back to grinding.For a game that has continuously had updates after almost four years it's dissapointing to see such a step back in progress for the GTA series. The lack of any extra content for single player GTA V the most recent stance and ban on modding and the fact that GTA O's purpose is to push microtransactions has really destroyed what I originally considered to be a pretty fun game in a great series.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-28,0,0,59,False,Recommended,GTA5 the most fascinating is that its shape lo st this virtual city excellent animation making lo st this virtual city seemed so real natural environment geological features are impressive. And not only is it big but the GTA5 is also giving a lesson to other open world games in terms of filling sanddish content. In addition to the plotline the abundance of strangers and weirdos random tasks hobbies and pastimes can be a lasting obsession in this open world of sand. It's fair to say that you only feel like you have too much fun to play in the game and you don't know where to start and you don't feel like you have to repeat or have nothing to do. The game is very rich and I don't want to take the game out of my PS3. What I like most about the story is trev his dare to hate his straightforward personality makes me very much looking forward to it even though he has a lot of craziness but it also highlights the charm of the character. Game has three end and I do but I think most people should choose the third way the ending Steve DE all these story for us to hate guy kill feeling really very few. GTA5 of course is not perfect too few pedestrians on the road that it's a pity for lo st is set in Los Angeles the bustling downtown pedestrian is really strange. It is also regrettable that the existence of the GTAOL has led to the absence of a single scenario DLC. Overall it's fair to say that GTA5 is a great thing to say not a decade or at least one of the most difficult things to do in five years. Hope Rockstar can bring more surprises to us in GTA6! As for me after GTA5 I intend to continue to explore luoshengdu and take the series of old works out and play with them again and fall in love with this series.,Grand Theft Auto V

So that's not saying much at all.I got the game because I got a bit bored of messing around in Just Cause 2. And this as it turns out nowhere near as much fun.The biggest reason I don't like the game is because it feels empty. Aside from main story there is nothing to do in single player. Side missions are utter garbage. I get that multi player has a lot of activities but I am not interested in yet another dm game. And neither am I interested racing in a game with keyboard/mouse controls being this broken. There are far better racing games than whatever this is.

2017-08-09,0,0,87,False,Recommended,When this game came out I'd have given it a 10/10 for sure and as far as the single player goes I still do. This is an amazingly fun game with well written characters and a plethora of things to do and see. That being said the multiplay went from being fun to literally being treated like an MMO where the dev's expect you to grind out missions for cash just to be able to afford ammo. Because they've lowered the money reward from doing most missions people tend to do the same jobs over and over. The heists give decent cash but they take so long to do and are such a pain to complete that finding a full crew to actually do one is nearly impossible.If you buy this game play it for the single player and leave the multiplayer alone microtransactions and trying to sell in game currency has ruined it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-10,0,0,67,False,Recommended,Fun singleplayer with some great characters acting gameplay and open world. As we've come to expect from Rockstar. Multiplayer not so much. If you're buying this for the multiplayer then I'd advise you not to waste your money just get the Multiplayer mod for Just Cause 2 or 3 it does what this game does much better and with ten times the fun. To elaborate if you want to rank up in multiplayer expect to grind endless hours and be killed constantly by other players. I'm not against microtransactions if it's for cosmetic reasons but to give other players an advantage just because they spent more money? For shame. I'd tear more into the multiplayer but if that were the case I'd be spending all day writing this review but I'll give this game a thumbs up just for the singleplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-04,0,0,2038,False,Recommended,My total hours played are actually closer to 1 100 hours just on one online character. Steam says it's less because it isn't counting my time on the Xbox 360.With that said the story is decent and definitely the best GTA story (still nothing compared to Red Dead Redemption).Online was awesome until I came to PC. The only reason I put up with the hordes of modding/cheating children is beacause the PC has better graphics and framerates. However once you've made some friends the online is awesome if you do private servers with people you trust to be honorable. Honorable modders are some of the best friends you can have in GTA Online. They give you cash and provide some unique experiences (have you swam with whales after diving off of your $10M personal yacht? Or hunt deer around Mt. Chilliad? I have!).Rockstar does their darnedest to put down the money giving modders (R* keeps pedling their stupid Shark Cards) but ignoring the noob modders that blow up everyone in the entire server force global suicides disable vehicles kick and lock you out of personal vehicles remove all of your weapons spawn s*** on your head so you can't see... I think you get the idea. You'll pretty much have a crappy K/D if you're just starting due to the friggin' god mode modders. Pretty much the only thing this game is good for now is blowin' off steam and cruising around in your cars and jets in passive mode.If you're looking for a competitive multiplayer game that cracks down on cheaters look elsewhere.If you want a game with great visuals a decent story and an excellent sandbox for you and your friends to tool around in this is your game. I'm recommending it because I keep playing it. I only give a thumbs down if I don't continue to play and have little good to say about a game. GTA V is a lot of fun but if you don't plan to mod and cheat be prepared for a sea of d bags online.,Grand Theft Auto V

I strongly suggest anyone who has not given it a try to at least play a few hours and give it a shot. You will not be dissapointed.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-26,0,0,466,False,Recommended,"Well I believe I can give an honest review for this game with the time I've put into it.. Overall is it a good game yes. Does it have its issues yes. Would I do it all over again yes. Basically to sum it up I bought the game a while back because a couple friends got it and from their description it sounded amazing in fact GTAV is one of only a couple games I bought at full price. They've long since moved on but I still found myself coming back so there's definitely an enjoyable aspect to the game and Rockstar did well by releasing new content to keep the fanbase engaged.There are downsides though starting off with connectivity issues. This was designed for consoles and when bringing it to the PC Rockstar didn't change anything so we have and outdated and horrible system for going online.. the user has very little control on where they're put. Also Rockstar became money hungry. The game allowed users to hack and in the beginning very little was done to punish them and because of this many people became ""rich"" which led to them being able to afford anything in the game. Rockstar decided that becuase the community was inflated they would jack ""in game"" prices for products to an astronomical level to balance the system.. that didn't work. Legit players felt left out and some believed the only way around this was to buy Shark cards. While Shark cards were always there they really became popular and once Rockstar saw this game over. They've made insane amounts off of these purchases and everything now days essentially revolves around this idea.Rockstar also has turned a new leaf and updated their ban policy which how they do it makes no sense and people are being banned for no reason because Rockstar system believes they're cheating. The community is and rightly so. Bottom line I'll enjoy what I have but I'm not sure if I'll support Rockstar for future developments.. guess time will tell.",Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-26,0,0,33,False,Recommended,I think it is safe to say that this was one of the greatest games to come over the past few years.

2016-11-25,0,0,213,False,Recommended,Great entry into the GTA games. I've been playing them since the days of GTA2 top down madness. Maybe not the greatest of storylines but lets be honest we don't play GTA for the storylines the fact that there is a decent plotline to move us along in our exploration of the sand box is all we need. The interplay between the three protagonists was IMHO great and garnered quite a few laughs. game play is smooth enough that what few gliches I've seen are forgivable. Now as far as the online play...I do enjoy it really I do but that being said there is still a lot left to be worked on. I get that people don't want to put in the grind to achive what some others are pay to play achiving. I get that there are times that you feel super out classed by others on the server. I get that it can be frustrating but that is no excuse for the hacks short cuts poor gaming sportmanship that can SOMETIMES occur. So TL DR between lame community members and rockstars lazy admin what could be a stellar online game is marred IMHO. STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-14,0,0,977,False,Recommended,I have been waiting for this game to come out on PC forever and when it finally did I was so happy. While I could have gotten this on my PS3 which I play very rarely it wouldn't have been as good as the PC version. The game was worth the long wait and several delays. This is a phenomenal game and is almost perfect in everyway. The story is engaging and intereesting and the insane heist you pull off are amazing fun. Online is mixed though. It is very good and I like it better than story but the thing that sets it back on PC are the cheaters and constant connection problems. Online is most fun when you are playing with several friends and in a private session.Public sessions can still be fun but most of the time you will be running or hiding from some cheater who is shooting exploding bullets from a jet. Some modders are nice though specifically the ones who use their mods to have fun with other and sometimes drop money. But if someone is dropping money be sure to not pick up too much or you could get banned. Overall GTAV on PC is an amazing game with a great story and fun online just stay away from most cheaters.9/10 would be 10/10 if there were less cheaters.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-26,0,0,766,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is an massive open world action adventure video game which gives you the possibility to play with 3 protagonists named Michael Franklin and last but not least Trevor.GENERALRockstar support it's just so so BAD.Let's say you get banned somehow ( not cheating )If you call them you can purely not fall at a understanding with them but to hang up the phone remaining in a big question mark.As well as trying to report an online bug you will receive an useless automatic message meaning that they don't care in short.The graphics are almost flawless beautiful.The gameplay on the other hand is not that good to be honest there are stuff that are missing fun things that GTA 4 has and GTA 5 hasn't but it could've had if Rockstar wasn't only focusing on the graphics.Exemple throwing with things yes in GTA 4 if you want to throw a cigarette you can throw a cigarette.Psychics and mechanics The cars feels like they don't really have weight when it comes to handling and at that they could have done better believe me...and it could feel weird if you're a nostalgic.SINGLE PLAYERThe campaign is good though it's mainly about robbing banks for the government where the three receive some of it.And now you might think it could get boring well not really.The robbing way is different for every heist you don't do the same thing which is an extremly good thing that they cared about it.You get to choose the way you like it silent or fulll force forward.Then depends of what did you choose you get to collect the necessary materials for the heist and then you take actions against.The voice acting is fabulous like you watch a movie but you have the control of it.Interesting easter eggs which can be difficult to find but some of them are worth a try even if you got to do stupid things.The map is big you get to choose the way you like to ''live'' in the desert or in the city or perhaps you just might want to hunt some animals.Second missions are also interesting to take a look at.ONLINEThe online could be toxic could not be.Depends on what type of session you got.Could be named PAY2WIN could not be.You can stay 5 days a week two weeks a month and so on to farm money because you need those cars those equipments those planes that figher jet named Hydra in order to succes your missions.Or you can spend a lot of money on SharkCards so you don't have to bother about cash anymore.Or you can just sit there poor which of course it's not fun at all.Basically you CANNOT really have fun if you don't have enough money and you can never have enough in this game and that destroys the fun.(It's the only argument that makes me to not recommend the game)The hackers problems of course.For example in a session which i was in for about half hour i got 2 Godmode modders a teleporter modder and a vehicle spawn modder that's 4 hackers in a session for 30 min.Constant DLC's which is good and bad because another tons of money spent both in game and in real life if so and you need make them again and again because DLC's cannot stop coming i already spoke about why that's not fun at all.Tons of missions many of them do repeat but hey that's why it's named Grand Theft Auto.CONCLUSIONAfter all this long review i guess you already have an opinion which can be a good one more or less...Be concerned that if you buy the game you need to have more money so you can have the experience that you wanted.Overall i don't recommend it because of it's lack of support and pay2win.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,216,False,Not Recommended,For 10 years now the Grand Theft Auto series has been edited and modded by people to make the game more enjoyable. Hundreds if not thousands of people have bought one or all of Grand Theft Auto SA Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V just to mod it. The modding of these games have been done mostly in singleplayer and with the help of OpenIV a software that lets you get into the game's files and replace vehicles scripts textures etc. The closing of OpenIV leaves 10 000s of people without access to be able to mod their games and leaves 10 000s of people without the ability to continue their hobbies. All modding used by OpenIV is for singleplayer use only to make the game more enjoyable the software OpenIV was never used to mod multiplayer or Grand Theft Auto Online so it does not harm anyone. Myself and other members of the LSPDFR and GTA modding community ask that OpenIV be allowed to continue distributing and running as a modding software and that the modding of the Grand Theft Auto series including SA IV and V be deemed legal again as Rockstar Games has said in the past.

Just be careful when receiving free money because you can get Perma Ban. So just watch out best idea when you realise theres a modder in lobby? Leave lobby and join new one.

2016-01-23,0,0,40,False,Recommended,GTA is game sieries that i grew up with. I love GTA V and I highly HIGHLY recomend GTA V the free roam aspect and GTA Online addition is great fun and i hope to put many more hours more into this game. The story takes place 2013 early 2014 and overlooks three funny crazy and evil people Michael Franklin and Trevor In Los Santos San Andreas. The campaign has 3 Big hiests and lots of missions and side missions. I got GTAV on xbox 360 at midnight launch and pre orderd xbox one edition But PC edition i bought on Christmas day but still love it!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-23,0,0,909,False,Recommended,Rockstar made a beautiful game in GTA V with incredible attention to detail ranging from police pulling the bodies of their dead partners into cover to a working doppler effect changing the sound of car engines and horns as they move past you. Online is filled with hackers and as of yet not much has been done to stop them by rockstar but if you are playing with people you know it's great fun and adds another layer of chaos to the game. I found the storyline to be lacking especially compared to San Andreas and despite a map hailed as being bigger than GTA SA IV and RDR combined it felt smaller than San Andreas' map at times because there was only the one city. IMO if GTA V had included San Fierro and Las Venturas and altered the storyline to suit it would have almost been perfect but I guess I'll have to wait for Rockstar to remaster San Andreas.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,94,False,Not Recommended,Take Two just killed the game and its community. It was a good run while it lasted but apparently our relationship is now over. When a publisher starts fighting and makes legal threats towards its own customers then it's time to move on. Any company that tries to kill its own modding community deserves no support. Spend your money on someone who will appreciate it and continue to deliver the products you want rather than deciding for you how you are allowed to play.For those who have a craving for more open world action I would recommend the Just Cause series or Saints Row as the companies behind those understand the wants and needs of the playerbases and will instead encourage them to do all the whacky shenanigans they desire.,Grand Theft Auto V

And Trevor doesn't disappoint.And some of it is my fault. I can't play the game on ultra graphics.But still. You drive here. Pick something up. Drive there. Shoot someone in the face. Cops don't like that.You drive away real fast. Drop someone off. Go home save. Rinse repeat.The characters in the cutscenes are ALWAYS ing about something. WHY are they so unhappy?Seriously. You don't have to get up and go to work to earn a wage to pay the bills. You have more money thananyone around. You can do whatever you want in life and get away with it steal rob murder screw anyone whatever. And I almost want to push the mute button cause they are a bunch of whining butt hurt crybabies. Not my kind of gangster (except for Trevor. He's the man. Of course.)I don't like the bank robbery mechanic. It's like Rockstar ran out of ideas. If I wanted to strategize I would play a different kind of game.No one will read this because everyone knows what GTA is. So Hi Mom!Buy it. Play. It's freaking Grand Theft Auto.

It's well optimized it suppots triple screens with no issue and runs it phenomenally well even on older hardware it looks great it runs well even on potato level hardware it's controls are tight and rockstar has used their shark card money to fund a crew that has stuffed this game to the gills with content. Hell there was another update just yesterday that added a whole new set of vehicles buyable buildings and missions into the game.I have spent over 250 dollars on copies of this game for me and those around me and it's still beating my dollar an hour rule for steam.I can rant about this game forever but the TLDR is this This game is indescribably good and the pc version is it's final form. Buy it ASAP Edit Unfortunately I have to rescind my good review even with all of the fun and awesome content that this game has to offer.The outright disdain for the modding community by rockstar and take two is disheartening.

2016-08-14,0,0,136,False,Recommended,So after practically quitting console gaming and moving solely to my PC for gaming I have been wanting to get GTA5 again. I read multiple negative reviews regarding hackers online and even still I said it and decided to buy it. I have only put 19 hours or so into the game so far and I haven't really run into any major hackers online that I can see. It essentially feels the same as the Xbox One version to me. I read something about Rockstar cracking down on hackers. I don't know if that is true but I haven't noticed anything yet.My only gripe with the game is an antialiasing issue which causes crawling jagged edges on a lot of the textures especially the minimap ffs. Every line is jagged. I am running an i5 with a 4gb r9 380 at 2560x1080 on high settings with a good 60fps lock. Have never had any aliasing issues on any other games. I have tweaked settings to no avail. FXAA on or off doesn't seem to make a difference. MSAA seems to help a bit but makes the game crawl at 20fps. I tried a standard 16 9 monitor thinking maybe that had something to do with it and it didn't change anything. The game runs and plays flawlessly with the exception of this ing AA. If anyone has a solution feel free to reply to this as I can't seem to find anything online.,Grand Theft Auto V

I know what you're trying to do which is subtley push us into online which is pay to play because everything is so expensive you would have to buy a shak card just to make it tolerable (if that) to play ATTENION ROCKSTAR AND T2 IF YOU REALLY WANNA MAKE MONEY MAKE YOUR OWN LEGIT MODS AND MAKE A POLICE EXPANSION PACK FOR SINGLE PLAYER ATLEAST TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A COP!

A bit taxing on the PC but having a beefy computer means I'm not really affected by that at all. Would like to see more in terms of player rewards. I have literally no reason to keep playing this game. My characters in the main story are poor af (on like the second heist) and even online I have to be cautions of losing what money I have (not much) due to other players who've hoarded cash and terrorize other players.

However gets repetitive at times.And now Multiplayer features Pros *Litterately countless ammounts of missions and races.*Play with friends.*Heists that you can play pretty much at any time.*Freemode activities (golf tennis imprompt races etc).Cons *Alot of work to earn money.*Microtransactions to get easy money.*Many ""kill all"" logic players (is this even the games fault?).MP Conclusion Great fun if you have lots of time and friends to play with in a private lobby.And of course standard GTA functions like Tons of cars with customizations aerial vechiles boats and all manners of crazy things. Theese apply to both MP and SP.All in all a great game that is worth every little bit of currency it costs. Great fun to be had during a stupidly long time (im talking 5+ years here people.)

Here are some honerable mentionsEvery Call of Duty in existance especially Advanced Warfare and World at WarOk. Grand Theft Auto V despite all of the contraversy is a pretty outstanding game on pretty much all of the consoles. on the pc you can run the game at 4K resolution which I will never try purely because I dont have a 4K monitor. moving onSingle Player is not worth talking about. everyone has different experiences in terms of mods gameplay etc.Online? well outstanding with friends good with other nice people and terrible with hackers. once again grow a pair and find another session when this happens easy fix.Updates are a constant thing with this game so lets skip all the other updates I forgot to review and lets cover the bikers updateFirstly great job with the Finance and Felony update because this is like the more crinimalised version of itOverall rating 7/10Great game with issues that WILL BE FIXED be patient R* do enforce a zero tolerance policy for cheating and regulary do a mass sweep to find and ban the people who are cheating and put them in the cheater's pool.,Grand Theft Auto V

With literally nothing to do in the online side of GTA many of us turned to modding singleplayer.

2015-06-27,0,0,322,False,Recommended,I'm going to recommend the game only because I got my good fun out of it.The singleplayer story mode has all types of different kinds of stuff to do if you don't feel like following the story there's wildlife and animals minigames trippy flowers to eat in order to turn into one of these animals. While GTA Online is simply just breathtaking and a good amount of fun the community however has never been good and mostlikely will never be. Then again that goes for a lot of other games aswell. But with friends GTA online is quite simply amazing. With the community being so toxic it's quite hard to complete heists surely it is doable but with the wrong people you will be sitting for hours on end not being able to complete them. Which makes heists semi unplayable atleast while not playing with friends.Aswell as just the community being toxic that can include cheaters/modders aswell you will come across quite a bit of these. However you just make your own lobby or play with a friend in their lobby.Another part of the GTA online experience are that there are no actual servers/dedicated servers everything is peer 2 peer it's not lobby like all the information of people in a range of eachother is sent from person 2 person.So say your internet connection isn't the best you will have a hard time playing. Especially if you are from Africa or parts of Asia where faster internet connections are quite rare. Well downloading 60GB wouldn't be ideal then either I suppose.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-14,0,0,415,False,Recommended,A good game but you can't seam to use a joystock for planes and streeing wheels are out. On the pluss side car dasboards are fun and would like to see you support stearing wheels for PC. I thought the game was good for shooting in Iron sight mode which was fun. Crouch and prone would have added more value as a shooter. I thought there was go ing to be great sex sceens but it was not there. They could have anded a male strip bar for adult women for a laugh and go all the way and add real love sceens with graphic action. It has all the bad words but no real graphic action in the love making. The cars top speeds are missing and Doge spider look a like should have been able to reach speeds of 150mph. The most I could get in the cars is 110mph in the 5.5lt cars. You can not increase top speed with turbos or Transmissions so there is no point in spending money unless you want to change colour or style. If you did do a real performance boost in a car in the real world of driving you could increase top speed depending on gear box and turbo.There is so mutch more they could add and if you are into mods may be someone will turn it round and make the Aston look alike hit 150mph or 170mph in the super cars as you would expect. In real world I drove a capri 3lt bult in 1972 by ford and hit 125mph with an automatic box in the 80s which had only 3 or 4 gears in that auto box. Could you imagine firing in a new auto 6 speed box in that old capri and you would hit a higher top speed 150mph.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-26,0,0,22,False,Recommended,Definitely the best way to experience GTA V I played on 3 different platforms and PC is the one! I'm using a mix of the Steam Controller and M/Kb and the game runs and looks phenomenal (considering it is now a fairly well aged title.) The only real disappointing thing is a lack of a New Game + or similar incentive for unlocking everything again. Also a little peeved that it drops into a huge sale 2 weeks after I buy it but that s just me being a sucker I suppose. Runs great on older hardware but you ll want lots of system RAM to free up the GPU and CPU unless you have a high end card (running a GTX 780 here.)It s the best version of GTA V especially if you have the hardware to boot and like a mix of controller and M/KB. But buy it on sale probably a deep one because there really isn t that much added as far as content and it is an old game. If it's between this or The Witcher go Witcher Actually the Hitman team could stand to steal some stuff from GTA V.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-05,0,0,43,False,Recommended,While I am very aware of the price tag change situation during the 2015 Summer Sales I purchased the game from a third party at around 30% off and thus my review will be only about my experience with the story mode in GTA5. I did not play GTA5 Online due to rampant hackers and the fact that I'm taking a break from online play after unhealthy relationships in Dota 2. xDAlso GTA5 is the first 'next gen' title I played on a new custom gaming PC after finally clearing a long list of old titles I purchased from sales I find it necessary to give a brief preformance review. My i7 4790k (not overclocked) GeForce GTX 970 8GB RAM system supports the game at a constant 60FPS on HIGH settings at 1600x900 resolution (running from LOW MED HIGH ULTRA). I only notice a dip in FPS when driving at high speeds but it never goes below 45. However one issue I had was the time it took for start up. You have to sign in to SocialClub go through an unskippable startup video select Story Mode (the autoload doesn't work) and then wait really long for the load. For someone who doesn't like to play for long continuous hours this is really tedious. That said the game runs absoultely smoothly thereafter.And now to the good stuff. OH BOY did I enjoy the story. I'll list the things I liked in point form as there are too many to organise 1. You play as 3 interesting and lovable characters each with very well crafted backgrounds personalities separate side missions and unique ablilities. Franklin your young homeboy wishing to make it big in Los Santos is an excellent driver with the abilty to slow time while driving to make incredibly precise turns. He is also the only character who can join street races. Michael an ex bank robber who made a shady deal in order to retire is brought back into the fray when his terrifying best friend showed up at his mansion. He is skilled in firefights slowing down time to take hostiles down one by one. Last but not least Trevor who looks 99% like Paul Blackthorne your one and only phychopath.2. There are a large variety of missions in the main campaign. During which you get to drive cars planes helis a submarine tow cars for a useless friend assassinate targets with a sniper rifle race on a bicycle etc etc. I never once felt bored when playing the story.3. There are also a large number of side quests available. These include hobbies from street racing and patronising strip clubs to triathlon and yoga. Alternatively you could just punch people on the streets (or shoot them) and run from the police (or blow them up). I would say police assault is the toughest and most annoying part about the game but I guess that's the most relastic it can be in a video game.4. For the few heists that you have to pull off there are usually 2 possible approaches and players can choose their preferred playstyle. You get to select the crew such a gunmen IT experts or getaway drivers and their importance depends on the approach you chose. Their cut also differs and this made planning a robbery interesting. 5. The choice you have to make in the finale seems like a nobrainer to me after falling in love with the characters. This mission sums up the game nicely and puts the story to a satisfying closure. Much like the Arkham series you get to continue playing after the finale and you can attempt to complete the side quests or replay missions for a better score.As for improvements to the game I would like the loading time to be cut short as mentioned earlier. Also I think a possible tweek to the police assault is after getting out of radar the police forces continue to patrol the area (non stop) and all you have to do is to drive away and get a new vehicle etc. Of course if you get caught back in the radar assault continues. I think this will be more realistic than waiting a (non specified) duration and then the police just suddenly stops pursuit even if you appear right beside them. What do you think? I really enjoyed the gameplay of GTA5. 10/10 Story.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,471,False,Not Recommended,GTA V singleplayer recommendedGTA Online not recommended at all.The Online is an utter mess and a stripped out version of the single player (no animals no cable cars no stock market etc.) The micro transactions completely ruin the economy of the game. It takes hours and hours to earn money yet most of the best cars are over a million dollars each. Nothing is priced reasonably ($30 000 for a leather jacket?) and most of the modifications and all of the weapons are level locked. This is one of the most grindy games I've played. I'm certain this is Rockstar's plan make it grindy sell them a short cut in the form of microtransactions. I'm honestly not surprised that there are so many hackers it doesn't even bother me anymore.If you were hoping for some GTA IV styled multiplayer fun using mods with friends avoid this. It's impossible to play the fantastic LSPDFR mod with friends.Single player though great.,Grand Theft Auto V

Will be buying again for the PS4 now due to issues listed below either way though.Worst controls ever. I played this a lot on ps3. Wanted to put it on my PC and experience the better graphics.

2016-07-15,0,0,78,False,Recommended,REASON FOR REVIEW To many people give this game a bad review because they cheat in some way and get banned use modded accounts/money (through hackers giving it to them) and get banned go against the ToS and get banned or expect free things from R*. Don't hate me im just giving an honest opinion from a player who has played GTA 5 since the game released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 then again on the PS4 and Xbox 1 and now PC. Iv played for over 39 days 19 hours since GTA 5 originally released... so if you look at my steam time and think im not experienced enough... you better look at my R* account first before I drop the proof that I know this game.One of the Best GTA games out there. San Andreas tops it only in the scale and variety of things you can do. I have had a TON of time with this game on PS3 then PS4 and now PC. My experience has never been better. GTA 5 single player has alot to do and has a great story. Having Micheal Franklin and Trevor to run around with and perform heists is one of the best new features of a GTA game. Now GTA Online gets a ton of flak from people saying they have been banned or have encountered a hacker. 2 responces 1 If you have been banned submit a ticket and wait. Yes waiting is annoying BUT R* has alot of tickets to sift through your not the only one with an issue that needs to be addressed. I have submitted many tickets and have had all of them resolved within 4 days at most. Everything from being banned to missing vehicles has been fixed. You need to remember that the anti cheat system is automated so if you do get banned you need to notify R* is you believe it was an incorrect ban. Once they get to your ticket they will review why you were banned by the system and IF it was an incorrect ban they will revoke it and let you play again. However try to lie about it they will do nothing. Also try to be respectful to R* support like I said they have alot of tickets to sift through and they dont have to deal with someone who is rude and swearing at them all the time. As for hackers... Come on... ALL PC games have hackers yes GTA online has hackers but as more hackers appear tons are banned without us even knowing. Simply report them and leave the game dont try to fight them argue with them or troll them. THEY ARE TROLLS simply leave and stop feeding them to prevent any issues. I have encountered them and have yet to see any real need to rage at R* since I understand that you can LEAVE THE GAME AND FIND ANOTHER. If they follow you just take a break for a bit so they lose interest they are fueled by those who react to them simply ignore them and leave. If you think its R*'s falt for hackers... you should really start to learn about programming computers and networks in general. Im lucky in that Computer Science is my profession.Anyways the game offers alot of playability in single player and online. Just make sure to be careful in Online to prevent falling for scams idiots and trolls. I highly recommend watching some videos on tips and tricks for GTA there are a TON of things that you may not clue into without them. Talking about the game in terms of vehicles and customization Tons of vehicles split between air sea and land that really make the game fun. Sure online they can be pricy but the cash does roll in if you do missions heists and other activites doing nothing no money. Customization exists in the player's character such as tattoos clothing facepaint and more.Cars can be customized aswell.Its a great game that people need to stop blamming for their own problems. If you enjoy GTA pick this up on sale. PS(Try to stay away from shark cards... sure they are a good idea for quick cash but honestly the real price for the ingame cash is rediculous. 5 bucks for 200k? I can make 200k in under an hour id rather buy a burger and drink for that 5 bucks for the 3 hours I play that makes me around 500k 900k depending on what im doing.),Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-14,0,0,66,False,Not Recommended,Yaknow this game for the most part is pretty enjoyable the story is a good time and the open world is basically one giant sandbox for you to play in and with modding it was even better.For any of you who own skyrim on pc (if you dont what are you doing get out from under your rock and buy it) most of the time whenever you wanted to mod you needed SKSE. Well Rockstar decided to kill GTAV's version of SKSE by sending the mod author a cease and decist order so now the modding scene is basically gutted through and through. Why you may ask? Because if you can mod all of the online stuff into singleplayer then that means they can't drag all of you out to online and wind up forcing you to buy shark cards because of the near extortionist prices on everything!.Btw here's something the CEO of Take Two (Rockstar's parent company) said about GTA Online players.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v xEYGhks8CRkEDIT okay heres somewhat of a review so this isnt just my openIV tyrade. Alright so I'm going to make this short singleplayer is great fun. The vanilla story is incredibly fun to play through with heists that all feel unique and each character having their own story to tell I could recommend this game just on the merits of the singleplayer mdoe.However I'm not recommending the game and here's why.Most of the issues I have with this game are with the online mode which most will turn to if they dont want to mod their game (which is pretty understandable seeing that modding your game gives you a good chance of getting banned from playing the online despite most singleplayer mods not even touching the code that has to do with multiplayer). So the online overall is a massive grind that leads you into more grinding so you can get a nice car thats all maxed out only for a more expensive and better car to come out in the next patch. In order to do anything that arent the stale fetch quests which so happen to be your only real source of early game income since you need a p nice house in order to be able to do heists is to either grind out the money for a nice enough home so you can set up heists or to grind out the money in order to start a corporation and do things like smuggling and gunrunning.Keep in mind in order to start a corporation you need about $1.2mil (which so happens to be the amount of money that a $20 shark card gives you nj rockstar /) and then in order to get better warehouses for smuggling you have to grind out more money and in order to get a bunker to do gunrunning you have to grind out even more stupid amounts of money! What fun and intuitive gameplay that offers multiple forms of entry into the late game without too many time consuming barriers! Wow!Oh and don't get me started on the community for online good god. Some of the people you meet will be pretty cool if you're lucky you can crack a good joke to a hacker and you'll be set up with enough money to jump past all the grinding but most will either be people who camp you and force you to enter passive mode which doesnt really let you do much or you'll meet some zygotes who still need a parent's permission to go on Disney.com who are swallowing their mics and screaming how they banged your mom I built a gaming pc to escape XBox but I guess you can't really escape toxic online communities unless you dedicate your life to playing single player games and never asking for help getting through them . Also the online character creator has you select your grandparents and then those affect your parents etc. For whatever reason you can't just directly modify your online character but instead have to get a degree in geneology in order to get a character you're happy with. All in all I am no big fan of the online at all if you couldnt tell already.TL DRModding and singleplayer are a blast and you can waste countless hours messing around in the singleplayer sandbox rockstar has laid out.Singleplayer gets a 7/10Online makes you want to die almost immediately unless you're one of those people who enjoy grinding.So online for me gets like a 2/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-30,0,0,116,False,Not Recommended,"Everyone involved in creating GTA V Congratulations you made a fun immersive addicting game.To the point now yeah? I have the same issue as everyone else the game is basically 4 years old and there is still no such thing as single player DLC. It could not be more obvious that this game is maliciously designed to be a black hole for the gamer's money (not just in game money). Everything in the game seems to have been amazingly made to be as life like as possible EXCEPT for EVERYTHING that costs money to the player as they cost two arms and two legs. I understand that a profit has to be made but honestly it sickens me that (after 4 years still) the game is $60 on Steam. YOU'VE MADE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE!! The irony could not be better explained in that your new ""Oppressor"" vehicle (DLC) translates to around $25 US currency per person. That thing was so simple to create that it probalby took 1 developer 1 day to make and that's just one vehicle out of countless others available it's oppressing the everyday gamer. Whereas for any other game DLC on Steam you can get a whole new map plus weapons etc. for the same price which likely required multiple developers working for weeks and weeks. Comparatively THIS DLC IS REAL LIFE HIGHWAY ROBBERY. To put all of this into context if you bought this game recently you will confront a plethora of ""DLC"" vehicles and add ons which will render you useless in the online realm and if you have any hope of combatting them be prepared to shed out another $100 at least for the Rockstar/Take Two scam that is Shark Cards. Either that or be prepared to spend months grinding to get that in game cash yourself. I'm glad that the Steam community rose up against the devs especially in light of the recent modder bans that eradicated both guilty and innocent players without appeal because it apparently threatened the company's profit. As if it wasn't worth the trouble to develop anti cheat into the game to show their players some respect. Just absolutely sickening. Don't expect any of these negative aspects to change because the developers are only going to focus on how to rob us all over again in their next games from here on out.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-27,0,0,45,False,Not Recommended,So I had already made a previous review on this game that was a lot more basic... But now that I've been expieriencing some other problems I got some more stuff to say. So my general thoughts with this game so far is that I completely and utterly wasted the 20 dollars I payed for this game (thank god it was only 20). Why? Well when I first started the game it brought me through this long and painful social club setup process and then after I got through that it then made me confirm the license key(...?) that apparently came with the game. Odd process as I have never seen it for any other game. Anyways upon loading into the actual game for the first time it set all my graphics to lowest at 800x600 despite my graphics card being able to run much higher.. Then I had to wrestle with the game to turn my settings up because it kept turning it back to lower resolutions. When I got into the first mission of the story mode I got the absolute worst screentearing despite the FPS sitting at around 80 so to fix that I turned on vsync. Once I got to drive a car for the first time I started to notice this awful stuttering that would happen any time I went under 60 FPS. I started looking online for solutions and didn't come across much. I was messing with the nvidia control panel to turn on vsync in there instead when to my horror the game launcher started crashing upon trying to start it up. I again looked online for solutions but nothing there worked either. So I just finally gave in and decided to reinstall the game (forgot to mention that the game is giant and takes about 8 hours to install for me not very impressive). When that was done I tried to launch the game again and low and behold the launcher crashed again. I'm not gonna play the game again (not like I can anyways) until this gets fixed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-19,0,0,1387,False,Recommended,GTA V is simply described as GTA san andreas but with awsome graphics. An enoumous ammount of vehicles and weapons is availble and even when you have done all of the storyline missions you still have lots to to and if you want to you can replay all missions.Honestly I havn't realy played Online but from the small ammount of time that I have it seems amazing.The few things that are negative about the game are that in my opinion the Storyline was a little bit short (about 30 missions) and you can't realy interact with NPC's the way I had hoped for but over all it's still by far the best GTA game even if you don't take the improved graphics into the equation,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-07-19,0,0,603,False,Recommended,Great enjoyable game but there are some things i dont like about this game.Single player 1. no money cheat codes like Gta San Andreas.2. cops impound your car (cars you buy from the net) when you leave it in the street for like 5 minutes.3. its takes time to get money from purchased bussiness properties.4. when you play alot of boring with most strangers and freaks they wont give you money and you will kill them.multiplayer 1. its hard to earn money to buy great cars and vehicles espcaily after the ill gotten gains updates. 2. alot of hackers some are great that gives you money but the other are annoying that can kill you by a push of a bottom.3. not alot of stuff to do in free mode.But after all its a great game espicaily if you play it with a friend.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-14,0,0,283,False,Recommended,"Great Single player story with interesting characters and set pieces although the heists are pathetically underwhelming. There are only 3 heists that involve you getting s of money while every other one is done for the story's sake. The gameplay harkens back to San Andreas in that the world is rather massive and very richly detailed although unlike San Andreas the story campaign is comparatively puny with only 69 missions while I never actually beat San Andreas but I'm pretty sure it had no ending (joke). So like San Andreas it the gameplay generally devolves into cop shootouts/chases and that's really it. The Graphics are stunning but in the modern AAA gaming sector that's not a selling point anymore. I've read about people having consistent issues with hackers and I myself only encountered one in a grand total of 77 games so I think the issue has been more or less addressed at this point. I will say that PC gamers are extremely quick to whine ""hacker"" when they aren't doing too well as this is unequvically proven in Battlefield 4 where I once was kicked for ""hacking"" by an admin when in reality I was just doing really well. The community in GTA Online is one of the worst communities I have ever seen. The number of times that I have witnessed a player drop out of a lobby just because we failed is impossible to keep record of. On top of that I've done entire heist setups for hours and not actually gotten to play a heist because a player ed off. I blame this on Rockstar allowing such low level dunces access to heists. I mean LEVEL 12? ARE YOU GUYS OUT OF YOUR ING MINDS? Also online players will not hesitate for one moment to just blindly kill you for no reason forcing you to turn on passive mode or leave the game there are very rarely servers where somebody isn't being a head. Speaking of the heists only the Humane Labs Raid Pacific Standard and arguably the first heist are actually decent. Series A is not actually a heist it just pays well and the Prison Break is much to difficult too justify the reward. I not too subtly hinted at the fact that the heist setups can be the only thing you do for days at a time because people are constantly dropping out and finding a half decent team is more difficult than it sounds. This can usually be solved by joining a seperate crew but I just think that the standards for joining heists should be higher like raising the level requirement from TWELVE to 50 or 60 and punishing people when they drop out. The thing that I love most about the online however is creating a private lobby with just you and a group of good friends because it turns into the best game of all time where you and your buddies can just around in the sandbox. I do have even more issues though such as the fact that Rockstar WAS bringing down the ban hammer against people who modded the single player but they've all but stopped doing that by most accounts. Another issue I have is that modding the game is somewhat finnicky as Rockstar gives no real support for it and you'll find yourself rolling back the single player just to get mods to work. My biggest issue is here ROCKSTAR NEEDS I REPEAT NEEDS TO MAKE MORE ING HEISTS! The current ensemble of Heists is pathetic and as I have mentioned earlier isn't even very good. The reason that we can all assume that they are hesitant to do this is because more heists more money to be earned rather than bought by players. Now this game is by no means pay to win but it you over in the same way that pay to win games do with all the cool stuff being locked behind ridiculous pay walls and higher level caps (which is good). With the advent of the heists you'll find yourself only playing the Pacific Standard and the Humane Labs Raid as the other ones are not worth the effort and you WILL get bored of it. Heists were promised from the very beginning and I have been playing this game since 1 32 AM on September 17th 2013 and it took them until March of 2015 to release the puny amount of heists and that pisses in my ing cheerios. Overall Single Player with(out) mods 7.9/10 Online before heists 5.6/10 After heists being introduced 7/10 Get this game if you enjoy grinding in a GTA atmosphere. (And if you meet the spec requirements)",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,Join a session and a hacker put 45 million into my account this wouldn't be a negative review if R* seemed to be doing anything about this. Every session has people asking for hackers to drop money for them and every second session actually has those hackers dropping money. It kills the pacing of the game when just by launching the game you get given more money you will ever use not to mention if you use any of that money you will likely get banned for a few days. R* will remove it but it took 5 days to remove the hacked in money for me and I don't want to keep track of how much money is hacked in just so I don't spend it and get banned.Other minor complaints are that you can't build playlists outside of the game but you have to add maps there. The grinding of money seems to be tailored to buying shark cards which isn't that much of an issue if you don't mind playing playlists and heists. No dedicated servers recent discouragement of modding (OpenIV) and a few minor issues like how easy it is to accidently slip back into single player (why are single player characters on the character wheel?).The game is fun if you have friends but I would suggest only really playing on a crew/friends session if you don't want to deal with hackers or people killing you every minute. Also grab friends for longer heists i've had some people just leave and kill a session at the end of a long heist just to troll us since at this point in the game most people have tons of money and don't care about heist rewards.,Grand Theft Auto V

Jobs completely ruin the immersion. when you decide to take a job you are taken away from the city put in a textual lobby with the other players like if it was any other FPS game you have to wait for everybody to get in and be ready and then you start the mission. which is like drive a race kill the other team and so on. rinse and repeat.it's stupid. it's just stupid. where's my GTA? where's my open world endless chances? I wanted to DRIVE to the job take the job alone or with my team a la WoW and have fun. But instead no you wait for 3 4 minutes on an endless loading screen then you play a senseless shooter against some random dudes on the internet you win/lose repeat the task till you get your bored and then you're thrown back in some random place of the city. wow what an half job here.PRO the single player is magic as usual.CON online. senseless asian like farming and grinding. nothing else. loadings. infinite loadings. optimization could be better.Buy it with the idea of enjoying the amazing single player experience which is one of the best of all times.

GTA V is an incredible game and the story aspect of it is absolutely fantastic. The online is a how but with friends it can be great fun.However DO NOT BUY GTA V! Not yet at least. The biggest reason people wanted this game on PC even 2 years after it's original release on PS3/Xbox 360 was modding. Modding has made GTA IV last an incredibly long time and it is what makes the singleplayer of GTA V playable after completing it. Modding makes this game incredible fun and the vast majority of mods run off a single mod called OpenIV the ""backbone of the modding scene"" as Dan Hardcastle (NerdCubed) put it. Whats wrong? Take Two Interactive the parent company of Rockstar and 2K Games has issued a cease and desist notice to the makers of the OpenIV mod a mod that has enabled modding in a number of games for a decade now. One of the most popular mods on GTA V (and also one of the main reasons I bought it on PC) the graphical enhancement Redux mod runs on OpenIV. This cease and desist notice will kill the modding community and make the singleplayer of GTA V absolutely worthless. Their reason for doing this is because they were ""undermonetising"" their consumers. As in Take Two wasn't making enough money. So they decide to kill the OpenIV mod which as I've said allows the majority of GTA V mods to work and lets them work together very well. Killing the OpenIV mod forces people to play the GTA Online portion of the game which is riddled with micro macrotransactions in the form of ""Shark Cards"" allowing you to recieve in game money. Why don't people just ignore the shark cards? Because the in game items in GTA Online such as cars and weapons are ludicrously expensive and money only comes easily once you've dropped a cool 1.5 million dollars on an in game business which takes a great deal of time and effort to do itselfOverall Take Two has issued this notice to kill a modding community and to make more money because the greedy s aren't making enough money on a game that made over a billion dollars in it's first day of release and not only that but they released it 3 times! This is cited as being the 4th best selling game of all time and they still want more money from it. Do not buy GTA V do not buy Mafia III do not buy Kerbal Space Program and do not buy/pre order Red Dead Redemption 2. Not until Take Two Interactive stop this tldr Take Two are being s to the modding community don't buy their games.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_ok&amp ab_channel OfficialNerdCubed NerdCubed's video regarding thishttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v xEYGhks8CRk&amp ab_channel JimSterling The Jimquisition episode regarding Take Two's behaviourhttp //www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017 06 15 popular gta mod openiv receives cease and desist from take twohttp //www.pcgamer.com/gta modding tool openiv shuts down claiming cease and desist from take two/",Grand Theft Auto V

(the English text will be attached at the bottom of the article below)In the official statement of the OpenIV team they said they had received letters of attorney in June 5th and decided to announce the news after nearly 10 days of consideration.MOD is an important way to keep a game alive and attract players. Many game companies such as B Blizzard and so on have official MOD tools.GTA series for more than a decade has been a private player to develop their own tools making a variety of interesting MOD.However for MOD the R star is officially turning a blind eye which has left the GTA series of MOD in a gray area.Today the R official has finally come up with a legally effective official statement MOD makes the law illegal.It must be said that this is a very regrettable statement.After a long thought the OpenIV team decided not to go to court because they knew that after months of court debate the end result was not good.So they announced on their website that they would accept the recommendation of the R lawyer's letter and no longer offer OpenIV services that is OpenIV stopped at version 2.9 and there would be no new version of OpenIV later.Implication for the game player the most important thing is there are already installed OpenIV 2.9 best not to uninstall because there will be new also will not have the server providing updates you after unloading will be installed on the OpenIV.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,180,False,Not Recommended,I want to give this a good review I desperatly do. I bought the game at launch on 360 I rebought it for Xbox one at full retail again and I picked it up for PC on sale.But after almost 4 years they are still charging 60 for this game. Sure it may still hold the quality of a 60 AAA but the fact it hasnt chaged in 4 years?Then theres the character transfers or lack therof. They removed the option to transfer in march of 2017. This has led a lot of people moving from consoles to PCs or consoles to consoles having all of their stats taken away for very little reason.And finally The shark Cards. 8 Million dollars does not get you much in this game. Maybe 3 or 4 nice cars. Maybe a small low tier bunker? For 75 . More than the cost price of this game. Sure they may be bringing updates every now and again but that is no excuse. Not to mention the fact they have scripts in place in Single Player to despawn any DLC cars they detect.All in all Rockstar is just trying to maximise their profits they dont care about the playerbase they ban people just for recieving a couple million dollars against their will but let actual griefing modders that kill the entire lobby every 5 minutes stay virtually untouched.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-10,0,0,358,False,Recommended,Oddviously if you didn't just automatically buy this game that means you're looking for awnsers and well this with a anime profile pic is here to help you. Should you buy this game because the servers are great? Nah. Should you buy it just for the multiplayer? Well maybe but I think not the multiplayer in this game while great unless you don't have friends to play with it can be a little bit boring inbetween updates most of the features in it pretty much require you have friends for them to be any fun. Don't even get me started on the Sandbox literally 2 words Hackers Everywhere.Should you keep in mind that the game has many glitches especially in the multiplayer? Oh yeah. Does the Singleplayer make this game worth 60 bucks if I'm not someone who want to play the multiplayer (I know you people exist)? Up to you honestly maybe not what you want to hear but it really is the singleplayer was one of the main draws for me it's amazing and at least half of my hours are dedicated to playing it but I like anyone else would say if your just gonna get it for the SP get it on sale usually it goes like to 20 30 bucks these days.Is this game all it's hyped over about? Ehhhhhh yes and no Everything in this game is better from GTA IV except the mechanics everything in this game is extremely dumbed down from the last game from driving to gunplay it's very much simplified however as I said everything else is better the sounds the voices the story the graphics the scripted events the Multiplayer (which they try there best to update often) It's all way better so it's a bit of mixed bag. Why do you have such a gay picture for your profile pic? It's just a memeConclusion Should I buy it full price?Well maybe if you really want it bad enough sure but I'd recommend getting it on sale most definetly it just feels dumbed down from the previous game which in my opinion does not make it worth 50 60 dollars. But would I reccomend it? I gave it a thumbs up I think so yeah.EDIT Hey is your name Franklin? Okay Franklin do you like games with a memorable story that gets swept under the rug for a multiplayer that's sub par at best and is basically unless you wanna grind the same mission over and over you won't be able to get anything without micro transactions? If so It's the game for you. Enjoy it frank.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have the feeling this game will become one of the all time classic games. the amount of content is about on par with fallout 4. especially when you take mods into consideration. Pros entertaining story mode with lots of stuff to do and 3 completely different characters with interesting motivesvery good map with lots of detailsgreat graphicsvery good shooting mechanics.interesting carsLOTS of dlcCons Hackers in onlinethe cost of everything in online (seriously R*? 3Million for 1 car?)Map is smaller than previous gamesrockstar support is absolute br&gt Conclusion I like it alot but could be improved with a few things,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-22,0,0,304,False,Recommended,Is the game fun? Yes.Can I recommend singleplayer? Yes.Multiplayer? Not on official servers unless you are okay with malicious modders.There are modders in almost every lobby. However if it's not populated chances are less likely(I'll get to that later). This makes much of the new DLC useless as people will minge and ruin the experience online while knowing full well that you and your friends spent hours upon hours grinding missions to get enough money only to have it lost.Rockstar will reset your money if your balance has been modified whatsoever. If you had $500 000 and a modder gives you $2 000 000 you will find your balance at anywhere from $0 $10 000 the following day. Again the base game is good but rockstar is not banning modders but just resetting statistics when a modder modifies them.Now the thing that is good for playing with your friends is FiveM. Sure it's not as stable and it may be missing much of the new DLC but you won't have modders being malicious with your experience and it can add many more customizations for gameplay if you enjoy roleplay.Now back to Rockstar. I was banned for 2 weeks after using FiveM for a few days. This was during the time that Rockstar didn't allow any modifications even for single player. However as you are not connecting to official server statistics or playing in the normal online scenario Rockstar no longer cares if you play on servers so it's safe to use FiveM now.Overall lot's to do fun missions. If you want to play GTAOnline I would suggest finding a large group of friends preferably 3 or 7 other people. Try to find empty lobbies then invite your friends. This will allow you to usually have a modder free experience and if you want to do missions 4 or 8 people means that you have just the right amount of players for races or raids as they range from 4 12. In addition if you don't plan on doing many lobby missions that require public servers such as MC and such then I would suggest friends only lobbies for missions. This will ensure that modders can not modifty your statistics and your hard earned money will be safe.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,912,False,Not Recommended,I hate having to post a negative review as the actual GTA V portion of the game is quite fun. It expands on the open world formulat that the series has used since the third game in the franchise. The game looks nice graphically and telling the story using three protagonists is a unique twist.Unfortunately the owners of the game have shown they are more interested in pure greed than supporting the games community. GTA Online is microtransaction after microtransaction in order to purchase anything in the game unless you plan on playing it for 8 hours a day. Also they have gone after community modders with DMCA takedowns literally attacking fans of the game that attempt to add to it. Until they can back the community that loves their games I cannot back them.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,178,False,Recommended,Rockstar Games has recently stepped in and has worked with the OpenIV developers towards keeping OpenIV alive. The OpenIV team have stated that development will continue on the framework. Take Two have really screwed the pooch on this one and it seems Rockstar Games will suffer as a result given the overwhelmingly negative reviews this game is still garnering. As such I have edited my review of the game accordingly and have opted to recommend the game. Below is the original review which did not recommend the game.&gt Man I love this game. Fun as hell in singleplayer fun as hell playing with friends.&gt &gt Still won't recommend it though.&gt &gt Take Two seem dead set on dropping trow and taking the biggest steaming dump on the modding community of which most have purchased the game for the intent purpose of modding the game in some way. Beyond the hoops that would normally have to be jumped through the biggest framework mod (OpenIV) received a cease and desist notice effectively rendering most current mods useless as well as curbing the development of future mods.&gt &gt I'm taking the suggestion of NerdCubed by writing a negative review in light of these most recent actions and I urge anybody who feels strongly about this sort of stuff to do the same.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,963,False,Not Recommended,I did have a legitimate review for GTAV and GTA Online but it's time to rewrite it due to some rather...poorly thought out actions l'd say.The main reason I bought GTAV is so that I can mod my singleplayer game. I do also play online but I feel that using cheats and hacks in Online is unfair and for that reason I use two installs of GTAV one to play mods in singleplayer and one to play clean in Online. I have never ever had the impulse to mod online and I never will. My mods stay strictly within my singleplayer game. It saddens me that Take Two has cut off a whole community from playing their game. Modding is the only reason I'm still playing both GTAIV and GTAV today. It reveals a creative side to not only me but a whole range of other creators who put huge amounts of time into their modifications. Hopefully Take Two will realise how many legitimate players they have lost to this decision and revert it and/or try another solution.,Grand Theft Auto V

(unless you play with 3 or more other friends would not recommend) (dont rely on random players for heists most of them either dont know what theyre doing or just troll you)A Lot of stuff is far too expensive ingame to actually pay without shark cards (money grab tactics) I mean the Yachts seriously from 8mil with no upgrades? Traffic is too aggressive AI is sometimes far too easy but mostly overpowered as heck.Game is starting to get highly repetative and the Random Events on jobs I.e. when on biker jobs come too often and you often arrive and run out of time because the event starts when your on the other side of the map in a slow car. thanks Rockstar,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,292,False,Not Recommended,"Just bought this game 3 weeks ago on PC after playing on console since original release in 2013 and man I'm not sure if I made the right decision. Rockstar does their best to remove any and all fun from this game in place of getting people to buy shark cards. They have said as much in financial earnings calls. So unless you have about $200 of real money to spend on shark cards getting started in GTA Online will be very hard. They make it so difficult to accrue money and for those of us strapped for time it makes the game unfun because we can't grind for days or months. The decision to remove mod support is another reason why you should avoid this game. For those people who can't afford to play Online they want to have fun with mods ""well no fun for you!"" says Rockstar because mods can't be made any more. They want you ONLINE BUYING SHARK CARDS NOT playing around with mods.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-03,0,0,1223,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is a great game in total especially with beautiful visuals. Unfortunately fans of the series will be heavily disappointed about the moderate &amp splitted storyline tho. If you've played GTA IV previously you might have recognized some few simple differences in the RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine) which has also brought some negative changes to GTA V's total game experience. Additionally there's nothing worse than GTA V's Theme song. Some of you might remember the San Andreas Theme Song or GTA IV's ""Soviet Connection"". These Themes/loading sequence songs really motivated you to play the game GTA V's loading music instead isn't that encouraging or remarkable at all (to me). Nevertheless the sarcastic ambiance &amp a s*** ton of puns &amp gags the realistic audio &amp a great playlist featured in the ingame radio as well as super sweet graphics &amp a smooth sense of gameplay makes GTA V one of the most entertaining games available (in my eyes). In terms of GTA Online police work is concidered as killing people on sight and steal their cars for money way too much modders/hackers bad p2p (not acutally R* fault) earning money by doing jobs and bankrobs with random people is a pain in the butt R* shut down the independent GTA V MP project! &gt ( Matchmaking takes FOREVER if you join a random job you're most likely to get kicked for INTERUPTING the privacy of the lobby owners (turn MM off ._.) finding skillbased players is just a joke I guess Failed to join session The Rockstar Cloud Servers are not available right now (ofc not their offline forever) Session is full (NO IT'S NOT) Timed out loading session Player is no longer in session UNKNOWN NETWORK ERROR need some more?BUT Free DLC's transferable charcters a support that helps you if you ask specificly a s*** ton of upgradeable vehicles &amp a game full of crazy stuff a s*** ton of missions and so many funny things you can do with your friends this game had become priceless to me. Definitely worth buying but if you wanna have fun tho verify your local game cache first DThank you TakeTwo for baning OpenIV.

2016-01-01,0,0,91,False,Recommended,This is the best Grand Theft Auto installment I have ever played. And what is more it's pretty well optimized. I can play it on HD 7770 (1 GB VRAM) at high settings mostly (textures set to very high) with MSAA off and ambient occlusion/tesselation on normal. 30 60 fps depending on the circumstances without a problem. I haven't noticed any drop below 30 fps so far. The VRAM bar shows 2280 MB/1024 MB in use but I don't see any problems with graphics or frame drops... so I guess it locates all that stuff in RAM which I have 8 GB (+Xeon E3 1230V3).The game is great it has an awesome plot and really vivid characters. If you haven't had possibility to play it before go for it.

2017-06-25,0,0,1275,False,Recommended,If you're looking at getting this game you already know what you think of it. It's GTA. Overall the game is decent enough with a fun story and an online mode that despite the usual problems with hackers and cheats is a reasonable and fun addition to the main game. Yes it's a grind and yes the economy is geared towards either doing that or buying in game currency with real world cash. Unfortunately it seems that this is the way the gaming industries going so I don't know that this game can be pulled up for that on its own. The gameplay itself is reasonably balanced though and is at least an enjoyable grind especially with friends.However with all that said there is one massive issue that the devs really need to find a workaround for. That is their customer service. Currently their ban policy is to ban people with little to no explanation and no chance of recourse. If you get banned they close up all lines of communication and give you no option to defend your case. After I was recently spuriously banned and reset I found this out firsthand. There was no help from customer service and any attempts to get help from the community were met with derision and accusations. Luckily for me it appears someone is looking into the bans behind the scenes and I have had my account reinstated. While I'm happy with the outcome in my case the lack of an explanation about this whole debacle really doesn't sit well with me.

2016-01-02,0,0,60,False,Not Recommended,I haven't played it much and I'm not going to play it much. I did the singleplayer story it was really great. They put allot of work in creating the characters and the new multi character system is just awesome. The big downside is there is nothing left for you after singlelayer because online just sucks. Its full with cheaters/modders which mostly are little kids spawning money and you with tanks/rpgs or other exploits such as turning you into a ing christmas tree. I also read that Rockstar isn't doing about this and ruined the only oppertunity for this to be saved which was dedicated servers. If you want a positive review fix GTA online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-02,0,0,97,False,Recommended,This newer Entry is the GTA I always waited for. The first GTA I played was IV and at its time it felt quite good and entertaining but missed fancy graphics or a good open world. For me GTA was always a bit like a cool and realistic Version of The Sims. Where IV met his borders V got its strong parts Hard to control fun activities turned into funny and a bit challenging mini games. Little variety of such things as nationalities or the city itself turned into complex milieus and a whole Island featuring everything from a poor suburb to a mountain including a platform with a table of sights.Summery I would wait until GTA V is at least down to 30 or so and then buy this marble of open world life simulation. It may be worth more but as steam games are getting cheaper every day and there are plenty of sales every year I would in this case wait until the game is cheaper.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,473,False,Not Recommended,The story was great and the game is very entertaining but the greedyness of TakeTwo is destroying the game. They are screwing up single player modding trying to stop the online modders (just because they are losing profits thanks to the modders that give money away they haven't fixed most of the griefing tools that the modders use to troll and harm people online). And even yet they aren't going to be able to stop the modders since they rely on p2p instead of actual dedicated servers cheaters in gta online won't stop soon unless they get a GOOD anti cheat system (the actual one is a joke) and patch every single exploit that the game has. I could rant a lot about the online aspect of this game but basically is this If you don't spend money waste A LOT of hours into stupid and not enjoyable grinding (I've played MH for over 1500 hours combined along the games and trust me this game's grinding is awful and doesn't feels rewarding at all) or cheat you'll get screwed over by everyone because with money and a bit of time you can buy the most unfair things (explosive bullets in the new update OP vehicles...) and destroy every person if you are somewhat skilled at playing the game. Also you won't get banned for being with a cheater in a lobby or receiveing money from a hacker unwillingly that comes from people that probably cheated and got caught.I can't recommend this game unless you are buying it just for the singleplayer aspect and even then you are losing your ability to modify the game to your liking. Now if you have plans to buy the game for modding you'll have to pirate it so you can use old versions that support modding. I'm not encouraging people to pirate the game it's just a warning to people that want to buy the game for the modding aspect of it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Skydiving off of mountains and killing cops in your plane. It allows you to do what you would want to do in real life that you wouldn't be able to do whether it is illegal expensive or risky. GTA5 (and expecially online) are great fun. The reviews may say that the online is horrible because you can get killed or there are hackers but those things make it FUN. If there's a hacker they may turn you into a christmas tree or send you into the air. If people are just spawn killing you devise a plan with your friends so you can kill him or you can just leave the server. I would most definitley reccomend this game for all to buy. ),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,11,False,Recommended,With the return of OpenIV this marks a great step for mods and user content from here on out.Let this stand as a lesson as to the power that the consumer has because without us companies like Take Two are powerless. They have power over Rockstar but we have power over them.Thank you Rockstar for taking the effort and making things right. The game is a good game and deserves praise so long as the consumers are respected as they should be.The fact that this happened at all is honestly an enigma of its own. How stupid do you have to be to try to ban modding? That's like burning money because mods draw in customers.Whatever the case Rockstar has repaired it's relationship with me at least. They took the right steps and handled the situation well.And before anyone argues that Rockstar should have taken a stand *before* the incident ever occured I have a counter argument. First we don't know that Take Two spoke with Rockstar at all before sending the cease and desist. Second They have all the power over Rockstar that they could ever need. Rockstar can't exactly stand up for itself without cause. The backlash that resulted from the incident was their cause. It was the motivation to fix what had been broken.This was a victory for modding and consumer content but it was also a victory for consumer input in the industry. They'll think twice before trying anything stupid like that again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-06,0,0,356,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is a great open world game. I don't play the story mode... to much violence! What i got it for is the open world city.A living moving and very large city to drive all types of cars. Even semi tractor trailer. And very large water ways to boat and jet ski! I love discovering all areas of the city the northen country area and down town areas. But there is way more cars trucks and boats even planes available on GTA Online. But there is where i ran intwo trouble! I brought myself an apartment and some nice cars to cruise around in. But i can never cruise in peace. Its not the other players because there is a passive mode where they can not attack me or my car. No its the hackers!!!! there everywhere and they have ruined my online experience. They teleport intwo my cars and destory them. I go to another server but there everywhere!!! I have resorted to playing GTA online private mode. Having to play an online game in private makes little since. I wanted to meet players and maybe find players interested in roleplaying or make a movie. But GTA online is over run with hackers who ruin the game. I don't recommend this game,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-25,0,0,1040,False,Recommended,GTA V's single player is really cool the gameplay is fantastic and may offer the pinnacle of open world game play.I thought the story was a bit short and some aspects of it shallow compared to the likes of Red Dead Redemption but it still a decent single player campaign.Modding games can greatly enhance the gameplay experience and can drastically transform the game. Players have total freedom with their game and can have even more fun with the world Rockstar has created.There s so much mods which transform the gameplay you can even find or create mods which make gameplay adjustments such as adding fuel simulation to vehicles. You can also have mods which add new weapons and vehicles to the game. I also know of a mod where someone is developing a split screen modification for the game so you can play with your friends from the same computer should this mod be completed!If you want to survive in a Zombie Apocalypse you can also do it!The Online mode has various issues such as glitches bugs long loading times connectivity problems and online cheaters running around causing havoc and disrupting the experiences of other players. There has been some times when an update releases and you have peaceful sessions without these crazies running around but then sometimes they're out in full force. Unfortunately the anti cheat system they use in this game appears to be greatly ineffective possibly due to the Peer to Peer nature of GTA Online.The grinding in this game can be really tough I find the grinding in this game harder than all of the many MMOs I have played. Seriously it's insane! It looks like the game has been designed to maximise the playtime of players putting many hurdles in their way as they try to grind be it players or the how some missions are designed to slow you down.One way of grinding in the game is selling some stock that you have accumulated from things like illegal drug operations and the selling of weapons. But you have to do this in a public session a public session where other players can destroy your stock which you may have spent hours getting together. Seriously hours! As to accumulate the stock you have to source supplies by stealing them or buying them and then waiting for your stock bar to fill up. People can also destroy your stocks and supplies and get rewarded for it so those hours can just go to waste and cause much grief to players. You ll want to bring friends with you on the grind to speed things up as grinding solo can be slow and risky I encourage you to obtain a vehicle warehouse as it is one of the most profitable ways of grinding in this game with it you have to source and sell vehicles. If you can bring some friends along with you that s great as you can sell 4 cars at once which can make you a nice amount of money. But there will be players who will want to destroy your efforts.Heists are another thing you may want to participate in as you can make a nice amount of money as well.Not only is the grinding incredibly long and hard but the prices of some of the new content additions are so high that it would take many hours for you to obtain. As I said before it looks like the game has been designed to maximise the playtime of players due to this design shark cards can become alluring to those who want to save themselves from the stress of grinding.About cheaters for the longest time it looked like Rockstar weren t serious about combating cheaters but now it looks like they re taking this more seriously. Unfortunately as a result of this seriousness the single player modding community has come under attack from Take Two. OpenIV is a single player modification tool which is predominantly used to modify the single player portion of the game the team behind it had a C&amp D (Cease and Desist) sent to them on allegations that their modding tool affects the online mode of the game and supposedly allows third parties to defeat the security features of their software. Losing this tool would do great harm to the single player modding community. They re going after the wrong team they should be going after the people creating online mod menus/cheats!Unfortunately I m leaving a negative review.This is due to the issues with the Online mode such as the bugs and glitches that haven t been fixed the seemingly unstoppable cheaters due to the ineffective anti cheat system and the attack on the single player modding community. Should one or more of these things improve I ll adjust my review. I want to give this game a positive review but it has so many issues mostly pertaining to GTA Online that I can t say I recommend playing this game for GTA Online and if the single player modding community is under attack I can t recommend it because it s so wrong to attack this community and it harms the single player experience that people have spent over 2 years building upon and improving. Fortunately Rockstar has spoken up for the modding community recently and has said that they re not going to pursue various single player mods this is really good hopefully OpenIV can make a return!I could probably write a novel about this game and the issues the online mode has I m just scratching the surface with the things I ve mentioned in my review. I really wish they would fix the problems in GTA Online. (Review Update 30/08/2017 Rockstar and Take Two have backed away from attacking the single player modding community I m now leaving a positive review mainly for the single player portion of the game. The gameplay is phenomenal and this game offers some of the greatest gameplay in an open world game ever this is enhanced greatly further by mods. GTA Online still has various issues but there is fun to be had if you do play it I highly recommend playing GTA Online with friends as a solo experience can be quite challenging depending on what you re doing. Otherwise I don t recommend playing GTA Online but it s up to you as an individual you may like it.I ve had fun playing GTA Online in the past but it s just becoming more hectic and there are still various issues with the online mode and unfortunately the grinding is still insane. What bothers me quite a lot is that Rockstar encourages causing other players grief this is done by players destroying things such as the stock you have spent time accumulating in free mode to try and make some money. There s no repercussions for theses hostile players only rewards which aren t even worthwhile. And if you even think about getting revenge destroying their weaponized vehicle is going to cost you.The Oppressor a recently added weaponized vehicle is one of the worst things you can encounter it s a nimble bike which can glide through the air with the help of the thruster on its back. Sounds great right? No this nimble bike can fire homing missiles at you while you re minding your own business and decimate you in seconds. You could be on your grind trying to sell some stock when someone decides Oh this player is trying to make some money let me blow them up and get shillings for it! The location of what you re trying to sell is broadcasted to all the players in the session so they have the opportunity to destroy it and cause you grief the rewards aren t even worthwhile.The game also has a variety of imbalances one of which is that the health your character has is dependent on your rank as a result lower ranked players are at a huge disadvantage as they can be killed quicker than higher ranked players if I recall correctly this spreads across the whole of GTA Online from free mode to death matches I m not sure if it spreads to all of the death matches though. I don t like the direction the free mode of GTA Online is heading you spend a lot of time grinding just to have it all blown away by some big meanie in a death machine. But if you put the grinding aside and play some of the many game modes you can have fun.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-07-03,0,0,568,False,Recommended,Over 400 hours on record and about the same off. This will most likely be one of the most valuable reviews. First off GTA 5 single player is crap loads of fun it has a fantastic story and can be fairly challanging. Another good part is it can take awhile to beat and you can screw around when you feel that need. I played all the other GTAs and they pretty much nailed it this one with their story After some time now that its been out I'm eager to see what they put on the future table for GTA...its not done yet...can't be. GTA 5 Online is another whole realm. It's fun as hell to screw around it and mess with people. Early on you were pretty limited and now days they have the whole CEO and body guards bike gangs and a bunch of new stuff they keep tossing in which pretty much is the same....I feel they are just Scratching a new field with Boss bodyguards and could even spark something strait off from that in only larger scale. Boss&gt Sub boss's&gt body guards&gt Soldier&gt etc....It could get big but they would need a new GTA face... 2 downsides 1 The biggest downside to GTA 5 online is the hackers 95% of the people who claim they are not hackers are or have tried and it can really mess up a mission you have been trying to get done or put a lot of money into. But besides that normally hackers don't mess with you too much unless you ruin their time. 2 You don't really have a say in your own product to where it goes and how its handled. so you may end up getting some really missions they are boring as hell and take forever to do with way more chances for it to get crushed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be very good. I myself professed it to be one of the greatest games ever made at one point. So good that I bought it again on PC so that I could mod it. That was literally the only reason I bought it on PC as GTA V is probably one of the best modded games on the planet.However Take Two interactive has repeatedly demonstrated that they are totally against single player modding by first making it extremely difficult to do (encrypting the relevant files not including and tools or expicit support for mods etc.). Now they have taken the rather extreme action of sending a cease and desist letter to the developers of OpenIV the de facto main tool for modding single player GTA V. After this action I can no longer support the developers of this game and also can no longer recommend purchasing this game as the modding element is one of the deciding factors for me at least.Update 31.08.2017So rockstar did retract their C&amp D to the OpenIV team. This was a great move however I still feel there are some big issues with the way they handle modding. There is also another problem The complete lack of any extra content for SP since release. GTA IV had some of the best DLC for any SP game I've ever played however GTA V has nothing for years. MP has gotten a lot of time expensive DLC but SP has gotten nothing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-08,0,0,586,False,Not Recommended,"So for starters I would like to say that Grand Theft Auto V is easily one of the best games I have ever played. The story is phenomenal with excellent cast and plenty of fun things to do across its expansive landscape. The game is beautiful and the thrill of each mission is just as sweet as the last on top of the humor which keeps you coming back.However that is story mode. It will last you...25 30 hours. 50 Tops. Is it worth the sixty dollars? Yes.That being said though if you want GTAV you more than likely are thinking of it for it's multiplayer Grand Theft Auto Online. Well let's get this over with...I hate to say it but Rockstar has taken one of my favorite games of all time and my second most played game of all time and completely ruined it. Every single update you could tell that they were struggling to keep people playing by making everything harder and harder to get so every update is incredibly full of content. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that everything they add nowadays is well over $1 000 000 in cost. Now I could handle this with a high end apartment to host heists from. I could handle the cost of an office to run my own business. However the Import/Export update really sold me on just how money grubbing Rockstar is by adding one of the funnest looking things they've ever added to the game a car that ramps vehicles off of itself at the astounding price of $1.3M+ when it looks like it was made in a scrap yard.This still wouldn't be a problem for me if it was easier to get cash without buying the shark cards. The reason it is so hard to get money is because of the limitations set by the CEO businesses. For some ungodly reason you have to be in a public session to do these. Not even in friends only lobbies can you do these missions to earn money which is absoltely rediculous due to how toxic other players are and that doesn't even take into account the hackers. There is literally nothing fun about spending several hours filling up a warehouse only to have a large portion of your stock destroyed by someone because being an is promoted in Online.So in short. Don't bother with GTAV anymore. The game has reached an MMORPG level of ""Grind endlessly or Pay to Win"" mentality and forces you to play in environments of complete toxicity.If you must buy the game buy it for the story mode. You will waste so much time or money if you try to get what you want Online.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-26,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,"Not gonna talk about the singleplayer in this review as that is not the reason why I am writing this. The real reason why I am writing this review is to talk about the absolutely appalling way that Rockstar ""support"" treats its customers when trying to talk to anything but an automated message sent by a bot.So at some point around 2015 or 2016 some single player mods had been created that I was interested in and since a big reason why I bought GTA V on PC was to play with mods I quickly downloaded them and tried them out. Anyway a week after this I heard about how Rockstar was banning people playing GTA V online if they had any singleplayer mods installed so naturally I uninstalled the one mod I had downloaded as I had more fun with the multiplayer anyway.So skip forward to some point in the future when me and my friends returned to GTA Online after my first play session back I got an email from Rockstar ""support"" stating that I had been banned from GTA V Online for a week with no reason given. I would like to reiterate that I had only ever had singleplayer mods and never once tried to cheat in the game (although there were plenty of those types of people around on the multiplayer anyway). Anyway this quite rightly had me confused and a little angry as I could not think of any reason as to why I would be banned so like any normal person I went to Rockstar ""support"" and used thier systems to inquire why I had been banned and if there was anyway I could prevent this from happening in the future. I sent off the inquiry and expected to get an answer around the next day or something so when I saw I had a reply back after a minute I was obviously confused at the speed of response. It turned out that instead of getting an actual human to solve the problem they had just sent an automated message through a bot basically explaining that there was no way to repeal the ban or get specific infomation on why I would have been banned except for a list of reasons given in the response that I had never violated. This had understandably made me annoyed that there was no way I could find out why I had been banned but I decided to just wait out the ban for a week anyway and forget about the problem for now. So a week later I was unbanned and able to play GTA Online again to my delight (as although this is a negative review I still enjoy the game). After the session I had that night playing with friends I went off GTA and started watching YouTube however 5 minutes later I got another email from Rockstar ""support"" stating this time I had been permanently banned with again no reason given and no way to repeal the ban again. To this day I still do not know the real reason as to why I was banned but since then I have assumed it must have had something to do with a random folder left over from a mod I had installed previously but had thought I had deleted. Now although I would accept responsibility for this if that was the case the fact that I can never know for certain as to why I have been banned has caused me much irritation and scorn towards Rockstar ""support"" for not giving any help towards me when I had clearly asked for it. If they had just told me that first time why I had been banned then I could have prevented the second permanent ban but the ineptitude of Rockstar ""support"" has led to a situation where the game I payed good money for has been half stripped away from me without any explanation as to why.Overall I still really like GTA V as a game but the glaring issues with Rockstar ""support"" and the multiplayer in general has forced me to leave this as a negative review until they properly fix the support system to actually help those who ask for it.",Grand Theft Auto V

I am one of these people that reports these players to Rockstar. As soon as money is being dropped on me I leave the game. Yes I did accumulate some hacked $ but Definately not more than $10k (over the course of trying to avoid these encounters hence my shorter and shorter times being logged in to this service) I earned my in game money by playing missions heist and other activities that were legitimate ways of earning money programmed in by Rockstar.It's reasons such as these as to why I hardly ever log in to GTA Online anymore. I was hoping the next time that I logged in to change my review from negative to positive. Rockstar games makes this decision of mine IMPOSSIBLE....And what a shame I've been a fan and have enjoyed this series since GTA III on PS2.

2016-11-26,0,0,452,False,Recommended,I will edit my simple review from the games early days.The single player is absolutely incredible. It is one of the best designed games with the most freedoms I've seen. This is the reason I give the game a positive review.BUT Online is a joke. R* can't seem to shut off peoples ability to mod the online mode so the experience is ruined. They take real money from peoples accounts for no reason and have no accountability for it. People that don't mod and want to make money being either CEO VIP MC Pres. etc are unable to do so in private matches so none of these updates adding cool new things are worth actually trying because you will innevitably be in a match trying to make a sale of cargo and with no one near you your vehicle WILL blow up and it will have been a modder. During all of this you would expect people to be upset but instead they just ask for money money money. I've begun to online again more recently and the best part of the past months worth of play time was last night when I somehow got put into an empty public lobby and was able to actually make the sales from my warehouse and make money that has been sitting for far too long all because the minute I'd normally leave my warehouse the modders would just grief.Honestly? If you haven't played this yet just keep holding out and wait for it to hit L.A.

While that's true you are able to play online in a CLOSED FRIEND/CREW session. I don't know why everybody fails to mention that. Gameplay in this game is just perfect when you play closed sessions with your friends. Also if the online portion sucks there is the SINGLEPLAYER game that has a great story and characters!So should you get this game? YES! Even if you are planning to play this alone? YES! This is technically buying 2 games for the price of one as you get GTA online for free.So just ignore the other people who say GTA Online sucks. There are plenty more you can do in the Singleplayer too!This is one of the best games of ALL TIME and if you fail to see why even after seeing the 96/100 score on the store page I don't know what to say.,Grand Theft Auto V

And when they do join incompetent fools they are AND the connection sometimes is so they crash into you and you fly into the ocean for no good reason.And when a heist does get started with the perfect team vehicles and weaponry it disconnects at the perfect time.Still a couple of hackers wandering aboutNeed to grind a hella lot just to get in game cash.The properties cars helicopters and planes are ridiculously expensive. Up to the point where you have to mindlessly grind the heists CEO and bunker jobs just to afford them only to have that treasured item you love so much spontaneously combust for no good reason(Thank you hackers and scumbag players).From what I've seen from the other reviews rockstar banning innocent people(and not unbanning them) is just plain stupid rockstar support is completely bloody useless. And just DON'T buy the shark cards. I have bought this game twice already(Xbox 360) and it is a joy to play. Will purchase another rockstar game in time to come. (will update this post from time to time)Post updated on the 28th Oct 2016Story Mode Having been through story mode at least twice. I can safely say that I it s whole lot of fun. However some of the online DLC are not avaliabe in story mode you would have to use mods. Other than that the storymode and freeplay is near flawless.

For a company that claims to appreciate the modders and all of their fans these guys seem to be quick to on those that supported them from the start so yes the single player side is a great game and i would recommened it but it comes with a thumbs down due to the practises of both rockstar and take two for the attitude 'F the fans we just want money',Grand Theft Auto V

The interweaving storylines are the perfect mix of comedy &amp tragedy with characters who are simultaneously outrageous and relatable. Graphics are up there with the best and the developers did a great job optimising settings so users of less powerful PC's can play while high end gaming rigs can experience something truly awesome. Online mode is a creative social and immensely fun twist on regular gameplay making post story gameplay endlessly addictive. The only con I can think of is the online load times can seem a bit slow and some people have mods which can be annoying if they use them to your detriment. I still rate this as the greatest game I have played in my life 9.5/10 because nobody's perfect.PS I waited for this to go on sale because I already paid full price for PS3 version and clocked it twice.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-30,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,Note I'm reviewing the online experience not the single player. The single player is great and worth playing through especially if you can get the game on sale.As far as GTA Online goes There's a whole lot of game to like here if you're actually able to make it work. When it works it's an incredibly brilliant and diverse game. But that's the problem. It doesn't really work most of the time. It's so inconsistent that it's often simply unplayable. There's enormous amounts of content available here with a giant and incredibly detailed open world playground at your disposal but if you spend 75% of your time looking at loading screens only to be repeatedly kicked out of online sessions once they finally load you start to wonder whether or not it's worth your time. And for me at least that's how this game is about 90% of the time. I spend more time simply trying to connect to a job or a multiplayer session than I do actually getting to play the game. It's so frustrating especially since it's so much damn fun on those rare occasions when it actually works. Simply put the Rockstar servers aren't up to the challenge of keeping this many players and this many sessions connected. They've made an unholy amount of money on this game so I'm not sure what the issue is or why they can't provide a more consistent online experience. I have a great (i.e. expensive) internet connection in a highly populated part of the US and have no trouble with any other online game so this problem rests on the shoulders of Rockstar and GTA Online. Since the game still demands an as new price of 60 bucks most of the time I simply can't recommend it. It's been out for too long now to expect that it will get any better I'm not optimistic that the great update that solves the connectivity problem is going to be coming around anytime soon. Maybe you'll have better luck than me but just know that if you buy this game for the online element you are at best rolling the dice. There's enormous potential here but until Rockstar gets their multiplayer code up to 21st century standards it's just not worth the hassle. For now I'll just free up the 70 gigs of hard drive space and hope for something better.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-24,0,0,234,False,Not Recommended,The state of GTAV right now is extremly poor. The negative backlash from the attempted banning of OpenIV has cost Rockstar a large amount of customers and resulting in an Overwhelmingly Negative review state. Surely thats not what GTAV one of the biggest and best open world games deserves right? Well when you centralise your game around making money it will innevitably be badly recieved by your customers. They dont want to spend anymore than what they paid initially to be able to access the in game content in a reasonable amount of time. And why should they? What the updates of GTAV have become are boring slow uninspired and repetitive missions that dont give you nearly as much money as they should. In my opinion even if the money in GTAV was tripled it would still result in a game with an incredibly large amount of grinding. Im honestly suprised at this point that Rockstar didnt charge us for these DLCs. However the new vehicles are very fun to mess around with but they are incredibly expensive. In the end Rockstar just wants to make you spend money on their awful shark cards and suprise suprise even they are overpriced. The most expensive is 60 for $8 mill and that isnt even enough to buy all the new vehicles (or even a fully upgraded yacht (but who would want that anyway because they are beyond useless).In conclusion if you want to mess around in an open world game with friends go for it. But if you want a good vehicle or house or garage or just about anything be prepared to do heist after heist or delivery mission after delivery mission for what will pretty much be something that you can play around with for a few hours at most. What an incredibly unsatisfying game this is.https //imgflip.com/i/1cyqqt Actual Rockstar headquaters,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-05,0,0,208,False,Recommended,What an amazing game that has so many things to do. I have really enjoyed the very broad activities and never knowing whats around the corner. I also really enjoy the game because your character is constantly growing it's success instead of just another gta coming out. The only thing that i have struggled with is finding a consistent group of people to play with in order to achieve certain tasks that can not be completed solo. So i will continue to get by this challenge and look forward to figuring it out because i know there is so much for this game to offer. Im looking more into working with crews and chatting online in discussions and forums through the steam community. Please feel free to drop me a line if you can give me some advice or you just wanna play!,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-05,0,0,74,False,Recommended,The story mode is reminiscent of earlier incarnations of Grand Theft Auto. Same for GTA Online but the program tends to freeze up on load screens. You have to quit and restart every time this happens which is extremely aggravating. Also some of the game mechanics related to flight are extremely difficult to master because the default flight controls are counterintuitive. Thumbs up for the game overall thumbs down for load screen freezes and a few annoying minor details.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-12,0,0,515,False,Not Recommended,The single player part of the game is awesome in many ways. Sadly they have totally failed on the online part. If you go online be prepared to be constantly gangbanged by players that solely log on to make your life miserable. It's the worlds biggest gankfest and as a new player you will most likely be killed numerous times while you just try to make your way from a to b.Not only that Rockstar releases shiny new DLC's that probably are very fun to play but in order to have fun you will have to hand out more money than the basic game costs. Much more money.I mean much much much more. If you still are set to buy the game Play the solo part and skip the online game.I'm seriously considering not getting their next game if the set up is like this one.,Grand Theft Auto V

I don't enjoy the city as much as I loved Liberty City but the game world is still a lot of fun. The multiplayer is definetly the meat and bones once you've completed the single player however.

He contacted Rockstar about it explaining what had happened the guy at support then proceeded to say that my friend should just re install and then he wouldn't be banned again if he didn't cheat. and then they proceeded to do jack didley about it. So we waited the week the first ban was going to be and then we played again. amazingly an hour and a half later he was banned AGAIN. so i went and did some digging aparently one of the reasent ""patches"" have some issues Rockstar won't admit are there. We're talking you can get banned for using the following programs Any Screen recording software.MSI Afterburner (a Default Program with MSI pc's)Steam FPS counterand any other service that adds an overlay to the game like Razer Cortex and such and Game boosters too.And ofc the support didn't bother telling my friend about these programs being able to trigger a ban because the customer Rockstar is always right.conclussion?

2016-12-17,0,0,373,False,Not Recommended,This review is mainly for the online portion of the game Let me preface this by saying GTA Online can be really fun and enjoyable especially if you have a good group of friends to play with but unfortunately Rockstar has made it hard for me to like this game due to some of their consumer unfriendly practices.The game itself is mechanically fine and quite a few missions such as the heists races and other assortted things can be fun distractions but the biggest problem is in game currency. All the fast (and useful) vehicles are locked behind an in game currency paywall and actually getting the currency to buy these nice things is a major grind and rockstar have gone out of their way to make sure that it stays that way so that they can get you to spend real money on shark cards that give you more in game currency. While buying these cards ensure more and more content will keep coming to GTA Online it also opens the door for them to make each update more expensive then the last and then putting the new content behind a paywall. For example want to do CEO missions or Biker Cllub missions? Well you best be ready to pony up a couple million dollars of in game currency. Want to do the new CEO vehicle missions that they just added? Time to spend another 1.5 million just to get your foot in the door. All in all GTA Online is starting to feel like a very hollow experience with players being forced to grind and grind if they want to access most of the new content and ultimately it feels like all the really want to do is line their own pockets some more.Thats my two cents anyway and thats not even getting into their ridiculous customer support and negligence when it comes to modders.The short version Game is fun especially with friends but be prepared to grind endlessly or pony up real world money to make any kind of reasonable progress.,Grand Theft Auto V

Story is just okay what makes it great is the world.Los Santos feels alive it's just so enjoyable driving through across LS.And Mods makes GTA V SP replayability so much better.I recommend this game for single player only with mods.

Summer sale hits many of my friends buy the game and I want to play with them.I have 2 acounts My Xbox account (has progress on it level 175)My PC account (level 5)I didn't feel like working up from scratch again so I contact rockstar support. All I wanted were 2 things to have the current key deactivated and a new one provided so it can be activated on the Xbox account. The first employee was very helpful but from there on out their actions made no sense. you Rockstar support. A simple 2 minute fix was dragged out into a 2 week ordeal. Still no resolution. I'm fed up with their customer service. I just want the game refunded at this point. I would like my $60 back. Please and Thank You Matthew,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,326,False,Not Recommended,At it's core Grand Theft Auto is a good game. If I were to review the game itself it'd score a 8.5/10. However I'm giving this a thumbs down because of Take Two Interactive's and to some extent Rockstar's royal ery with the modding community. On June 14 2017 a takedown notice was issued to the creators of OpenIV an absolutely essential tool for modding the core files of GTA V IV and to some extent Max Payne 3. What they pulled makes modding illegal and is a massive move on the part of the publisher.I hope the modding community recovers from the blow and that Take Two and Rockstar get their together and issue a sincere apology because until then they won't get any business from me.,Grand Theft Auto V

Mods have been used in several several games even on this very medium singleplayer and multiplayer alike so R* why do you think you should be so different?,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-16,0,0,114,False,Not Recommended,I used to be a loyal fan of all things Rockstar. I bought this game three times at full retail price (PS3 PS4 PC). Your parent company's decision to send OpenIV a cease and desist is not only anti consumer but also goes against this series history of supporting mods.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-16,0,0,578,False,Not Recommended,Well finally I was forced to write this...Let me start off with a simple statement GTA V was and is a great game. I have mixed feelings about GTA Online but I'm going to leave that aside for now. This game (singleplayer) has a great story amazing freedom and stunning graphics. I played it on PS3 and was satisfied by the PC version. It keeps the traditional GTA setting with the introduction of some fresh ideas. This balance was maintained and was one of the reasons this game is so good. The state of GTA Online upon release was satisfying. The game recieved numerous updates and although it all started with thematic updates with just a few cars and guns it was enough to keep players entertained. Heists released and it was a blast. There is something important about this update though. At that point the game started being more centered on cooperative play so it is strongly recommended that you find a crew to play the game with. Later on we've seen massive additions to GTA Online and recently we've gotten two very controversial DLCs Import/Export and GTA Online Gunrunning. The reason behind this controversy is that the more conservative players (longtime fans) tend to believe these updates are ruining the realism of GTA and that it only caters griefers and kids and is all about Microtransactions (Shark cards). There is a whole article worth of explanation here but I don't have enough time to write it all down. The other part of GTA community (mostly new fans) states that GTA Online is all about fun and does not concern realism. While I agree to some of the parties' opinions I do have to say that the problem isn't entirely in the players (although some of them are the reason I play GTA online in public lobbies less and less). This is where we get to the part where I explain why I don't recommend this game anymore. It is my belief that making GTA V Rockstar games did an excellent job. It is made in a wonderfull manner and the online segment was initially a great thing. HOWEVER the publishers (Take Two interactive) have done a horrible job of catering the players (+ruining R*'s reputation). Don't get me wrong T2's mission is to squeeze out the biggest possible amount of money from the game. They are a business after all. The problem is that Take 2 took it way too seriously. They made GTA online a horrible experience by ruining it with microtransactions. They also do not maintain contact with consumers which isn't what a user friendly company usually does. They have taken down an alternative Online service because they feared their $w33t $hark card revenue would be hurt. They have taken down a converted RDR map mod. They are constantly taking down any attempts of users to make the game more fun fearing that modders make better content than them and constantly trying to make people play GTA Online exclusively. Furthermore they are constantly trying to make people buy shark cards. The amazing greed this company has has lead it's aim to become nothing more than to suck out all of life from the original true community and turn it into a heaven for the neo gaming generation. Their final step was nothing but disgrace to the GTA V PC community They have taken down the biggest modding tool for GTA V. Their actions are completely unacceptable and are harmful to the fanbase. This is the reason I'm giving the game a negative review.It used to be a glorious gem but Take2's greed was too heavy it crashed into a million pieces.poetic huh?TL DRGr8 singleplayer online is a grindfest T2 are bad guys don't support them.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-16,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,Ok lets us be real. GTA V is a good single player game but multiplayer has come up short of expectations. Now with Take Two squaring up to take on EA as the worst gaming company I can no longer give this game a positive review after Take Two assault on mods. Modding RP and the like give the game free promotion which helps sell the base game and the very least gets the game views on streaming platforms. It is clear the new shift within the gaming culture towards mods is not one the end user agrees with. If a mod helps sell a copy of your game but makes a few bucks in the process it is a win all around the community continues to grow that community exposes others to the game and a few buy it. Now that they want to ban mods for no real reason it seems this is another power play for some paid mod cash grab.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have only one complaint and it has to do specifically with the online feature. The Queue times are way too long. In order to earn $$ to do anything functional online you need to Queue up for missions and events but this results in me spending literally close to 50% of my time not playing but waiting.Other than that I highly recommend ALL the games in the GTA Series (As well as others like Bully),Grand Theft Auto V

No this game is a pointless ing money grind to buy pointless items. The only cool things in the game are the cars and the cars are outrageously priced unless you want to buy money from rockstar then expect to log at least a month of game time before getting what you want. I cant even enjoy this game with my friends because not only of the money issue but the loading times are just ing insane.

2015-11-15,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,"I've watched a lot of GTA Online streams over the past year and only just recently built a new PC cpaable of playing the game. I'm sure this game can be a ton of fun if you have ome friends you can play with but online play with the community (aka random strangers) is absolutely horrible. First off modding/hacking is absolutely rampant. Almost every free mode session has at least one modder/hacker in it to ruin the game. There are a lot of ""exploits"" I've seen used in the game Kill a player or everyone in the session with explosions they can even kill you in passive mode Take away everyone's guns although joining a new session brings them back Spawning game resources on top of people such as vehicles but also including bags of money Teleporting to players wherever they are including inside apartments garages and mod shops Color changing cars Setting their speed disatance free fall etc. to win various free mode events and many more hacks/mods I have yet to encounter but you can read about onlineThis isn't all bad as some modders keep to themselves and their friends but it gets annoying when one decides to grief everyone in the session. The hack/mod I am most disapointed with is dropping free money. I've read online that Rockstar will take away all modded money when discovered but that items purchased with modded money are fine to keep. This has led to players frequently asking modders/hackers to give them money. I choose not to play this way and would rather earn my items &amp status symbols but whyen one modder decided to give me money without asking Rockstars system empty my bank account including the legit money I had earned. I was able to submit a support request and get it back but such a system only hurts players playing legitimately.The hacking/modding aside I do have one more complaing and that is the community itself. Last week I listened to the most offensive &amp racist hate speech I have ever heard from a player. I had not learned how to use the mute feature in the game so I was subject to their ranting until I left the session a few minutes later and ultimately the game because I did not feel like playing anymore. While that person was an extreme example I find that most GTA online players with mics are also rude and that about hald of all players just like to grief and kill on sight.Ultimtely I'm greatly disappointed in this game. If anyone is reading this post and are interested in playing GTA V / Online my advice is to just play Story Mode and play with friends online but forget about playing online for the above reason unless you enjoy that stuff. If you want to get legit cash but don't want to enter free mode just start up Story Mode and from there you can launch a solo online session and do solo missions. Unfortunately there's not a whole lot of solo missions IMO so they get old really fast.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-20,0,0,282,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Single player is great avoid the multiplayer.Note I will be using hacker and modder interchangeably in this review. (Modder is a more correct term)I bought this game on preorder because I knew it would be good. I mostly got it for the online as I owned the XBox360 version and had played through the single player.I would love to recommend the game and I will the single player its engaging and fun with a long hilarious story line following 3 characters.But the main reason I bought it and the reason why other may buy it is the multiplayer and after a couple of years it a buggy hacker filled mess.You would expect a company like Rockstar to be able to fix hacker exploits in a few months I'm sure they are in a constant battle to beat them but they have only succeeded once and for what appeared to be about a month. They for certain haven't abandoned the game regular content updates show it still is getting love but the hackers (more appropriately modders as they don't hack the game as much as mod it) break the multiplayer for those who just want to play with friends.Even if you don't run into modder trouble the multiplayer is a mess. Constant unexplained connection issues that won't kick you out of multiplayer but disconnect you from your friends for no reason. The grind is impossible near the beginning requiring you to either know a modder and get money from them or have a friend who already did the first option to have a chance at making any money at all. But if you want to do it legit be prepared for hours of totally fun and not boring grinding or shelling out an insane amount of real money for worthless amount of GTA$. Also the heists are terrible. You get kicked out of the lobby if one player disconnects and with a game like this they will whether from leaving or internet problems. You don t get checkpoints in the heist so one up and you get to restart. The Securoserv stuff doesn t work well. There is no easy way to coordinate with colleagues except a text chat and you have to pray a no one decides to ruin your day because defending the shipment is impossible across sometimes three vehicles.The game besides random internet issues performs great. I can max a surprising amount of options on a Strix GTX 970 (overclocked +200Mhz clock and +600Mhz memory) and I saw a performance increase with a new processor (i5 6600k overclocked to 4.3Ghz).The single player is fun as I mentioned before. There is plenty to do across three characters. Gunplay is only ok and flying is best done with a controller but otherwise a keyboard and mouse are my proffered inputs. The voice acting music and animation are all very good and the characters all have a unique and hilarious personality. My one gripe is that I could never find clothes that interested me but then I just left the characters the way they were.Overall buy for the single player if you don't have it and ignore the multiplayer if you can.But the main reason I bought it and the reason why other may buy it is the multiplayer and after a couple of years it a buggy hacker filled mess.You would expect a company like Rockstar to be able to fix hacker exploits in a few months I'm sure they are in a constant battle to beat them but they have only succeded once and for what appeared to be about a month.

2016-01-21,0,0,343,False,Recommended,The fifth installment in the franchise and the best one in my opinion.Grand Theft Auto V changed the whole open world genre and what could be achieved bringing an amazing 3 player story and an enriched and content filled online which was like a huge mmo story itself. With GTA online getting a huge new update every month and then that update getting a sub update every 2 weeks you can never run out of things to do in GTA online. I extremely reccomend you buy this game as it wont be leaving us any soon. you will easily find yourself having fun in the world of San Andreas and will notice how quick your play time will increase! A MUST BUY!!!,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-20,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,The missions can be very creative and the writing has a good deal of humor. The characters are well fleshed out.The gameplay is boring. The gunplay is so basic it's dull. It takes forever to get from one mission to another. If you like euro truck simulator maybe you won't mind but when most of the gameplay is trying to weave your way through traffic I feel like I'm wasting my life. I spend enough time in traffic IRL as it is.I should try online more play but how long will those servers last? There are apparently lots of things to do online but none of it seems to be rewarding. Maybe if you like collecting cars but they implmented microtransactions to get more money and I hear the new vehicles they release can be very expensive requiring a lot of time to farm the money.Played another hour online.Nothing but loading screens to games with shared lives so you fail when someone else dies. The missions are in random areas of the open world so they are not actually built for gunfire. We were in this one place with bushes so you couldn't see the enemy but the enemy ai would shoot you. That's when a game actually started and I was not in some join leave cycle in the loby.I said the game was garbage in all chat and eveyone else playing agreed. And this game has the gull to not drop below half price after so many years. Screw it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-20,0,0,336,False,Recommended,Without diminishing this review to politics I thoroughly have enjoyed the few years of GTA Online I've gotten.Though I've been through hell and back multiple times due to them breaking the game with an update or an update being incompatible with a current GPU version. It still holds out to be my favorite time waster.If you don't like the idea of working for money or think that micro transactions are literally the only way to obtain money efficiently. You may need to step back breathe and try something else.For those who've gotten banned for simple file removal or exterior programs hooking to the GTA interface this is something that is stated as a bannable offense no matter what's doing the hooking or what file you removed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-20,0,0,70,False,Recommended,Best of the GTA series. Rockstar really put the time into this title to make it the most realistic game play in a GTA series title. Even though many people would consider this game a 3rd or 1st person shooter... it really takes on the element on an open world RPG (role playing game). If you ever tried the Elder Scrolls series.. this game is similar in a lot of ways only instead of swords and maces... you have shotguns and moltovs.. and where Elder Scrolls has guilds and moonsugar... GTA offers gang waves and crack. This game is truly designed to bring out your inner beast that we all have locked inside. Modify cars and race boats... pay for it all or become the cities most wanted thief. It's all there to enjoy!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-17,0,0,133,False,Recommended,To be honest I have played GTA before but it didn't keep my attention for hours. I just kinda played it because open world and beating people up is fun. I got to GTA IV and I loved being this russian gangster dude and then came GTA V. I have been watching video's for days until I finally got my copy. This game is just so AMAZING. I love stealing cars ramming cops driving over people in streets and laugh sadistically as I mutilate them with a pick up or huge SUV. This game just brings out your inner you. This game is like therapy for the soul. You can do whatever the hell you want and laugh as loudly as you like. The graphics is fantastic for me. Honestly it is smoother than melted chocolate for me. The gameplay is extremely stable. I have honestly only had one crash and I am okay with that. It's not like you need to patch it up and stick it with ducktape and then maybe it will run without issue. It's a myth. The movement and controlls are very easy to get used to. I wouldn't play it with a controller. Just not as smooth but maybe that is because I am solely used to keyboard and mouse. I love the audio. It's cristal clear. It's briliant. I love how it works fantastically with a 5.1 dolby surround sound system. The music is simply great in this game. I love every damn song on that radio including the ability to add your own songs. I get to shoot gangsters and massacre groups of guys in a mission while listening to Carry on my wayward son Kansas. Online is great. You aren't forced to only play in your region which makes it great. I admit that it's a little unstable with ping wise but I won't complain. You time out a bit too easy and it doesn't handle well with high pings. It looks to the other people normal but to you not and the other way around. Again I won't really complain since I have quite a good idea why and I understand. I like the mini challenges you get and heists are GREAT. You can wear a mask out of ducktape/ police tape!!!! That is friggen awesome!!!!!!!!The story is something I can't stop laughing about. I honestly find the story amusing. Just the guys anger issues hearing black people call each other n*****. It's so amusing. I like being the black and the white guy. Really funny on both sides. The cars you drive is something that just stirrs my love of a sexy smooth fast car. 100000/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,323,False,Not Recommended,I've gota lot of time sunk into this game. I actually bought it again I originally owned it on the 360 and then upgraded to PC. I've sunk a LOT of time into it. The game has a great single player campaign but Rockstar obviously doesn't care about single player because they haven't updated it like ever. They care about Online so that's what this review will be about.There's a lot of fun to be had online especially if you've got a few friends to gang up with. But there are SO MANY mechanisms in place to make you waste time on it it starts to get absurd. Every update adds a slew of new vehicles and ways to dominate the game locked behind an enormous paywall. The only way you can reliably purchase these new upgrades is by paying real world money for them hacking money into the game or grinding for an absurd amount of time. For a company that seems desperate to push the purchase of in game currency Rockstar has done VERY little to curb hacking in game. People who hack money gain a tremendous in game advantage and because they can kill any and all players at will can completely screw up a VIP mission something you had to pay to start in an instant in a way you can do nothing about.So to review an online experience with lots to do that demands you buy into it while simeltaneously failing to prevent cheaters from ruining the experience. You will lose a LOT of time and if you're gullible enough to pay for SharkCards you'll lose money as well getting invested in this.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-24,0,0,1014,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto is an amazing game. I enjoy every minute I play for various reasons these include story line graphics the ability to play GTA online and last but not least the characters. No matter how many times I play the game I never get sick of the main story line it is entertaining and funny as the cut scenes provide a gold mine of laughs along the way. The graphics in GTA although good are not be the best in the world however when you add some mods the game looks flawless. GTA online is lots of fun as there are lots of people there to play with. if you do not have many friends to play the game with it can sometimes be hard to make money however if you spend some time doing heists with friends you can walk away with lots of money to burn on the vast amounts of properties and vehicles up for purchase.And with the endless amount of updates such as the bikers DLC there is always something new to do. The main story line has three main characters to play as. Michael is a retired bank robber with a family who lives in a nice house in Los Santos who is trying his best to become a better father while also trying to have one last go at scoring big. Franklin is a young inexperienced kid with potential who grew up in the hood and after meeting Michael his life will take a huge turn for the best. Trevor never fails to disappoint he is a barrel of laughs mainly because he is clinically insane he has been called many names over the course of the game these include sociopath cannible and is an overall disturbed individual. In conclusion this is a fantastic game that is bound to leave a good taste in your mouth.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-22,0,0,607,False,Recommended,"The game that had fixed itselfThis game has fixed its issue by not pursuing OpenIV over their legal team and allowing OpenIV after a update. This was from reviews like this. For historical reasons I will keep the rest of the review The Shameful DemiseIf you remove the tool that you state is used to ""harass"" players make sure you fact check your argument. OpenIV couldnt modify online. If you were to it would give a error saying you are trying to enter online with a moded install and reverts back to singleplayer. Fact check your arguement. This was the most shamefull attempt to increase profits in a game in which the company already makes tons of money. Their driving force is to make the game a service not only you already paid for it they want you to buy their stuff the monetization. This monetization however had a competitor. Singleplayer mods. So to increase revenue they had to attempt to make the modding scene kick the bucket. We know that because they sent the Cease and Desist letter to the developer. The only issue is that even though that the mod scene will go on and their will be a replacement for OpenIV we know that will occur. The GTA modding scene will make one and maybe this time they wont be so nice to you rockstar with protecting your online by allowing mods to be used online.Not only this was shamefull it was a damn waist of peoples wants and cash. Not only did you screw some people who bought this game to mod singleplayer you screwed yourself this was because now people like I and the others here are going to not buy the next product published by Take Two.les Français The Shameful Demise Si vous supprimez l'outil que vous déclarez utilisé pour harceler les joueurs assurez vous de vérifier votre argument. OpenIV ne pouvait pas modifier en ligne. Si vous l'aviez fait cela donnerait une erreur indiquant que vous essayez d'entrer en ligne avec une installation modérée et revenir au joueur unique. Vérifiez votre argumentation.C'était la tentative la plus honteuse d'augmenter les bénéfices dans un jeu dans lequel l'entreprise fabrique déjà des tonnes d'argent. Leur force motrice est de faire du jeu un service non seulement vous avez déjà payé ils veulent que vous achetiez leurs affaires la monétisation. Cette monétisation cependant avait un concurrent. Modes unipersonnels. Ainsi pour augmenter les revenus ils ont dû essayer de faire en sorte que la scène modding lance le seau. Nous le savons parce qu'ils ont envoyé la lettre de cessation et de désistement au développeur. Le seul problème est que même si la scène mod continue et leur volonté de remplacer l'OpenIV nous savons que cela se produira. La scène de modélisation GTA en fera une et peut être cette fois ils ne seront pas si gentils avec vous rockstar en protégeant votre connexion en ligne en permettant aux mods d'être utilisés en ligne.Non seulement cela était honteux mais c'était la taille de la taille des besoins et de l'argent des gens. Non seulement avez vous vider certaines personnes qui ont acheté ce jeu au mod singleplayer vous vous êtes fautif car maintenant les gens comme moi et les autres ici n'achèterons pas le prochain produit publié par Take Two.el espanol La Demencia vergonzosa Si eliminas la herramienta que indicas que se usa para ""acosar"" a los jugadores asegúrate de comprobar tu argumento. OpenIV no podría modificar en línea. Si lo hicieras daría un error diciendo que estás intentando entrar en línea con una instalación modificada y vuelve a jugar solo. Realice su argumento.Este fue el intento más vergonzoso de aumentar los beneficios en un juego en el que la compañía ya hace toneladas de dinero. Su fuerza motriz es hacer que el juego de un servicio no sólo usted ya pagó por ella quieren que usted compre sus cosas la monetización. Esta monetización sin embargo tuvo un competidor. Mods de un solo jugador. Así que para aumentar los ingresos tuvieron que tratar de hacer que la escena de modding patear el cubo. Lo sabemos porque enviaron la carta de Cesar y Desistir al desarrollador. El único problema es que a pesar de eso la escena de mod seguirá y su será un reemplazo para OpenIV sabemos que se producirá. La escena GTA modding hará uno y tal vez esta vez no será tan agradable para usted rockstar con la protección de su línea permitiendo mods para ser utilizado en línea.No sólo esto era vergonzoso era una maldita cintura de la gente quiere y efectivo. No sólo has echado a perder a algunas personas que compraron este juego a un solo jugador te jodiste esto fue porque ahora la gente como yo y los otros aquí no van a comprar el siguiente producto publicado por Take Two.Россия Позорная смерть Если вы удалите инструмент который как вы заявляете используется для издевательства игроков убедитесь что вы действительно проверяете свой аргумент. OpenIV не может изменять онлайн. Если бы вы это сделали это дало бы ошибку заявляя что вы пытаетесь войти в сеть с установленной установкой и возвращаться к одиночному игроку. Факт проверяет ваши аргументы.Это была самая позорная попытка увеличить прибыль в игре в которой компания уже зарабатывает тонны денег. Их движущая сила заключается в том чтобы сделать игру услугой а не только вы уже заплатили за нее они хотят чтобы вы купили их вещи монетизацию. Однако эта монетизация имела конкурента. Модификации Singleplayer. Таким образом чтобы увеличить доход им пришлось попытаться сделать сцену моддинга пиком ковша. Мы знаем это потому что они отправили разработчику сообщение о прекращении и выдаче. Единственная проблема заключается в том что даже при том что мода будет продолжаться и их будет замена OpenIV мы знаем что это произойдет. Сцена для моддинга GTA сделает один и возможно на этот раз они не будут так хороши для вас как Rockstar защищая ваш онлайн позволяя модам использовать онлайн.Мало того что это было постыдно это была проклятая талия народов и денег. Вы не только закрепили некоторых людей которые купили эту игру чтобы разобраться в одиночном игровом модуле вы ввернули себя потому что теперь такие люди как я и другие здесь не будут покупать следующий",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Single Player and Mods are the only reason I play this game. Thanks Take Two.EDIT TO A POSITIVE REVIEW NOW THAT SINGLE PLAYER MODS ARE BACK,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,562,False,Recommended,It should be obvious with the news buzz the kind of things Take Two (and maybe Rockstar?) pull. Regardless I'll review the actual game now that the storm has passed.The game does have a fantastic world that is among my favorite ever crafted. The city the mountains it might seem small but it all fits in spots that feel right. The music both score and licensed is great. It's also fantastic looking. I have taken so many screen shots of sunsets and rises the cityscape and the ocean and the wilderness. Initially out in 2013 and in it's current graphical updated release in 2014/15 if you want eyecandy this game has it in spades.It's been a while since I've played through the story so I don't remember all that much of it. At its core that's really what it is relatively unremarkable and not terribly memorable. But it felt fine and there were plenty of points to make you laugh and it's worth a play through. Really though you're getting the game to have a romp in the world.That's where it excels. You can blow stuff up and have endless firefights through the city streets. Or you can nick a car off an unsuspecting lunch goer in the middle of a drug fueled rage. Spend ill gotten gains on a really fast car and lap the state in less than 15 minutes. (The world's size starts to break down at high speeds perhaps one of the few things that don't feel quite right.) Perhaps you'll find a bike and take it down the beach. Through the hills. Take it slow and go for a walk from Los Santos to Paleto Bay. The game pours life and charm and the world will absolutely capture you no matter what you decide to do.So you decide to start an Online character. Your own character your own story! More content! Friends! Better progression! What could go wrong?Those things are true but what's also true is the amount of grinding and back watching you have to do. Yeah I enjoy playing online because getting a new car or house feels like you earned it. At least most of them. So many things are now far above resonable prices and require just a bit too much grinding keeping you playing just a bit longer and wearing you down to spend some cash. Real cash. Because there are microtransactions they drive the new content economy and they suck. Hard. (Disclaimer I lean on the side of cynicism when it comes to microtransactions. I don't think GTA's is a good implementation of them.) Don't worry it's not pay to win though. It's hack to win.The back watching I refer to is the fact that even though I like online for having my own character despite missing several bits and collectables from singleplayer I only ever play on my own or with friends. Public sessions are a near guarantee of griefers and other hacks. Efforts to stop this are entirely unsuccessful and result in unbelievable moves like we saw with OpenIV that don't actually fix anything.So yeah. It's a fun game. I still fondly remember waiting for PC launch strung out by Rockstar like a dog on a leash. I've certainly got my time out of it. It's also made me even more skeptical about AAA companies like Take Two and take a harder stance on microtransactions where they don't belong. It's an important good game that everyone's going to remember for a long time but it's also a damn good example of the pitfalls of money grabbing and other industry issues. Issues that turn a world that's more alive than the best movie or painting into a battleground between the art and business of game making.EDIT Old review is left below.It's a great world and they've put a lot of really good work into it. It's pretty fun too. But it's run by Take Two which is guitly of Obscene microtransactions driving the prices of new content way up in Online they're also apparently underutlizied according to TT's CEO. Withholding content from singleplayer to get people to buy into aforementioned Online microtransactions really makes you wonder how much we'd be paying to play singleplayer only games in the furture at least from TT (Red Dead anyone?). Uses a broken copywright law and threatens legal action against people trying to make the game better and refuses to talk to content creators to find a solution. This of course leads to Taking down OpenIV a framework which has operated IN THE BOUNDS of Rockstar's rules and not allowed Online access with it installed. TT ignored that and waved their big golden rod in order to get rid of OpenIV so they could maybe earn some more cash from microtransactions. Even upon taking down the largest and best modding tools around in the name of ridding the game of hackers the game is still littered with them and it is impossible to play in a public session (where all the new content from the last year is locked to) without getting telefragged and blown up.So yeah the game is fun. If you're looking at reviews and debating on buying it though? Don't. Don't give Take Two another cent until they change. The Online is ed right now anyway and singleplayer isn't worth supporting Take Two and their t.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-26,0,0,49,False,Recommended,"I highly recommend buying this game on sale if you can. It has such a massive world and for $30 on sale you can't beat all the content the game gives. Although it is a great buy for anyone interested in these types of games there is one major gripe I have about it. In Grand Theft Auto Online there are plenty of hackers (which is not a surprise) and equally there is enough of an opportunity to hack. In online most of the nice DLC content (although ""Free"") costs a lot of in game money which isn't super easy to come by unless you mod/hack or grind non stop. This reason has led to a lot of people hacking for money the easier option or buying an ungodly amount of Shark Cards. I myself have been banned from GTA O for modding money in (not saying I don't deserve it) and I got my account which I have played for a LONG time (since Xbox 360) totally reset. Of course I deserved the reset but there is no ban appeal whatsoever so if you get banned for someone else dropping money onto you you have no option to appeal the false alarm. Despite the reset which will probably make me not want to play Online much (although it would be a fun challenge to start at level 1 in such a crazy online world with hackers) I have had days upon days of fun times on the story and in multiplayer with countless hours marked on Xbox 360. I can't say anything really about the story experience on PC although I have played it through on the 360 and I can say that it is a wonderful experience that will give you plenty of hours of gameplay. Bottom line the game is a must have although if you have never played online before you may encounter some trouble getting by since it is probably hard for a beginner to get by in a world that has aged so much.EDIT Also if you have an account from any other console that you don't play with anymore that has been leveled up decently you can transfer it over to PC (with Social Club). Just don't mod money in with that character and get it reset like me )",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,541,False,Not Recommended,Oh how the might have fallen.The GTA Series has long been a champion for digital outlaws. A game nay community of people who had a game in which they could practically do anything they wanted to do including the ability to manipulate it however they saw fit through mods. Rockstar themselves have been incredibly supportive of their communities trends over the years but lately due to corporate endeavours have been pushed to do the unthinkable.Removing a major player in the modding scene (OpenIV) ushers in a change many fear. As PC players having the freedom to manipulate games as they see fit (Provided its not at the expense of other players enjoyment) is an incredibly important form of expressing our love for games. Mods bring more players to a game and this obviously makes the developers and publishers more money but now I fear that they will want to take mods and monetise them for EXTRA personal gain.I long for the days of games made for the love and enjoyment of them.I can't in good conscience recommend GTA V to anyone anymore. Yes the microtransactions bring free content but at what cost?Grand Theft Auto is changing and this change is not for the end users good.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-26,0,0,832,False,Recommended,If you've never played or like me have played some of the classics like GTA 3 on console well this game is for sure a classic in the making. For the uninitiated this is a game the likes of which you ve not experienced before buy it!Adapted 2 years after its launch on console to the PC platform this game still surprises me with its everlasting ability to entertain. Certainly in GTA V the words there s nothing to do or I am bored were never uttered.PROS The level of customization of cars choices on game play and strategies and the sheer number of modes from heists to freemode to missions will keep you busy for hundreds if not thousands of hours.Some of the most fun I have had in this game involves picking up tanks with helicopters racing across the map for bounties taking out enemy VIPs as well as protecting my own and the immersive nature of the heists and co op missions. For the competitive there is an endless amount of money and customization to be collected and exercized. You'll be working to obtain vehicles based on asthetics or stats and enjoying the PVP both in freemode and in VS missions.For the single player oriented there is an intensely immersive single player experience or a non PVP availability of ghosting in freeplay to prevent other players from harming you. Basically you can do just about everything without having to face off against other players.I have also had a fantastic experience with R* support they ve refunded and even gone above and beyond and granted extra goodies for problems I faced within the game from hacking to failed purchases of apartments affecting my in game bank.There are secrets easter eggs and most importantly ongoing development from R* keeping the ongoings in this game fresh and alive.CONS The game of course has its drawbacks and could rightly also be called loading screen simulator 2016 it s unbelievable how long it takes to get in between modes. No really Be prepared for 1 minute + loading screens.Please let s not talk about how it s taken just under a year and a half to go on sale for the first time and how they keep pushing shark cards at every turn to keep us filling their coffers.Additionally the level of hacking that the game has seen has been absolutely absurd with players continuously circumventing the protections that are being put in place. Don t forget the fact that the game was adapted from a console so the zoom speeds control responsiveness menus and camera angles are maddeningly clunky for a PC player. MADDENINGLY CLUNKY.Let s also not go over the way R* seems to release cars that don t properly fit into the correct tiers this significantly hurts the racing community that simply likes to race particular cars and enjoy the extremes of the racing modes in the game. CONCLUSION It s a must own and a must play. Only you will decide if that s for a few days or for a few years but one thing is for certain you won t regret it!,Grand Theft Auto V

These games are just completely boring without proper multiplayer and Take 2/Rockstar have animosity towards anyone attemtping to fix their stale gameplay with modding. Also the gaming industry at large can't for the life of them just sell you a game and let you own it this game requires some crappy Social Club program to waste disk space and uses very aggressive DRM to protect the poor multimillion dollar company from being deprived precious dollars if a naughty hacker or a legitimate customer do something.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-09,0,0,1900,False,Recommended,Best Open World Game and Multiplayer/coop game ive ever played why? PROS no DLC bs no cosmetic micro transaction BS no pay to play content after release (all for free) no pay to win the best graphics and physics ever together in a game this big. Story(solo) mode is amazingly good like in all rockstar games Multiplayer and coop fun are even better than story mode!!!! probably the best connection to servers with multiplayer and coop that i have ever seen in my entire gaming life TONS of different (QUALITY) content that has been updated FOR OVER 3 YEARS FOR FREE!! GTAV still has more active players by far than any other game that tried to copy or resemble it like watchdogs Wildlands etc and still looks and RUNS better than any of them and is frankly pathetic that it was released in early 2013 and still better than any other fresh sorry attempts from other older and bigger companies like Ubisoft or EA or even Konami. CONS Hackers a lot the good thing is that you can play with your friends completely unmolested by them in a Public Lobby with one click tools provided by the community and if a hacker gets in and the lobby has enough smart people in it you can kick the hacker out in seconds by votting kick really easy. Its not a fix for hackers so the con here i think is the fact that they should have 24/7 ADMINS to monitor the lobbies where theres irregular activity and/or reports to ban hackers/cheaters IMMEDIATLEY cause hacker killed most of the player population in the game and thats something that should had never happen to a game as good as this one.,Grand Theft Auto V

They are doing it for free and to have some fun. You better do something useful and fix the GTAOnline which is a # $%&amp $# garbage. There is no other game that gives me more headache than this. It's literally a loading simulator and playing with a friend is a bloody nightmare. It is completely counter intuitive and we are always laughing with a friend when something works for a change that it's probably a bug.

It's fun though if you got good internet speed and prolly very fun with friends. But if you want to buy this game for mods dont bother. you might as well buy it when it offers discount 99% discount cause its not just worth it if you only play single player and mod it. Real sad when they allow mods for gta for a long time and killing it off like it was a pest like it didn't do anything good for the game for the past years just becasue they think it was responsible hackers to have easier job beating their software such a rush action of banning mod like it was a newly discovered threat is a disrepect to those that actually promoted the game for them.

Cannot go into every store and rob them just select ones and these limits make the game frustrating.The shootouts are fun just the limitations on being able to rob everything/anything hurts the game as sometimes you just want to run amuck.7.3/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,561,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a game I've anticipated for a while and already within the first 15 minutes I wasn't let down by the storyline. Pros of GTA V +Storyline The main reason you got this game besides the multiplayer.+Freeroam Sandbox One of the reasons why you play GTA besides missions you can freeroam and do other side activities both in singleplayer and multiplayer.+First person mode Some bonus rewards online for playing heists start to end in this.+Rockstar Editor Create custom movies using these sandbox tools+GTA Online play new missions collect collectables and play events with friends includes custom editor.+Controller support atleast for Xbox360 controllers it makes flying easier than the keyboard for me.Cons of GTA V Police AI You won't see police patroling and they are really dumbed down compared to GTA IV which is a let down. GTA Online connectivity Sometimes it can be hard to keep a session with friends when there are server issues. Nothing can be more fustrating when you lose friends in a session because their login servers go offline. Rockstar Social Club required It is required to play both Single Player and Multiplayer so if it goes down then you can't play offline.Overall I was mainly disappointed with the Police AI as in GTA IV you could see patrols and the cops reacting to fights by arresting or intervening in GTA V the cops will either flat out kill you or they'll just keep ramming you off the road and become more irritating than they were in GTA IV. Despite that the police are more brutal and if your clever enough you can evade them by breaking line on sight and no longer having your minimap flash red to indicate you've been spotted.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-12,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,At first a few years ago I thought oh a new addition to the Grand Theft Auto collection. When I purchase any game or addon I wait a few months / years watching the reviews get gradually better over time I decided to purchase the game although I have very little experience or game time with this I ve found it is very resource demanding. Performance upon start up is reasonably good but a few stutters may occur after that everything is fine. Gameplay and story mode is a good touch. Nice to see some little added effects such as when rain drops lands on a puddle there is a small droplet effect. The creators on the other hands to me is only in it for the money giving us little customer support is just a disappointment. And the price Grand Theft Auto IV was almost half the price of this game and they are almost equal in graphics and total quality of the game. The community was able to give better and more thorough support than any of the staff I ve spoken to. Online mode is just a disaster. You start off with very little money and are expected to do what? One after another comes a 12 year old selfless hacker who just wants to ruin it for everyone. Spending real life money just for one simple car in the game and yes spending more to purchase upgrades for your needs is not even worth trying now a days. Developers could focus or even put their efforts into fixing bugs UI problems and at least try to ban the person who is actually hacking not the people they are messing around with by bringing them into your car. Once you re in it there s no going back once banned all your money wasted just for an imaginary car that I brought for a few days and had it practically confiscated from me and stripping me of my access to the online feature. Purchasing your first house is just out of the list. Don t even think about looking at the prices of these. Stick to the very top of the list or cheap side of the game and forget about everything else. Connecting to the game is the worst part having to wait 10 minutes a few times made me think I m already connecting to online. But no hell no. This was just to load up the menu. This would be the type of game I d like to play. Online Friendly staff and members clean server. But no forget about it. Stick with the wonderful story mode to take your mind off thinking of going into multiplayer and just go with the flow. It s a 0 from me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,457,False,Not Recommended,"I have been modding GTA since probably the year 1999. I used to design my own 2D cars in top down view and import them into the game. I modded GTA 3. I modded Vice City. I modded San Andreas. And you better bet I modded GTA IV. I put a Delorean in GTA IV and I made it super fast and super heavy and super strong and I would barrell down traffic like an unstoppable object.I used to spend hours on the forums of Gouranga.com which had some kind of official support. All the GTA 3 era games had simple ""handling"" files that anyone could tinker with adding hours of fun and enjoyment to the game. I have bought multiple copies of the same GTA game for multiple platforms. I bought Vice City for PS2 and PC. I modded Vice City so that it had the map of Liberty City from GTA 3 but you had motorcycles and helicopters.I have always loved the GTA series because it is the ultimate sandbox game. This is your core fanbase your hardcore fans. The DLC and online was okay but it was mostly annoying. Do I enjoy playing online with people? Yes sometimes.Would I rather have a whole new game? Yes most definitely. Am I going to put up with an online system that is overall just kind of really annoying? Not for long.Rockstar Games used to be the best. Solid quality period.

2017-06-17,0,0,184,False,Not Recommended,"Having Bought Two Copies of GTA V and playing well over three hundred hours on console and PC I can say that while the single player is great It lacks replayability outside of the heists and going crazy in the free roam. The Online aspect has been the subject of many false promises Hackers running free Overpriced Vehicles and weapons and a general cluster of issues. The only thing that made this game worth while to many people anymore is the fact that you can mod this game with a nearly limitless amount of mods to fill many different types of play. A lot of people have put days of their lives into their projects and mods to make this game more then what people thought it could be. Take Two however has decided that in an moronic attempt to fix something that should've been fixed very early into the release of GTA Online They should take down OpenIV Not that it will do any good. GTA Online had so much promise and it was wasted infavor of fairly pointless DLC that costs an incredible amount of in game money in an obivious ploy to push people to buy ""Shark Cards""",Grand Theft Auto V

Fair enough I said 30 mins later i had $60 million again.Never got on my account with a 3rd party program for more than 20 mins to do outfits or money.One day i seen one of my friends with a Juggernaut outfit with Tron clothes underneath had to have it.Bought GTA FORCE ELITE and made the outfit on story mode on a seperate account.Got on my main account and loaded online and put the outfit on and saved it and logged off immediatly.Next week a ban wave hits and i get suspended after all that.I am in no way upset because i knew i broke their EULA.But the fact that we cant get all of the cool clothes without modding or doing glitches is rediculus.They put a cool tactical vest with magazines in it in online for CEO stuff and we cant even buy it WHY???????I get the Juggernaut outfit isnt suppost to be a normal outfit but the vest and all the joggers and stuff like that?ALSO the fact that we cant put bennys rims on all vehicles is really annoying and to justify it i have to save cars with them from modders.My Thoughts On The Gunrunning DLC It is all great and all but the explosive sniper bullets ruin the PVP it takes absoloutly no skill to use them and it ruins the game for the original players that actually got really good at sniping with normal ammo or flying jetsAND THE TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE VS OPEN IV THING IS THE TOPPING ON THE CAKE!!! Rockstar &amp Take Two Interactive You are doing nothing to help your game by doing that infact Open IV has nothing to do with the methods of online modding atleast to my knowledgein fact i have alot of modder friends and they have been on their accounts for weeksMODDERS ARE RUINING THIS GAME!I have seen first hand what they can do it is too much and something needs to be done.i am completly fine with a modder here and there just chilling and playing around but all they really do is crash your game when you kill their friend or blow up the whole lobby or teleport everyone to them over and over until everyone leaves.To combat them my group has a few modders that will try to crash the malicious modder.I understad that they will find a way to do it again after rockstar fixes all the exploits but something has to be done.From the sources I read Rockstar was suppost to come out with a new ANTI CHEAT with the Gunrunner DLC After The Gun Runner DLC was released GTA FORCE 2.2 was fine to use still with no reported bansWHAT HAPPENED TO THAT????????Overall it is a great well made game other than a few things that are overlooked and i will continue to play it but i feel like the devs / company makes some poor decisions. I am leaving this game a negetive review because whoever is in charge of the decisions doesnt seem to know what is going on they may or may not be only be doing everything for the money without worrying about their customer base in the first place and they seemingly have lost the war on modders scince 360.,Grand Theft Auto V

So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and it's all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo.

It's big and beautiful and realistic. There are a lot of different vehicles minigames customizations. But this world is intended just for admiration while you look around or drive a car. Unfortunately there is nothing to explore the buildings are just emty boxes without enter you can go to the subway tonnel or on the roof of the skyscraper but there are no reasons for that because you can't find anything there.

2017-06-22,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,The online is a joke anyone thinks otherwise should play gta IV or any other online gta game before shutting this point down. Making money is the most difficult thing in the game. Sure they keep milking the game with addons but i cant even play the addons because of money. I could pay $20 $100 more to get the money but thats not logical when i could just get a new game that has some what the same things in it. better yet play GTA IV because it doesnt require you to play for 100+ hours to get a tank or jet and everyone has equal access to a tank and jet. Not to point out the mods make the graphics on par with this game. somthing this game cant do. unless you want to play alone but wheres the fun in that? I understand its unfair if somone has infinet health is unfair but changing the graphics isnt. open IV cant be sued since they arnt infringing on any rights they only supply a software for free no cash needed it should be held agents people who use it for not the intended use.

2017-06-26,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,GTA 5 is a great open world RPG with good gameplay and tons of whacky things that you can do in the game. The map is gigantic and there's always random events or crazy side missions that you can do tons of single player content would recommend that.However I have a lot of issues with this game.Firstly the menus are grade A garbage fire and they have unintuitive controls.Secondly rockstar's social club is trash and makes the game take forever to load.Thirdly after paying for a 60$ game rockstar decided it would be a good idea to put microtransactions into the online component. Yep for buying a full priced triple A game you get the pleasure of having the opportunity to pay for ingame currency. Which brings us to one of the big issues that are the mods. Rockstar recently decided to ban mods not only in the multiplayer portion of the game but the singleplayer portion as well. This takes away community made content which they supported in the past simply because their bottom line wasn't big enough yet.4/10 wouldn't reccomend.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-26,0,0,628,False,Not Recommended,As time passes being 3 some years into the game's release it seems it is becoming more and more of a play to win style game with the shark card system that Rockstar has implemented. From low pay heavy grinding missions to enemy and neutral MPCs making it living hell to do CEO work it could take a player sometime before being able to purchase something interesting in the game and enjoy the new things with each DLC. Yes I understand that Rockstar is a company and they have to make a profit but I am sorry what they have done and what they have refused to do for the Online community(the players that have fun without being ***holes) is simply unacceptable in my opinion. On the subject of players it seems to me catagorized into three different types. There are the regular players who mind there own and have fun with there friends the toxic griefers who enjoy messing around with the hard working players for fun and the worst of all the online hackers who turn each session they enter into a fest of stupidity and anger. In regards to Rockstars recent banning of singleplayer mods well there is not much that I can say simply because I have never tried modded GTA 5. However from what I know it seems really stupid for the company to literally stab half of there community and OpenIV in the back. Overall I believe that the game has gone down the drain and unless Rockstar gets it together and wake up to the anger of there community they will be going down the drain.,Grand Theft Auto V

It has some very creative missions and side missions with easily the best graphics and game dynamics I have seen working to date it does lack the simplicity of GTA one and two and at street level without the missions or side missions it can become tiresome the online play is also very satisfying I recommend buying it if you have the right system spec as long as Im not bugging about what it hasn't got I'd like to see it remade again in a more individualy customisable manor with missions made slightly differently more true to the original game based in a different decade lets hope theres plenty of remixes on the cards of the same game slightly different than it is and it would be hugely entertaining.,Grand Theft Auto V

Always have been ever since the very first birds eye view grand theft auto back all those year's ago on the PS1 Console. I have GTA5 on both Xbox 360 Xbox 1 and PS4. Including my Gaming P C.

2016-05-29,0,0,1202,False,Not Recommended,I ing loved this game. I don't anymore.Rockstar has adopted something extremely similar to a F2P model to squeeze every last cent out of GTA. Everything is behind a paywall at this point. It is righteously depressing. This game was some of the most fun I've ever had online from just mindlessly driving through the mountains to joining MC RP crews and PVP crews. With the last few updates it's become ever so apparent how much of a cash grab GTA has become. There are so many paywalls behind everything and so many t ways Rockstar obstructs you from getting what you want. A good example would be getting a fully upgraded Weaponized Tampa that you saw in the Gunrunning trailer with the rockets mortars and duel miniguns. The thing looked damn sweet. After the update drops you boot the game and learn that it doesn't have any of those upgrades so you need to buy a MOC in order to upgrade your car. But wait you can't buy an MOC unless you own a bunker. So you grind your off buy both and go to upgrade your Weaponized Tampa but wait! You need to do randomized research in order to unlock the weapons you have no option of selecting what you want you need to sit there and ing pray to whatever God you worship that he'll give you the upgrades you wants so you don't waste time or money. The golden days of GTA Online have long past now they're charging $70 for a starter pack. A ING STARTER PACK FOR A $60 TITLE. EVEN AFTER YOU BUY THE STARTER PACK YOU STILL NEED TO GRIND SO YOU CAN BUY THE YOU ACTUALLY WANT.I am so ing done with this game. Honestly if you are going to buy GTAV download a mod menu and spawn yourself some money because you do not want to subject yourself to the torture of griefers and the monotonous grind that this game has become.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-04,0,0,1404,False,Not Recommended,Mods changed my mind for 166.492hours until my game crashed cuz i has bad PC.I have spent a lot of time in Grand Theft Auto V Online and I have had lots of fun when the game first came out on PS3 and there was not super expensive vehicles clothes and other items but now the whole game is pretty much a grind so you can buy a stupid car that can't hit 20 mp/h. 60 for 8million dollars in game is really over priced for how expensive the items are in game. If you have a couple friends that would play this game with you then it's a great time and lots of fun but if you are going to be playing alone then don't buy this game unless you want to play single player. Most of my hours are me playing with friends but when I start playing on my own I get bored really fast.,Grand Theft Auto V

Liara T'soni was playing with Garfields ears and Matriarch Benezia was playing with his toes and sexy belly button. As ladies massaged his body Garfield laid back enjoying expensive wine with his lasagna meal.""Garfield why must you fight why can you not be staying with us here at this moment. We can hide away forever and enjoy the love of our bodies."" Asked Liara T'soni with questions.""Sorry Chicken pocks. I am a fighting man and the fighting man must fight for it is his fight alone."" Said Garfield with determination.""I understand your words but they make my heart cry."" Said Matriarch Benezia with sad understanding.""Do not cry heart tears my flour sack. After I save galaxy we will have a celebration of physical kind."" Reassured Garfield with kindness.""Garfield you know what to say to make comfort of me."" Said Matriarch Benezia with comfort.Garfield then stood up and walked to pilot room where Joker was sitting to give the orders.""Joker it is time. Prepare Normany for space flight. Time to spread your wings and soar."" Garfield said with encouragement.""Garfield you taught me everything I know of piloting and what it means to be a man. You are like father I have never had."" Joker said with tear in his eye.""Yes dear joker and you are like son I never wanted. But enough sentimentalities. Now comes final test of manhood are you ready?"" Garfield asked with questions.""Yes I am ready I will not fail you. Time for lifting off!"" Declared Joker as he revved Normany motor and prepared for taking off.Garrus then approaches Garfield for sentences filled with discussion.""Garfield there is no turning back now are you ready for final battle?"" Asked Garrus with meaning.""I was born with lasagna in my mouth and gun in my hand. Bring on the hell of battle."" Declared Garfield to all.""Let us do it!"" Shouted Garrus high fiving Garfield.Miranda came to Garfield filled with worry and clenched his arm (which was full of muscle) tight.""Garfield I am worried. I have premonition of tragedy."" Miranda full of concern.""Do not worry my delicious diva. The lies of Evil can not stand against my fist of truth."" Said Garfield with certainty.""Besides worry makes women fat and ugly."" Said Garfield with joking as he slapped her behind.""Oh Garfield you charm me like snake in a jar."" Said Miranda with blushing.""When we are done I will let my snake out of its jar."" Said Garfield with flirtations.""Garfield you make my mouth watering with hunger."" Said Miranda with desire.""Keep your appetites in check my sweets for now is time for mission."" Said Garfield as he took command.As Garfield sat at commander's throne he took out lasagna for enjoyment as ship began to move.""Garfield you mad? Lasagna will spill in such crazy speed."" Said Garrus in shock.""No worry my cautious compadre. Behold."" Said Garfield as he took out a marvelous device.""What?"" Said Garrus with questions.""It is the gyrobowl. Look with wonder."" Said Garfield as he took out lasagna and put it in.As Normany sped at speed of sand and fury Lasagna stayed in bowl without spilling. It was miraculous to all.""WHAT SORCERY IS THIS?"" Exclaimed Garrus pointing at Gyrobowl.""Relax your tensions. It is miracle of science and engineering."" Said Garfield with reassurance.""Yes I wish to study Gyrobowl for scientific discovery. It holds knowledge beyond my understanding."" Said Dr. Mordin Solus examining gyrobowl with microscope.""I must have gyrobowl for myself then I will not spill things anymore then at long last my dreams will come true."" Thought Garrus to himself.Garrus then went into daydream fantasy imagining himself inside a giant gyrobowl with countless hot ladies laughing and pleasuring eachother. But fantasy turned into nightmare as giant gyrobowl span out of control sending Garrus and ladies into hurricane. The gyrobowl then came to life and began devouring Garrus and the ladies.""AHHHH."" Screamed Garrus as he descended to madness of Gyrobowl nightmare.Garfield grabbed Garrus by collar and slapped him with sense.""Take hold of it man."" Said Garfield slapping Garrus.""I am sorry I was lost in a nightmare of spinning agony."" Said Garrus sweating with nerves.""Be careful do not let Gyrobowl consume your soul."" Said Garfield with knowledge.""You are wisdom."" Said Garrus in admiration.Garfield then sat back down and launched words from his mouth full of orders.""Prepare to go in Omega Relay. This time no more playing nice!"" Roared Garfield with triumph.At Garfields orders Joker revved engine and sped Normany into Omega relay like a space dolphin on his last day on earth with no regrets. As Normany entered Omega relay all braced themselves for combat.""Look!"" Said Garrus pointing at approaching ship. It was Collector ship!The collector ship approached with menacful flight looking to destroy all.""What do we do?"" Cried out Joker in panic.""Fire the blasters!"" Ordered Garfield without fear.Normanys blaster cannons charged full of energy blasted the Collector ship but they were deflected!""NO!"" Cried out Miranda as he clung to Garfields manly figure for protection.All of crew braced for worst as collector ship approached when suddenly all heard a familiar voice.""AMAKOOOOOO.""It was Jon Arbuckle soaring through space with his element zero katana and his hair and cloak blowing in wind! Jon Arbuckle had rugged scar on left eye and grizzled stubble. Jon Arbuckle soared through the collector ship and slashed it in half with his element zero katana exploding it in pieces. Jon Arbuckle then came on board to Normany space ship to greet his old friend Garfield.""Garfield it is good to be seeing you again after long years of time."" Jon Arbuckle said embracing Garfields hand for shaking.""Jon Arbuckle it is good to see your future face. Thank you for killing collectors you are top notch space swordsman."" Said Garfield with thanks.""No problem Garfield nothing like sliced space ship and collector juice for healthy breakfast."" Said Jon Arbuckle with wisecracks.After destroying collector spaceship Normany pushed on further until they saw Odies space fortress.""Land head for maximum impact!"" Garfield said as he looked at space fortress with telescope like true captain.With Garfields majestic words Normany smashed into the space fortress with power of Garfields women pleasing manhood. It was monster crash but all were alright.""Normany is barely in one peace."" Said Garrus with exasperation.""Good thing I always use protection."" Said Garfield cleverly.Garfield and crew marched on into the Space Fortress to find Odie and put an end to his wicketry. Garfield then came across doorway. A voice with foreboding talked to them. It was Odie!""Haha Garfield I knew you would be coming. If you wish to face me then enter my gauntlet of trials. Prepare to face a waking nightmare!"" Odie cackled with evil.""There will be no dreams in the sleep I will be sending you to!"" Said Garfield with teeth clenched with anger.""It is sure trap."" Garrus warned with advice.""Then let us trigger it."" Garfield roared as he ran in.Garfield and crew ran through hallways and encountered collector soldiers but they were not a match for his might. Garfield shot all collectors with his trusty Desert Eagles without blinking a sweat.""Worms are best used for fishing not fighting."" Scoffed Garfield at collectors as he blasted them to pieces.Garfield and crew then came to large open room. Odie was heard again with voice of taunting.""Garfield you may have warrior spirit but can even a real man such as yourself face friend?""

Single player is fun but only once since rockstar/taketwo/whoever decided not to release ANY additions whatsoever to single player. Multiplayer is... waaaay too expensive and grind heavy. Either grind heavily or pay lots and lots of bucks for all the fun stuff ingame. Essentially microtransactions ruined the online game at least for me.

2017-12-22,0,0,1287,False,Not Recommended,About half the time the servers are down and it's not just the online game that is affected. You have to have a social club for single player gaming too and if that's not enough even your single player gaming is comprimised when the servers are down. I can understand the measures that have to be taken against piracy and stuff but at what cost? The cost of regulary interfering with the players' experiences who bought the game? If the company wants to take measures then that's up to them but why mess up the basic things of the game like loading the parts of it that doesn't even require connection for people who have paid for it and just want to play sp when og is not available? If the cost of securing profit by preventing piracy was equal to forcing the players who have acquired it to comprimise even small companies would have thrived on such immature short sighted algorithms. For such a company to take this cheap and (we rule we don't care attitude) road it's not just something that you would expect considering their reputation. This review is for my overall experience after playing for a little over a year and I do think that just loading the game shouldn't be a part of such otherwise great game as not every person has the time to stare at screen for an hour to load the game and get the error message.,Grand Theft Auto V

Online adversary is fun but the lobbies are only full during 2x Money &amp XP. I recommend getting a good group of friends to play this game as playing alone makes this grind harder.

With hilarious things every time from micheal walking around on the beach to trevor having intercourse with women. The addition of first person makes the game even more of a blast. Graphic wise its probably the most beautiful game ive ever seen i can run on very high setting 1080p getting 60fps no matter where i go.

I just joined a server and noticed someone had put a ridiculous bounty on me. Next thing I now it's showing that I'm killing everyone in the server my game locks up and I had to restart my WHOLE ING COMPUTER. Why can't people just play the damn game as it was intending ? Why do this little punk mother ers have to ruin the experience for everyone that paid money to enjoy the content?

2017-04-30,0,0,395,False,Recommended,"The game is great in every aspect. Graphics customability weapons activities. Even silly stuff like just taking your BMX to the local skate park for 10 minutes of goofing off. Great fun.One player the story is fantastic. I love how characters are intertwined. Great script and well executed.The only one downfall and MAJOR downfall is the hacks mods people use and the cheating. It ruins everything.As soon as something weird happens I can't kill someone despite putting a whole clip into them characters on the server being mashed together in the middle of nowhere to stolen guns being frozen you name it if I can hit ""new server"" quick enough then usually you can get away unscathed. Still disrupts your activity and gameplay.There are some pretty nasty things done to random players too. These cheaters will keep you restarting the game due to crashes restarting Steam and ultimately having to restart your PC to get back online at least that's been my experience anyway. I can waste a half an hour trying to get back online.There you have it. It's great. But expect to be bothered by these 'modders'. I wish Rockstar would implement some sort of initiative. I mean since they sell in game credit cards often paid for by real credit cards in real life I'm sure it would be worth their while to put a stop to the cheating There's a lot of 'free money' being tossed around by the same people costing Rockstar potentially gobs of real money.Maybe there's something I'm missing regarding real to fake money. But finally despite the game wrecking jerks if you haven't played GTAV then there's definitely something you're missing.

Besides the main story this game offers the players vast varieties of activities and places to explore. There's weeks worth of content to be seen even for the most dedicated of players. Once the singleplayer campaign is over the player is still given smaller missions and activity alerts on the phone keeping the world feeling so alive. Should the player want a bigger challenge though they can switch to multiplayer and attempt to do some heists with friends which can be quite challenging. All in all this game will last you a while and is fun for weeks months and even years.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-13,0,0,486,False,Recommended,Really only going to talk about story mode which in all honesty is what GTA games used to be. Story mode is pretty crap. It fails to do what GTA SA did back in the day. I feel no attachment to the locations like I did with Grove Street or Area 69 or that Ghost Town in the middle of the desert the airfield the jet pack having 3 completely different cities with all sorts of side jobs that you could do even after the story was complete. San Andreas was a living breathing world or at least it made you feel like it was. Eating playing pool buying clothes working out getting tatted up customizing your car buying different houses all with shallow differences driving trains sky diving robbing peoples houses killing crack dealers walking through the hood because it felt like the hood like your hood learning different melee fighting styles leveling up your gun skills getting a girlfriend riding bicycles killing people with spray paint gambling and of course the hydra. GTA San Andreas was a real breakthrough that pushed the competition to the next level. GTA V feels like a movie set. Good characters good driving good physics good sound fun guns fun npcs awesome cars great graphics. I don't like how Trevor Mike and Franklin all have preset clothes to purchase for their characters. You could make CJ look like anything you wanted. The lack of this in V makes the game feel more like a movie. The characters can't break character. It is my right to speak my opinion so feel free to hate it While I absolutely love GTAV it will never steal my heart the way San Andreas did.,Grand Theft Auto V

Honnestly things cost way more than you'll ever be able to play to unlock and the predatory pricing is definitely to make you buy shark cards. them. I'm not saying everything should be free or anything like that just that by playing say 6 hours a night you should be able to get somewhere to get what you like in a week. I wouldn't have so much of a problem with it if shark cards were not so much of a rip off. We are talking about pixel things....selling the dlcs at a fixed price to unlock their content at say 25 euros each would be much much cheaper than using shark cards to do the same. If you would want to unlock the fun stuff all at once i suspect you'd have to pay more than a few hundred euros. No game is worth that much. Period. they are also cracking down on modding the game. I paid for this game i wanna do what i want with it there is no competitive pvp element to it like you'd have in say CSGO or overwatch so off and dont' touch mods. Having the option to be Iron Man and stomping cards like noboduis buisness is my idea of fun i bought this leave me be.I will not be buying Rockstar games anymore at least not until they are worth what they are becoming less than 5 euros on sale so you can throw your copy in the fire if they feel you are not playing like they want you to play.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-20,0,0,470,False,Not Recommended,Hundreds of hours invested so I feel I have enough experience with the game to leave an honest review. Short answer I do not recommend this product. Story mode is worth a look for sure. It is a really fun experience. I have good memories of this! GTA Online is the problem. It.....is a MESS. Every session you join expect a modder(gta term for hacker). A wide range of things can happen to you almost all are bad. You can be given hundreds of millions of dollars which will probably get you banned anyway even if you didn't ask for it. You can have a burning log shoved up your butt dropped off in the middle of the ocean put in a cage have all your money stolen have all your weapons stolen blown up over and over. All of this sounds funny at first but after you experience it just a couple times it gets old. It really ruins the fun. And you can't kill the modder because the little turd is always invincible. The game has such a good foundation and is such a good game that it is a pure shame to leave a negative on it. But if you play online and you have this experience you will come here and leave the same review. It is frustrating and Rockstar should have dealt with it a long time ago. Shame on you for charing 59.99 for a 4 year old game that is infested with modders. You can only hit 'find new session' so many times before you get up and go outside and play basketball.

As characters gain experience grow and their performance and this in turn improve their skills improves reaction speed and endurance. The more the player uses the skill the corresponding figure is growing rapidly. For example if Michael to fly on a helicopter it will increase the flight indicator. And personal indicators specific to each of the characters that is if Franklin is a lot riding on a vehicle driving figure will rise only he Michael and Trevor this characteristic remains unchanged.Special abilities.

Increased stamina allows your hero longer run swim and ride a bike before he gets tired but if you continue to pace yourself the hero will begin to lose health. In carrying out these activities the figure is growing.Shooting. The high firing rate reduces the impact of all kinds of weapons and makes the hero more accurate in addition the hero will be able to carry more ammunition and recharges quickly.

2017-05-29,0,0,121,False,Recommended,GTAV is probably my favorite and most played game of all time and now is both the best and worst time to start playing. Ive been playing since it originally released on 360/ps3 and havent stopped since. The single player is by far the most in depth single player in GTA history. The ability to take control of 3 unique characters the choices and pacing of the story the absolute freedom to play as you please along with a plethora of activities to keep you busy for days makes SP a 10/10 for me. Now online is a bit of a different story. Ive been through the highs and lows of GTA online and right now it has its positives and negatives. The positives would definitley be the insane amount of things to do from street races stunt races heists adversary modes and those are only a few of the game modes youll find yourself playing. The multiplayer lobby is my favorite place to play though because there are always different things going on for you to get into. Customization goes deep. Like really deep. From your character your weapon choices cars apartments the choices are nearly endless.Now the bad. At this point in time GTA Online feels like a pay to play game unless youve grinded countless hours into the game. To my own personal dissapointment i found i could no longer transfer my character to PC so i had to start from scratch which really hurt considering i had over 1000 hours put into the game previously. Starting new made me realize how much shark cards help you get to try new things out but they are so eroniously overpriced that you may as well hope to get to try out that sweet new car that just release because someone left it unlocked on the side of the street. All in all ill probably keep playing online until R* stops updating and the servers go down forever. The games great SP or MP. If its on sale pick it up maybe get a shark card (honestly though anything less than 8 mill isnt really worth squat anymore) get some friends together and make some mayhem!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,301,False,Not Recommended,For many GTA has been an icon of our childhoods for 20 years. Why exactly is that? Because it was a game of freedom. A true sandbox where you could do as you pleased. In this era adding multi player components to your game is pretty much madatory. Especially a game as big as GTA. However they completely went the greedy developer way with their lousy system of shark cards while keeping in game money a pain in the to obtain. In the online part of the game the most important aspect of the immense sandbox feel that nearly every GTA brought with it disappeared. A cancer on the industry.This was fixable. Through mods. I could play the game with friends in a private session and we could just do whatever we wanted with mods. That's where the absolute fun came from. We didn't like the original GTA online. We liked just having no restrictions and play in a massive sandbox. Now they shut down one of the best mod tools for GTA. And all I can see is . YOU. I know you got plenty of filthy casual normies behind you to just ignore this and move on with your crappy attitude on the gaming market but real gamers will not forget.

They also can't keep their word (the release dates and the promised DLC) have a poor anti hacker system and generally treat the players like crap.Otherwise it's a pretty good game though I don't think it's worth 60 .",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game some time ago so I cannot ask for my money back now. Fine fair enough.As a modder of other games I find it highly worrying that Take Two interactive has decided that it wants to target OpenIV. Let me make this clear if Take Two had done even the slightest bit of research they would have found that OpenIV is a modding tool coded to only work with the single player part of Grand Theft Auto V. It cannot function with the online component of Grand Theft Auto V in any way. Their cack mouthed 'statement' shows just how ill aware they are of pretty much anything to do with modding at all.Let me put this scenario to you. You're a cop there's a gunman and he has a hostage with a gun pointing to their head. Do you shoot the gunman? That's the sensible thing to do. But instead of shooting the gunman you shot the hostage and watch as the gunman prances away unbothered. In case the metaphor is unclear Take Two is the inept police officer in this scenario online cheaters are the gunman and OpenIV is the hostage Take Two just shot dead.We like to rag on corporations like EA but even EA won't shut down single player modding on Star Wars titles. When I have to jump to use EA the perceived worst video game company as an example of something GOOD you know you ed up. It's almost like these guys are trying to take the crown. The sooner Rockstar finds themselves a different publisher the better. To anybody considering buying this game don't. Take Two don't give a about you. Until they learn to do some basic research before handing out cease and desists and shooting the hostages I'd suggest steering clear of any title this company puts out. Take Two.,Grand Theft Auto V

It doesnt affect me in some way but it kind of sucks imo. Another con would be players that kill other players for no actual reason. I absolutely understand it's not R*'s fault but it still annoys me when a stupid 5 year old kid blows up my X80 Proto. RE EDIT My game finally works ... I updated my windows to windows 10 the game works really well and smooth I really appreciate that R* puts out new DLCs every month or so to keep the players entertained ( FREE DLC I repeat FREE ).

2017-06-17,0,0,59,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be a lot of fun. I put more than 200 hours in to GTA online on the Playstation and have put more than a hundred hours in to single player on Playstation and Steam combined.That said I have a couple complaints The online has been completely ruined by Shark Cards and the outrageous pricing on the new in game stuff like boats cars and houses. Honestly the game was a lot lot lot more fun when everyone cheated but it was still feasible to make progress in game without cheating or paying for money.Now you can't get any of the new cars or stuff without A being one of the people who cheated a bunch to begin with and still has a ton of money left over from that or B spending more than the retail price of the game on Shark Cards. It makes it even worse that I'm afraid to cause too much trouble in game because I don't want to lose money on insurance and ammo but people who have cheated or are willing to buy Rockstar's t points run around causing wanton distruction because they have enough money to not care.The amount of money that you get from completing missions and races absolutely does not make it possible to obtain any of the new stuff in game without spending an outrageous amount of hours doing it. This is one of the biggest reasons my friend and I who used to play daily don't anymore. I bought this game on PC because modding GTA SA and GTA IV was a load of fun and I expected this to be similar. Then Rockstar went and ruined that. Rockstar and Take Two.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-20,0,0,618,False,Not Recommended,Online is full of hackers which makes it literally unplayable. Single player offers no character customization. Once you play through the pre determined story there is nothing to do. You have a big giant beautiful city where you can't enter any of the buildings or create any semblance of your own life in the city. No fun and now they don't allow modders to make up for Rockstar's severe lack of imagination. This is a waste of a game. Great graphics but they didn't put any effort into single player and like I said I can't even play online. At least the online was free. Rockstar really needs to decide which direction they want to go becasue as it stands they put out two half products. Maybe they should just focus on one or the other.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-21,0,0,176,False,Recommended,I'm going to write this review primarily about Online since I haven't played through Singleplayer on PC I did that on my PS4 before this was released. The campaign is fun though.Online is fun. I have a lot of hours spent messing around with my friend and doing missions but it always feels like they missed the mark slightly. One of the biggest problems is how much of a grind it is. Yeah I kind of understand it from a business standpoint but it really feels like they're trying way to hard to get people to buy Shark Cards. This wouldn't be too bad if anything remotely cool wasn't more than a million dollars which takes quite a while to get. The new biker DLC remedies this a bit the cheapest club is about $300k which feels much more reasonable.Now since money is such a big issue I should address the best way to get money which also has the potential to be one of the worst experiences in the game Heists. They're actually really fun but the setups are what kill me every time. You are forced to play with 4 people. This isn't a problem if you have 4 friends to play with but many of us don't. Only one of my friends has a computer capable of running this game well so we have to rely on 2 randoms. This is usually a disaster but what makes it worse is that the majority of missions do not actually require 4 people. Most of them could be done alone and a few are actually two 2 player missions combined into one again so you are forced to play with 4 people. It makes the game a hassle and to make matters worse nobody actually wants to do the setup missions. People will join your lobby and instantly leave because they're only looking for a heist finale with a payout.Other than this though the game's pretty fun. It's GTA but with a friend what more could you ask for? There are other missions that can be done with 2 people that are fun and like I mentioned before the biker DLC really fixes a lot of these issues and makes the game a lot more fun.Overall I'd say online is enjoyable although it's definitely a grind with artificially inflated costs so Rockstar can make a buck. And of course singleplayer is fun too. Good game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-19,0,0,847,False,Recommended,UPDATE Since this review was written Rockstar has worked somewhat impressively with taking action against modders and so the ones that are left are not griefing much anymore. Unfortunatly this was finally fixed near the end of the flow of updates to GTA O since Red Dead Redemption will likely become the main focus rather soon.At the core it is a great game good driving good shooting and a good story. Then you enter online and 5 minutes into the session some has attached a damn christmas tree to your character frozen you in place and bombed the whole server several times over. Despite the overwhelmingly huge hacking problem Rockstar have so far failed to do anything about it other than ban waves that last a couple of days.Recently with the new update all the hackers were removed for a grand total of three days before someone made a new hack and they came flooding back into online.So unless your looking to buy GTA V for the single player alone or Rockstar does something more permanent than a ten day ban I would not recommend spending your money on this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

Keep in mind Take Two Interactive reaped the benefit of user created mods through more copies sold however that wasn't quite enough for them they want to control the entire ecosystem and sell you shark cards to use in their very limited multiplayer mode.

Great story line!I've been playing this game when it first came out in 2013. It had so many nice things to look forward to. R* did have good ideas. Pretty cool game contents. As the years went by a lot of promised content just never went through (casino buying stock so much more). The game had great potential R* just could not commit. Yes they gave free dlc which required a charp ton of grinding or shark card (and I can see why they pushed shark cards so much need money so they make the free dlc's). But not promising certain dlc and just redoing the current dlcs is just lazy. Ceo MC gun running smugglers (granted they gave us more vehicles to play with.awesome! again grind or shark cards) They are all the same thing just dressed differently. R* is just a bunch of money hungry lazy a holes. The lack of caring for their followers/consumers is so inconsiderate making the game slowly rott.About the banning situation if you want to put it that way. They screwed themselves with that one. Making a sketchy anti cheat system that wrongfully ban people when they legitly got to where they want to be in the game. The anti cheat system only helped them with their money. The anti cheat system helped little to none with modding community but it spawned more modders. Causing people who didn't mod/cheat to get banned. They told us to report the cheaters but that doesn't even help. Putting that system in just shows how lazy they are and how much they just don't care. as long as they get their money Modding is great for both single player and online. No issues with people using them. They make the game more fun I get it. But online modding is a double edge sword. Its fun for the people who use them recreationally. Not using them to give themselves the upper hand in a fire fight. The ones who abused them every chance they get should get banned. It gets annoying when your randomly T pose and get caught on fire. Or when your trying to play the game grinding (filling/selling) your warehouses businesses etc. Than a random guy comes in ruining everything and you're trying to kill them every way possible and he just doesn't seem to be affected but the bullets rockets c4 etc(I wouldn't mind being chased if the other person actually dies. It makes it fun! no problem). That's when it gets annoying and makes the game less playable. You can report the cheaters as much as you want it won't help one bit. R* star just doesn't care. They do patches but the patches won't mean a thing if you don't pay attention to the gamers trying help you pointing you to the right directions of who are the ""bad modders"".Great game depends on how you put it.

The modding community that Take Two Interactive is trying to destroy by slapping a cease and desist on the OpenIV tool which is the backbone of a *ton* of the single player mods for GTA V. This could set a horrible precedent for single player game modding which is one of the absolute unique strengths of PC gaming.

2017-05-27,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,I played through this back when it first came out for consoles. It was a fairly fun game. The gameplay wasn't anything special but the story was good. I bought it so I could play with my friends online and holy crap was that a mistake. I got into an online game after running through the prologue (unskippable but relatively short) then hit the online tutorial on accident. After another half hour of worthless tutorials I was put into a game with several other players. Being a gta 4 and 5 veteran I immediately knew that no one is to be trusted. I found out very quickly that even when out in the middle of nowhere are you not safe. Me and everyone else were teleported into a small room and subsequently mowed down in explosions and machinegun fire. What was once a free for all online death arena filled with as*holes has become a den of hackers modders and cheaters who take all the fun out of the game.

2017-06-14,0,0,59,False,Not Recommended,"I bought this game what has to be a year ago what most people would say is ""10/10 ign"" but not in this review. I loved this game but that word loved not love a couple of days ago Rockstar banned OpenIv the biggest modding tool for gta that has been used for 10 YEARS. MIllions of people have used that program some of them only bought gta 5 for modding not to turn gta 5 online into chaos but to turn it into something better. Now that Rockstar banned the biggest tool that millions have used that many bought this game only for mods I can not say how wrong that is it is just disrespectfull to the player base and this is the fourth best selling game ever that is just terrible. Now Multiplayer it is a microtransaction ocean and lately that have purposely overpriced all objects in the game some of the cars in the game can cost up to 10 million and that is a stupid amount of money to grind for if you did you would have to log at least 20 hours into the game to be even able to afford a car from a new dlc but if that was it by its self that would be just bad but not unplayable but they have been releasing dlcs every few months so if you want to buy that new property or new car or both you will have to log close to 200 hours if you want to get a few cars and guns and all of the upgrades. BUT if you dont want to do all of that hard work Rockstar has a solution microtransactions they are ridiculous you can spend up to $100 dollars at one time I have seen people have to spend $200 dollars in total to just buy a quarter of the things in a dlc that is outrageous the player base should not have to go broke for wanting to get that new property or new bunker for car seriously they just came out with a new car that is a couple million fully upgraded. Now if you want to know in plain terms this is a good game BUT you must know you WILL be supporting a company that is purely for profit and will sorry my terms but the user base if it will mean even a microbic amount of profit so just know you are supporting a company that does not care for the user base.",Grand Theft Auto V

Edit Take Two.Original review After 75+ in game time I decided to write this review.GTA V (Story mode aka Single player)I finished around 60% of SP at the time of writing this review (around 40 hours of in game time). First of all this game has some amazing graphics it is really beautiful fluid 60 FPS everything on very high. Story is easy going I really like the concept of playing three different characters. But the most amazing thing in this game is the little details how something looks works or feels. Thumbs up for Rockstar and their commitment to this game. As for cons I would say that from time to time you can come to some odd bugs but this is really a small minus. Also they removed some part of the series that have been for ages (police ambulance and firetruck missions etc.). GTA OnlineMy first experience of GTA Online was chaotic. There are many things to do and nothing is linear so a new player can feel lost. But after ten or so hours you can start to feel why so many people are playing GTA Online. It is the freedom to do whatever you want with your friends or solo with random people. I had so many laughs in this game that I never experienced with some other popular online games. If you are solo player don't worry you will find some friends in each session. Yes there is a problem with modding (hackers) and they get kind of annoying when they blow up and destroy your in game experience but I bumped into only few hackers (35 in game hours of GTA Online). The big plus are free updates from Rockstar every month.This game is worth every cent! RECOMMENDED!,Grand Theft Auto V

Then i switched to PC and its only gotten better. I dont car that its still $60 they upgraded the game since last gen consoles of course its gonna cost the same as a new game because they literally put years of work into this. Plus all the DLC is free and there is so much of it! I dont mind the shark cards i figure they've already put so much into the game for free for the fans they can put some in game money to buy so they can survive.

2016-12-30,0,0,339,False,Not Recommended,YOU LOVE LOADING? BUY GTA V!!!So GTA V is a game of long load times often crashes and bugs that should have been fixed years ago. I have had times where it loads GTA Online for 10 minutes then tells me it timed out so I have to load GTA V which takes 5 10 minutes to load GTA Online again. Just don't espect to have a perfect running game unless you have a great up/down speed on your Internet connection a fast SSD and a great overall setup (RAM CPU GPU). Do I still recommand this game yes I have had many hours of enjoyment...when it works. The one thing I will add is that this game is not worth $60 wait for a sale of at the most $30. With all the issues I have had related to this game (Including a bug where if you shift tab for steam overlay it freezes) it is not even worth that amount. Wait for a sale or wait for GTA 6 where hopefully they fix this.Also advice to Rockstar have someone else run your servers. I have seen private Minecraft servers run way better than yours do. SAVING FAILED. &lt If you have played this game you know what I'm talking about. Old Review This game is great and doesn't crash or have server issues at all.

Never ever will i support this developer again.Not only do i not wish to participate in these kind of activities Nor do i feel like paying them a single dime for just an account on a game where they are dependant on clients for the servers.You buy access to the game. that's it.You don't own They do./Rant over,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-23,0,0,122,False,Recommended,SINGLE PLAYER REVIEW ONLYI have no interest in the multiplayer aspect. I don't have friends to play with (nor the time to play regularly). I tried it for a little bit but didn't like it very much (I don't usually like multiplayer experiences like this) so my review is based off of the single player story mode only.The story mode is great. There is a wide variety of entertaining missions and side quests are fun and worth doing. The characters for the most part are well made. The dialogue is often hilarious. The plot is often rediculous and over the top much like a Tarantino movie. The motivations for the protagonists sometimes feel forced (especially with Franklin in some places) but it's a GTA game so who cares?Most people with negative reviews are only negative because of the multiplayer. This is one of those cases where it is a shame that the single player and multiplayer are forced to share ratings. The multiplayer may deserve a thumbs down (I wouldn't know) but the single player absolutely deserves a thumbs up. Ignore the multiplayer reviews and you won't find many negative single player reviews with good reason. The single player experience is fully fleshed out and you don't need to do any multiplayer to feel like you're getting your money's worth.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-27,0,0,175,False,Recommended,Having covered the game twice already we won t go too far into the detail of what makes GTA 5 so good. Partly it s a question of experience. With four previous 3D GTAs under its belt plus Red Dead Redemption Bully and assorted DLC packs Rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems and GTA 5 has the best driving the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series.It s also a question of structure. Dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from Michael s ageing career criminal saga to Franklin s ambitious hoodlum story to Trevor s crazed amoral brand of mayhem where the dumb cathartic slapstick violence we all deep down love GTA for finds its natural home. With repeated play it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with Rockstar s savage satirical take on the Californian dream.,Grand Theft Auto V

Pay stupid amount of real money for shark cards and the online glitches out and you never received the GTA money you just paid for. that's happened to me a few times. Grind for chump change. you come home from your real job grinding for chump change you just want to take your mind of the real world and play some games i loved GTA v since the PS3.Just sad that once an amazing game is no more than a greedy pay to win with no rewards for hours played earning money. micro transaction has killed gaming on a lot of games this game is a big example of that.,Grand Theft Auto V

Another example of the huge production effort is that there are many different fictional radio stations that you can lisyen to and TV programs that you can watch while in game.Maybe the main story line could be a bit more developed but after all it's an open world game so the goal is to give you freedom to do whatever you want a ""story heavy"" game would partially limit your freedom so I can see why the production decided to go down this route.I hear that the online game is awful but as I said I haven't tried it so I'm recommending the game for now.",Grand Theft Auto V

The characters are bland caricatures their development almost nonexistent.The world is huge and insanely detailed. Kudos to Rockstar for building it. The satire of LA America is a bit too much and somehow got even immaturer then IV or SA.The missions are sometimes cool sometimes frustrating your typical GTA.The driving is fun the flying is fun the boats are mostly because they re boats.At the end of the campaign you are left with a huge open world with little to do.""But wait."" Rockstar whispers to you Here is GTA Online.Make your own characterWork your way up in this worldPlay with othersWell then. You make your char and for a time its fun and new. Then you get killed by your first hacker for a whole hour before you have to switch sessions. Then you get killed by the guy who bought some fakemoneys until you have to switch sessions. Then you realise you can make money way faster by grinding crates. So you get in a solo session (limiting bandwidth till you are alone per 3rd party program etc.) and grind. You have to do it solo unless you like loosing money to guys with jets grenades(launchers) rpg s tanks helis miniguns knight rider rocket shooty cars and of course the omnipresent hacks. And for a while that is fun. Grinding get a chopper grinding get a new car grinding new warehouse etc.And yes technically you could do that with other people. But as always the community is hostile the missions (heists and grinding) with randoms end mostly in chaos and failure. The only redeeming factor of the online world are the races and deathmatch modi. You can have fun with those but you wont make as much money with them as grinding.In the end you loose a warehouse full of crates (couple of afternoons of grinding) to a random lagspike or a npc helicopter that is spawning in behind you or a hacker that got connected to your session or just because you didn t disconnect 10 times until you got a non plane delivery mission.And then you realize you were addicted to the good old mmo loop.

Open World Sandbox games rely on mod support to keep them alive over the years its why GTA San Andreas still has a massive online pressence and the only reason my copy of GTAIV was installed was because of LSPDFR and now that we cannot mod these games assets I cannot give my reccomendation. The Online portion of the game is also plagued by hackers so unless playing with people with god mode with exploding bullets and people who will drain your bank accounts to zero dollars ingame is your idea of fun I would stay away. The game was amazing on the private servers but the actions by Take Two have also made those impossible.Wait until its on a heavy sale because its no longer worth the 60$ in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

The singleplayer experience was solid and continued to get better and better as each mod came out. I spent limited time in the singleplayer and even less in the microtransaction ridden multiplayer but I still had hope and played only in the name of user created mods. But Take Two has killed that. With a cease and desist sent to the OpenIV team they've decided to say that modding of their game is illegal. Despite the reason many of us own the freakin' game is to create and use mods they've decided to shut it down and deem it illegal.On top of that the online is full of hackers and bugs making the game unenjoyable for most and unplayable for some. But don't worry they'll shove another content pack at you with overpriced vehicles and other content to push you to buying a Shark card and giving into their not so micro transaction riddled game.

2017-06-15,0,0,35,False,Not Recommended,Reason for my review T2 held up a finger to the fans of the franchise because they only care about making money. Even though rockstar made a great game it feels like being nickled and dimed for you money or time. I would not recommend this game because by extension of their actions you are just their ATM. This game started off being worthwhile. you can tell the time they took to make it a great game. The campaign is interesting and single player has a decent amount of content. I payed for this game multiple times because I liked it a lot. The first place I played was on ps3 and put in a ton of hours. I think what kept me playing for so long was getting a bunch of free money from hackers that was later taken away because they have to sell the shark cards. I think I had somewhere near 200 hours on ps3. So now that i've played with a ton of money and from a fresh account I have to say It's clear they built the game so you constantly need to grind for something new. This incentivizes their micro transaction shenaningans. They have since made the mission rewards better but there's a lot of bs with the grind and shark cards. If you are a new player prepare to grind for a month to get a good car for racing or to be protected from griefers. Or you can spend $100 on a shark card and get 2 of the latest super cars with upgrades and one expensive bike with 1 upgrade. I enjoy the racing in this game but realistically everyone uses upgraded super cars or bikes so it would be better to spend the money for a shark card even though its clearly a cash grab. I would guess they decided not to make single player content because shark cards sold so well they didn't want to put time into making it. Also all the dlc is online only so you can't play with the new stuff unless you want to play multiplayer. They have not fixed matchmaking and sometimes it can take ages to just find a match. If you are grinding be prepared to get frustrated at the game. I would recommend this game for the price of $10 or less Preferably free because if you want to have fun online you might have to put $50 $60 right off the bat.,Grand Theft Auto V

By either playing hundreds of mission that give around 5 10 grand if you finish it or by buying Shark Cards getting more money out of your pocket and into the pocket of Take Two the company the thinks it's not getting enough money out of its customers and thats a quote roughly said.

2015-05-20,0,0,184,False,Not Recommended,It's a great game but don't buy it through Steam. It has two levels of DRM and due to the first layer (Steam) I can't currently play it. Fun! But it did motivate me to finally write a review.As for how the game ranks against the best in the series (San Andreas)? Well you can't control trains. You can during a singleplayer mission but never again. And there's no hydraulic customizations to vehicles. And the default key bindings are pretty abysmal and sometimes inconsistent (expect to Google controls often).The bad? Some of the singleplayer missions aren't fun and will even make you feel uncomfortable. And I love Postal 2 for reference. Singleplayer is basically three story missions (with three separate bank accounts) requiring you to unnecessarily switch between characters to fully enjoy the game. And there are many other small things to nitpick on.The good? It's easily the prettiest game I've played on PC and excels in many genres (including racing minus the ridiculous rubber banding cheating AI).,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-20,0,0,785,False,Recommended,Worth Every Penny. This was already probably already one the the best games of all time the PC Version took it another step without a doubt. The single player is a blast also with mod support and other PC exclusive features. The game itself is truly amazing to look at especially with High Res Textures at 60 FPS. The amount of immersion included in the game is scary its easy to forget you're playing a video game. The multiplayer is also about as realistically close to perfect a game can get. With so many cool things to do and achieve I personally find it hard to get bored moving from one task to another. Anyway This is probably one of the best games i've ever played.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-20,0,0,218,False,Recommended,So I guess I'll try to counter the giving bad reviews here. The game is great better than I remember on the x360. My favorite story line of any GTA game I just wish they would have added more things to do like in GTA SA. The online mode is great as long as there are no hackers in your session. Now the vast majority of people here giving bad reviews are these very same hackers crying because they got banned. My biggest problem here is that Rockstar is being too lax in their punishments of these hackers. First offense is a 2 week ban. Accounts are not reset. Hackers keep everything they cheated to get allowing them to just spend all their time in game trolling people who are playing legit. Now despite all this I do believe Rockstar will come to their senses and come down on the s who are trying to get this game shut down. With all of that I still recommend this game and can see it having a great future so long as Rockstar ignores these dumb s who just love to good up for respectable people.Pros in GTAStoryLooks goodPlenty of to doCons Rockstar are scaredy es that won't protect their online modeNot as deep as GTA SA customization wiseBugs but it's less than I had on 360 sooo... at least betterNetwork could use some tuning And one more time I recommend.,Grand Theft Auto V

OpenIV is the tool that allowed you to have custom cars custom characters pretty much any content modification relied on OpenIV.

2015-11-22,0,0,215,False,Not Recommended,My review has changed due to Take Two Games / Rockstar Games ending the modding community. It was a thriving very creative part of this game that extended the life. Modding has now been banned. Original Review I really enjoy this game. It's one of my top games of all time. Not mainly for the story but for the incredible world that this game has built. You really are in a living breathing city. The best part of the game for me isn't the missions or the story though that's pretty up there. For me it's all about the built in video editor. You can create your own world and story in the game. It's incredibly powerful and creative. I only hope that 4K support comes for the video editor as the game in 4K is nothing short of incredible.,Grand Theft Auto V

I've probably played the multiplayer for nearly a hundred hours and still barely have anything in it. Nearly half of the money you make needs to be spent on ammo and races barely pay out any money if you do that instead of missions that involve shooting. I bought this game in the hopes of getting singleplayer DLC that I absolutely would have paid for but instead we just get more online cars that I'm still about a thousand hours from being able to afford with any decent upgrades. And now modding in this game is basically illegal so they can sell more of their F****** cars in online.

I paid $60 for this one of the best selling games of all time and I expected to get my money's worth from it. But to launch an attack on the modding community with the C&amp D delivered to OpenIV is one of the most egregious things I have ever seen in gaming. It is a free mod which allows for further modding a game I paid $60 for and I will have the content of a game I bought be held for ransom. This attack on the community which loved this game is horrid and an attack on gamers in general and consumers as a whole. I paid you already. Let me have the game and let me have the mods.

Being banned from a game that you spend hours and hours on is like having someone steal all your time and effort and slapping your in the face. But the worst thing is that Rockstar get so many complaints and they choose to ignore them completely! that really kills it for me. I hope that they would take the issue seriously because i know im not the only one with this problem. Many players has been banned because the banning system is so stict that its broken and bans anyone who is just a little bit suspicious.But should be one of the lucky ones who is not banned then you should find GTA as one of the greatest game ever! its seriously amazing. by all means buy it if you think its worth the risk!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-12,0,0,248,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto. Does exactally what it says on the tin.The single player within this game is brilliant with many events missions and more freedom than you can hope for with more content than the other games in the series. There is more than enough to be getting on with and with the freedom to explore the city and the countryside to the North of the map it is hard to get bored with what Rockstar have created within this full and exciting world. Unlike in the other GTA games you can take on three different charcters that have very different stories and personalities that make the experience very entertaining and memorable. From drug deals to helping a friend that makes stupid decisions on a regular basis to trying to survive a broken family situation there isn't much that doesn't capture the attension of any player that enters the world of Los Santos. The gameplay is much like the other GTAs but thats isn't a bad thing when it comes down to the overall experience quite frankly I loved it. The enviroment is a work of art that never fails to impress and can be enjoyed to a much higher degree on more powerful machines which I cannot experience though I have turned up the graphics in areas that are of particular beauty to appericiate the talent that created this game.Sadly when it comes to the online areas of the game the above cannot be referenced. There is too much locked behind a paywall that demands large sums of money or serious long term dedication to experience the DLC is that of an arcade that makes the game look stupid which the GTA franchise is not about in the slightest. I have since left the community in favour of games that allow me a much better experience when it comes to online gameplay even though it's free I feel that it is even worse than that of an EA title and I have lost respect for a games company that has produced amazing games in the past.Single player 9/10 Should be a must for all gamers alike cannot reccomend moreMultiplayer 2/10 Dissapointing and greedy would not reccomend,Grand Theft Auto V

I enjoy online the most I think its what makes this game great being able to access the entire map and do whatever you please. Now that I own a decent gaming laptop the graphics are gorgeous and vivid. I am playing at 900p and getting about 35 40 fps. Back on ps3 the graphics are unbearable and I don't know how my eyes got used to the frames. I haven't noticed any pop in whatsoever (coming from a regular 5400rpm 1TB HDD user). There is a bit of jaggies and stuttering but I have it under control when I set up maximum pre rendered frames to ''1'' in my nvidia control papnel and power management to maximum performance.

You have their money anyway mods or not.This is absolutely unacceptable. F*ck you C*ckstar and Take Two. You bunch of greedy c*nts!I will now boycott this game and everything else you will make or release in the future until OpenIV and the stance on modding are reversed.**********ORIGINAL REVIEW**********I have bought this game 3 times already. (the fact that i bought it 3 times must mean something) I currently own Grand Theft Auto V for the Xbox 360 Xbox One and PC. This game is one of the best games i have ever played. It runs amazing my rig. I highly recommend this game.Pros 1) Beautiful Graphics. 2) Optimized Well. 3) Unlocked FPS. 4) Hundred of Graphical Gameplay Display and Audio Setting. 5) GTA Online. 6) Amazing Campaign. 7) A wealthy amount of game content. 8) 4K Support. 9) Mods support. 10) Very fun to play. 11) Trevor Phillips. 12) Constant Updates and Developer Support. 13) Very Humorous Dialog/Cutscenes. 14) Heists. 15) No more Playing Bowling with Roman. 16) First Person Mode 17) Remappable Keys 18) Large weapon selection to choose from 19) Animals to huntCons 1) GTA Online Servers. 2) Social Club. (Don't even get me started) 3) Over 60gb with more updates on the way. (better have a Large Fast hard drive) 4) Annoying phone calls from characters in GTA Online with no way to turn it off. 5) Loading times can sometimes take a while. 6) 12 Year Olds Online 7) No swingset glitch to launch yourself like in GTA IV,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-23,0,0,269,False,Not Recommended,A great single player experiance that will last you several weeks. When it comes to muiltiplayer I have to spend more time talking about it as Rockstar clearly want it to be the main feature of the game now. The online is pretty broken if you intend on playing it by yourself or even with just 1 or 2 friends as many missions require 4 people to play and Rockstar are pushing microtransactions down your throat by releasing new content that isnt that groundbreaking and charging millions in game to even get access to the basic items that come with it. The online community is some of the worst in any online game ever with rockstar giving incintives for people to come and attack you for no reason.Its clear Rockstar arent content with making lots of money unless they are making ALL of the money they possibly can. Dont get sucked into the online with its toxic community and pyramid scheme to drain you of your time and money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,469,False,Recommended,As someone who has played GTA5 on PS3 and clocked many hours in it so far I'd have to say that the PC version was definitely worth the wait. They could have released it in a state like GTA4 was when it was finally brought to PC but they decided to polish it which I'm grateful for. So far I've clocked 69 hours (perhaps a little too much...) and every second of it has been wonderful. The only issues (that I personally have experienced) would be a large FPS stutter when I've been playing the game for longer than 2 hours however after restarting my PC it allows me to play for another 5 (I regrettably tested this last night...)TL DR Fun game restart PC if stutter.

I've found it only glitches or disconnects due to bad wifi not because the engine is bad. Which isn't true. Its quite a heavy game to run but offers alot in return.

2017-06-15,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game on PC only for the cool mods. I already had it on PS4 but i wanted to be able to mess around with the game. For those who don't know OpenIV is the main mod that is used in most GTA 5 and 4 mods HOWEVER Take Two filed a Cease and Desist on OpenIV therefore it no longer exists and cannot be used in mods. This means the countless hours of work that mod authors put into their mods has been completely wasted. Take Two has done this in order to push players back onto GTA 5 Online so they can recieve more revenue from players which is the most scummy thing I have ever seen any game company do. I paid good money for the game so that I could mod it however that has gone away. If you wanted to mod the game tough Just buy the game on whatever platform is cheapest. There is no reason to get GTA 5 for the PC if you typically play on console.,Grand Theft Auto V

I know many other people who have done the same thing. Apparently $200 isn't enough so now they're taking the mods away. If I could refund the PC version now I would.

2017-06-14,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,As someone who bought this game a total of three times (PS3 PS4 and PC) Take Two already took loads of my money. The only reason I bought this a third time on PC though was for the modding potential. However Take Two decided to one up EA in hopes of becoming the worst video game company in existence by going after OpenIV a program that makes modding GTA V single player possible. Due to this I can't recommend this game. I can't recommend any Take Two game. The company is disgusting and it is a shame that the developers who work under them have to deal with the consequences.PS Multiplayer is a microtransaction mouse trap.

I don't recommend this game because the parent company of Rockstar Games Take Two Interactive are now severely impacting the modding community. They filed a cease and decist order on one of the largest modding tools. They are doing this to force players into the online mode and make money. It's upsetting to see that after the several versions I have of this game they are now milking it for everything it's worth. (And it's not like they weren't already doing that.)

I have bought this game three times once on console twice on PC. I have given R* and Take2Games 180 US dollars for their admittedly enjoyable content. The entire premise that now after having spent so much time and money on this game R* and Take2 want to tell ME what I can and can not do in SINGLE PLAYER is completely ridiculous and honestly a shameful money grab. Stop trying to force people to multiplayer and its microtransactions stop adding content that is only accessible through multiplayer. If you want more money from this game create new content in the form of expansions or dlc that applies in both single player and multi player. The entire idea that Take2 and Rockstar want to tell me what I can and can not do to files that I have licensed from them under their EULA which does not prohibit the editing or ""modding"" of said software in any way so long as such modifications are single player only is an incredible breach of public trust as well as a grievous attempt to regulate how end users interact and utilize licensed software.

2015-06-11,0,0,566,False,Not Recommended,It is noteworthy that this review has been changed from a positive review. I no longer recommend this game due to the actions of Take Two Interactive reagrding the cease and desist given to the creators of the OpenIv mod framework.Here's the issue In GTA V's online mode you can purchase microtransactions to recieve in game currency (The online mode isn't very good. It's filled with hackers and is built to try and take your money only recommended for some fun activities with friends). To encourage people to play the online mode and spend more money special free update vehicles are added these are very expensive (Thus encouraging the use of microtransactions) and are NOT placed into the single player mode. Until recently there was an easy solution to this problem Mods!In fact the majority of people I know have two copies of this game one from when it was initially released on PS3 and Xbox 360 and one on PC. The main reason for this was the exciting potential offered by the large modding communities that are all but exclusive to PC games. Unfortunately Take Two Interactive don't really like mods. Because they are not allowed in the online mode (For obvious reasons) they attract people away from their microtransactions! Not only this but the aforementioned online only vehicles can easily be modded into singleplayer.In response to this Take Two Interactive have decided to try and squeeze the very last bit of cash they can from GTA V by issuing the creators of OpenIV a cease and desist. OpenIV is a mod framework that has been around for nearly ten years first appearing in GTA IV. A large majority of mods for GTA V (and IV) rely on this framework to function so without it many mods will die. By doing this Take Two Interactive are actively fighting against what many bought this game on PC for in the first place The modding potential.This is incredibly anti consumer and is completely unacceptable. GTA V is a great game that has now been ruined by stupid corporate t and I will miss it. you Take Two Interactive.,Grand Theft Auto V

However when I say 'getting into "" I do not mean logging into the game. In fact I have a hard time looking past the obvious fee to pay economy. The endless grind the pathetic wait times the bombardment of promotional material and the toxic community that is run amock with actual cheaters sealed the nail in the coffin for me. But hey it only took me 20 minutes of online play to realize how it was and I haven't had the slightest compulsion to ever give it another shot so no skin off my back. No the only real reason I play GTA V is to mod in the single player mode. I use OpenIV for my modding as they make the whole experience way smoother and they enable new modding possibilities. As I'm sure that you are acutely aware everyone sees through this cheap marketing t for what it is. Everyone knows you are just trying to push more microtransactions. Hell if my friend group is any indicator then most everyone who plays GTA V never plays the online and they only play the single player with mods. Clearly it is a very significant amount as it has peeved you off so much as to write that bogus cease and desist. I tell you seeing your stocks plummet for this ham fisted blunder gave me a great feeling inside. But you know of course you guys are a corporation you can do what you want in this. On the other hand the ball is rolling and you'll need to do something drastic to reverse the negative momentum. It is materializing in your review sections your stocks and it will ruin your future sales. I for one will never purchase another take two game unless this t is put to a swift and conclusive halt. There will be no beating around the bush retract that fully with no compromise or again I will never buy your again. GTA Online has no redeemable gameplay qualities when all of the headaches and grind are factored in. GTA on PC did not sell for that.

Sure Alot of the fun came out of the content in the games but what mostly kept me playing was the mods. So like most people who heard that GTA V was being released I was absolutely excited for the mods for such a realistic looking game. Then came the day I realized that the computer version won't be released on the same date as the 360 which at the time angered me greatly but I had forgiven them. Then after about a month of playing online I discovered that multiplayer was a huge mirco transaction scam and got evan more But I kept on playing hoping for the mods to be redeeming. Now comes the day of the PC release A wonderfull couple of months of new mods come out and I'm beyond happy. Then out of nowhere my friends start getting banned for using mods in singleplayer left and right and I get worried and unistall all mods. About a year later I get back into singleplayer hoping that all the dlc's new content would be available on singleplayer and I could just play with the new content. It hits me once I look online that all dlc content cars guns upgrades etc are only on multiplayer and cost millions of dollers and the only way to spawn dlc cars in gta v is to install a mod. I reinstalled GTA IV and gave GTA V the finger. It was a mistake to buy this game and Rockstar ed up one of the best game ideas ever. Advice for Rockstar STOP MONEY WHORING! Sincerely MydogisadorkP.S Don't remove mods from video games. It takes a large audiance away and people will be Also micro transactions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,1416,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar and Take 2 please go yourselves.I started by paying for this game twice because of an inept support then I just went around enjoying the singleplayer. I was having the time of my life and I loved it. I saw GTAV as this shining city on a hill a yardstick by which to measure other games for their attention to detail and playability.Everyone lived in harmony... Until the Online rolled around. At first it seemed a bit of a grind but it was alright I suppose. Then as it started to develop I found myself constantly in sessions with 8 year olds seemingly friendly actions by you or someone else quickly ended with them just shooting you in the head. Well atleast I could use a Heist exploit to grind efficiently. And so I did until they patched it.At this point R* and T2 had become completely intoxicated by micro transactions and money. They were only focused on the online completely leaving the singleplayer to rot because it was in online the money lay. However it quickly became full of hackers. At first I was mad and then I became disappointed before finally accepting most of them into the community. I have heard so many stories how just how easy it is to hack the online and how little R* and T2 manage to do to stop it.I suppose at the end of the day this was alright because the modding community was so strong...NOT ANYMOREHonestly R* and T2 can go shag each other behind a dumpster that s on fire next to some TNT while overdosing on heroin. We all or not have made GTAV one of the most successful games in history. We are who play your games and we have played it long enough (1.1 kilohours) and we have given you enough money. Either care for your community or give us a sequel that shows the success of GTAV and give a public apology to us and the people behind openIV.YOU MIGHT TAKE OUR MONEY BUT YOU LL NEVER TAKE OUR MODS!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

Single player campaign and world is epic truly amazing huge with so much detail.9/10 Casual online plays with small group of friends. The multiplayer is fun if you have a small group that you can run heists and generally muck around with. Killing each other in often hilarious ways and that one friend that will always try to do flips during missions. Still can be occasionally buggy and the p2p connection does give rise to a bunch of hacking/online modding (I m fine with and love single player modding but online is jerkmode)5/10 Solo online competitive players and a bad (for consumers) business model. Rockstar REALLY want you to buy Shark Cards which is basically you paying actual money for virtual money and price many things super expensive drip feed content and constantly supersede vehicles. As well as seemingly not having any idea about vehicle class balance. A video game shouldn t feel like a chore except for Viscera Cleanup Detail .

This was a blatant attempt to stop people from allowing people to mod into the single player items which were only available in the multiplayer. One can imagine they chose to do this in hopes thet more people would play their hacker ridden online multiplayer but instead they have managed to offend their entire pc fanbase. Maybe if you wanted us to play online you should have figured out a way to stop all the hackers who are the real reason you don't make more money from the online.

It's nice to know that under the rule of Take Two paying customers are now being treated as criminals for seeking to improve their in game experience and sharing it for others to enjoy. Their theory is that modding will steer people away from playing GTA Online and more specifically buying in game currency to buy some of the insanely expensive content now availiable for the online portion of the game. Kind of odd that this happened right as the released the gunrunning add on huh? Anyway TL DR Do not buy this game. Do not support any game they publish. Take Two needs to know they ed up.

2017-06-15,0,0,120,False,Not Recommended,I will start by saying that I do genuinely enjoy the single player story mode but you probably could have guessed that. At this point who hasn't played and loved every brilliant moment that Rockstar brought to us through such memorable characters as Michael Franklin and Trevor. The single player experience is golden and well worthy of all of the praise it has garnered over the years.I did not buy this game on the last generation of consoles nor on the new one. I was perhaps in the minority of players in that I waited patiently for the PC release just knowing that it would be the definitive edition. When I got the game I thought it had been well worth the wait. The graphics the pedestrian density the first person mode everything was perfect. I played through the story in a couple of marathon sessions and then flipped over briefly to GTA Online. I had watched some videos of content creators having a blast with custom game modes and GTA races and I wanted a slice of that action myself.What I found was a buggy mess of loading times and mostly empty servers. My stay did not last long. I decided that I would wait on the promised single player DLC as for me the quality of experience on the single player side was just miles beyond what the online would ever be for me. But the single player DLC never came and instead I was faced with month after month of new content available only to those in GTA Online. I briefly dipped my toe back in that water excited about some of the new cars and customization options only to find that the online prices were ridicously high and that I would either have to spend hours of my life slogging through loading times and buggy matches to grind out the cash to access the new content or I would have to succumb to the temptation of the Shark Card and spend my earned money to unlock each tiny piece of new content. There had to be another way. The new content was never made available in single player but I had faith that someone had figured out a way around that. And low and behold they had. Through the mod OpenIV and hundreds of mods built around the very same the GTA community had opened the flood gates of creativity and were doing amazing things with the GTA engine. I quickly found what I was looking for and I was soon flying through the LS streets in a new T20 free from the stresses of online play. Mods brought me the content that was made inaccessible but also promised new content. A gravity gun ridiculous cars and the ability to control the weather and graphics to quite a level of detail.This kept me playing GTA for another couple of months and every time new online content was released I would wait a week or so and then I would be riding around in the mountains on whatever new bike or car had been added just to see what the new stuff was like. I had a lot of fun doing this but sadly it isn't an option anymore. The creators of OpenIV have received a cease and desist letter telling them to stop updating and distributing their mod effectively killing the GTA modding scene. All of this done to force a few more players back in to the online mode so that they might buy a few more shark cards.Only I don't think that's going to work. Judging from all the other recent reviews this latest move has backfired. I enjoyed the game but I do not enjoy having my pockets wrung for every last penny. GTA V is already the FOURTH best selling game of all time behind Minecraft (a multiplatform indy sensation) Tetris (an ancient game with more versions than pinball) and Wii Sports (a game that shipped with every copy of the Wii ever sold). They have made a lot of money off of this game. They made some money from my own purchase of their game. But until their attitude towards single player focused players like myself and towards the modding community of which I am a part for other games they will not be receiving any more of my money.

2017-06-15,0,0,228,False,Not Recommended,Take Two Interactive (R*'s parent company) has to be the most garbage game company at the moment.This game is great single player is great and multiplayer is great but only when you have access to the DLC content which is one of the major issues with this game.People praise this game for its free DLC content which couldn't be further from the truth.A conservative estimate of what all of the Gunrunning DLC content costs excluding the plentiful and very expensive upgrades is around 25 million. That is over 300 dollars worth in shark cards.On top of this the money you make while farming in online is pathetic. There are artificial cool downs on everything to slow down profits hours of farming equates to a few million on a good day and missions you get while farming get stale after a hour of play time if you're lucky.The only people getting access to this content are the ones who have their pocket lined with money who think 200 300 dollars per DLC is worth it and cheaters.I mean you can easily just go in any public session and get money from a cheater without asking them then possibly get your account banned or character reset then get lectured on cheating. Game is absolutely filled with cheaters despite the efforts to stop them.On top of all of this even single player modding is at risk at the moment. Take Two Interactive recently pushed a cease and decist against the developers of OpenIV the backbone of a metric ton of mods.For anyone arguing that this is to stop multiplayer modding OpenIV does not work online. Its a strictly single player.So in summary unless you got way too much money than you know what to do with or you're OK with cheating don't buy this game but if you still want to buy it from a third party.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,333,False,Not Recommended,"Take2 has decided to destroy the moddability of this iconic title and in doing so set a dangerous legal precident that could be extended to other games in the near future. They did this by threatening legal action against the OpenV the software utility designed to allow players to modify their singleplayer installs the game with new vehicles skins etc. The reason for this isn't some sort of fear that the game is being reverse engineered or might be used to make a competitor title nothing of that sort which might prompt legitimate action. Instead they're trying to funnel players into their poorly maintained poorly moderatored Grand Theft Auto Online so they can bombard them with microtransactions in order to solve their self admitted problem of ""undermonitizing our players"".Take2 does not care about the fans who are directly responsible for the success of this franchise. Many of us purchased just this one title multiple times. I myself bought it for xbox 360 xbox one and when it finally came out years later I bought it on PC for the sole purpose of modding it. They sold this same game multiple times at full sticker price. Each time I purchased it because while I disagreed with the business practice I genuinely enjoyed the title... Despite getting $180 from me across three purchases and an additional $60 when I purchased a copy for a friend Take2 doesn't feel that I own my copy of the game. I am not free to do what I please with the singleplayer campaign.It's worth remembering that the ongoing success of GTA is due largely to the PC Modding community which exploded in growth back during GTA Vice City. Huge and highly active communities for the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas mod ""MultiTheftAuto"" can still be found today 13 years after the title launched. It is this community of modders that keeps the title at the forefront of people's attentions so that when the announcement of a sequel is made they flood retailers to purchase it.What Take2 has done is isolate the most loyal demographic of their audience and threaten them with legal action for trying to enjoy the game they paid for. This cannot become the industry standard. Take whatever stand you can. Write their New York offices at 622 Broadway New York NY 10012 or call them at 646 536 2842 and tell them to end their attack on game modding. If we do not take a stand on this it may set a new standard in the gaming community where modding as a whole becomes target of legal action and our PC gaming days become indistinguishable from canned console experiences.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,791,False,Not Recommended,If you bought this game in the hopes of joining up online and having a blast do note that everything is beyond a paywall. It even costs money to earn money and then you have the upkeep on all the things you own. The Sharkcards that they sell are also very low in value.The latest dlc Gunrunning was supposed to change all that turns out you either pay 30 m to get everything or you pay a bit less 10ish m och have to wait 239hours in order for the researchers to unlock the things for you. If you were to leave the game on for those 239 hours then the upkeep alone would be at 2m. The game is a lot less about the fun things you can do for money and much more about avoiding griefers and trying to do things optimal.I would've easily bought a Sharkcard in order to show support but as the game tries to nickle and dime you for everything it feels like the company strives to break you so you buy the cards or you leave on your own as you're worthless to them.

2015-04-16,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,TL DR at the bottomIf you're going to buy this game buy it for the Singleplayer. GTA Online is in one of the WORST states I have ever seen in a online video game. It is like the game is approving griefing because if you want to do some free roam missions like stealing coke or cars and whatnot the game sends out a big red marker that just invites other people to kill you basically. They also milk the crap out of GTA O. They do not seem to want to fix any glitches and bugs in this game the loading times of this game are a freaking mess. Even with a good rig and high speed internet you might wait for up to 5 minutes to enter GTA Online. Also they just push out more and more DLCs with each DLC being more and more expensive (newer things tend to cost 1 million $ and more ingame) in hope that players fall for the microtransactions trap (you can buy up to 10 mil.$ for like 100$ real money). Did I also mention that the game is modder/hacker infested and that they not only drop illegitimate money (again this happens moreso in spite against rockstar because of the ridicoulus pricings they have) but they also just grief you. They permakill you strip you off your weapons or even trap players or some other annoying crap.TL DR If You're going to buy this game buy it for the Singleplayer.

2015-04-28,0,0,345,False,Recommended,An astoundingly vast game a worthy successor to GTA IV. The key difference between IV and V manifests itself in the life present in the city the life present in the characters you encounter on the street in missions and the ones you control. The story is not a narrative masterpiece but the voice acting and linework is with negligible and miniscule exceptions that do not even linger long enough to recall /fantastic/. Rockstar have outdone themselves through incorporating the fierce combat style of Max Payne 3 alongside the atmosphere of Red Dead Redemption in conjunction with a new and improved stellar produced and programmed piece of GTA history.To truly appreciate the monumental leap from IV to V I implore anyone interested to boot up their IV copy and enjoy an hour or two of gameplay immerse yourself as much as possible. Then return to V and you will immediately be met with a feeling of Rockstar having had the time to the skill to and the unabridged interest in delivering what they could not do but wanted to in 2008 alongside seven additional years of creativity.If this is what they can do /now/ I dare not guess what they might be able to do in the future.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-28,0,0,336,False,Recommended,I normally never write any review but this time I will.GTA V is a worthy successor to GTA IV. Everyone that did play GTA IV will feel right at home in GTA V.Little has changed in the terms of game play and even the graphic is very similar(but of higher quality due to better textures etc).So basically if you liked GTA IV then GTA V will be right up your alley.Single player New location new story same idea. Pros Similar feel and game play as GTA IVSome annoying things from GTA IV is ironed outHuge playfieldAdded elements like stock tradingMore cars and all classes are available(not like GTA IV where the class you were driving popped up every where)More options for mini gamesRPG style leveling which are not too intrusiveCons Story not as good as GTA IV Characters not as good as GTA IVSome missions feels boringSave system(same as GTA IV)Even tho the game has been out for years there are still weird bugs and glitches that should be ironed outMassive problems for many players with no support from rockstarall in all the pros are much greater than the cons unless you are the unlucky soul who gets the crash routine.Then you will find GTA V the worst launch in the century and Rockstar is useless when it comes to help.I was one of those unlucky souls but since I'm considered a tech guy I eventually managed to create a fix that stopped my crashes. But I would recommend this game even based on single player only and Rocstar/AMD/Nvidia will eventually iron out any cause for crashes.GTA Online Well the online part of GTA is both excellent and really bad. But its a great addition and also extends the games lifetime.So far due to micro transactions dlc are also free and if you buy the game i encourage people to at least support this model with some transactions.Pros HeistsmissionscustomizationsLots of carsLots of apartmentsFree roamPrivate sessionsCrews(coop)Tanks Jets and helispvp mini games(both shooter and racing)Cons GTA O sends you to single player if something goes wrong. Should give a menu to choose from instead.GTA O sends you to random sessions when done with a mission/heist/mini game even tho you are playing with crew membersToo many problems connecting to sessions/joining friendsNo way to group with players to keep a group intactNo way to block public invites leading to spammingNo anti cheat tools(or it doesnt work well) in pvp leaving the games mostly for cheatersToo hard requirements for unlocking customization for carsToo few coop missions(all single player missions should also be coop for GTA O)No way to setup what session you'd like to start in leading to very long loading times when starting gameSame crash routine as single player for many leaving the game unplayableNo support from RockstarBasically GTA Online is very fun when it works and you play with friends.However the whole game is designed for solo players.so everything the game does is with solo playing in mind splitting up crews joining the same mini game splitting up crews when leaving mini games etc. this leads to lots of game time being watching a load screen trying to join another session.If GTA O was a stand alone game I would not recommend it in the current state.However it got loads of potential to become something great if Rockstar listen to feed back iron out all the session issues(Crews want to play together Rockstar!!!) implement anti cheat tools and give us more PvE missions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,343,False,Recommended,before the review There are a lot of hackers ruing the game... just a notice An actual review from over 60 hours of gameplay so far.First off I never played on console nor have I owned a console since I had a PSOne.Single player story has obviously seen very little attention so my entire review is based solely on the Online part of the game.Pros + Good for small groups of 4 people playing at the same time (heists) Ability to be in your own session alone without randoms When with randoms the entire game changes dynamically to make things interestingCons Randoms tend to be 80% red players that just run around murdering other players. Usually destroying your personal vehicles making you have to stop for a minute each time to call insurance and have it sent back to you via the mechanic. Minor glitches here and there that cause you to drop out of Online and back to single player for no reason. If another player rams his car into yours and this results in your car blowing up chances are you will be forced to pay to replace their car because your explosion destroyed vehicle... I personally have lost hundreds of thousands because of thisOverall the game gets a solid 9/10.There is no reason NOT to own this game even though there are likely more cons thanpros in reality the game is fun and keeps you interested.Money Online is easy to make so build up some cash get your favorite car supe it out and go murder some people!

Personally I enjoy taking my car out putting on my personal radio station adn driving around in first person at night when its raining it feels great. My only issue is the extraordinarily long loading time which are very painful after youve been waiting in a lobby for a heist for 10minutes and as soon as the heist starts someone leaves and youre kicked back to a loading screen.

2015-09-01,0,0,516,False,Recommended,"Absolutely and positively the best console to PC Port i've seen although the start to the launch was a bit fragile and has many issues R* has cleared many game breaking bugs and glitches which occur in the game and ruin performance or gameplay. I have a Mid ranged PC and i can run it at a stable frame rate without having a high leveled CPU or GPU i will recommend that you have 8Gb+ to play this game as the background tasks can take a real hammering when this game starts up.Pros Great Gameplay. Brilliant Port to the PC from the Console. High level mods to add to this game which gives more gameplay and customization to the game. Constant high framerates at a mid ranged PC. Story is great and is just at the same level of GTA it always was! Constant updates to the game that adds levels like races deathmatches and other custom features that the community have. R* Listen to the community and fix any errors or bugs that get in the way of a user having a great experience for instance exploits that duplicate money clipping issues and more. GTA Offers an awesome new way of giving users something else to do if you have time on your hands the editor. This gives users from the community a place to share what talents they have by making short films or cinematic screenshots these cinematic screenshots are best discribed in a guide here &lt http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 425705716 &gt The GTA online leveling system is a unique way of sharing with someone the amount of experience you have with this said game it is powered by Xp like many games and is attainable by races deathmatches and various other missions xp can also be rewarded by complete miniscule tasks such as ""Flying With Friends"" or ""Cruising With Friends."" These gain small amounts of xp which is placed into the level bar which will appear at the top of your screen. I personally think this is the best GTA online feature as it gives all players a unique difference in level and shows the amount of intelligence people know about this game generally the higher the level the more knowledge they will have.That sums up the Pros now for the cons (Theres not that many of them!).Cons There has been an increasing problem of modders or ""Script kids"" in the GTA community this is a problem as they can tamper with your experience in the game this generally gives people the impression that the whole community is just full of modders but i asure you they are not but there is a growing number of them as it is easy to mod. I have never came accross this issue but many people apparently have when downloading mods from certain websites to harmlesslly mod their version of GTA (e.g. singleplayer) people have came accross numerous counts of people hiding viruses in mods this is a problem but it is dying down from a serious issue to a small one.Overall i feel that R* has done a brilliant job in porting GTA from a console game to a PC game it is well detailed well textured and is a must buy!Review by Killa",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-27,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,I used to love the multiplayer to this game and i still like the singleplayer. However i would not recommend the unexpected and frankly dumb choice to ban mods that have been here since ever. The multiplayer has been the bread and butter for my friends and I. But they seriously ruined the fun by the horrindous amount of grinding to get new stuff. You get enough money for the old cars and houses don't get me wrong but the new expansion's price for entry is way too damn high. Millions of dollars to just start the bunker and more to get the truck. Friends can't use your bunker to get anything and having them as associates gains them nothing. They really want you to buy sharkcards if you don't have a lot of money from the previous events. The grind has taken its toll and we were sick of it. All of this annoyed us out of the multiplayer but them banning SINGLEPLAYER mods that have been here since launch? Makes no sense. Take Two said they wanted to take down modders that have plagued the online mode and made their sharkcards useless but it just alienated the fan base. If you honestly just wanted the campaign and did not care about mods go ahead. I just can't see this as having respect for its players though.,Grand Theft Auto V

I kept my copy on XBOX for when I wanted to play GTA Online and got the PC version for LSPDFR and now they're trying to ruin to modding community...so for this I'm done with Rockstar games unless this changes.

As for gameplay in general I find it difficult to play as the game is constantly crashing on me. ive tried to find solutions for this issue but there seem to be none. I've read plenty of online reviews where there are many others having the same issue. My computer is more than capable of handling the graphics on this game even at max settings. I see no reason why this is occuring and I am dissapointed that rockstar Is pushing out game content without fixing bugs or crashing issues from previous versions.I have owned this game since it came out (on Xbox and Playstation) these issues are something i have only encountered on PC. I will not be purchasing another Rockstar game for PC as this has made me lose all trust in their capability of rule enforcement and bug fixing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-25,0,0,1117,False,Recommended,"Yes the fabled GTA V one of the most anticipated and heralded games in history and easily one of the most successful. I mean hell not only did it cost 5 years and 200 million dollars to create it grossed over a billion dollars in sales in the first three days it was released. Met with sweeping acclaim and fully succeeding the Kingpin spot in Rockstar's flagship series. It is an absolutely breathtaking game as far as graphics are concerned probably the best I have ever seen in any game and it runs like an absolute dream to boot. The controls are fluid the physics can be hilarious but for the most part do what they are needed to do just fine. And of course Rockstar absolutely demolishes it's in game playlists and music.While most people will only ever truly pay attention to the external aspects of the game such as causing mayhem and usual GTA shennanigans just driving around watching the absolutely breathtaking world of GTA unfold around you to amazing music (Never have I ever seen a sunset in a video game more beautiful than the ones you will see in GTA 5) or the increasingly rediculous and silly GTA Online it is what lies underneath that truly make this a game worth playing.The amount of details and intrinsic attention to the aforementioned are staggering. This is a titanic world. It is huge no matter what way you look at it. But Rockstar proved very well why they spent more money than most blockbuster Hollywood movies making this game it is filled close to bursting with every tiny thing you could possibly imagine. Everything from a ranndom forgettable pile of garbage in a back alleyway or a stain on the side of a house a slightly askew chair or a worn paint job the random little NPC events you will come across out in the wilderness like a hippie gathering with an old VW bus or some rednecks out in a dune buggy countless easter eggs hidden deep within buildings and nooks and crannies that four years later are still being uncovered a lot of things people would never ever notice unless they were actually specifically looking for them. This world is lived in and it certainly feels like it.And thats just the little things. ""Shallow fluffs"".The Single player story is thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying even when just sampling the topical bits of it. But when you take a look down deep into the psyche of the characters you see their reactions how they behave and what they say it is all hiding far deeper more intrinsic meanings. Rockstar did not skimp at all on Voice acting and every single one of these actors earned their paychecks ten fold helping bring this world to life in ways no game before it has ever done. The cinematography is stellar and segues into gameplay perfectly something other games in this day and age still have trouble with.Everything that happens in GTA 5 has real life mirrors and implications. Everything could be considered both a parody and a deep introspective analysis of what the real world is going through and dealing with at every facet of life from the tiniest social circles on the street and the worship we pretend to show and the facades we put up to the implications of internet culture and what being eternally and instantaneously connected to the rest of the world has done to shape our world and society to corrupt branches of governments around the world trying to control their populations through subtle machinations.And perhaps the most beautiful part of all of this is the fact that none of it is ever shoved down your throat. If you want you can play this entire game just believing it is a simple silly brutally hilarious piece of GTA fare. Which it is. It is ing hilarious few games have ever made me laugh this hard at them. But if you ever start to look deeper you are more than welcome to and just like the oceans outside Los Santos you will find yourself going far far deeper than you ever would have expected to.People complain mostly regarding GTA Online and that whole mess of a situation. But as for the single player? Where Rockstar excells? Well . . .Rockstar is the People's Developer through and through and they prove they care about their fans every single day even if what they do to show they care like generally giving people more freedom and trusting the masses end up hurting a bit more than they should (Like the modders and hackers in GTA Online. Apparently GTA Online doesn't have the best Anti cheat detection nor does it utilize Valve's Anti Cheat software for some reason).The only thing I fear about the next GTA game to come will be that it may be impossible to live up to let alone surpass this masterpiece.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-28,0,0,47,False,Recommended,What can you say about a game that still has play value after what almost 4 years since release dating back to the console versions? I cant diss on this game i had alot of fun times and late nights playing this game with friends I dont have alot of playtime on the pc version so this review is basically from my console gaming time and i easily give it a 9.5/10 even with the bugs it had or still has over the span of its release im basing this purly on fun factor.....And having that much fun on the console version over the past few years i can tell you even with the little time i have into this game on PC its that much better then it was on console! And if i had more PC friends to play it with maybe id get back into it more.......The reason for the 9.5/10 and not given it a perfect 10/10 is because of the only knock i gave this game from the start and its the price of the in game vehicles/guns/clothes/etc. and not earning enough money to buy stuff like for example $10 000 for a shirt? and only earning like $19k on lets say Rooftop Rumble? doesnt make much sense to me....But still a really good game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,125,False,Recommended,UPDATE Rockstar has convinced Take Two to back off Open IV and published a statement saying they will NOT go after singleplayer mods. This original negative review was made to help create that response and as that has now happened I will revert the recommendation to positive. I'm sure everyone knows this game is great. It's obvious that Rockstar are the ones who know what gamers think and Take Two are the ones that are out of touch. I'd advise keeping an eye on how T2 handles their future releases but R* is good in my book at least as far as this is concerned. I'm keeping the original review posted below for posterity This is an awesome game. I played it a lot before writing this review and I will probably play it a lot after writing this review.But I will not spend a cent more either on microtransactions nor any game by Take Two as long as they bully mod authors into removing single player mods that do nothing to hurt the online game. This is an absolutely dangerous precedent that we need to reject outright. If you continue to buy anything by them then you are implicitly allowing this to happen. We cannot allow PC gaming to lose one of the things that makes it so great.For more information on this http //kotaku.com/popular gta v modding tool shuts down community explod 1796112893,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,718,False,Not Recommended,"I'm hopping on the Take Two "" you"" wagon but in a more different and detailed way. At the time of writing this I've played action packed loading screen full hacker full 700 hours. I got the game the same week it came out on PC. That being said I think I have had a good experience on the changes the negatives and positives that have evolved and died out during this period. To put it down simply these are the pros and cons Pros Amazing graphicsLoads of contentBig and diverse community.Cons Loading screenDrop out sessionModdersI'm no diehard GTA franchise fan but I've played GTA SA and I fell in love with the whole concept of running around in an open world and doing what you or your buddies desire ( SAMP comes into play here ). Because of previous successful games I decided to get GTA V as soon as it would come out for PC. If you are like me a guy that likes to go through the story line without worrying about the collectables and side stories the game will take you approximately 35 hours to complete. Which is fine because I bought the game for the multiplayer the heists missions races and free roam. Pros For starters this game is absolutely awesome to play. It has tons and tons of content and if you are creative you can expand upon the tools that are given and create even more content for you and for others. The game is optimized and graphically astonishing ( with graphical mods you can enhance the graphics making it even more enjoyable ). If I managed to milk 750+ hours from online a guy that has little to no creativity imagine what a person with creativity can accomplish.I'd like to mention and talk about the sheer number of diversity that the community has. By diversity I mean sheer number of crews. There's a crew for everyone. Whether you like racing drifting or just chilling there's a crew for almost everything.Cons The two problems I experienced at the beginning were the loading screens that sometimes could last a good minute or two before loading you into online mode or crashing you back into single player and the occasional kick from an online session. It's not a game breaker but sometimes these issues would get me quite annoyed and by quite annoyed I mean uninstalling GTA V because sometimes they were just too much. And I'm sure it wasn't coming from my end because all the other multiplayer games I've played have ran silk smooth. I've done quite a bit of research in this problem and I found out that it has to do with their net code and how they manage the online lobbies. The thing is Rockstar are letting players host the lobbies themselves whilst putting filters such as spikes in the packet loss. To keep things smooth they limit the packet loss so that people with even the smallest problems get kicked out. Because of this the loading screens are 9 years long meanwhile in third party multiplayer applications like FiveM connecting between player and the server happens 10x faster because the servers are hosted separately from the game. At the beginning of the PC GTA V lifespan the modders were not as prominent they were there but they weren't as many and a big pain in the as they are now.The game breaking problem for me are the modders in this game. They started getting annoying about three months into the lifespan of GTA V PC. Money started dropping and people slowly didn't even bother to play heists or missions that give money because why should they? They can just enter a lobby cry for money and the next thing you see is money bags dropping everywhere. If I would compare this problem to an irl thing I'd look at it as a growing tumour because it had this snowballing effect that creates even more problems the longer you let it grow. With every month the game lost a bit of its richness and beauty it had. The few months into the game you could see people exploring grinding heists and creating content via the content creator tool. Now almost everyone has the top 3 fastest cars best skyscraper and garages full with random cars. Granted you could get all that stuff by now but it leaves me confused when lvl 20 has all this plus more.Now the so called tumour has gotten big and cutting it off is not going to help at this current time period because of the mentioned things above. This could've been prevented if Take Two or Rockstar acted much ing faster instead of patching the game with useless patches that would later get exploited again. It's not only Rockstar to blame it's also the creators at Youtube the creators that spam videos that include ways to further exploit the game instead of enjoying it. Most of the channels don't understand the consequences the consequences in promoting something that could potentially ruin the game for others. All they see is money from those Youtube views.TL DRThe game had a huge potential but due to things like modders the possibilities are slowly dying out. At the very start of GTA V PC the pros outweighed the cons by A MILE but now it's getting worse and worse with every coming month. If I was writing this game a year ago I'd recommend it but now it just feels like it's lived its life and just gasping for the final days. I do think Open IV removal was not the correct option not because of the single player mods or whatever but because it could potentially put end to modders in online. Granted they should've done it much ing faster but I guess it's better to do it later than never.",Grand Theft Auto V

So I had to make room for the game cause just having steam download it stopped th downloader and it was stuck from continueing making room on the drive allowed the utterly slow download of whatever update was needed on release date fixed that.Also when the social club box came up the steam alt tab message box came up so I couldn't figure out how to attach steam to the social club .. removing the steam entry off the window allowed the badly placed ""go"" button to attach steam to the social club to be visible which I never would have found unless searching for help on it.The money I was supposed to get from downloading early never came.. in the storymode game at least I don't know do I see that in online mode?

The only reason I purchased GTA on pc was for the mods else I would've just stuck with the ps4 version. There's absolutely no reason for me play this game.UPDATE Ok so we've recieved official word from Rockstar themselves. They have stated that you will not be banned for mods OFFLINE that means single player is good to go! mod the out of it. I had originally given this game a dumbs down.

2015-04-13,0,0,414,False,Not Recommended,"Great singleplayer experience (still love it!) but with the paltry amount of fresh content it recieves being cut off due to Take Two greed due to the fact that this game has an MMO bolted onto it as multiplayer. (The truth is that the multiplayer DLC content used to be accessible in singleplayer but it was removed as it was much cheaper to modify and experiment in singleplayer before purchasing and performing the modifications in multiplayer.)Now onto multiplayer it was underwhelming upon release. No doubt about it. Grinding was hard and the entire game focused around either grinding (which was not too bad **upon release**) or the easy way out Shark Cards.Shark Cards are this game's form of microtransaction. You exchange real money for virtual money. Maximum amount that you can pay is $60 (equal to another ing license of the game) for $8 000 000 (equal to eight of the most high end car in the game the Truffade Adder **in the beginning of the game's release.**)Let's shorten the history of multiplayer. Players want more content. The developer (Yes it is both Rockstar AND Take Two Interactive but let's just say that ""developer"" encompasses both Rockstar AND Take Two.) obliges by adding more content but by also removing or otherwise making it more difficult to grind. I will address that yes heists were added and payouts were rebalanced. That does not excuse that the heists are difficult time sinks (I'd wager four hours) for $200 000 (in game currency) and that in order to get respectable mission payouts you need *to go AFK for 10 minutes* for $10 000. Also the missions that were grinded the most before heists were added were either made more difficult such as with the cases of the missions Coveted and Rooftop Rumble where the AI combatants were added in number AND given nearly fatal accuracy and precision against the player in addition to complicating the mission flow. In the case of Coveted deterrence was simply not enough and the mission was removed slowly from removal in quick access to removal in playlists to forcing the mission marker to be in the starting position of the mission itself (which is atop the peak of a mountain that overlooks the shore which can describe most mountains in the game world) to forcing the indicator to be present for three in game hours (but if you miss the time you either need to wait 30 minutes for nearly a whole day in game to pass or spend 10 minutes finding a new game) to silently removing the marker altogether.Let's get to the present. The most powerful vehicles cost $6 500 000 to purchase and modify (I believe that is for the Truffade Nero Custom not sure I haven't touched this game in a while) while there is no way to grind the money required to access the content without slaving 14 hours in this game daily for weeks. Also they are now actively going against the modding fanbase for the game (even though the majority played fair and only touched singleplayer a rule that the developer themselves requested) by sending a Cease and Desist order to the developers of OpenIV the mod which allows modders to view and manipulate the content and code of the game itself.Finally before I end this (half complete) review I'd just like to say that Take Two's CEO finds that the playerbase hasn't fully reimbursed them yet for the amount of content that they have released going as far as to nearly call those who only paid $60 freeloaders.Pirate this game.

It's been two years since GTA V has been released onto PC and half the game and all of it's DLC is literally unplayable because of this one massive problem. There has been little effort to fix this as Take Two decided to instead leave a computer program to ban any potential cheaters. Of course the program is garbage enough where it only temporarly bans them thus contributing very little to the broken mess that is GTA Online. TL DR I would not recommend this game to anyone even if it were on sale. It's not worth buying since half of the game doesn't work.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,0,False,Recommended,This is a great game that I would strongly recomend to anyone who loves just cause other GTA instalments or even open world adventure/action games. It has a vast array of activities or missions from killing cops to doing yoga (as featured in one of the many trailers). Although it may be fun the many activities ARE kind of a selling point for the game and generally they give way to the imfamous ultra violence typical to GTA. Basically some of the games are used only to boast of the games size and people maily will ignore them. I STRONGLY RECOMEND that you READ AND COMPARE the SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS due to the fact that it IS a very demanding game and that playing GTA 5 in 600x800 with half a second delay is while semi playable extremly disapointing and worth nowhere near the cost of the game. I WOULD deffinetly recomend the game to any casual or extreme gamer as it is an all round fun time (+ we PC gamers get to laugh at the console players trying to aim on controller!!!).,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is a fun game the campaign is amazing the gameplay is solid the map is huge and diverse in settings. I have enjoyed every minute of playing the GTA V campaign. My issues with the game are in the multiplayer. GTA Online would be fun if it wasn't such a grind fest to do anything in it. Payouts for missions games and heists are nothing. It takes forever to get enough money to buy even the most basic items like clothing guns and ammo. If you want to play with any of the cool new vehicles they keep releasing you'll either need to playing non stop for hours just to buy one thing or you pay real money for in game money. I also keep running into problems with ""hackers"" on servers. Want to drive your nice new car out of your garage? Well too bad someone put a massive windmill in the road in front of your apartment that smacks you the second you pull out. Or you're teleported to the top of a mountain instantly given a 5 star wanted level and shot by 30 officers and helicopter while you can't move.

But after that you think people are coming back to hear the same jokes over again? Or to continue their super fun online experience of getting banned for being on the same server as a hacker? No they come back because of the endless possibilities others have created for them. Mods are not hackers. Modding is not illegal. This company has a major inferiority complex. People are not playing San Andreas 15 years later for any reason except mods. For the love of god find some other way to get this game don't give them your money.,Grand Theft Auto V

And the multiplayer experience is entirely dependent on whether or not you pay out for micro transactions that at the end of the day are a black hole for your money as unlike in other games that would require the player to input so much of their money to make the online experience enjoyable there is no online marketplace or stock market which players can make use of to gain resources for their character.

(team killing not completing the job's messing around) Now I am finding players who are actually trying. They may not be the best but at least they are putting in effort. I have not seen many hackers sinse the first time i started playing. You may find it difficult as a new player to be accepted because everyone sees your Level of experience. I often get kicked form jobs before they start because i am ""at the time of this review"" at level 10. It takes many hours to figure out the online play but once you do it soo much fun! Its when you wonder the map for to long that you become a target for headhunters. People killing people for fun. As long as you go job to job your fine.As for the single player mode! I may actually finnish the game! I have played all the past GTA's but all those games faliled to capture my attention and I soon just went around in a Tank blowing stuff up untill I stopped playing completely. This game is full of fun Jobs and great acting with funny charicters! They did a very good job with the voice overs. This game is highly addictive! I will finnish the single player mode.I would say to new players if you get discouraged or frustrated with hackers wait before you demand your money back give the game a chance.

2017-06-10,0,0,88,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is perfection imagine every grand theft auto game stuffed into one and it creates this absolute masterpeice of a game. Everything to graphics voice acting story and world design. San Andreas is absolutely stunning the silent oceans to the crazy deserts to the busy cities its perfect. The story is awesome its very clever the way rockstar made each character Franklin takes you back to the good old days of gta san andreas and represents new players and those willing to start fresh. Michale represents the laid back character of Tommy Verceti from Vice City and symbolises players who have finished the game and move onto new stuff. Trevor represents some more crazy characters from the original Grand theft auto and symbolises the more chaotic characters who blow stuff up and kill innocent players. Online is also the perfect way to interact with friends online new missions are added frequently and the game is 4 years old and DLC is still getting added one problem with online is the price of vechiles and the way they force you to buy shark cards but all can be avoided with a simple mod menu (not ideal) over all this game is a masterpiece 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

But then when I tried to actually PLAY and RUN the game I couldn't because I get an error from social club saying ""Unable to access rockstar server. Activation of Gta 5 requires an internet connection Please check your connection and try again"". My 0.4 hours on record in steam is not actually in game time but rather time spent on the launcer seeing that error message stated above. Needless to say I am now ABSOLUTELY LIVID. Is it not enough that I gave rockstar my hard earned money even BEFORE I actually got to use the product that I PAYED for? only to be treated like crap with this ridiculous social club DRM that DOESN""T EVEN WORK in its intended puporse of stopping piracy since pirates get this game for free regardless. Anyways I am done ranting. I just wanted to share experience with GTA 5 on launch day. Who knows maybe in a couple months sever traffic may die down enough for me to actually access rockstar servers and actually play this game. But by that time I probably wouldn't give a hoot anymore.

2017-06-20,0,0,163,False,Not Recommended,While I enjoyed the single player story that's about it. The map sucks the cars are incredibly cartoonish and handle like toys and it's just not fun after you beat it once or twice. The main reason I despise this game is the disaster known as GTA Online what a dog sh*t experience. I tried it a couple times years ago I bought a high rise apartment bought a couple over priced cars... and then got bored. It's essentially just a deathmatch arena. You can't walk/drive around for five minutes without getting killed by some douchey fourteen year old screaming into his mic like Justin Beiber fingering his balloon knot. The loading times in the online portion even on my SSD are atrocious. The biggest issue is the forced Shark Cards notice how all the cars they've added post launch are only in multiplayer? So if you only enjoy single player you don't have any access to the new content. Not just the cars but all vehicles released post launch they're all exclusive to GTA online. This is clearly intentional. If you want to experience any of the new content you either have to grind for three months just to afford one overpriced car or you have to buy a Shark Card. It's not just pay to win it's pay to enjoy. The Shark Card that costs you twenty US dollars barely buys you a car or two. It's so clear they adopted the disgusting corporate attitude the gaming industry has been sliding towards in the past ten years Ubisoft being the most guilty. Rockstar used to be one of the companies I would consider pre ordering from one of the companies I trusted but after the joke that this game turned out to be I've just lost patience with these Since GTA Online is such cancer I stuck with the single player for awhile despite the lack of content. One of the main reasons I could do this without wanting to rip my eyeballs out of my skull from boredom was because fo the modding potential. Well guess what? That's gone too now. Take Two sent OpenIV a cease and desist letter so no more modding. I literally have no reason to play this game anymore. Importing mods to replace in game cars with their real life counterparts along with the LSPDFR mod was the only reason I played the single player after beating the campaign. I bet it's just another way to force players into GTA Online so they can sell more Shark Cards. It's just gross. Count on Red Dead 2's online experience to be no different there's no way these cowards aren't going to try to maximize profits at the cost of a quality online mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have no idea who is responsible for the attacks and I had no plans to play detective simulator nor did I sign in here to do paperwork for you guys. so i figure I'll just go to a new instance.

2017-06-22,0,0,418,False,Recommended,Update It has been confirmed that OpenIV has been cleared for singleplayer mods while also making it harder to mod multiplayer. My statement on saying that the story and gameplay is good still stands. I'll leave the old review within this below as a testament to what has happened previously because we cannot forget what has happened. As much as I love Grand Theft Auto 5 and the hours of fun it has brought me I have to not recommend this game due to the recent actions taken by Take Two Interactive in regards to modding especially the OpenIV project which had been handed a threat of a lawsuit. Grand Theft Auto 5 may be a wonderful game with a good story and good gameplay but Take Two has crossed the line and has taken action against an innocent modding community whose majority suffer the consequences of the minority who use the program to hack and alter the Online services. Although I may be a vanilla player I fully support and praise the majority of the modding community that does their best to comply with Online TOS and disable it when active in Online and use the program for good and hope that Take Two sees that this is action will not be tolerated by their fanbase and will hopefully reverse their decision on banning modding.TL DR I definitely recommend the game itself for it's wonderful gameplay and good story but highly not recommend it due to the cease and desist letter sent to the OpenIV team by Take Two Interactive.(I will change this review if the situation does change.),Grand Theft Auto V

You can't even do that much with it except wander around the mere 3000 square feet interior or walk on the deck.

I've bought the collectors editions of GTA IV and V and I've spent more than I'd care to say on shark cards in GTA V.

However that stops now due to TakeTwo's decision to outlaw single player modding via the cease and desist notice to OpenIV. Online is nothing but hacks and griefers and rather than doing anything about it TakeTwo would rather take away the single player modding experience in an attempt to drive more people to their online microtransactions. Well sorry TakeTwo but the gaming community isn't that stupid. Modding keeps aging games alive and keeps their titles fresh in our minds when the next installment approaches. I was still playing GTA V and online because of mods. I only bought GTA V on PC because of mods. I was buying shark cards because I was still playing the game and splitting my time between online and SP so mods were making you money. And nothing about OpenIV affects the online in any way. Win your customers money through quality of gameplay not through lawyers.Avoid GTA V. And unless they address this avoid the rest of TakeTwo's catalogue as well.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer experience is top notch.However I feel bad about supporting a company which has proven itself to only care about the micro transactions literally nothing else.The whole multiplayer is a cashgrab through microtransactions... It's not about playing together experiencing GTA together with your friends It's about you buying shark cards in order to buy cool cars ingame...Can't support rockstar if RDR2 is anything like this I'll have to skip it completely.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-20,0,0,143,False,Recommended,After they have listened to the community I completely give them lots of respect for doing so so in conclusion I have changed my review back to positive and would definitely recommend this game for a great modding experience,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,2478,False,Recommended,(EDIT) After R* has listened to our complaints Single Player modding is back! I hearby change my review to a rightous upturned thumb! Thanks R*!Before I was all like R* killed themselves by banning Single Player modding. I've spent a lot of time on the game and genuinely enjoy it but now I feel betrayed. Oh well I just bought Arma 3 screw R* our relationship is over.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-02-18,0,0,646,False,Recommended,WHOOOO OPENIV IS BACK This game is awesome for anyone liking an open world sandbox that is filled with details!The only bad thing is take two taking down openiv but now its back it seems.Would recommend alot!But it's kinda hard to make money online. But very fun and amazing game!,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,0,0,686,False,Recommended,"So this game is a good game and I would give it a positive review but some recent actions by Take Two have led me to give a more negative review. The gameplay of single player is good and the story is quite good. The online is quite fun though the emphasis on their longing for money is evident in the high prices and advertising of microtransactions. But Take Two's recent ""cease and desist"" to OpenIV because it ""enables recent malicious mods that...interfere with...GTA Online..."" pushes me to write a negative review. OpenIV is not a script mod which is what most Online hacks are. OpenIV has never had malicious intent it was a basis for modding to mess around in single player. Take Two has just made the wrong decision here. If they had a problem with an Online hack enabled by OpenIV they could have tried to work with OpenIV to stop the Online hack rather than shut down the entire modding community. This was timed in such a way that one could say it had to do with the work on a port of Liberty City into GTA V but I feel that there is not a single person who would buy a game just for the map. The experience of Liberty City in GTA V would be completly different from GTA IV with the different physics and lighting and stuff. I would advise you to also leave a negative review on GTA V to get as much attention as possible.EDIT Now that OpenIV is back I give this game a positive review because it's fun but I advise you to avoid large public online sessions.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,40,False,Not Recommended,Update Rockstar and their parent company decided to remove mod support for GTA V after allowing it for this long. Theories say it's because they're pushing microtransactions harder and without mods to compete with them it's better for them. Well regardless of the reason mod support is dead and I've no interest in supporting Rockstar/Take 2 anymore. Thanks guys I've enjoyed the games over the years but you guys really blew it. Avoid their games at all costs they apparently don't care about the community or what they've destroyed. I've never played GTA V on other devices didn't really see much footage of it till the day before the PC release and it was everything from how solid the port was to how much they did right and how great it's gonna be. I'm a fan of GTA though I've avoided it since GTA IV that was a mixed bag and just didn't give me the same fun 2 3 VC had. I've played a bit and I'll separate them by general and online. So keep that in mind that I only played a few hours of SA and while I beat 4 I also would happily never play it again.General This port unlike GTAIV is amazing they have a lot of options to tweak and adjust from very in depth graphical options sound options you can use mouse &amp keboard or switch to a controller on the fly. So if you like driving/flying with a controller but shooting with a mouse and kb? Easily done! Everyone has always wondered what GTA would be like in first person obvious from the mods some have made and installed now it's in the game by default and they went ALL out. Get into a car and you're treated to not some floating cam on the hood of the car but a fully modeled interior of the car! In first person you can run around and do everything as normal and there's an option to switch to 3rd person if you use cover.Graphically the game is wildly pretty as stated car interiors are fully modeled and look great there's a variety of areas to visit with different areas. The map is huge it's not Just Cause 2 huge but it's impressively large. Runs at 60fps at 1080p with everything mostly on highest (exceptions being not putting every AA option on PC specs at end of review)Online This is hit or miss you start out making a character with a unique styled character creator which ...while neat makes the process more complicated than it needs to be.Here's what I hated I played with some random people for a few hours and I would charitably describe them as lively. Being called several names over voice then attacked then again more name calling and you'll be defending yourself a lot too because Rockstar thought it'd be in your best interest to point out all players actively on the mini map and map. So if you want to just try and do some things and there's 1 jerk? He can hunt all players down. They DO mark people who do this by making their dot more and more red and 'good' players are encouraged to hunt them but it's not any less annoying. Only made worse by how fast you die I'm sure this was more geared how it was on console where using sticks was a bit harder to aim but with a mouse you can kill a player in a few bullets a headshot being instant from what I could tell. So guy power slides over stops for just long enough to shoot you in the face drive to where you spawned and try it again while each death being followed by some uncreative insult or you blow his face off and blow his tires out.What I liked Thankfully you can make private matches with friends or alone you can even still have players online hop into events such as racing if you let them into the event/not your world. So you can easily avoid pub matches but still play online with full access to deathmatches being put up and whatever. You can even start matches and make them public from your private world. Once you end it you'll be dropped back into your own area. In events they tell what control scheme each player is using mouse/controller and you can limit the game to who can use what or not.To put it simply you can find a lot in this game because you can do so freaking much.

2016-11-24,0,0,396,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-06,0,0,666,False,Recommended,"GTA5 online and story mode Fantastic. Story mode is great. Script hook cheats are ok but stop the online content..There is a bit of sexual content in the story mode but none in Online. Online is fun but you do have to know there will be level 200 players that will just smash you. Best bet is to buy a couple of shark cards and get a bit of stuff to make things more fun/safe... find a quiet server... off you go. But theres no fun in that. the ""T"" button will open the text option or double beep so another player knowns your not going to kill them and invite them along. Drive sneak swim around and participate in missions and you will max out your stats quick. Bennys has free cars... get as many as you want they are pretty fast. Once in a blue moon you meet a modder who spawns cash which is a god send. you will need a reserve of $$$ to pay for incidentals but its pretty cheap. If you join with a friend and get a bounty on you player you can get yoyr friend to ""bump you on the head"" and collect it and vice verser. I have enjoyed alot of the extra content I didnt think I would. Golf tennis 80 video games... there alot to do. There will be trolls but there is also Passive mode so no one can kill you too. I have seen posts of people being banned for on reason but theres a channel for compliants against other inapropriate players... probably the reason why they got banned.

2016-02-15,0,0,222,False,Not Recommended,Actually if there was a yes AND no option I would choose it. The game is very fun and you can spend days weeks even MONTHS on end playing only this game. The online option makes it just and infinite times better. I just need to tell you that you should DEFINITELY get it on a sale for around $40 instead of the whole $60. I say this because you need one of those $1 500 gaming computers and to top it off it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to play a game like this with keyboard and mouse. Mean that along with the $1 500 computer you also need to buy the $60 steam controller. I got tis game for $40 and I completely regret it. It is literally just like a beta version where all you can do is the prolouge and beggining of the FIRST mission for the story mode adn the online well it only lets you create your character then it crashes when you try to load it. So if you want the WHOLE game you had better be ready to fork out $1 560 plus tax for just the COMPUTER AND STEAM CONTROLLER then top the cake with$60(Again try to get it for $40 or hopefully less) for teh actual game. Ending total ABOUT $2 000 just for a (again reallly good) video game. I'm not ready to spen tht kind of money ESPECIALLY after I ALREADY spent $40 on the game just to find that it doesn't even work on my THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR COMPUTER THAT IS TOUCH SCREEN. Not to mention all the games you have on the computer you have now you would have to buy them AGAIN adn ALSO restar your progress. 3/10 rating for the whole entire thing 11/10 rating for the just the game's AWESOMENESS by itself. please comment your opinions below.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,4,False,Recommended,I already own this on two consoles (PS3/PS4) and now the PC version looking as well. I am looking forward to modding the crap out of it. It s a great game and I think people get turned off the online too easily. Long load times the occasional lag and spotty server connection don t always help the argument either. It is easy to get frustrated especially early on when it looks like there are only a few activities and you re getting constantly stomped by people with better toys in the open world. Don t give up steal cars and rob mini marts. Buy guns or cars to do missions or race then property. Don t get lured away from the goal by the icing (clothing haircuts tattoos custom paint and neon kits on starter cars). I d rather be the worst dressed guy killing your faces any day. As you level up more and more activities will unlock and if you put in the time and find a good crew (you might as well it gives more point to run with a crew anyways) this game is beyond fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-14,0,0,420,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is an excellent game and a great value as you are essentially getting two games for the price of one... To elaborate this is because GTA online has essentially transformed into it's own MMO styled game as there is so much to do and so much customization. One could easily dwindle away hours of life playing GTA online just as much as they could playing the core game. This is because Grand Theft Auto 5 is arguably Rockstar's largest and most expansive game as there is just so much fun stuff that can be done and so much freedom in the actual game and customization. In regards to the story and missions the single player story is a tad short but there is a cavalcade of other missions and other activities that could be done after the main story has been completed so don't fear that the game is going to let you down in that regard. The story itself is actually great as it's satirical take on Western culture specifically California is always a good laugh and overall very entertaining. In regards to the PC port if you can even call it that Rockstar has done an excellent job in including copious settings and adjustments to the game and it's graphics which assists it to runs well on majority of systems. An excellent example of a PC port done well other developers should seriously take notes. In short Rockstar has made another great game in the Grand Theft Auto series which in my opinion is one of the best entries to date as the inclusion of GTA online added to the overall enjoyment.,Grand Theft Auto V

Modding is a legal PC institution that shouldnt be harmed with in anyway. First Bethesda wanted us to pay big bucks for mods now T2 wants them to stop being created so you can pay big bucks on GTA Online via Shark Card microtransactions.Disgusting.Now onto the real review. GTA V in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. This was my first GTA game. I played this game for 3 hours and all I found is unlikable main characters boring missions unsatisfying gunplay AWFUL driving controls and lots and lots of really mean people roaming the streets. I know the purpose of this game is to create chaos and punch these guys in the face but that doesn't apeal to me to be honest. I want a good fight to stand for not to be a If I wanted to release my anger I would play Doom or Wolfenstein.But thats just me. I found GTA V to be tasteless and boring. But that may be different for you. GTA does have a strong fanbase and a dedicated community. So don't let my opinion sway you away from this game.

I did some research into modding the game and the mods sold me on it so i shelled out another $60 for the game however after owning it for only a month take two killed the mod support and now the game is just the same thing I played 3 years ago.

2015-04-14,0,0,156,False,Recommended,Finally.....So I'm running an overclocked i5 3570K (Ivy Bridge) and a GTX 970 and the game runs great maxed out. I turn off vsync and refection quality lower since that seems to give me stuttering issues (probably related to RAM) but everything else is pretty much as high as it can get. I float around 60 70 fps even with population density all the way up though it does drop considerably when in a vehicle in first person. Not sure what that's about but they may have a fix for it down the line. The game itself is expectantly great nothing different from the console versions. Haven't dabbled in Online or Heists yet but I'm sure they're just as good as they were on consoles although I'm expecting a serious frames drop but that's bound to happen in a multiplayer setting. All in all if you lost your social life playing the console versions and you want the benefit of higher graphical capabilities and future modding then don't hesitate to buy the game. it's good 98% good to go.

2017-06-20,0,0,289,False,Not Recommended,"ROCKSTAR decided to take out a non threat to their online revenue stream and instead focuses on a program used for single player mods all the while claiming they are protecting others from ""harassment."" t you greedy s. Grand Theft Auto Online has a myriad of problems as is and the recent Cease and Desist is just the straw the broke the camel's back. As much as I enjoy the game's single player though without any DLC or any real love or support from its developer it does feel empty after the game is beaten. A massive open world limited by how short the campaign and how few side missions there are. The Online is another story using a heavy reliance on unreliable people to complete heists and a dependence on in game virtual currency to obtain anything surprisingly fun or wacky to enjoy with the few friends you are able to coax into playing the game alongside you. The in game currency and trying to obtain becomes a grind fest for the ages when one wishes to have say a rocket car or what have you. But that can at times be forgiven as an excuse to play with my friends so long as there isn't some sadistic wanting to snipe my off from three blocks away and continues to do so for the next hour (YOU DON'T NEED MODS FOR THAT ROCKSTAR). But even my gripes with the Online and even the Single Player could be forgiven if they just worked on their damn load times and connection settings. I mean my god it is 2017 as I write this and in four years since release Rockstar has yet to figure out how to make their loadtimes less than five to ten minutes? But now they've gone and attacked OpenIV blaming Take Two the publisher for the action of sending the C&amp D rather than owning it themselves as they have the main financial incentive. But they couldn't even do that right and are attacking a mod base that is for single player mods. Gotta sell those ungodly expensive Shark Cards somehow right? Even if that means taking out completely innocent bystanders who are only associated because of the shared label of ""modders."" For all it's worth it's a good game with numerous problems that need to be addressed and a development company that doesn't care about fixing the problems with their actual content so long as they keep dumping new content into their Online.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-24,0,0,283,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V was great and had great potential. The things rockstar has addded and still are adding is amazing! The game had a great and immersive story... but Rockstar has royally ruined GTA V forever. Everything fun or makes the game worth playing is unreachable without paying real money. Everything has been made super expensive and missions have been nerfed to not pay as much to the players that complete them. Rockstar has done this so that you will buy Shark cards which addds in game currency using real money. it is an absolute ripoff. So whatever can't get the cool stuff online Why not just go to single player to try it out? Well rockstar does not add anytthing to single player forcing you to go online and pay to get all the cool stuff. it is truly disgusting that they have made Gta V a pay to have fun game. Rockstar all i can say is im ashamed.. but its ok why not mod the stuff in the game so you do not have to play? Well not rockstar is banning any mods that add thier stuff into the game (ex Liberty city map gta v online vehichles guns ect) it sucks..... Rockstar has gotten a ton of money... why do they still need to screw us over for more.. im ashamed..,Grand Theft Auto V

Takes a lot of time to get ENB working.Very very very very very very very very ugly deformation of limbs.Rockstar is loaded they can afford better topology on their models. No excuse for that. All the characters in this game bend like blow up dolls.Also got boring very very quickly but its always fun to run into a lamp post or chase a lady in a bikini down the street.Didn't play the whole story because I got bored and stopped playing the game.

In order to enjoy the new ""content"" (never any new missions or heists) they release you have to have millions of in game dollars. The only way to obtain this amount of money is hours/days of grinding missions and heists (which they have not added any since release) OR pay ridiculous amounts of real life money for their ""shark"" cards. $99.99 irl for $8mil in game? That won't even get you started. AND now the banning of ALL single player mods? The single player mods keep the game going for a large amount of the community who do not play online.

I use a 2 year old laptop (i7 3630QM GT650m 2GB 8GB RAM) and can run the game on normal and get anywhere from 40 60 (definitely playable) so performance wise I'm quite satisfied. The story mode is really fun to play and the characters are diverse and the monotonous feel of GTA IV side missions isn't present. I haven't noticed any performance differences for GTA O and even with crappy internet there is very minimal lag in the game. GTA O is quite enjoyable whether you're with friends or riding solo and in the amount of time I've played I've had no issues finding something fun to do. Really the only gripe I have is that the loading times are a bit long even with an SSD but from what I hear it's a lot better than the consoles.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,0,0,222,False,Recommended,GTA Online comes bundled in of course bringing Rockstar s online multiplayer crime sim to the PC for the first time. It s due a reappraisal now that the new Heist missions have been dropped in but it s still a slightly odd combination of open world exploration and ad hoc PvP larceny and murder (all good) and more straightforward shooter and racer events which don t really play to GTA s strengths. It s fun but not Battlefield Hardline.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-07,0,0,125,False,Recommended,GTA 5 Review This game is definitly defining what a good world can do for a story GTA 5 brings a RPG like skill system that really changes how you play. Each character has their own ability diversing from slowing down the world while driving to slowing down the world while shooting or doing extra damage. At times you definitly miss having one of those abilitys during missions that don't fit that characters specialty. GTA 5 has a big world and unlike other big world I always felt like there was something to do even in the middle of the woods the story does a great job in sorta introducing each area to the character. I would find a random trail and follow it through the wilderness just to see where it would take me. At times in the campaign it felt like money was not an issue since that contrast to the very money stingy GTA games of the past but really that lets you toy around with a bunch of other things. I also felt like there were too little heist in the main story I really liked picking my crew and its worth trying other people in new playthroughs I just wish I could try them all in one. Overall the story is top notch and the world is great combat is easy but responsive and I like the skill and abilities of each character.GTA Online There was a time on this game where online was actually fun but that was around the Heist update. Rockstar have failed to create a DLC as refreshing as the Heist since. I was hoping they would add more but now they are into you buying microtransactions just to get a clubhouse or a CEO building. Its just more recycled crap from here I honestly wish they would go back to making heist instead of trying to make me buy a shark card just to play the really washed down and recycled VIP program with the same name. The CEO and Biker mission really just consist of taking an uncontested vehicle and driving it to a warehouse. Its not even fun. I cannot reccomend GTA Online in its current state its toxic and a shell of its former self.,Grand Theft Auto V

The multiplayer deffitly has its flaws but it is still very fun when you enter a lobby there is a decent chance that you might see a modder and you will see at least one douch bag running around the map killing everybody that he can but overall online is a very fun experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-25,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE Changed review to ""Not Recommended"" as Take Two sent C&amp D to OpenIV team thus basically killing off most of the modding scene. Mods were one of the few things I liked about this deeply flawed game so without them GTA 5 is just yet another mediocre open world game with awful online mode component. ORIGINAL REVIEW Cautious recommendation. Singleplayer campaign is OK. It's can be very boring due to a slower pace of first 10 15 hours but last third of the game was fantastic(probably because you get the chance to kill all of the annoying charachters). But before that you get very boring story unlikable characters and little to none action in story missions. And shootouts that are present are so linear that often you don't even have a chance to flank your enemies. So despite a very satisfying shooting mechanics and body physics these scenes plays more like a chore than an engaging action game. Driving is fine i guess but i really missed grappling hook and wing suit from Just Cause 3 but that's just me.Unlike driving early stroy missions and unlikable characters GTA Online isn't even ""fine"". It's awful buggy piece of crap filled with microtransactions. And you totally get the feeling that multiplayer was designed to sell you these. Balance in this game reminds me of some of the worst korean f2p MMO's. And solo play almost impossible because without missions and heists(and these are very painfull without communicating with other players) your only option is to rob stores and steal cars. And it's very VERY repetative and boring. And players you meet in the streets aren't helping to relieve frustration. In fact i would gladly punch them in the stomach.So in conclusion. I would recommend you to buy it on sale for the story and the open world but don't buy it for the multiplayer",Grand Theft Auto V

I did play GTA 5 on the xbox one but the auto aim was the reason why I brought this game for the PC because the aiming is much more smoother. The gunrunning DLC did add the worst feature research hated that you cannot choose your research and the fast track did make a Pay to win feeling. Not sure to recommend this game or not because of some features bugs and modders. Also I want to say how military the game has got I Remember the days when the adder was the greatest car and the Tank was the closest military thing in the game but today we have flying bikes APCS and much more.

2015-04-17,0,0,78,False,Recommended,"Absolutely amazing game. So far my ""Game of the Year"" title. Looks and plays amazingly although I highly recommend using a controller instead of the keyboard and mouse as the game is already fully set up for controllers. As far as visuals go the game looks phenominal. With a i7 4790k and GTX 980 the game holds well above 60fps at Very High settings plus all the extras. There are some random frame drops for unknown reasons and they don't always happen at the same time. My guess is that there is still some work to be done optimising this game. THE BIGGEST FAIL! The worst thing about this game is the crashing. I livestream so I usually spend 5+ hours in game and after a while the game will crash because something with Rockstar Social Club failed to initialize. This has happened 4 times already and when it does it causes my graphics driver to reset and my stream crashes. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! You can be right in the middle of a mission and lose all progress or you could have just spent a bunch of money customizing a really nice car and it all disappears because of this stupid bloatware. Worse than GFWL and UPlay combined. Despite the terrible crashing issue the game is great and I highly recommend it. Hopefully sometime soon R* will learn from the mistakes of others and strip the social club as an external software needed to run the game. Otherwise with the way it crashes the game it's not better than GFWL.",Grand Theft Auto V

(This sometimes requires multiple attempts depending on how fast the game loads.) If you can get the affinity set to use just CPU0 before the video plays with the police sirens it will usually continue playing without a ""ERR_SYS_THREAD"" message.For a game that cost around $270 Million dollars to make and brought in over a BILLLION dollars in sales you would figure that Rockstar would be compelled to provide these simple fixes.Guess we will have to wait for all the COCAINE to run out before the boys at Rockstar North get back to work.",Grand Theft Auto V

If a cheater/hacker enters your game ******LEAVE****** The support is no help whatsoever its an automated system which just posts the same copy paste t no matter what. GTA Online suspensions are triggered by a number of factors including modding in GTA Online exploiting or abusing game mechanics manipulating protected game data and code or interfering with other players gameplay experience. Suspensions from GTA Online due to these reasons may be temporary suspensions or permanent bans depending on the severity of the infraction. If you receive a temporary suspension from GTA Online the next infraction will result in a permanent ban. If you are temporarily suspended from GTA Online you will not be able to access GTA Online from the moment you are suspended. Your suspension expiration date is shown on the splash screen after being returned to Story Mode following an attempt to play GTA Online. In addition your GTA Online character(s) will be reset. All GTA Online progress property and inventory will be reset. All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed.

I've played all of them and enjoyed most of them. GTA5 brings a whole new level of interaction with the famous GTA Online mode. I have not really played the single player story mode due to online being soooo fun. GTA Online has loads of features and is 100 games in 1. You can golf pick up hookers trick out cars drift go parachuting base jump of buildings hunt bikini beach goers and get stoned. _Become a powerful CEO or a biker MC boss.... the choice is up to you. I highly recommend this game for hours of fun with friends.Online mode allows you to make YOU. You can customize almost anything. When you first join you can work small jobs to afford a humble house steal a car and take it to the mod shop and insure it...... boom. Set for work... Work your way from small jobs to huge heists. *You need a fast internet connection and a good ping to play successfully with your friends.Graphics Beautiful 4/5.Gameplay Fantastically fun 5/5.Interface Good 3/5.Features Excellent 5/5.Updates Excellent 5/5.*Game has loads of free updates which other publishers would sell as DLC.

2016-12-04,0,0,62,False,Recommended,tl dr recommended but with lots of caveats.I remember playing the first GTA and loving it. I'd put in my favorite CD grab the gamepad and really enjoy some top down senseless mayhem. A lot has changed since those days. This latest implementation is very refined. It very much feels like playing through a movie script. An assortment of RPG elements have been introduced over the years like player stat improvement side quests party system and more. The sandbox you have to play in is enormous and there is plenty of opportunity to simply create your own fun. All of that said I'm not sure I really enjoyed this iteration of GTA. I like to immerse myself in side quests as a way to extend the playtime for a game and while there were side quests available it was no where near the richness of a Fallout or Skyrim. There are a handful of branching points in the game mainly to determine how you will approach a job. I loved Burnout for the ability to kick off an event from any intersection. GTA has Burnout like stunt jumps but you'll need to keep an eye out for them. The only character I really enjoyed was Trevor. This review is based solely on the single player campaign. I haven't tried any of the online content and from the rash of negative reviews I'm not tempted to either. Now that I'm done with the campaign I'm not tempted to return to it either. Sure there would still be more to do but unlike those early GTAs where I would launch the game just for a few minutes of mayhem I feel like it would be a lot of work just to get rolling in GTA V. From the long loading time to the extensive driving to reach a kick off point I could easily spend 15 minutes justing getting ready. Even with those gripes GTA V is a remarkable game. If you've enjoyed the series it is worth getting. I think I just had some bad expectations going in.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-25,0,0,207,False,Recommended,This a phenominal game and you should buy it for the single player experience alone. I've completed the story over seven times across the Xbox 360 Xbox One and PC and I loved it every time. Following and playing as three characters is a game changer.I would not reccomend buying the game for the online experience unless you also plan to buy a mod menu. It is extremely hard to actually have fun in online unless you first spend hours and hours grinding for money and even then there isn't that much to do besides run repetive sometimes boring sometimes stupid missions. All the adversary modes stop being populated after they stop being double $/RP. Online seriously needs a quality of life update but they just keep piling stuff on that doesn't really add much. The new Doomsday hiest is truly great and I like most all of the vehicles they've added however it doesn't fix the fact that you've gotta spent so much time grinding and not enjoying it to be able to enjoy it at all.I do not reccommend buying this game for the online experience and in remembrance of when Take Two shut down modding however if you plan to play the story then do get it.Note I would not and did not pay full price for this game. It goes on sale for $30 all the time and occasionally less get it on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-10,0,0,308,False,Recommended,So far I played through story mode with as much sidequests I could find and going around doing other stuff and tasted a few hours of Online. Personal observations based on this Story mode pretty standard GTA gameplay the usual stuff is here although I wouldn't have mind a little bit longer story and a little bit... more than just a standard GTA (it feels like how Farcry 4 felt like after Farcry 3 feels the same as before not much improved just enough to sell the game). 2 likeable cahracters (F and M) but tbh I didn't like Trevor at all the only reason I did (minor spoilers warning) the c option at the end is because I hated the other characters you can kill even more and I was afraid Michael and Franklin would not talk to each other if I chose to kill T. NPCs aren't really interesting most of them are psychos or just plain annoying and it gets really annoying really fast that you can't find a single likeable NPC like Little Jacob Kate or or others (I know is in the game but just for heists). Heists are fun but there is only a few of them I could use a lot more (and a lot more other missions as well). Can't really say anything about graphics my 460SE couldn't really handle the game even on low settings most of the time it was smooth sometimes it was a power point presentation. Good radio music and sound effects. Nice variety of things to do although I could still use a bit more and after the last heist the game pretty much stops. Shooting 2 bullets in the middle of nowhere and getting a 1* wanted level? Cmon. Even though I said the above I quite feel like R* didn't really care much about offline just put together a standard story almost like a tutorial for online and just concentrated on online. Hell I just bought the game (2016 steam summer sale) and there are still bugs in story mode disappearing cars gliches and for some reason hunting don't want to work for me at all. Ohh and also I'm kinda disappointed that you can't use cars bought online in story mode anymore.Now for Online So far hackers avoided me (or I avoided them) so I can't say yay or nay about them however the online community is as far from being nice as Pluto is from the Sun. Doing the basic quests for Lamar took me hours because people either didn't want to play with me due to the fact that I was low lvl or just intentionally died or trolled not to mention that I was shot almost immediately after every time we done a quest by those whom I did the quest with. So yeah Ben Yahtzee Croshaw had a point the game seems to be designed to make you just hate other people. Tried some heists too got kicked out of most of them and those I could do was kinda meh. 2v2 and 3v3 team shooting was fun.Overall I'm happy I got the game it's not necessarily the best in the series and tbh R* really should open up a dictionary and look up what fun means because they pretty much left behind most of the things that made a GTA game outstanding and really fun.EDIT Also I'd love to see this R* social club burn in the deepest parts of hell quite irritating that if the servers are offline I can't play the game at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,239,False,Not Recommended,GTA V was one of the best games I have ever played ( back when it released on PC ).Since then the game has only been slowly dying and it's killers are the once who made it.Here are just two most important things that killed GTA V 1st. The Multiplayer part of the game is not fun and a complete cashgrab.If you are playing alone ( without friends ) you are going to have hard time and it will become super boring really soon. In addition the community is absurdly toxic which completely kills all the fun. If you are interested you can read other reviews and search the internet for more points on topic.2nd. The fact that they have removed mods.Mods were one of the reasons why people brought this game for PC in the first place. Removing mods completely killed singleplayer as now after finishing the game you will have nothing else to do.In conclusion I want to say that there is no reason to buy GTA V anymore. You can simply pirate it or not play it at all because you won't lose anything. The game has been murdered by it's creators so now the only thing left is to not support them.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-16,0,0,474,False,Not Recommended,R* and Take Two Interactive are two of the worst gaming companies in this industry I can't say that for many other developers and publishers but here it is.Single player story modethe single player story mode was decently size with a good amount of side quests and plots surrounding it. There isn't much content otherwise when compared to other games that are open world. Of all the voices Steven Ogg's performance in this game was the most outstanding. In regards to mods they were the only reason a lot of people bought the games in this series. Most mods were created by people in the community to add content to alieviate the boredom of repetitive gameplay. Now that R* has taken that away and pretty much made it illegal to use means that I don't have a reason to play anymore. Online MultiplayerOnline multiplayer is the meat of this game all the gripes with GTA V and it's developers and parent company will be stemming from this half of the product. The online servers are infested with cheaters hackers griefers and anything ruining the game under the sun. Unfortunately for the players there are not only inefficient ways to notify support about these instances R* does not have any sort of medium to appeal to these reports.Shark cards are the pipeline in which the money travels to the pockets of the developers' pockets. The only way a person is going to make it in multiplayer is to buy these cards just to get around the abunance of griefers.ConclusionAround 17 years two guys made as mod for Half life. Now they have kickstarted the biggest tactictle FPS shooter for the PC series because Valve weren't complete,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-08,0,0,1211,False,Recommended,"Initially I posted this review to give a negative one due to what was at the time an absolute mess of a situation regarding script kiddies (NOT modders you consoletards need to learn to call them what they are we PC gamers know what mods actually are and we're sick of you trying to corelate modding with cheating) however a few things have changed.First off Rockstar managed to call off Take Two on the OpenIV shutdown which means singleplayer modding which is an awesome thing that should be encouraged is being treated as it deserves.Second off a NEEDED shutdown was applied to the actual online cheating services like Force Menu OpenIV etc. A lot of stupid neckbeards who made that trash lost their income which makes me very happy to watch them post videos crying about it and how they got chargebacks from the scumbags who use their tools. And the script kiddies lost major sources of their filthy cheats also had a lot to cry about.Thirdly a HUGE ban wave of cheaters and make no mistake they were all cheaters kicked off in the last couple days. You'll see lots of phony reviews along the lines of ""BOO HOO LEGIT PLAYER R* BANNED ME YOU SHOULD ALL NOT PLAY"". You should be insulted that they think you people who read these reviews are that stupid. Do they seriously expect someone as smart as you to think that without any proof at all you'll just accept at face value that they weren't a cheater? They're just butthurt they finally got their hand caught in the cookie jar and got the just punishment they deserve.All those steps aside this game does and probably forever will have a cheater problem in the online portion. However given the volume of effor that has been put into curbing it it has finally degraded from ""Unplayable"" to ""annoyingly high"" and the otherwise excellent gameplay makes up for that.",Grand Theft Auto V

Saying the reason they banned a SINGLE PLAYER ONLY mod was to stop hackers using it in multiplayer. HA good one guys. EVEN IF that were somehow true I don't see why they would instantly shut down the entire mod without even trying to work with its creators to fix the supposed exploit.REVIEW OF THE GAME IT SUCKSIf I'm honest they already lost me long ago when they released this full priced AAA game with microtransactions and provided MULTIPLAYER ONLY updates so players would either need to grind for hundreds of hours or pay up to use the new toys. The singleplayer in GTA V is seriously lacking in content. You can't even get the hydra jet in singleplayer without mods! Nope you can only buy it in multiplayer with $50 worth of in game cash. RIP fun.REVIEW OF MY FEELINGS (Well you know what? They can take all their games and stick 'em right up their **** and I sincerely mean that. I will not support anti consumer practices.

2017-06-21,0,0,193,False,Not Recommended,I came to GTA 5 late and only bought it because of the Amazing Mods shown on display on youtube. It s quite difficult to mod GTA 5 even with Open IV so I gave up on it. I also bought the game at full price even though they did a shady Price Hike and show it as reduced. Played the online bit. But heres how it goes when you join late. 1 There is hardly anyone playing. 2 It took me almost an entire day sitting in a lobby just to finish a single Heist as people drop etc... why? Because no dedicated servers. It s basically Peer to Peer and half the time people don t take heists seriously or they drop half way.3 The world is open but there are instances or missions you drive into. Overall it feels pretty empty.I would have recommended the game before I heard of this action. I mean I loved watching people test out LSPDFR and now theres just no point to playing the game. The reason they ban people is to reset your account so you buy more shark cards to get back to where you were. Otherwise grinding back up can be a mission. I ve never gotten banned but I ve not played all that much.I think developers have the right to protect their property but to be honest once you buy that property you should have the right to amend it for yourself. Like buying a car and swapping out wheels and rims. Either way the game is fun but rockstar and take two have chosen to simply dissallow players to enjoy their game. And this is 4 years down the road where even on their own pages they would highlight good mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-26,0,0,274,False,Recommended,After putting a fair few hours into this title and being new to the franchise I have decided to give my verdict.I love this game.I have had great fun on both the online platform and the single player. GTA 5 online is excellent fun with a group of buddies while completing heists or just generally arsing around. The single player is both engaging and tells an exellent and involving story. Both modes are beautiful by day and night and the port from console is un noticable.HEISTS are great fun with friends and are challenging when its needed. The hollywood action movie vibe is very well recieved and makes for a great experience WHEN IT WORKS.HOWEVERThe online matchmaking systems and navigation leave A LOT to be desired. Matchmaking is slow beyond function and there is very little options at the menu when starting up the online mode. More often than not it wil fail to join a session and throw me into single player. From here you will find a much better menu that lets you choose the type of lobby you wish to join.Waiting for players in heists takes atleast ten minutes MINIMUM which is outright unacceptable when there are still hundreds of thousands of people playing at any given timesort all of this out and you have the recipe for a great game!,Grand Theft Auto V

Nothing been done to fix hackers and moneyguns but you'll need them if you want to afford any of the new content.Heists are good but need some balancing. Spend half an hour lobbying get paired with randoms someone gets insta killed from a headshot and leaves. Repeat process. Wish you could Heist with less than 4 people.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-17,0,0,141,False,Recommended,If you were only going to buy one game to play on your PC then GTA V would be it.It truly is an audio visual masterpiece and a gorgeously beautiful game. The attention to detail especially the jokes is simply amazing. You can really tell that they had teams working on the environment (the real star of the show) for months on end. The city truly feels alive. The voice acting is spot on. The soundtrack is truly amazing and lends to the atmosphere.If the story wasn't enough the on line component caters to all kinds of shooter games and racing games and just sandbox mayhem in general so there really is something for everyone. The heists are perhaps the most unique aspect to multiplayer that I've ever seen and is a real blast to play with your friends.Best part of online is the hackers that insta kill everyone and hack another players name onto the deed. Sure fire way to get everyone banned!One thing is for sure... you are going to enjoy your new life in Los Santos.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,Game has an extremely good singleplayer story mode but they don't give a $hit about it anymore. They said they'd give us more dlc to expand on trevor michael and franklin's story back in 2014 but have done nothing. Instead they only expand on the online mode in which they give free dlc thats really not free. You have to rely on modding or other modders to get said money just to be able to buy anything from the dlcs or you can spend about $200 of your real money to buy shark cards to be able to buy all items from one dlc pack.The online play would be fun if you could use mods without getting banned and if rockstar would actually protect you from a$$hole modders that crash your game. Funny thing is Its really only playable if you have a mod menu that has built in protection to keep said a$$holes from kicking you from your game. The best part is before GTA V came to pc they said we could mod our game and then after like a month they started banning people for modding even if it was just a fov slider. If rockstar had actual servers and on said servers would implement some sort of protection service i wouldn't have a problem with them selling overpriced shark cards but because they blatantly don't give a $hit i'm fine with modders giving us free money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-22,0,0,84,False,Recommended,Pretty great game. Singleplayer is fun all around.However I will be focusing primarily on the online side of this game as that's what the majority of players will be doing.The freeroam aspect of the game is really fun but you don't really get that much money off of it and when you first start off you will probably feel very restricted getting cash isn't easy in this game so unfortunately a way to circumvent this is to pay up to Rockstar and buy a Shark Card and if you paid full price for the game it's not always worth spending much more if you don't play it that often. You could of course do heists but those aren't super fun if you don't have friends to play with and the payout is...okay. It's better than nothing though.All in all I'd give it a 7/10 for being really fun but there comes a lot of work that has to be done before you can really dive deep into the fun things like flying cars.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-25,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,Prepare to spend around $100 to actually get into the game (if you buy for half off at dot com) at this point as you've missed three expansions that all required massive time investments or buy in. All fun content is locked behind needing to buy warehouses or hangers to store the cool vehicles. The game is terribly balanced due to these cash grabs and absolutely nothing is being done about the hackers in every game.The ui bloat is a terrible mess and they did a crappy job of pushing open world content. It's hard to figure out what to do any any given point in time and the player base is split between newer open world stuff and launch day instanced missions.Finally the net code is an absolute show. Connecting to a single online game can take 5 10 minutes. There are also random disconnects going from instanced content back to open world. It's ten times worse with friends. The amount of bugs that require joining new instances make all of this even worse.Once everything does come together in an open world mission where players actually have a back and forth instead of one obliterating the other it's a fun game. Happens about 5% of the time though. Multiplayer was clearly an afterthougth cash grab which sucks.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-25,0,0,114,False,Recommended,I really enjoy this game for it's open world experience and co operative opportunity.

2017-12-25,0,0,326,False,Not Recommended,Well I was apparently stupider than what I had previously thought. Bought the game to play online with friends (for pc of course) and have gotten on and off over the course of a couple years now. Recently I began playing with the newfound addition of the doomsday heists and other content which has been added over the course of the past few months. Played the game heavy for approximatley two days and on Christmas Day no less I discovered after having completed a heist setup mission that my online bank had been cleared of over half of my earnings over that two day period. About 40 hours of my life wasted in building up money on this godforsaken game just to loose it all in either some glitch or through the vigalante style assault that Rockstar is fighting against Modders. Whether a mistake or Rockstar thinking I'm a modder I've no idea but I'm rather disappointed in having funded this ludicrous buisness when they are so anxious to punish those that made them what they are.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,220,False,Not Recommended,Play for the single player then uninstall it. Singleplayer has amazing storytelling with memoriable characters.Multiplayer is a glitchy poorly optimized and mostly troll based gamemode that was a micro transaction wet dream.And now that modding is illegal within the game makes the game kind of pointless to play.This game is seriously not worth the multiplayer money when it comes to using shark cards to get in game items that doesn't even matter. Not to mention the multiplayer missions are not even that great as well as the constant random disconnects from free roam servers and causing you to play with random people for only 10 minutes before you are forced to play with yourself.So do yourself a favor. Play the game for the people who poured their hearts and souls into a game to give you a great experience of what a next gen game looks like. But don't support a game mode where you have to use your own money or grind non stop with low earning missions to get what you want out of the multplayer mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

I recommend it.Horrible multiplayer experience (rampant cheating that can cost you as non cheater your game key micro transaction hell grindfest).But here is my definite downvote In preparation of monetizing (vulgo suck dry) the playerbase even more (shark cards anyone?) this is the first company ever to declare modding ILLEGAL. Yes you read correctly as of 5.6.2017 modding of the singleplayer experience was declared ILLEGAL. They started to send out Cease and Desist letters and took down the popular mod tool OpenIV already no kidding.Because if singleplayer gets nice funny content from ambitious people for free no one should have it apparently.Instead of taking on the rampant cheating and horrific experience in multiplayer. Or selling a DLC extending singleplayer.As a sane adult and on behalf of the OpenIV community it is my civil duty to give this a full hearted downvote. Insert many many .... many swearwords here. Unspeakable ones. You ** beep** ** beep** ** beep** fu**beep**ing pieces of **beep moth**beep**ers.What's even more worrying is the fact that this hellish publisher recently aquired Kerbal Space Program a title with a vivid modding community..yeah..right.I don't think so fellas.As of 16.6.2017 this title accumulated several thousend negatve reviews within a matter of hours. Serves them right. Because it is our voice that makes things count and decides on THEIR earnings. Unhappy customers?

Awesome.However I can no longer recommend this game since Rockstar has done nothing to curb the cheaters and hackers. As well as having very little in the way of closed session content. It appears that Rockstar has abandoned the game and any form of creativity. They seem too preoccupied with the idea that everyone wants to PvP. This is a common mistake by gaming companies. Why do I say that? Allow me to explain. With PvP the companies doesn't have to think about a story or do much. They simply make a map and a few item and let the kids kill each other. That's it. What is more disturbing is the number of children that think it's fun. They don't have to think about anything either they just run and gun. Sad when you think about.,Grand Theft Auto V

There are more than a few rough edges Memory crashes unless you use fail safe / low video settings Cheating. If R* would make GTA$ easier to come by this would be less of an issue First Person viewpoint isn't very smooth if you prefer FPS's. lots of charater jitter No joystick support for flying (except with a console controller)Plusses and minuses. For $60 it's worth a shot.*EDIT* I'm chainging my review for the following reasons Crashes a lot. This is probably due to errors in nVidia's 760GTX but GTA is the only game I have that dies when it occurs. Other games don't crash but keep going until the driver reloads (Win8.1) Cheating is RAMPANT. Rockstar only cares about cutting down on free cash ($GTA) and not on people who explode you for trying to complete freemode events or VIP challenges. Some of these things (having a campfire spawn on you and set you and/or your car on fire continuouly despite many deaths and respawns) are persistent until you reboot. Cheaters / Modders can also replace your ammunition with smaller amounts. This is persistent across restarting the game and can cost $100k to $200k when it occurs to buy it all back. Each. Time. Perhaps this doesn't bother R* since it menas more Shark Card sales for them... Flight controls for yaw are broken (large changes in direction for single movements) for planes if you're using a keyboard and have been so for 4 months. Helicoptors were also broken but are now fixed. The combination of the above has killed the fun for me. I will say I play GTA Online almost exclusively.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-24,0,0,255,False,Not Recommended,The game is great don t get me wrong online is fun with friends sometimes at least.This game is 100% pay to play. First you buy the game (when it s not on sale it s $60) then if you want to get any kinds of progress made you either grind for days on end find a nice modder to give you money or buy a shark card.The shark card system is a total scam by the way Take Two is just a bunch of greedy s and we all know it. If you don t care about being banned get yourself a mod menu like Epsilon or Infamous. It makes this game so much more fun and you can have money to do things instead of wasting money on shark cards.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-03-24,0,0,1702,False,Not Recommended,I truly loved this game both the campaign and Online especially having spent over 1000+ hours playing it seems ridiculous to say that I honestly have no interest in playing this game anymore. And sadly it's not due to the lack of quality of gameplay because I could have and would have spent another 1000+ hours more.While I may not have been affected personally by this recent incident with the unjust banwaves against longtime players and even ones who have just purchased the game but alongside past incidents of their faulty anti cheat system punishing loyal players and ignoring the ones who maliciously ruin the fun of others there is enough reason for me to believe that Rockstar will never truly get it right. Whether they do manage to shut down most of the cheat menus out there they've already unfortunately lost the fight against them by banning a large swath of their legitimate playerbase. Unless Rockstar changes their approach and just labels all the actual cheaters and let's the playerbase blacklist the ones we want to avoid Online will never truly be fixed.If you really want to purchase this game and play what it has to offer stick to the single player campaign but stay away from Online. As much of an annoyance and damage other players can do with cheat tools or not it's not even close to what Rockstar's faulty automated anti cheat system can do to you. And for a company that's earned a billion dollars not just millions but a billion it's laughable the sort of support they give to its players both in and out of the game in terms of keeping their servers safe from cheaters and ignoring appeals for unjust bans.,Grand Theft Auto V

What the hell they didn't appeal suspensions and they dont ing care if they are suspended for nothing. They are very selfish it is a big ing waste of money. You can't stop me for my foul language because everyone else also experience my experience not only me. If your a moderator from rockstar games I have to tell you something.

2017-06-22,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,Just throwing in my two cents with this review.First this is the best GTA game so far gameplay wise. I've had a ton of fun with the game and I think it is really well made.Unfortunately Take Two and Rockstar have decided that they no longer want to support the PC community. They have essentially banned modding for GTAV thereby rendering it a dead game after everyone has beaten it. There is an online component but at this point I see it as nothing more than a desperate attempt to keep making money.To summarize I enjoy the game a lot but if I had not already purchased it I would certainly not do so now. In fact as much as I enjoy playing it if I were still within the refund window I would refund this game because of the recent decision made by Rockstar and Take Two.(As a side note social club is completely pointless and should have never existed in the first place.),Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-12,0,0,193,False,Recommended,I can't speak on the Online Multiplayer as I've heard it is rampant with hacking but as far as the Single Player goes I loved it. There are definite control aspects of GTA that I've always thought were wonky and could be streamlined a bit however the Story the Gameplay and the terrific parody and exageration on life is great. I wish there were more heist parts of the story because setting up a heist just feels so satisfying especially when you put it in action. The characters as well as funny interesting and they're all holes so standard GTA affair. Trevor is best gril.Overall great single player campaign.,Grand Theft Auto V

Stating that 'modding GTA V is illegal' just restates the fact that Take Two and Rockstar don't actually pay attention to anything their consumers have to say. The creator(s) of OpenIV worked on it for ten years they weren't specifically targeting GTA online. There are ways to ban online modding without affecting single player. I would've recommended this game a week ago but since Take Two is giving me (and basically EVERYONE who plays single player on PC) a big ' you' I'm going to give them one as well.While I stated I don't think Take Two nor Rockstar will listen sign this petition for good measure.https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openivThat's all I have to say.,Grand Theft Auto V

Yes there is hackers on the game but it is still on my list for playing with my friends for some fun!Here are my Pro(s) and Con(s) of Grand Theft Auto V ( GTA V ) Pro(s) of Grand Theft Auto V Great Campaign Really good story plot Online is so much fun with friends You can get laid ( for all you 9 year olds that means sex ) The cars are very fun to drive and have sex in I really really really like how I could transfer my progress from my Xbox360 GTAV to my PC!! I mean now I am right back where I was and still messing with my freinds!! Graphics are just amazing! The cops have some sort of intelligence in them. Your car does not flip when you hit a little street rock anymore Strippers are hot Lap dances turn me on I get that feeling when you're getting laid that your character is only doing anal / You can now do online heists with your buds!! Pretty easy to get money hard but pretty easy at the same time Good music Fun for messing with your buds! A very great game for having a good time Con(s) of grand Theft Auto V Rock star the makers of Grand Theft Auto have been getting a lot of lawsuits filed on them for the reasons listed * Using music with out the artists consent ( 67% of the music in the game ) * Using pictures of celebrities without their concent * Making a NPC of a women who did not give her consent. But the lawsuit was dropped Hackers are a big problem but not as bad at MW3. Hacker or Modders help me through things and are some what nice The lag is some what of a problem but it is not that bad. When I do a 2 star crime sometimes it give me 4 stars and it has given me 5 stars before. So just a bug issue. Fix some bugs in the game Some of my money did not transfer through to my PC but whatever ( Transferring issues ) To many ing little kids on the game,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-29,0,0,731,False,Recommended,Campaign is great as I'm sure most people reading this will have heard. Would be nice if some new DLC missions for single player came out which rockstar hinted at a while ago before noticing microtransactions for online.Online is great fun getting a tad quieter over time but it's still unlikely you'll be in a lobby with under 10 others. The freemode events add some variety which was missing in the initial launch of the game whilst playing online whilst in freemode as there is now a goal and an oppurtunity to make money if you commit time to it.The other online game modes vary depending on what you like but I find some are good others are really poor but it depends on what interests you in a game.The use of double cash and RP rewards on varying game modes means that at least one game type has a good number of players in it and it's very easy to make $100 000 + in a couple of hours using these.Whilst everyone complains about the cost of items in the FREE new DLC's I think it gives the players with millions in the bank something to aim for and I'd be bored if a new supercar came out for $10000 as it's too easy.Overall I'd say it's a very rewarding game with a huge amount of variety for racing/ sports/ shooting.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-16,0,0,267,False,Recommended,Well GTA V is one of the best games I've played in a while. Online is taking up most of my time. When Rockstar announced GTA V in 2013 I was already planning on getting IV. But V screamed to me more. And it's still as amazing as it was 3 years ago. The multiple console releases would prove that. On story mode alone you can do almost anything Heists steal cars go on a killing spree. But online is where it's at you can stick up stores do heists buy houses buy boats and go on killing sprees...

But whenever you play online you happen to run into a lot of hackers seemingly underaged kids spamming the voice chat and modders. Really ruins the fun most of the online time if you're unlucky you cannot even play because some modder kid hooks some weird type of perma explosion on your butt and Rockstar games seemingly cannot do much about them.There's also no option to join only mod free online game sessions.Very good single player or friends only game. Online function is hacker flooded. Very recommended but not recommended online until they got rid of those cheaters so best to wait a bit or better Gather enough friends to play in friends only sesssions.

Definitely worth a try.What lies beneath singleplayer is GTA Online great concept as a sandbox but very poorly implemented one. With every new addon to GTA Online Rockstar forces people to grind or to invest into Shark cards. It would've been OK but they simply don't do anything about griefers and cheaters.Players are forced to grind in public sessions where griefers could appear any moment ruining the gameplay and wasting the most precious resource the time. This situation fits well Rockstar's greed for Shark Cards money. They should've made this option subscription based and reduce the grind drastically instead they just add more.All this while being incapable to deal with actual cheaters. You won't establish new track record for a 3 minute race for example just because some asshat used cheat to ""beat"" the race in 10 seconds. Although that's technically impossible to do those players weren't punished in any way nor they were removed from high scores.

2017-06-23,0,0,318,False,Not Recommended,Banning the use of openIV seems like such a bad move. Being able to mod the game offline probably added a good 100 hours playtime and enjoyment of this game for me. Look at what bethesda has done with the remastered skyrim and activily encouraged that practice and I certainly have a more positive view of the company and their games now and I would consider that as forward thinking. Possibly this contrast makes me feel that this move is even more backwards than I would have anyway. This game has been good there is no arguing that but as a consumer I will be more wary of buying future rockstar games and will not only be showing my opinion with this review but also will likely be expressing it with my money in being more reluctant to buy those future games. I am also extremely sure that those who use mods in the online community will have only barely been slowed down by this move.

2015-04-27,0,0,797,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer is great but multiplayer is cancerous garbage with mechanics straight out of grindy mobile gaming Take Two is also intentionally ing over the SP by banning mods and not adding the new content to SP so that you have to buy their shark cards to play with the new content thats only in MP (Or you could grind for 6 hours for a single car/bike).I already gave you $60 why can I not play the game that I bought the way I want to play it.

2017-06-16,0,0,167,False,Not Recommended,Look when this game first came out even the first year this game was great. And really overall it ia an amazing game but recently the game has been crippeled serverly and i'm not just talking about the OpenIV ban yeah that was a really horrible thing that take 2 did. But I have more problems with the game then just the banning of singleplayer mods (which is absolutley bogus by the way) I don't even understand WHY they would ban singleplayer mods. Like really?But the problems with this game don't just stop there. Well let's just say the online mode is COMPLETELY F***ED.Why? Well let's see here. How about getting banned for no reason? How about the online support being not helpful at all and not caring at ALL if you get banned for false reasons? What about some modder just walking in dropping you a ton of money or modding your level WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT. And whoohooo you get BANNED. You wanna know WHY people MOD? CHEAT? BOOST ACCOUNTS?BECAUSE THE ONLINE IS GRINDY AS F**K THAT'S WHY all Rockstar and take 2 want is their money. Their SWEET SWEET PRECIOUS MONEY.That's all they care about I mean it's not like the game literally made over 2 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SALES IN THE FIRST WEEK.But yet they still FORCE you to buy sharkcards to get any of the cool new stuff that they release in the game.and they put NONE OF IT in the singleplayer.... yeah.At this point if you've already gotten the game before back on Xbox 360 or PS3 when the game first came out don't buy it on PC. You won't get any benefit out of it at all sense their is no longer any mod support.Rockstar and Take Two really had a great game here. But they shot it in the foot for no reason.Unless you haven't played the story mode before DON'T BUY THIS GAME. The online isn't woth it anymore sense you literally have to spend HUNDREDS of dollars in real life cash to get anything without playing the same money missions about a million times.,Grand Theft Auto V

Really loved it can't wait for more uptades!EDIT OK I think that I can properly judge the online part of the game as I have over 650 hours. Every dlc is EXACTLY the same. The olny difference is that with every dlc you have to pay more real life money to be able to get the full experience. I mean ok I understand that they somehow must make money bit I believe that if those dlc were not free both the community and the items would be better. With every dlc they add new weapons (personally i dont know anyone who uses more than 2 rifles the heavy sniper the RPG and the AP pistol) new vehicles (and because it is GTA all vehicles are similar) with customization that costs an extraordinary amount and the same jobs re made with another name and different vehicles. Ok R* you want money but I do not want to play a repetitive game hours of grinding just to buy a car and almost impossible to play the game alone.At this point I actually do not know how to rate the game so I will leave the ""thumbs up"" but I am not sure if this game is worth the amount you will pay.2015 10/102017 6/10",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,336,False,Not Recommended,I like the game but the online is nothing but micro transactions and none of the online content is available in single player. Rockstar never properly dealt with the online hacking problem and probably never will and most people who get banned did nothing wrong. The bans are usually permanent and in most cases even video evidence will do nothing to change that. The only real way of making money in online is through buying shark cards and aside from that all other options are either a grinding hell (The best heist for money gives an average of half a million dollars and takes several hours to complete) or are physically impossible because of other people destroying your cargo. I give the single player an 8/10 but the online has a 70/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,96,False,Not Recommended,"GTA5 is one of those games that you praise doing a lot of things right but still cannot get past the things they did wrong. I am aging myself here but I grew up with this series and the past two games have drifted further and further away from what I liked about it.First off the goodThe game has been rock solid since the first week update something I was incredibly skeptical about given Rockstar's previous PC releases. I bought GTA4 and I can't even play it. They even went back and made GTA SA unplayable after the fact. GTA5 though has given me no issues on my 5 year old machine. For 60GB game I expect tons of slow down and more bugs but it never happened.The visuals are also pretty good. I can tell Rockstar has dropped the silliness and is pushing for realism which is actually one of my gripes. But being objective they did an excellent job with shadowing and the world was highly detailed as well as aesthetically pleasing. The buildings were crisp with a good amount of life given to them from spray paint tags signs and a fair bit of grime depending on where you were all of which were smooth and clear. The textures on the people were only okay but the mocap looked good. The landscapes appeared vast and lush and the mountains felt very prominent.I played this game with a controller and it was nice to feel the vibrations from the road while driving. It kind of annoyed me at first but then I got used to it and it seemed to compliment drives especially over bridges. I also think it reflects just how much detail was put into the game which is great but...The bad Rockstar has started moving away from what made the GTA series so great which is the absurd ridiculousness of how the protagonist goes from nothing to something. The parody diminished in all things except watching TV but I didn't buy the game to sit in a virtual house and watch fake TV while I sit inside a real house and look at a monitor.The ridiculous stuff is what made ""go to A and kill B"" fun instead of arduous. In that regard the only character who had that going for him was Trevor and why I believe Rockstar went with the three character choice thing. Not many people can relate to Trevor and both Franklin and Michael were mostly boring Michael to a lesser degree. Those who want what GTA once had now have to play Saint's Row.The radio seemed uninspired which is sad because it was one of the biggest highlights of the game since GTA3. Rockstar seemed to put more effort shoehorning Lazlow into missions than maintaining a key element to the game.Conclusion If you've never played a GTA game before you'll probably love this game.If you've been playing this series in succession since it began you'll probably not be satisfied by the story or characters except for a handful of moments. Not to say GTA1 or 2 had a stellar story or character but the absurdity carried it up until 3 and I hate to see it go.",Grand Theft Auto V

On top of that Grand Theft Auto V has had many problems with hackers on its online servers that it does not seem to want to fix and the apparent banning of completely innocent players that causes me to continue to not recommend this game.B) If the cease and desist is not being rescinded and OpenIV is not coming back then I cannot change this review to recommended.

2017-06-23,0,0,1291,False,Not Recommended,As a fan of the series since Vice City I found the single player aspect a lot of fun. The lead characters are entertaining the detail of the world is incredible and the missions are generally great especially the big heists. However the online component of GTAV is simply a disaster. It seems obvious Rockstar is far more interested in getting people to buy Shark Cards and pay for premium vehicles bizarre clothing and weapon skins than making sure it's a well managed and competently crafted experience. I'm not against paying a little extra to customize a character's online appearance but you've got to put a reasonable amount of effort into making sure the core gameplay isn't broken before expecting myself and others to pony up extra which is obviously their expectation. My advice Next time don't bite off more than you can chew. Most of these troubles could have been avoided with better planning and putting some effort into maintaining a decent relationship with the player community. Here's a wacky idea Maybe release a single player game (with mod support) and online game (properly supervised) separately.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-13,0,0,302,False,Recommended,"Fourth edit https //www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/6j3y1o/openiv_updated_its_back/Seems like things are back to normal. I would still like to see more support for the modding community and maybe a bit less pushing shark cards or grinding while having very little fun. That and the add ons should *really* just come to singleplayer. It'd make the game a lot more fun. And as I've said before not needing to log in to play singleplayer would be great.As for performance I've since upgraded my graphics card to a Fury X Nitro and it plays nicely. My CPU cooling was also upgraded. It's decently smooth.Probably my third edit https //www.youtube.com/watch?v Kgd7AfbYyI0&amp feature youtu.beRuns great on my computer (was built to game but is getting older (I have a 7880 2GB just above the recommended)) but I could get better preformance in this game. I have to play around with the graphics settings just a bit but it's fine for now. Plays well with no crashes even testing with a 360 controller (yeah I played it on console now can't use KB&amp M for this game because it doesn't feel right). The first person is pretty good the extra music and car customization is pretty cool and THANK JEEZOOZ THERE IS AN OPTION FOR CUSTOM MUSIC AGAIN!So far I've only played 1.1 hours but I plan to find my graphics settings that I need and port over my old characters. And also play online. Waaaaaaayyy too much online.EDIT I now use KB&amp M for a lot except for driving/flying. Fun.Hackers need to be taken care of though. WAY too many of them and I fear it may soon ruin the game.EDIT2 I like AND hate that there's returning player only stuff. I LIKE it because I bought it for 360 and I have the special version. I HATE it because my friends can't have the same stuff AND I can't buy some of it because it says ""Price invalid."" for stuff I am supposed to be able to have AND for stuff normal players can pay for where I get it for free (in game money). Sucks.Updates are great. You get a ton of free content but some is only online for some dumb reason. From the Beach Bum update to the Business Update the ones inbetween that and the Heists Update (were there any?) the Lowriders update (eww at the high prices yay at the new stuff) and soon a new one coming out two days from now. The only complaint I have is that the stuff is really expensive R* obviously wanting you to either devote tons of time to the game OR probably more likely buy their Shark Cards. And the expense wouldn't be a problem for me except they don't give you high pay missions hell even the heists are hard to get money out of quick (to buy anything AND have fun). I found myself burning myself out on this game the last time I played grinding the same mission over and over again. Also the money situation isn't helped when they have nerfed pay multiple times for missions.Edit More stuff. I've heard of people being screwed over by bad sport which seems to not work unless it's a very specific one person of few people. Then someone goes after them with an armored karuma and they fight each other but when the person blows up the karuma with a grenade THEY get put in bad sport. Which is stupid.Hackers! Yeah they've overrun the game and R*'s awful supposed anti cheat system. P2P servers like they have suck and if they go with that system really saving on the cloud servers of R* they're basically trusting people to not just go and edit their stats and stuff. It doesn't work you get awful connections there's problems and I constantly connect with people living in China and Russia. Which I don't have a problem with but you can't even see their chat it's just squares. And I have the language packs. It's also laggy. Really laggy.I can't connect to servers easily. The servers are slow to connect I get cannot connect errors tons of times and there's NO WAY to go directly into an invite only server. Frustrating. Oh and when you try to connect you get servers that people leave and no one ever gets auto joined to you it doesn't merge and I've had servers where in invite only someone joined (console version no clue who they were) and other times (PC console) there were cars of players sitting around. No reason why. It's a mess.Oh also taking down the devs of FiveM or whatever it was that's ing awful. Sending people to their door not creepy at all.Another thing. Why do we have to be ONLINE to play ing SINGLE PLAYER?! ing hell learn from the PC port of GTA IV.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,468,False,Recommended,The game itself is a good port. Runs well on modern machines. Once you complete it however it becomes rather..well all the same stuff. Online is not for me. Its full of trolls and angry gamers just looking out to destroy your car or kill ya when they can. Sure RS has done what they can to stop the negativity but its just not that fun. Recently Take Two the publisher ticked off the entire modding community by threatening (legally) the OpenIV team. Many of us were ticked and the backlash/outcry put over 50k negative reviews about the game. I was one of those people. It felt like a stab in the back. Modders were not the problem its the few jerk hackers out there that just had to mess with the online part. Rockstar worked with the publisher to get them to relax some so hopefully mods return soon. Final note? The single player campain is great. Challenging fun and the story is fantastic. The online part while kinda fun for me ended up on a sour note due to hackers plus just outright rude nasty toxic players. Its worth the money in the long run but well ill be very wary of Take Two from this point on.,Grand Theft Auto V

It would be nice if Steam would allow people to turn off Auto Update or choose when to update. Because of this I will not be downloading any new games via Steam until such time for this to be an option. What took months to mod my GTA V was destroyed in a matter of 10 minutes with Auto Update. This should be an option for the owner of the game not something forced by the company it was purchased from.

2015-05-04,0,0,665,False,Recommended,There is a lot of content being presented here. Let me start by saying the single player alone is worth it! It's an extremely long and rich story with funny and relatable characters. When your bored of the main game it's an excellent physics simulator. If you're interested in the multiplayer I would bet that is what is responsible for the mixed reviews. To be totally honest I'm not surprised. Multiplayer in this game is one of those things that starts off great but slowly and steadily gets worse and worse. From the game encouraging greifing to game breaking bugs to absolute toxic sociopaths that will dog fight you with absolutely no gain. The game puts no effort to combat it's horrid community but instead encourages it. Unless you want to be in passive mode (at that point why are you even playing). It's only really fun when everyone in a session agrees to be friendly. Which is like winning the lottery because one bad apple ruins an entire session. Plus hackers are still a HUGE issue I'm kinda shocked that years later and I still run into at least one hacker almost every time I play. Some of the design choices for online are half thought out and horribly implemented into the game.It feels like it purposely weights on you so you are impulsed to buy shark cards and the phone is basically used for pop up ads when your not in a job. The online has certainly been created by their B or C team.Overall i encourage you to get this for the single player for sure! If you're mostly looking to get it for multiplayer maybe wait for a sale. It's still a fun game to play with friends but it's basically useless for solo players unless your a sociopath that loves to dogfight.,Grand Theft Auto V

Mods. GTA Online however is a massive pile of microtransaction laden horse excrement and Take Two and Rockstar have not recognised that pushing more and more updates that only add to the slog are not the cause of this longevity but is quite possibly the actions that end up killing the Online community.&lt /excerpt&gt That is all.

Singleplayer has a good story with interesting characters and a lot to do on the side. (still waiting for singleplayer expansion though)Game feels pretty nice to play. I never used KB&amp M controls so I don't have much to say there. Viehicals are fun to drive and to do crazy with. The game allows you to do whatever your heart's content is within a sandbox world's jurisdictions. Multiplayer/GTAonline GTAonline is a blast! The game is really fun to play with your friends because just like the singleplayer there is still tons of that you and your friends can get into.There is something that I'm really not a huge fan of though. That would be GTAonline's micro transactions... yes there are literal micro transactions. They are called shark cards. Spending real money in exchange for in game currency in the online mode. The worst thing is is that since these exists they take advantage over the new updates for the game. Every update adds incredibly expensive items for you to buy (they get more and more expensive as the updates come) therefore pushing you to buy these cards so that you can enjoy the new content. With Rockstar making bank from the micro transactions I feel as if this makes them very lazy in terms of pushing out singleplayer expansions.""",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,149,False,Not Recommended,I have played the GTA series since GTA2 and I am completely destroyed by Rockstar's decisions lately. It is mostly Take Two's fault but I truly blame Rockstar as they developed the game into a pay to win sp mod and our customer show. GTA is what it is today because people mod it on PC. MTA and SA MP made GTA.It's pathetic. I trusted this company and was proud to support it for over 12 years. Now I don't know who to trust to make quality games that care about what their userbase wants in this industry.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,0,0,467,False,Not Recommended,"First and foremost I want to say this post is a little vulgur and I have **** out the cursing. Also this is quite thought out so there is a lot to this review. Also if I say T 2 I'm referrring to Take Two. So here it goes.... Well.... GTA 5 is f*****. I mean personally I loved the game. I got it on PS3 PS4 and PC. I Pre ordered the game TWICE (PS4 and PC) for christ sake and waited 10 times longer than the original release dates. I spent over $300 on the game itself and the microtransactions that is Shark Cards in GTAO. The only reason I got the PS4 version was because it now had first person which was unreal for a GTA series game. And then with the PC version not only because of the astonishing graphics that can be achieved with a great computer but the fact of mods. I sat head over heels waiting for OpenIV and ScriptHookV to be an official thing. Modding GTAIV with LCPDFR and other mods was my life so to speak and couldn't wait to see it in the next gen game.But then someone decided to be a prick and mod online and ultimately finger f*** every PC player they have. OpenIV had NOTHING to do with the problem. And they EXPLICITLY STATE that they DO NOT CONDONE OR SUPPORT ONLINE MODDING. I tried to launch online with mods installed just to see if it would work and sure as the world OpenIV gave me an error stating something to the effect that mods were in place and couldn't be used in online. And the sad thing is the OpenIV team hasn't made a dime from the mod itself. The only thing they're getting out of it is enjoyment because they want mods in the game just as much as we do. And yet they're the one getting shafted....Rockstar didn't have the gonads to just ban the guy who made the illegal mod and call it a day they whined to Take Two that a singular guy was giving them fits...and what does T 2 do???? They send a f****** cease &amp decist (hope I spelled it right) to OpenIV and do absolutely NOTHING to the chap that made the illegal mod. R* had ONE option and that was to contact the guy and tell him to take the mod down or criminal charges would be enforced. Sounds pretty simple for a Billion $$ company that has a Top 5 best selling game. But no they want to do it the hard way. They came up with this insane idea everything went how it went and now they are suffering from it.Because they don't make a dime off people in the single player they force everyone to online and that's where the money is made. And because the mods and that ""5M Reborn"" server (or whatever it was called) is competition to them and their revenue they shut all competition down. For a Fortune 500 company they're making enough money no need to suck anymore life out of their own people just to see another penny.I have like 1 100 hours on record I think and I haven't played a minute in the last 3 months. Mainly because I just lost interest (American Truck Simulator The Long Dark Payday 2 and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege are some bomb a** games btw that have taken the place GTAV had in my days playing my PC). But now why would I play? I never play online I play strictly for Single Player Modded. If I don't have that then good riddens to ya. I'll be d****** if I fork over another penny to Take Two or any affiliates because clearly I spent $300 too many as it is. It especially hurts ny feelings because of how loyal I've been to the GTAV progression. H*** I could've used that money for parts on my Jeep or towards a new graphics card (which I already have a GTX 980Ti but you get my point).The way I see it they caused more problems than they solved. It could've went smoothly and nobody even know what happened. But what they did was karma...and it came back to bite them. They're so greedy that they'll risk losing every PC player and then some just to squeeze a few extra bucks into their pockets. If OpenIV didn't shut down T 2 and R* could've easily got a $1 Million lawsuit out of them because courts would rule in favor of the big company not the small business of 6 guys. But back to the karma it's showing. Look at the reviews on Steam. As of writing this I have some some stats to show you. I also tabulated the %'s for perspective ((Keep in mind the numbers I am presenting are NOT equating my review itself although my review would add to the negative side of the spectrum))Of recent reviews (32 351 in the last 30 days) ony 15% or 4 852.65 people gave it a positive review making it Overwhelmingly Negative. (27 498.35 gave a negative review)Of total reviews (221 839 user reviews) 70% or 155 287.30 people gave it a positive review making it Mostly Positive. (66 551.70 gave a negative review) The 66k factors all time so the 66k 4.8k would mean that from April 14 2015 to May 17 2017 61 699.05 users gave a negative review. And the thing is of the 4.8k who downvoted in the last 30 day some of them were before this incident so it is hard to make heads or tails of exactly how many people downvoted after this incident.My whole reason for laying this out is to try and show that there is a backlash from what they did. And as the recent reviews go up the overall standing of the games rating will go from mostly positive to neutral or worse. This game used to be Overwhelmingly Positive in both review categories and now look at it. The 61.7k people who didn't like the game prior had no effect on how many people loved the game. But now tables have turned nobody is giving them any wiggle room as downvotes are showing.Hopefully people see this as a sign and hopefully that sign will backlash at T 2 and R* and will get them to fix their own problem. Becuase here's the thing. If people see the completely negative reviews to the game and see why they aren't gonna want to consider buying GTA or any other T 2 game because they will see the T 2 deveopers as who could give a fly swat about their own players. Me personally the only T 2 game I got is GTA but I would suggest not playing ANY T 2 game or BUY any T 2 game so that their play counts and sale revenue drops. That I believe would be a wakeup call to them. A Fortune 500 billion $ company losing revenue by making a deficit in $ and players is not got and won't be on the list for long. And to add to it this delimma will always be tagged to T 2 and R*'s name like Baggage hosted by Jerry Springer ).So when I say I don't reccommend the game I say it because of what they've done to the game for modders. Other than that 10/10 would reccommend...but killing modding....WRONG DECISION. They on the wrong people. They on their own lifeline. If nobody is buying the games they have nothing to stand on they'll implode and go bankrupt like Sears Holdings (KMart and Sears). We are what makes or breaks the company....Think about that...............................................Thank you for reading this verrrrrrrryyyy long post )EDIT Nevermind the part about me saying how much time I spent in game. It's like 241. And then I somehow got 0.3 in last two weeks. Guess it was from trying to lauch the game when the gunrunners update came out in which it kept crashing on load with no mods loaded.

2017-06-17,0,0,506,False,Recommended,"I love this game. This is gonna be hard.GTA V as a game is a masterpiece. Great graphics and perfromance great story great characters and voice acting and although GTA Online is flawed in many ways it's really fun with friends and I still play it usually everyday even after 2+ years. That being said TakeTwo interactive the publisher is one of the worst and greediest in the industry. Their DRM is nothing short of cancer it's slow terribly written and it has many times prevented me from accessing my game due to some form of stupid ing reason that I can't even being to understand. That is only one of their vices. Their neglect of the PC community the re(re re...)releasing the game 3 times on for maximum profit their shady behaviour on the so called ""Shark Cards"" ignoring the ""cheaters menaces"" of GTA Online PC that gripped the PC Online community banning of unguilty people and their unresponsiveness afterwards and now the cease and desist order for an innocent modding tool OpenIV (which I don't personally use BTW) has long stained their reputation. So Although I personally love this game and don't really use mods and I urge people to not buy any TakeTwo games until they change their behaviour towards their customers specially the PC community. All in all GTA V single player VERY HIGHLY recommonded. GTA Online recommended. GTA V published by TakeTwo NOT RECOMMENDED. I do NOT recommend this game unless TakeTwo hears our voices.UPDATE Now that TakeTwo has taken cease and desist order against OpenIV down I can kinda recommend this game.

2016-01-06,0,0,223,False,Recommended,So I have been playing GTA since very first game. And I have always liked them. They are forerunners of all open world sand box games. And when GTA V was introduced I was thrilled. I haven't had console since Playstation 2 so I had to wait this for pc and boy it was worth it!Game itself is so large. Mainly because there is actually no limitations about what you can do. GTA Online is one of the best things I have experienced in online gaming. Massive world and so much things to do. Only problems are huge ammount of loading screens (never seen this much loading in any game) and constat stream of hackers/modders/exploiters (you will see hacker at least once a day and it can ruin gaming experience).Especially with friends this game is awesome. It allows so much things to do what is not acutally missions (dirt bike driving flying with planes and doing stunts street races mayhems in the downtown collecting beautiful collection of cars etc)So should you buy this game? Yes. It is 60 game but it also kinda contains dlc pass.. you know that ugly feeling when EA releases new dlc with two guns and one map.. well you don't get it in this game beacause all dlc are free (so far).So if you want to experience mad missions and awesome story and characters in story mode or you want to bring cahos or just chill with friends online.. this is the game for you!,Grand Theft Auto V

Plenty of people complain about the expensive stuff and that micro transactions are the only way to get them but I have made plenty of money (if however boring) by grinding through missions alone on hard. They want things easy they can pay. I do things the hard way but it's free and the reward feels more fulfilling. I'll keep playing this game till GTA VI for sure.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-16,0,0,345,False,Not Recommended,The horrendous company known as Take Two Interactive has just killed one of the essential tools for modding GTAV. Take Two Interactive is pure evil and the things they've been saying about microtransactions is awful Take Two literally thinks that customers SHOULD give money for everything and nothing in a game should be free. They actually want to cut GTAV down as much as possible and sell each little piece for as much as possbile.Take Two is the reason for why singleplayer GTAV has received no updates they want to force everyone into GTA Online so they can squeeze money out of you. GTA Online is a total failure and most people agree on this Take Two has taken notice in population drops and are now trying to cripple singleplayer in an attempt to force players into multiplayer.Suck a fat one Take Two! Rockstar can also go feck themselves for allowing this to happen!,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,After about 300 hours combined on the playstation and the computer several replays of the main mission and quiet some time in the online mode I can only say that this game itself is awesome. The story is intriguing with more than the lame one dimensional character the graphics are beautiful the engine works perfectly the sound is really good and I love the open world of San Andreas.So why am I NOT recommending this game?Well first off because of the fact that R* is only focusing on the online mode now as it is its easiest cash cow so far.Seriously you have to either grind for way too much monotonous hours to get to the fun parts of the mode (cars places the whole CEO part etc.) or have to pay nearly the same amount of money you already spent on the game for CashCards.The community is pretty much done at this point. There are way too many modders and hackers while innocent people who got money running away from a modder get banned for over a month?Then there are a lot of annoying people outside of the hackers/modders who just drive around mindlessly in their nearly indestructible car chasing you just for fun and killing you over and over again.Yes you could go into passive mode but this will disable a lot of main parts of the game or you could switch the session you're in which will then take way too long just to load into next lobby where you finally realize there are even more of those kids.One of the worst things about this game at this very moment is the policy of Take Two Interactive. I get that you don't want people to mess with your code or your game but seriously stop some modder who actually does something good to the game? This is some 2006 We're in 2017 now you should be greatful that there are people still enhancing the gameplay expierence of the singleplayer mode because you clearly stopped caring about it no matter how many times you've promised us more content for the SP.To make it easy + Singleplayer Online mode Take Twos policy the whole focus on the online mode the left alone singleplayer which promised so much more,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-18,0,0,401,False,Not Recommended,This was a game me and a friend would play for hours on end together. Originally we both had it on the ps3 logging in a crap load of hours and generally having a lot of fun playing survival and exploring the world.When I first purchased this game the single player kept me hooked for a long while. Once all the missions were done and I had my fun post single player it soon became stale to me.Luckily there are mods that can help remedy the single player's staleness. However Rockstar truly should have invested in more singleplayer post main game content. When you finish the game between one of three of the endings there truly isnt much left to do once the side missions are done and out of the way and you've killed your millionth guy.After I had thoroughly enjoyed the single player aspect of the game I went on to multiplayer which is where me and my friends story began. He especially played it nonestop levelling up was addictive for him and the unlocks were fun. Survival was addictive especially with its cooperative aspect.For a while it was fun. Then he had begun to play less and ultimately I had gone to my PC once the port came. Singleplayer was again very enjoyable to play through but the same issue of staleness occured post game.I went to multiplayer and failed to move my character from the ps3 account I had to the new account I had accidentally made on pc. Dont ask.Again there was some fun in doing random missions/survival/roaming but immediately I realized the fun was essentially over for me.Tl.drIf you like good gunplay have more than one friend to game with and have not yet checked this game out if you have the money to waste I say do it. Thing is this game wont last you too too long if you are looking for a singleplayer with missions to take on continously postgame. Multiplayer is good but for people like me we only want to play with friends.Overall I dont recommend this game in the long run. I might come back to it but the new Doom has definetely taken the spotlight for me in terms of outright fun and violence.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-01,0,0,146,False,Recommended,Note I am not very deep in single player nor in Online play but i do have 7 hours of experience to say i know a bit or two.GTA 5 is a open world sandbox game which has 2 very core components Single player and GTA online which is almost a seperate game. I will not be covering GTA 5's base game as its well done but i havent done much. GTA Online is fun to an extent but terrible in other extents. It is hard to make a decent amount of money without forming your own team as randoms are random in skill but more often than not you get put in with the most downright awful people who cant do objectives worth a damn resulting in a very very low payout no RP (as in repuation like Levels) etc. meaning you basically earned enough to cover the cost of ammo and armor but thats it. Now when you do complete a mission you may make 30K or more which is good enough until you realise alot of the good stuff is over 100K. Its annoying. However the gameplay is fun.

2015-12-06,0,0,328,False,Recommended,EDIT A sectioned #/10 review for different sections of the game is at the bottom for your convenience. A great game to play with friends.It's a truly immersive sandbox with great mods great physics and so much detail it routinely blows my mind. Almost every day I play it I discover some new little thing that blows my mind and makes me feel like I'm playing the game for the first time again. Saying it's perfect would be lying but it's probably the best game in the series yet. Gameplay Everything feels fluid in this game. The world truly feels big without being so ridiculously large that you despise the thought of travelling from one end to the other. Cars handle well. New details both immersive and otherwise packed absolutely everywhere. Honestly when I think of this game I think of fantastic gameplay. 10/10Graphics/Visual Experience The level of attention paid to detail in this game is absurd bordering on Kojima levels at times. A lot of these are gameplay details but I'm putting it in the visual experience section because a lot of it goes on around you without your player affecting anything. The graphics are great already but if they're not to your liking there are tons of realism mods out there to keep you satisfied. This is another area in which Rockstar's ability to create an atmosphere really shines through. 9/10Sound Guns lack a bassy sound but when the rest of the world is made so perfectly noisy I'm willing to overlook such a misstep. Radio stations are better than ever and Self Radio makes driving fun if you don't like the stations already in the game. 7.75/10Replayability This is a game that's replayable because it's versatile. I've booted up this game because I've wanted to race because I wanted to play a biking game because I wanted to shoot things because I wanted to explore an open world. It does all of these and does them all equally well. For the moment this is one of the most replayable games I have in my library. 10/10How it Runs Quite demanding. It's not necessarily poorly optimized it just seems that R* is so focused on maintaining a visually impressive game that they don't want to offer too many options to crank it down.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,It was a good game at least before Take Two threw a hissy fit and launched their toys out of the pram and into orbit by practically banning mods for the game. Mainly since it let people get the additional multiplayer content added for 'free' in single player without paying for their stupid stupid shark cards. That or grinding for 10 hours just to grab one thing. I never really liked Online in the first place but this made sure I'll never return to it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-26,0,0,1176,False,Not Recommended,The endless grind of GTA V's multiplayer is what turned me off to it entirely. Literally the only thing to do is grind for money to buy more items and then show those items off for 10 seconds and find out that everyone else already has them because their mom paid $99 or whatever ridiculous price they go for $2.49 for a 100k shark card. You can't even enjoy killing other players in free mode because if you blow up anyone else's car you lose money if you blow up your own car you lose money if you get killed you lose money if you get killed by the police you lose money AND have to go steal your car back from them and get another wanted level OR you can that's right lose more money to get it back. There is absolutely 0 freedom in free mode and all the missions are really just repetitive grinds so you can earn money to buy stuff for the very unfree free mode. You can't even say the money and just go nuts because if you continue to blow people up (basically the main attraction of GTA online for most people) you end up in the time out corner for bad kids who thought that GTA online was for actually having fun and not grinding for virtual money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-28,0,0,238,False,Recommended,So Would I recommend GTA V On PC. Let's go from the ground up (in 3 parts Optimisation Graphics and Playabiltiy The Game itself and my overall thoughts) h The Game itself The story although short is VERY engaging. The game world is diverse and you can do a ridiculous amount of things... (except pool '( ) There's a reasonable amount of guns.. However if you've had it for as long as I have or have recently bought it (more aimed at online here) there's a brilliant selection of non level guns from DLC and updates which definitely make for a hefty arsenal. Online is relativity fun depending on you session. although HACKERS are a massive problem if you're not a fan of online then there is so much to do in free roam single player I don't even think you'd care. h Optimisation Graphics and Playabiltiy It's not the best running game of all time. I have a higher end PC and frame rate issues still ocur Loading times are an ernoious task. Online sessions often disconnect you and evryone else and you then have to finda new server (However I usually prefer the slow pace with just a friend or two in a closed session) Desyncronisation is very evident with alot of online activities especially the quicker activities For some reason cars are not able to reach their top speeds They are limited. My Entity XF for Example an 800$ car with nearly the same spent on upgrades reaches it's rev limitier only slight fter what looks to be 120mph on the First person cockpit view Controller suppot definitely makes the game more playable.the graphics are verrrryyy pretty on + HIgh settings or above just gotta watch for that frame rate drop h OverviewSo would I recommend it? The short answer is yes. If you're a long term GTA nut like me you've played every single one from the PS1 all the way to PSP and XBOX to PC definitely. Howver know these points. Rockstar are very cheeky when it comes to the way they treat their customers. (look at the summer sale fiasco). Their support is next to minimal. You need up to date drivers obviously on a larger card (i'd personally say over 2GB's VRAM) for a playable experience. A controller is definitely recommended. the menu's are very long winded. BUT It's a hell of a laugh good to hang around on awesome if you like cars guns murdering hookers at the crack of dawn. It's Pure Insanity. That's why I've come to love it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-19,0,0,41,False,Recommended,I am recomending this game only because on sales it drops half the price.Story very good and graphics good enough still not up to the expectation.Too many loading screen and the online has too many hackers.Also the online is full of s that attack you for nothing also ive lost the count on how many times a random 11 years old kid has ed my mom.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-19,0,0,586,False,Recommended,GTA 5 is really good game to play with friends family or meeting new friends. The best part in gta 5 is multiplayer for me however i hope there will be more heists and it will be really nice if you could make your own server just like GTA san andreas. The other stuff i want to write about is that the Rocket Star made a lot of improvements from gta 1 gta 2 to GTA 5 and I hope with other people that GTA 6 will be even more better to play and more fun. If you agree with my worlds ) give a 'YES' if you not agree with me just give me a 'NO',Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-22,0,0,950,False,Recommended,Fun game.Alright story.Decent missions Online.Subpar racing simulator. (Easy means it's also heavily limited for skilled drivers.)Bad engine. (Lots of bugs and bad interactions with physics but it runs well if that's what you care about I have a smooth 120 FPS with only a bit of stuttering sometimes.)Bad server update protocol for multiplayer. (Enjoy clipping people in the face and having them warp in 90% of sessions. Or having NPCs all over the session warp and have strange stiff physics almost every single session.)Terrible anti cheat. (Enjoy a hacker every few sessions. Although you can session hop or play Passive vote kick etc.)Useless first person.Great content updates.Maybe it's the shill cards maybe it's the sales maybe they're good devs but a lot of great fun updates are constantly kept up with lots of cars and clothes some guns and game modes.If it was a good shooter or driving game I'd be praising the devs for this.That all said public sessions are pretty worthless unless you want to be a CEO which is endgame stuff.You can do as I did and play solo or with friends in private sessions just fine.Other than that not a lot to say about the title itself without Online it's been there for quite a long time being a pretty popular and hyped/appreciated title.You can do practical and reliable reading about it outside meme steam reviews.,Grand Theft Auto V

Updates and dlc are free (PRAISE BE) multiplayer isn't exactly streamline if your doing missions with randos but bring a friend or two and problem solved making friends is easy step one kill a guy for no reason step two apologize if he takes it well then he's chill. Step three offer him a ride. Friend made hackers are sorted out quickly and quietly by either anti cheat or just helpful players no one I've met has been banned or kicked without reason graphics are great (if you have any lag at all just knock down texture quality one mark and reboot my buddy can play on a Dell laptop) Worth the but I picked it up for 60$ CAD about and worth every penny98/100 because preteens on voice chat,Grand Theft Auto V

Everything that you could do in the old games is still here plus way more. The campaign is by far the most in depth and intriguing storyline that Rockstar has made to date and they have an awesome ever changing always updating online mode that can bring you hours of gameplay. I do think the price tag is a little bit high since the game originally came out in 2013 BUT this is a game you will continue to come back and play time after time.

2016-07-28,0,0,1175,False,Recommended,Single player is amazing worth the buy just for that. However they have not released any new content for it. As for online sure it's free to play but you will have to invest a lot of time in repetitive missions and heists to make money at a steady rate. Rockstar has released a lot of new content for online. In my opinion there are too many different modes and not enough variety in Survival and the Contact Missions. They do offer the ability to buy virtual currency with you real currency.The replay value comes from the online mode. I was hoping for an immersive RPG experience. Realistically it's alot of griefing grinding and loading screens. The player base is mostly children and this being an adult oriented game I'm a bit appalled at Rockstar who seems to be catering to kids with the latest content update. Mods could make this game more enjoyable for many but it's not set up to where you can host your own server and modding online will get you banned. A persistent world would be more to my taste.My biggest complaints are the overly accurate bullet sponge AI and the armored cars. I'd like to see a more realistic approach to damage and AI (Cops swarming after a stealth kill on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere.) There are mods that address this but like I said for online it's a no go. For single player it can be more enjoyable but when you start stacking mods the game tends to break.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,"Take Two (publisher) is hostile to the modding community that made this game's online mode really special purely for profit which is strange when they've already milked the community dry with P2P servers / shark cards. Alongside that they've also never released the single player DLC that was anticipated and highly desired by the community instead releasing mini DLCs for online mode that you have to use in game currency to access properly again choosing the path of greed instead of ""delighting customers"" (their own words) by fulfilling their promises and retaining any shred of ethics. Add that to their years late and poorly optimized release of the PC version so that they could pressure fans to buy the game multiple times for that sweet profit and you are looking at a game warped by a corrupt publisher a perfect example of the lowering of ethical standards by some big names in the gaming industry.

2018-01-03,0,0,96,False,Recommended,GTA V is a great game. Yes it has downsides which i can get into later but it is simply a great game. The visuals are great it runs well and the actual core gameplay is very fun. If you have friends that play this game you should get it now. if you plan on going solo maybe you should wait for a sale. The online is also very fun my only problem being the microtransactions and insanely high priced items like vehicles and properties from DLC. I think it is very hard to get started without at least buying a shark card which shouldnt be a problem in a game like this. The game is now only about money to Rockstar. This being said i still think the game should be bought even if you don't plan on playing online. The story is great funny and long so prepare yourself.

I would also like to leave some honest opinions about the game It's visually stunning the cars are satisfying to drive the sound design and music is phenomenal. There are countless little things that keep drawing you back into the game. I definitely recommend this game in its single player state. Online on the other hand is frustrating time consuming and filled with aggressive people. But going back to the first hand online has been a wild ride of fun activities interesting friendships made wild and wacky adventures and exciting combative moments. The game is not without faults but my god do they put effort into the world they make. I may be kissing GTA V goodbye for now.

2015-05-19,0,0,700,False,Not Recommended,"The way Take Two Interactive has treated the single player modding community combined with the blatant push for absurd monetization featured in the online version of the game has forced me to rate this game negatively.Let me get this out of the way the base single player game is very good and extremely well polished.I agree that the single player modding ordeal is awful and that the actions taken by Take Two are awful for the modding community. While I have not purchased the game with the intent of modifying the single player game I see nothing wrong with doing so.Being a player who has spent most of their time on GTA Online I am extremely disappointed with the extreme prices of products featured within the game's more recent updates it's almost like the game's currency is balanced around the money dropped by hackers or modders or towards those who spend thousands of hours accumulating currency prior to updates. Regardless it's very clear that towards later updates the game has become more demanding of a consumer's money than before. The online game's current directive vision behind CEO based gameplay is a mess attempting to introduce the concept of mixed PvE and PvP combat yet providing lackluster rewards for both the PvP aspect and assisting CEO associates it's actually a blessing for a CEO to be isolated in a public session (CEO gameplay can only be initiated in 'public' sessions not private ones). The PvP gameplay especially seems to be focused towards griefing other players and nothing more no exciting rewards just a couple thousand bucks (in a game where the prices for purchaseable items are significantly higher). How backwards is that?There are a bunch more issues existing within GTA Online that I simply don't want to write about. Honestly the only reason why you'd want to play online is simply because you're bored and you want to play Grand Theft Auto with friends and to have a fun time. Good luck doing that with the insane amount of mindless grinding that you'll have to do to even achieve a sliver of the newer updates' ""content"" more mindless grinding.For newcomers still bent on playing GTA Online get as much modded/glitched/illegitimate currency as you can. Shark Cards are not worth the money. Don't even worry if it's taken from you a bunch of other modders will likely drop money for you regardless of whether you want it or not. A sense of legitimacy in this game means nothing just try to have as much fun as you can.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-12,0,0,262,False,Recommended,"I have played Grand Theft Auto V since the day it came out back in 2013 my opinion on then and now has changed ALOT. This game is probably the BEST... but it also could be the WORST game from Rockstar that i've ever played. But first lets discuss the ""Pros"" 1. The map is really great (Of Course).2. The single player campaign is awesome.3. Great Story.4. Likeable Characters and Npc's.5. You can change between 3 Protagonist (Franklin Michael and Trevor).6. Each Protagonist has their own ""Unique"" ability.7. The driving is better than in Gta4 (IMO).8. The gunplay and the introduction of a First Person Mode is awesome.9. The game looks really great especially if you have the hardware to Crank up the settings.10. The side missions are suprisingly really good. 11. Introduction of the director mode in pc.12. The modding community.13. Gta online's adversary modes (Recommended with friends).14. Gta online's Heist's (again Recommended with friends).there are more but i'm too damn lazy to write all of 'em.those are my opinions on the ""pros"". Now lets discuss the CONS.""CONS"" 1. GTA ONLINE2. HACKERS3. BANNING MODS? WTF?! (They have allowed it again but still...)4. Shark Cards5. The ""Community""6. Overpriced Items in gta online (especially in the newer updates)7. and finally it's Pay To Experience Everything/Pay To Get The Full ExperienceThere are more cons for sure but again i'm too damn lazy.In the end if you're looking to buy this game for the multiplayer. Play it with a friend because online solo sucks and the game is gonna be really grindy and in the end you wont have that much fun IF you're playing solo. But if you're playing with a friend it can be damn sure fun. but if you want to play the single player and never played the game before then you should buy this game because its worth it for the single player alone there are also alot of mods for the single player.

2017-06-18,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,The single player campaign Personally i thought it was slightly above average. The characters have great voice acting dialogues however some missions near the end didn't feel personal it's a lesser experience compared to GTA IV.The multiplayer I wonder why many play this i'ts awful. There is a cluster F*** of game modes which might sound good but it is quite difficult to find people playing the average deathmatch (maybe it was just me) and when you find you'll always play in player made maps which generally sucks with silly rules like a race with melee weapons and flying containers. Never got to play Heist because there are silly level requirements to host them which force you to play game modes that you don't like to level up or just play with a friend... BUT i just couldn't find other people to play in my friends hosted lobby.GTA O really feels like garrys mod in some aspects and i personally don't like it. And again going back to GTA IV the multiplayer was simple and lots of fun.In general i actually had technical issues with the game. When i first bought it i couldn't play thanks to the annoying micro stuttering i had and it didn't matter what graphical settings i had the game was unplayable still. Few months later the problem was minor and i was able to finnish the campaign and play online.And after the C&amp D against Open IV theres even less reasons to buy save your money.PS In the multiplayer section as mentioned earlier there are silly level requirements for things like kevlar and weapons vehicles and apartments in the other hand have no such thing but are quite expensive forcing you to grind or just give them money through microtransactions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-22,0,0,261,False,Recommended,One of my first reviews.INFO Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games.(Wiki) This is the version for pc which got released about 2 years after the console version. It's one of the best sold games avaible in the world. The company sold about 54+ million copies and counting!Single Player(no spoilers) In the single player mode you play as three guys. Each has their own interesting and unique storyline. After some time they get to each other and become a team to do whatever they want ) In this mode you have missions for each main character in the story marked by their letter on the map. There are also some weird missions called *freaks* in which you help some random people around the town(friends or unknown people) with different objectives(from work to.. some other things..) PRO The story is unique(like I've said before) for each character. Their personalities are variated and they have surprising moments even when a small event happens. What is even more exciting is when they gather and do things together. That's where the fun starts ) CONS You can't deposit your money which means that when you die you lose 5.000 GTA$ Saves aren't in a cloud which means that if you reinstall steam your windows or change your pc your saves won't come with you and that means you'll have to start over again.(bad for me because I reinstalled my windows a few times and lost all the progress now I don't think I'm gonna finish the game)Multiplayer You can make/play with your friends walk around the city in some fancy cars. Do stealth/loud heists rob shops have fun around the city fight with others players freely or in a death match. In some other words it's awesome!PRO Amazing cars incredible diversity or weapons planes helicopters luxury houses amazing experiences during(mostly everything if you play with someone) the progress saves completely too much to be said )CONS Hackers/Modders who ruin the fun. (won't describe just look below or above my review to others') Annoying people that will follow you in an armoured car shooting without interruption(reason) at you then search where you spawned and do this on and on again. To escape/avoid this 1. (Easiest yet it takes time) Change your session 2. Get a motorbike and find a narrow place 3.(if you spent money on weapons) RPG/Grenades/Mines should solve.That was my short medium review. Thanks if you took your time to read it. I hope it proved to be useful. Have a nice day ),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-02,0,0,683,False,Recommended,GTA V (story mode) is fun at first but if you really want to enjoy it don't play Online until you have finished the story because is just flat out boring when you compare it to Online. The story is confusing and has bad pacing and in my opinion the 3 charector system while working well is bad because it tries to have 3 seperate stories all at once and the joint one and does not focus enough on the individuals unlike GTA IV. Online is ok for the most part if you are willing to spend hours upon hours grinding for money if you want to use the extensive list of expensive vehicles or of course you could always find a modder. The game itself is one big microtransaction you can't do anything without money and money is a pain in the to get (unless you buy the also expensive shark cards which will give you a maximum of $8 million for more than the game costs itself even then $8 million won't last you a day unless you're like me and are a money hoarder.I would recommend this game as long as you have the patience to deal with the annoying players who half the time just wanna blow you up and ruin your job.EDIT I think after over 500 hours of my life in this game I can finally say this game is stale to me. Pretty much everything gets stale even after a few game of it. The worst offender is the fact that grinding in this game takes ages. Money may aswell be worthless because everything is too expensive to buy unless you have bought a shark card or modded it in.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-04,0,0,123,False,Not Recommended,The game is good Rockstar is constantly updating the game even now the community however... Not so much. The only reason to buy the game at this point is for the online and they kind of ruined that because of the sharkcards and the constant grief from other players. What's the point of the grind if you can just buy your money get everything in the game and be done with it in 2 hours? I know microtransactions are huge nowadays but I can pretty much buy the game and enough currency to buy everything in it for like 300 bucks. Then I've beaten the game without even opening it for the first time. The game I'd say is probably a 1/10 if you purchase everything through sharkcards 6.5/10 for just online and an 8/10 for online and story mode and yes I've bought my way through the online and played through it starting from scratch with friends on two separate files. It's fun I guess with friends but my question is why are you buying GTAV in 2018? There are soooo many better ways to spend your money (especially if you planned on buying into the sharkcards). Have to give this one a thumbs down for right now despite how much I've enjoyed my time on it. GTAV is a thing of the past I think you should go buy something else.,Grand Theft Auto V

I want to drive cars from DLCs without any online stuff happening around. Infinite (in some bugged cases literally) loading screens especially in online Online mayhem it is not so easy to find lobby without some estúpido kid who will ride around and blow stuff up. CHEATERS! (also for some reasons called modders) let me just say that after not playing more then a year the first session I joined was hacked. The grinding gameplay this days the only goal is to do some high reward stuff to get ingame money for new DLC stuff well not exactly **high** reward thats when ordinary missions give u $10 30K and most expensive heists (which u will be doing in about 2 hours because ur teammates will logg off glitch off jerk off and fail stuff up) will give u about $300 400K when usually the most cheap thing from DLC costs about $1 5 2M glitches crashes and stuff. Not so common but mysteriously will happen in most inappropriate moment they closed (and then when kicked in the face by fans reopened) OpenIV to prevent cheating its like fighting terrorism with nuking all the countries terrorist could come from. U shouldn't care if u r not from one of those right? Annoying notification and not user friendly SocialClub overlay system I bought MC club figured out this was waste of money. Now every few minutes some dude calls me and sends messages about this MC ""go check it out blah blah"" the same goes for Gunrunning I would gladly shoot agent 14's head No ability to sell or at least drop stuff u bought I want to sell my apartments! I want to destroy my MC! Very annoying and not wise decisions they dismissed ability to send money to others and a lot of other stuff.

So yeah up yours Take Two. In my opinion microtransactions should be deemed illegal.

2018-01-04,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer is amazing and the multiplayer used to be amazing. Gta online has become pay to win. For example Rockstar has now added an obrital cannon into the game which costs 750k per shot and is an insta kill regardless of if your in an armored vehicle underwarer in the air in a tunnle etc. Rockstar used to be a good game company Unfortunatly they have become greedy and are now milking thier customers for every penny they can get out of them. Rockstar has become worse than EA in their business practices and that is really saying something. You are at an unplayable disadvantage if you dont dish out $200 on new content when it comes out. Its really sad to see one of the best games turn into a moneygrab. I was planning on buying RDR2 but I will not purchase another product from rockstar again unless they stop theese practices.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-04,0,0,26,False,Recommended,For me Grand Theft Auto V s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane fought the crew hijacked the thing and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time whilst driving around in an off road buggy I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. Typical! one of them yelled at me as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments big and small that make San Andreas the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well realised world and tells a story that s gripping thrilling and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series and there s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons mission checkpointing ensuring that you never have to do a long tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.,Grand Theft Auto V

I rate 10/10.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-03,0,0,13,False,Recommended,"So get this...I'm playing GTA online. As I'm walking another player in a bright blue car just rams into me for no reason. I pull out my gun and start shooting at him then high tail it before he can kill me. I run up onto the roof of a building and see his little red dot on the mini map on street below me. I crouch down with my gun out peeking my head over ready to kill this player if necessary.A few minutes of playing peek a boo goes by and he says in the chat that he wants to help me out. I told him no because he just ran me over. He told me it was an accident. He said again that he wanted to help me out.Reluctantly I take his offer. I'm still very cynical at this point because EVERY OTHER PLAYER I've come across has tried to kill me or has succeeded in doing so. I have my gun out ready to fire and I jump off the balcony. I get in his car.He tells me to get out of his car and I'm prepared to run away in the event he wants to run over. I get out of his car and back away a few feet. Then it happened.Briefcases begin falling from the sky and money is suddenly flooding into my pockets. It was an explosion of briefcases. Another player shows up as I'm being showered in cash and I ready my gun again in the event that these dudes are just trolling the out of me. I'm thinking that they're going to give me all this cash then kill me and take it all back.So I tell my husband what's happening and he just screams ""DEPOSIT THAT DEPOSIT IT RIGHT NOW! HURRY UP!""I open the bank app on my phone and begin depositing it as quickly as I can so it's safe. Then another horrible thought crosses my mind... What if they're just trying to get me banned? It's no secret that the auto banning code is a bit finicky in the game right now so I thought they were trying to have the game detect that I'm suddenly getting hundreds of thousands of dollars out of nowhere as in make the game think I'm cheating.Almost immediately this thought crosses my mind the transaction system crashes because it cannot handle the mountain of cash that I just received. I couldn't do I was stuck out in the middle of the street holding onto over $700 000 in cash.When I was finally able to do something about this insane situation I put it all in the bank said thanks and logged the out.

2015-04-19,0,0,57,False,Recommended,What can I say The best game of 2013 and 2014 may have just become the best game of 2015. This PC port has proven to be very well optimized with as many graphical options you could possibly want. (Except for a true FOV slider). The game runs well on a variety of machines and scales very well to different setups. My set up is 12 gigs of Ram AMD Fx 6300 Hexa core CPU and a Nvidia GTX 970 GPU. With this set up I can achieve almost all maxed out settings at 1080p. With the technical aspects aside the game is pretty much the same as the latest generation consoles with noticeable improved controls for shooting while using mouse and keyboard and vastly improved draw distance. Those who are frustrated at the issues downloading and the Rockstar social club it is understandable but rating the game based on those issues and not the game itself is very unreasonable the purpose of a review to provide insight on the game itself not reviewing overloaded servers on the day of launch. No game is perfect thus rating any game 10 is idiotic but if any game is deserving of my highest praise GTA V would be that game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of sandbox games or a fan of previous Rockstar Games.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is one of the greatest games ever made. Now that Rockstar and Take Two have listened to their community and ceased their attacks on OpenIV I can recommend purchasing GTA V again. The old review However absolutely DO NOT purchase GTA V in any form or support Take Two Interactive in any way. Take Two Interactive decided to send a cease and desist letter to the makers of OpenIV the most popular modding tool for the Grand Theft Auto franchise. By doing this Take Two is attacking the dedicated community that has supported the Grand Theft Auto franchise for over a decade. Mods breathe life into older games and encourage people to purchase them. Rockstar themselves have even shared videos of modded content. Take Two should be rewarding the dedicated minds behind OpenIV who have certainly increased the franchise's sales and success. They absolutely should not be punishing them for making a fantastic game even greater.Again DO NOT purchase GTA V or anything from Take Two Interactive unless they rescind the cease and desist letter and allow OpenIV to continue development.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-25,0,0,192,False,Recommended,I originally bought this on the Xbox 360 when it was initially released. One of the players who got extra money becuase we all had to deal with the initial problems on release. I bought it for the Xbox One when I finally got one and now have it for PC because I have one that runs it.That being said it's a damn good game. Microtransactions aren't necessary so people should quit complaining and find a few people to do missions / heists with if they don't wanna play it's not too difficult. Single Player is quite good the characters are pretty awesome (although I'm not a huge fan of Michael) and there are a lot of cool little things to find throughout the vast world.If you want a great single player game get GTA V. If you can handle some people being unfair on multiplayer get GTA V. If you can't handle that you're probably not old enough for the MATURE rating.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-11,0,0,751,False,Recommended,I previously (back in August 2015) left a 'Not Recommended' review of GTA V. This was because there was a game breaking bug which Rockstar refused to acknowledge. Since then the bug and many more have been fixed and there have been a fair few updates with tons of new features. This is my current favourite game and has been for roughly 2 years now. I fully recommend it but there's a few things to be wary of. Luckily there are only two huge shining issues.1. The hackers. There's plenty and the experience you'll have with them is a mixed bag. In one lobby you'll have money droppers people who just want to have a bit of fun by flinging you into the air and laughing with you instead of at you. Then in the next lobby you'll have someone blow everyone up kill people in passive mode and drain all your money. Be wary. I have personally resolved this issue by playing only in private mode but it means i'm missing a huge chunk of the GTA Online experience unless i say 'screw it i don't really care about my money anyway'.2. Rockstar themselves. They take ages to acknowledge let alone fix bugs. Case in point was the microstutter back in August 2015. It was extremely gamebreaking and happening for literally every single person playing. When an enemy took cover and popped up to take a shot everyone in the immediate area would get a small stutter down to 1fps for a second. This let to many unfair deaths and mission failures. Rockstar took roughly 2 months to acknowledge the issue and another 2 to fix it.On top of the existing bugs that they don't fix they seem to take a personal disliking to players and go out of their way to ruin player's experiences. An example would be that you cannot wear masks and hats at the same time. You'd figure that it's a small deal so when players found a way around this and glitched it so you could wear them both Rockstar wouldn't bother stopping them right? Wrong. Rockstar have repeatedly patched the glitch it's their clear intent to stop players from customizing their characters the way they want to. This is only one of many things Rockstar seem to abuse their players for.As well as that they refuse to add extremely requested features that could benefit the game. For example gun racks we're stuck cycling through 5+ weapons just to get to the one we want EVERY SINGLE MISSION. In fact Rockstar recently removed the ability to have dropped weapons disappear from the inventory they just come back next mission. It seems they've made it worse instead of giving us a much requested feature.The matchmaking is also terrible instead of putting players into full ish lobbies it puts you into a lobby with 1 other player and then no one else joins. You will almost never find a game with enough players to start let alone a full game.We also asked for heists to be solo able with A.I replacing players because playing with randomers *WILL* get you a failure (If one leaves the whole mission fails and you're back in the lobby even right at the end).I've trashed Rockstar pretty bad in this review and they deserve every bit of it. They made a fantastic game and supported it for 3 years post release but they also don't seem to give a about the many issues plagueing the game.That said GTA V is my favourite game. With all the issues present it's still full of features the mechanics are fantastic the graphics are beautiful and there's no end to the things you can do. As much as Rockstar need to pull a finger out i'd recommend this game to anyone who asks because while there's plenty of issues it's easy to get past them and have a damn good time.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-26,0,0,100,False,Recommended,GTA story mode is awesome no complaints there. However hop in an online match and all it is is a money grab for shark cards. Can't afford any of the FREE DLC rockstar releases. No wonder why modders exist...,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,74,False,Not Recommended,Offline single player story mode is worth playing if you buy the game during sales.Avoiding GTA online at all cost. Terrible and greedy developers charges a ridiculous amount of real life cash for a tiny bit of in game currency. Online mode is full of bugs and glitches all the stuff you bought will just vanish for no reason Rockstar support doesn't even give a (I bet they don't even have any customer support employees)These Shark cards for in game currency is a total scam. Avoid at all cost. RockStar Club DRM is terrible it fails to sync my cloud save 50% of the time. When you connect to GTA online the game will completely reset your singleplayer map progress. This is an known issue from 2015 and the developer still haven't fix it.,Grand Theft Auto V

I completed the solo half of the game and what an amazing game it is. The story is so full of life and there are plenty of things to do. The characters are awesome my favorite being Trevor like most people due to his hilarious comments and phychopathic tendancies.This part of the game I strongly recommend to anyone.GTA V OnlineThe majority of the hours I have played are online. I'm very ""on the fence"" when it come to this part of the game.Pros Playing with friends.Heists (Except for the long loading times and idiot people leaving half way through).CEO Missions (a fun and good way to make in game money if you have the time).MC Clubs &amp Biker Missions (just an awesome addition to the game).Cunning Stunts are fun.All vehicles and driving.Warstock in general. (Tanks Hydras Buzzard Attack Choppers and all the rest).The weapons and the attachments.People that rage quit!!! Never fails to amuse me.Really most of my experiences playing online have been great.Cons Hackers/Modders.They ruin it for everyone. I'll admit turning a corner somewhere in the city and noticing massive space ships in the sky people flying around and money randomly s****ing out the tops of players heads is amusing (for a second). Once the laughter is over you realise that this amazing idea for a game is being destroyed by these immature morons. Rockstar clearly aren't going to do anything about this and it is a real shame. I've played all GTA games since the start and I'm a massive fan but this is very dissapointing and makes me wonder why I'm so loyal to a company that is proving how di loyal it can be. I hope that when GTA VI is released in the distant future that they take these common points stated in many reviews that I've read in mind.Shark Cards These cards are not a terrible idea but they are rediculously expensive. $100 real money for $8 million in game money. I realise that this sounds like a bargain to new players to the game but it isn't. $8m doesn't get too far in this game (Online) especially for an in game collector like me. You can spend 3+ million on a single car. One of my garages have $35m worth of cars alone.BANNING OF PLAYERS This is the most complained about part of the Online section of this game and I don't blame anyone. It hasn't happened to me yet but I know plenty of people that it has happened to some of them with more than 1000 hours clocked up and they are now permanently banned! It seems to be for no reason and when they've taken it up with Rockstar they don't even slightly care which shocks me.Overall I do recommend this game (especially the story mode) and I guess you can play the online side at your own risk.I hope you have found this review helpful.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-17,0,0,1399,False,Recommended,Avoid the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack (Bought inside the game) it's worthless. Look up how to do the heists and do them all in order from beginning to end without ever diverting from the order. Preferably with friends you won't regret it. Afterwards buy an Office and a Vehicle Warehouse if you want to do the Import/Export DLC (Steal and sell cars best DLC everyone says) or a Motorcycle Clubhouse (Necessary to make the following 2 businesses work) and a Bunker (Steal supplies to make weapons to sell) OR Cocaine Lockup (Steal supplies to make Cocaine to sell).Also the campaign is worth the price of admission!

2017-06-17,0,0,72,False,Not Recommended,This game is %100 hype. I eagerly waited two whole years for GTA V to release on PC after hearing how awesome it was for console players and for what? Other players will methodically kill you in free mode and/or fail heists like DJT at a federally funded fu*k sh*t up contest. I've put 45 hours into this rage inducing waste of time and can t say I ve enjoyed a single minute of it.The Good This is the largest GTA experience to date and the graphics are excellent.The Bad The cops are overly aggressive and capable period. The story is clichè AF. The combat functions and character animations are way behind the times. Hell you can t even crouch! All vehicles drive like a goddam*ed Power Wheels Land Rover in ZERO G and that sh*t s expensive. In fact everything is expensive! Want a haircut? That s $250. Need a place to live? That will be $250k. Want a bearded combat veteran to break into your house and break your wife in half? Call my friend Sean. Don t waste your money on this long departed hype train.,Grand Theft Auto V

Apparantly being the 4th highest grossing game of all time isnt enough they want to be number one.everyone bought it on xbox 360/ ps3 then they bought it again on xbox one/ ps4 for the ""nextgen"" performance upgrade then they bought it again on pc specifically for the modding potentialtake two makes it blatantly clear with their actions that they have no concern for their community they just want more money. if you are reading this and want to do a great service to the modding community dont spend your money on this or any other take two game.",Grand Theft Auto V

Still it's a fun game so I'll grant it the 7/10 it deserves although they should focus on improving networking and such.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-16,0,0,90,False,Not Recommended,"Singleplayer is amazing. The story characters map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.As for online this is the reason why I don't recommend the game because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong I used to love it played over 400 hours of pure online everything was awesome I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff which has become the problem. A year and a half ago everything was more or less balanced the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me ""Hey buddy want to enjoy the content? Well you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.""Then Gunrunning. Again my overall feelings ""Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way you will time from time get raided and lose everything unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well too bad you need a trailer for that but don't worry it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4 5M!""How I felt about Smuggler's Run Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure we'll paint it for you costs only up to 200k just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again want the keys to access your bed? 235k 375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word WORKSHOP! And guess what this number 1 150 000 means... Correct! It's the price!""The prices of the content added were skyrocketing if you wanted to truly enjoy the game you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack which is by the way another big problem with this game or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards so I stopped playing. Since then I've been ignoring the game not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes when I notice that there's an update I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update you might think this ""Oh finally another heist things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content.""The reality however looks like this ""Hey it's nice to see you back in the game look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions the same idea only way more expensive.""And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is but it doesn't seem to help. I've heard some heartbreaking stories of people getting banned for no reason this luckily hasn't happened to me yet.",Grand Theft Auto V
