2018-02-09,0,0,2506,False,Recommended,its a fantastic game for all and with weekly/monthly wipes you never run out of things to do. i would say the only downside is zergs and clans that makes it hard for at solo player to have fun. but besides that its a good game that keeps getting better and its worth every penny,Rust
2018-02-10,0,0,519,False,Recommended,"Welcome to South african Emulator. Where when you lay down in the grass we steal everyting nice house we steal everyting inside. You phone your friends to come help out *eish we have no petrol*. So RUST is a beutiful game where the aim of the game is to survive the only problem is that there is people that will kill you on sight because this is RUST. So in ""Rust we trust"" You trust no one when you see someone check for theire friends and if all that fails take out your AK and start mowing down. Rather shoot your friend then someone get the upperhand on you. This is very diffucult for a solo player to get into the game but it is still possible. Good luck and happy hunting ladie's",Rust

2017-01-03,0,0,409,True,Recommended,I've been playing Rust since it was first released back in December of 2013 and I must say that this game has changed quite a bit from then until now. Even so the game has been an alpha release for about 3+ years now.Pros Fun and engaging combat but is still enough of a challenge to not make it all that easy to master Amazing visuals that have been greatly overhauled from previous Rust Legacy A cancerous community that makes any person want to kill themselves (everyone needs a little bit of cancer in their life) Day/night cycle + weather (i.e Rain... yeah that's basically it) Different biomes (i.e Plains forest desert beach etc...) Crafting system that has been reworked several times (and will possibly be reworked again since the devs love doing that) Tons of weapons to craft ranging from stone age weaponry to military grade weaponry Animals to hunt and kill (or be killed by) Simplistic base building mechanic that allows you to build and upgrade a home to live in Several different monuments to explore and loot (i.e airport water treatment plant power plant etc...) Great in game audio FX and soundtrack Weekly updates/monthly server wipes Official servers community servers and modded servers DX9 DX11 and DX12 support (DX12 experimental at the moment) Steam Workshop support (players can make different weapon/clothing skins and put them on the workshop to be voted on)Cons Poorly optimized even for high end PC's Poor animal AI/animals faze through objects (i.e rocks trees houses) A lot of bugs other than what I had just mentioned Has a memory leak that often leads to lag or using too much computer resources The community for this game is beyond cancerous in fact. About 97% of the player you meet in this game will kill on sight even if you're a nakedFinal Verdict (ATM)6.5/10Despite my cons I'd still recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun game to play with friends or by themselves. Though the community is terrible about 3 4% of the players in this game are actually pretty cool and you might even make some new friends while playing.The game is still in alpha so it has quite a ways to go before everything is finalized and is in a more stable state. (Review is subject to change throughout the lifespan of alpha/beta),Rust
2016-12-22,0,0,1888,True,Recommended,9.3598419810498104984189/10 would buy again. got my money's worth and more lots of fast paced action slow crafting and harvesting. As I played through the game with all of it's changes that have gone through I learned to be looking over my shoulder all the time while I'm murdering the population of trees and nodes. Really love where the game is right now even though I would gladly go back to BP system but that's a thing of the past. I would definately reccomend the game to someone who wants to build up a base and have tons of fun in PvP wherever you turn. I really enjoy this game and would reccomend it to anyone looking to buy it especially if you have a few friends to play with going up against everyone else solo is quite difficult when you don't have many hours. There is a level of toxicity in the game on most servers so it comes as a very pleasant surprise when you get nice people running up to you and helping you out for no particular reason. Playing this game has been great and I'm wondering how it's still in alpha and think this game deserves more players. I'm gonna hit that thumbs up button for this crafting PvP building all around awesome game.Edit When I said there was a certain level of toxicity in the game I meant it. Most of the community is very toxic and kind of ruin the game for me there's also the dominant zergs that stop small groups from playing on high population servers which really is starting to annoy me as I'm a lover of combat in all forms from stone age weapons to high quality rifles.,Rust

2016-12-30,0,0,4345,False,Not Recommended,"Obviously i have spent alot of time on rust and have had tons of fun moments since december 2013. But the direction rust has gone since then is just no longer fun. If you are going to buy rust make sure you can put in at least more than six hours into it every day to keep your base up and running. Also make sure you have at least four other friends that play the game for six plus hours a day as well. Because if you join a server for just two hours by yourself you wont get anywhere you will be killed by people with guns when all you have is a rock or a spear. Dont even get me started on the community in this game rust's community is the most toxic and rude bunch of gamers i have ever seen. Everytime you are killed by someone with an ak i guarentee they'll say ""THANKS FOR THE PICKIN'S !"" or ""you're so ing bad at this game kid go kill yourself"" as i said ive had many fun moments on this game but these moments just dont happen anymore. The community is all the servers are run by groups of 8+ that have the ak (a laser weapon that can spray you down from 200+ meters in one second) and if you want to play solo you will probably never get anything better than a revolver blueprint because it takes hours and hours of farming to get a decent weapon to defend yourself. For these reasons i can say that i would NOT recommend rust to anyone. Do i regret buying it? Of course not! but i wouldnt put anyone through the pain of playing this game.",Rust

2015-02-03,0,0,4946,False,Not Recommended,one day after team ui update &gt Cold94DFA score hidden 55 minutes ago I love it too. A lot of solos are gonna turn their noses up but team play just became super fun and less stressful.FLOOP YOU GARRY AND HELK you've just made game less stressful. for god's sake this WAS rust '(it's just another casual game for girls now. i'm going on festivals and i would love to see this rolled back when i return.team ui update i have no words to describe my disappointment when i realized that this game is becoming casual shooter. in last couple of months we have seen so many structures in what once used to be unstructured sandbox but this has no sense at all. not being sure who is the guy you are targeting with your crosshair used to be one of the best things about rust one of those unique things that other casual shooters will never have and now it's lost for rust too.such a shame... REVIEW this is not a game this is virtual reality and it's very hostile realityin this virtual reality there is only one rule rule of stronger one.rust is the game i have been waiting for all this years the game where experienced players can and should grief and troll noobs. make them suffer and pay for their noobidity. join the dark side... xp update xp system update made rust a grinding tier / level / unlocking based game like casual simple minded games for masses. you cannot learn how to craft a good gun by finding it and researching on research table with blueprints but you can chop trees and farm rocks and this will teach you how the gun is crafted.it's soooooo stuuuuuuuupiiiid and i hate it.component system update rust is again one of the greatest games of its time ) ok component system is a little too hard core but it's waaaay better then xp system of progression.,Rust

2016-07-25,0,0,1075,False,Not Recommended,legacy rust was one of the funnest games i've played. unfortunately after they shifted to the new experimental (and now final release) version the game has been on a steady decline. this is all due to the increase in difficulty and time of even menial tasks.in legacy you could research faster gather faster build faster and loot was higher tier. any player could join a server find some rad pills go deep in big rad and get some weapons or armor. hell you got kevlar by killing animals with your bow. if you wanted to build a base you could chop wood piles for 20 mins and build a base out of endgame mats that took c4 to raid. this kind of gameplay made the game more easy going. you could interact with players deaths weren't a huge setback and progression could be achieved for even casual players.in this version of rust everything is much more difficult. it will take you hours to set up a minimal base that can likely be raided with just a few rockets or satchels. guns are incredibly rare and even if you find them fat chance you'll research them before you get raided. bases are optimized to hell because they are so expensive and dying means you're set back possibly hours depending on the circumstances. this shift in difficulty meant that players are forced to band together and form massive clans in order to survive. the former casual players who would thrive in legacy were forced to team up with the threat of being raided and wasting hours for no pay off. nobody interacts anymore since being killed by a hostile means you can lose tons of resources and time. this leads to a 100% KOS nature to the game where even fresh spawns are shot. Furthermore the teaming up of players to avoid the massive drawbacks to being a weaker fighter has led to huge clans dominating servers. why would you play solo when you can join the 20 man army and raid anyone you please? these unstoppable forces control servers and wipe out any and all solos or small teams. this all leads to an end system where players play the game like a job in order to avoid being raided. massive superpowers war on servers (which isn't as fun as it sounds) where whichever clan farms more materials wins. then the servers wipe and you're forced to farm it all back again. all the while the devs are obsessed with just adding meaningless content like farming or water collecting which means nothing to the overall game. the only survival you'll be concerned about is against other players. any animal AI can be outsmarted by building a foundation or killing it with a bow. there are no environmental conditions to worry about. this is barely a survival game.,Rust

But all in all I would recommend this game completely you just have to be comfortable with loss and the screeches of nakeds and cave men not to mention the roleplayer it's pretty fun killing roleplayers and cavemen. But if you cannot handle stress well or can't keep your composure in a high tense situation you will not have a good time at all as sad as it is i was playing with a friend who threw up from the stress it was funny af tho I'd give this a 9 out of 10,Rust

The game is not too repetitive and you can definetly play it for a long time.The only problem right now is playing solo is hard as everyone else is teaming up in bigger groups. If you play on vanilla or severs without restrictions to group counts then get ready to get ganked.

2018-06-04,0,0,24,False,Recommended,I absolutely love this game. I lost my boyfriend to the depths of these servers then decided to purchase the game myself and see what all the fuss was about. It's easy to learn how to play fast I normally get confused by complex survival/shooter games. But that doesn't mean there's not a lot to it! There's a ton of modded servers for you to find a gameplay which best suits you. Just get used to grinding for hours only to have a group of players destroy your base and loot everything you own. Like i feel so many critisice the community in this game but the whole point of rust is you don't get attached to your you're gonna lose everything again and again and again. the servers are wiped frequently to ensure there's no overpowering from other players not like the u see on ARK where its practically impossible to do anything.,Rust

2016-12-15,0,0,180,True,Not Recommended,*This review is mainly focused on Mac users*When I first got this game literally years ago it was an awesome and fun experience albeit a bit laggy on my mac. Although the game has vastly improved since the fetus days I played it the mac experience has not. If you are a MAC user reading this review do NOT get this game. I myself have been unable to join a server in years and the creators do not seem too focused on the fact that this is a widespread problem for the mac port as they do not seem at all focused on making this game playable for this platform any longer. On top of that the game is also poorly optimized and thus any mac players that can even play the game are likely going to have a very slow and laggy time. Overally my conclusion is thus although this game can be an incredible experience it is simply not worth purchasing on mac,Rust

2016-12-13,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,Don't bother trying to play this without a large group of players. Base raiding is made ridiculously easy with abusive jumping techniques and PIN hacks. Basicly with just couple of players not worth it. These same problems have been around for years now based on discussions on forums. Sure it's alpha but seems devs dont care fixing these issues. Shame really because the game seems otherwise really nice.,Rust
2016-12-13,0,0,593,True,Recommended,"My favorite game of all time. Rust is a game that you need to look up some tutorials and gameplay to get the feel for it. Raiding with your friends is a great experience especially when you get to the loot room inside and bring all the items back to your base. If you are seeing people saying ""Salty community killed off the start"" That is true but you will find some nice people pretty frequentlyI do recommend having a good computer for this or you will not have a good experience**No wonder i almost have 200 hrs. You can replay this game over and over with a different experience every time",Rust
2016-12-13,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,I don't know how facepunch studios have done it because I thought easily that the worse game for PvP back in the day was EVE Online with the RPG mechanics and how much the older players griefed new players. However they have out done themselves in making a game that completely invites people to be the biggest possible towards new players and I am sure that the comments section if the other reviews were anything to go buy will be flooded by the angry wailing of fanbois claiming I'm a noob and I don't know how to play the game blah blah blah well you guys can off no one likes you and no one especially likes a bunch of fanbois who refuse to admit that their game is broken.For those who will actually read my review this is a good 'game' the mechanics are excellent I actually like the survival aspect of Rust however I have picked up on two glaring faults that are breaking the game completely. The first one is the most obvious when you are a newbie and you first try this game. The spawn system is flat out broken because of the way building works in this game what has happened is that especially on the small maps because the older players know exactly where newbies will spawn they actually build huge ing walls to stop them from escaping easily and there are players on there literally sitting and waiting on rooftops for not just geared up players to come along but specifically targeting brand new players for and giggles because they have nothing better to do than make people rage in the review section about this.With this spawn system it is therefore impossible for new players to have any chance of fighting back I'm no pushover I was really determined to try and take these ers down and I did actually manage to nail a guy who had let his guard down on one of the smaller maps with a stone spear when all his buddies came rushing after me once I got through the outer edge of his base he opened by accident. However there's just no fighting it especially when you're solo and you go in for the first time the newbies have to have some kind of balance protection against these people even DayZ wasn't this ing bad and EVE Online at least had safe zones where any of the veteran players would be gunned down in a second if they tried attacking players who were just learning.The second major flaw with this game is you gussed it the balance of the weapons again this is to do with the spawn system partly but fresh spawns cannot even go up against somebody with a bow if they're unlucky enough to be spawned next to someone like that and that actually ing happened to me. The spawn system is so bad when I spawned on the coastline ( Which I think is mainly where you end up generally which is why players could predict where you'd end up ) I ended up getting shot at before I could even react properly just as I had come in.This is a serious flaw not just with survival open world PVP games but open world games in general I tried Rust because it was pretty reasonably priced but had it been something like Elite Dangerous again I would have been pretty off because in the open multiplayer that game suffers from the exact same problems as well.Games developers need to stop ignoring these glaring issues if you offer up more private game options and community options then that would definitely fix things maybe even allow admins to change the spawn areas and so on or randomise things more just stuff like that. However with the way things are I am not surprised at all at the amount of raging people are doing over this game I can't blame them and it's actually reminding me of why I'm really enjoying staying in singleplayer games generally or really well balanced shooters that don't have these issues.If you're really intent on buying this game I would see if you can find a nice community server to play in where there's an active admin that will boot any griefers that's all I can really suggest if you are fed up of the griefing players right now that get off on ganking newbies.,Rust

Rust combines both letting you more chances for survival than DAYZ (where you might die by a frog bite) and waaay more graphical than minecraft. It needs much work to be done on crafting side but if it is so addictive in early access state I can 't imagine what will it be when completed. The only problem is the transportation where I hope in the future we will be able to tame a horse than killing it for meat.11/10 worth every penny,Rust

Lots of pvp/non pvp servers can fit anyones playstyle with a bit of server hunting. Devs still going strong with content and updates. Cannot reccomend this game enough to anyone who like building/bases/survival/roleplay games as one or seperate. great solo game even better group game.,Rust

I thought to myself i better give him a name I decided to name him rocky to keep me company on this strange island. How did Rocky and I get here I wondered. Off in the distance i saw another Man with no pants. He also had himself a rock. So i chased him down and we became friends. We made our own little house with rocks. The we heard some people shooting in the distance we went to inspect. We were shot at and we legged it back to our little hut. Rocky and I hid in the hut for a few minutes I could hear foot steps. they were outside and on my roof. Someones here I dont know what to do... Ive got a rock and my .. i hear a Guitar playing and someone yells out that they are friendly and want to help me out. So i open the door with Courage only to be mowed down by 7 people with Guns. I could hear one of my Enemies screaming as they walked into my Bear Trap that i had luckily found in a Blue Barrel but that didnt save my home plus my friend Rocky was Sodimised ( This was my job i was saving it for a rainy day)Would recomend finding a big clan when you start off and knocking on their doors over and over untill they let you join and then make your way up the ranks via kneeling to god and swalloing when others usually wouldnt.

2017-08-30,0,0,158,False,Recommended,First off rust is an amazing concept and game. Some of the community is completely toxic and will take advantage of you. It can be hard to start in some servers if your new to the game since tons of players have guns armor and fortresses and your here with a rock and maybe a wooden spear while auto turrets mow you down. I suggest you find a small sever grab some friends and enjoy the game without too many people on a sever. There are some great people out there but there are some who are out to grab all your stuff even if thats very little. Besides the mostly toxic community 10/10Edit Got this game a week ago and have played 41 hours so far.,Rust

2018-06-22,0,0,1373,False,Recommended,"Rust for me is really a pinnacle for what I believe the ""source community"" represents. Rust brings along alot of baggage a trifling community that really doesn't know what it truly wants in the heat of that moment where in a game you're almost always paranoid that feeds into a bad cultivation of ""reviews"" or if you're one to frequent chat amongst most servers is of people bickering and complaining. So for most reviews or opinion through word of mouth or even in chat of a rust server. It is important to shift through those reviews to find those that truly symbolize Rust and it's ""culture"" I am at large a fan of Facepunch as I seeped tons of hours before Gmod really hit it's fame via media. To this day I have a hard time deciphering if Garry really has a good grasp on ladders yet (anyways) Beyond all else this game is a tribute to survival games as they should be before the plague of BR came about. Rust will stand the test of time I feel even if you take a monthly break once you get raided theres a drive to come back to see if you can do it better next time. If it's your first rust experience spend the first few days with chat disabled or if you're like me and enjoy talking and creating allies and enemies via social game it's whatever route you prefer. Building makes you think and is ever changing couldn't tell you how many hours I've spent doing math on what ways my base could be raided and what I can do to resolve flaws. Vice versa using that knowledge to help my raid team get into a complicated intrciate structure. Loot systemThe loot system has gone through many changes and I feel the current one is by far the most balanced and by far the one I love. However I do expect it to be changed but the current system allows large groups to progress in a fair manner to a solo player can still keep up if they play their cards right. The many aspects of this game is what makes it so damn addictive.So in an overall I 100% reccomend this game if you're looking for more of a competitive long term shooter rather than a BR.

2016-02-07,0,0,91,True,Recommended,Fun addictive game not for everyone.I love games like this but you will die and lose hours of time often. When you finally feel like you are getting somewhere 3 very geared people will murder you break into your house instantly murder you again ruin enough of your house and take exactly what they know will screw you over and leave. I have been playing Rust on and off for a long time it is definately coming along nicely and is vastly better than it was only a year ago. Sound awful? It is but I keep coming back for more.But caution if you cannot handle KOS even when you clearly have nothing on you of value do not buy this game. Complaining about it in this game is pointless and is very much a part of the experience. By advice try and make friends with an established player or play with 2 3 friends. Starting out from scratch alone is a rough go.I took a long time off from Rust but I can back into it many changes and still getting used to it. I used to have some luck dissuading an obviously vastly geared player from instantly destoying me over comms So far im about 0/10 since I came back. It is a rough game but I love it.

We laughed for a bit and then the second guy found his way back. i said i was sorry and he could have the other guys loot which was a gun and some tools. as soon as he turned i shot him again and laughed like an insane man. good times. lesson is don't trust any sirs or my gang of psycos.,Rust

I have to say from experience that whenever I first got this game and played it I wasnt too hooked onto it. But I do enjoy games that evolve and change over time as long as they dont get too broken. You have to remember that everyone else has the same limits you do unless they hack.Another great part about this game is the very minimal amount of cheaters that will harrass community/modded servers. Most of them go to the official ones which is great if you can find a decent community server to enjoy.

2017-03-10,0,0,479,True,Recommended,Fun but HARD game and what makes it hard? the other players who kill you (98%) it could be nice to have like a protection like until you build a base or until u start killing other playes because you play like 10 min and somebody kill you or somebody is roof camping.... My personal opinion this is 9/10 game the game need more TLC to it some animals are running torugh rocks buildings etc but I think they are working on it It s best to start playing it with some friends and stay togheter if you play solo it s verry hard,Rust
2016-02-09,0,0,139,True,Recommended,I just bought this game and I enjoy it a lot I love the idea of surviving and all but I and a lot of Rust users out there might be with me on this but I believe the game would sale more if the developers added a singleplayer world that works offline/online besides only being MMO it could easily be transformed to single player. As I stated before its a great game probably one of the best survival games out there but it could be more with a singleplayer mode added to it.,Rust
2016-02-09,0,0,2930,True,Recommended,Having played over 100 hours and following the dev and community blogs I adore the direction that this game looks to be taking. I anticipate spawning into large servers battling diverse elements storms and wild animals all the while dodging communities of roving raiders and slavers with complex social dynamics. The experience is as real and exhilarating as the players who create it and future updates promise even further improvements. The Devs are putting lots of time and love into this game and it's community and I can't wait to see what comes next.,Rust

How is the rust community you ask? what other game can yo urun around with a bow and only get attacked by 15 other naked new spawns with a rock and a C*CK. WHY do i recommend rust? Becuase there is not greater feeling then playing the game for 16 hours two days in a row totaling 32 hours in the first two days you own the game having control over the server being out powered by none then going to work and getting offline raided. The feeling is amaaaaazing if you like myself are an ex military helicopter you will find GREAT enjoyment is enacting your revenge on the curently still inlisted HELI model. oh BTW to kill bobby just drop two C4 On his head. What is rust? rust? is rust. rust is logging in to the game after saving a villiage in africa to find pure all over your body because your ""friend"" was too ENERGETIC to build a new box. but GOD FORBID you do it to him.

2015-06-28,0,0,164,True,Not Recommended,RUST is ok. To be honest it's suffering all the same issues that other online games suffer unfriendly players. I've been playing it for about a month on and off and have hit the same wall each time someone always kills me.People are reluctant to hook up into teams there is a pervasive atmosphere of mistrust that really drags the game down and which has put me off playing it.I had a base which got raided repeatedley. For those that don't know each time you get raided you have start again with your resource collection and that's a drag after the first couple of times. Building a base is a big investment of time and materials that is satisfying once you get it built.I hid one base away from the favourite spots near Rad houses tucked in amongst rocks managed to get it mostly stone built and was gathering resources to get armoured I got raided. There's nothing you can do but build a base that makes raiding difficult that's if you can hang on to your resources long enough to do that.It takes many hours of boring banging away on rocks (if you can find any) to get enough ore to then smelt into metal and you need a constant supply of wood for this.I spent more time hiding from better armed players or hanging around my base managing the smelting than I did enjoying the multiplayer aspect of the game.I know the dev wants it to be a gank fest doesn't want to enforce any features that limit a player's freedom and will never consider what I'm about to suggest the option to create squads and let ppl know you're looking to team up. I think this would improve the game massively especially for new players.,Rust

Now I know someone will call me a noob or that I just have to get goo but good lord you could stop sniping me from your City Skylines as I am walking to my modest little base. I play with a friend whose way better than me at the game but still we only stand a rats chance in hell. I would love for the developers to make it impossible for players to be blind raided. If I am online than whatever at least I have a chance at killing an attacker but when I get raided a 3am and wake up to see all my gone and a giant siege tower is outside my door I honestly feel like never playing again. It's an awesome open world game that feels epic and scary but would honestly be better in 3rd person. Overall I've had a blast with this game but would love this game if people would actually man up and attack a base instead of hiding until the time when most players are sleeping.,Rust

2016-02-09,0,0,113,True,Not Recommended,I'm just gonna pour what comes to mind.Rust is game for people who like camping baseraping having advantage over players not present on server anymore. Building something worthwile takes time losing it all can and will happen when you're sleeping or at work. Most servers are infested with russians or obscene trolls the game itself doesen't have any endgame you just play untill servers wipe during next release. scenery is randomly generated with premade locations randomly placed on map. Playing alone is pretty much useless idea making alliances in game is impossible because people who have group don't trust you enought to do anything else but to shoot you and if you trust someone they'll most likely raid you when you're away. nature is filled with bushes and you hope to find hiding spots there but most of the gunmen seem to see through them with ease. Not many different type of guns some melee weapons which are useless because of gunmen who see you from everywhere.... meh.. I'll check back if i hear some new development,Rust

To bait and switch us for a completely different game after we all became hooked on the original is a major problem.While I do complain that this is a different game this game is still pretty fantastic to play with the homies.,Rust

2014-04-11,0,0,154,True,Recommended,This is a great game and i could see it becoming huge in the near future. There is just so much to do! However i know it is in development but my friend bought this and he had the requirments pretty much but because of the lacking graphical options it just lags. Your not going to be able to play this with a slightly upgraded casual PC or low spec/old gaming PC. graphical options similar to those in Garrysmod would be great to see to reduce lag for PC's and provide a better experience for some players. Because people like me care more on performance to looks. I would play a game on lowest graphics to see it run like usain bolt. Besides the request great game. Tonnes of content and updating still. Lots of servers ranging in variety and some great looking maps. Love the overall style of the game and look. To be honest i'm not even going to request any gameplay features because i know Garry will be constantly updating this to bring these out even if i don't suggest them.Keep up the good work!,Rust

2014-04-13,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,This game involves decay (at this point) which means if you like your house you better be on everyday to keep it from destroying itself. Furthermore people can destroy your house while you are not online. Almost everyday I have played this game it has started with me once again outside in a cold dead wasteland.

2014-02-18,0,0,249,True,Recommended,"Rust is amazing. If we're generalizing here then it's a blend of DayZ (without the zombies and military accurate shooting mechanics) and Minecraft (without the blocky graphics). In Rust you start out with nothing but a rock. You can use this rock to forge your destiny by gathering wood from trees or stones from boulders or try your luck chasing a pig or chicken and timing the smash animation correctly to take them down and gather Chicken Breasts. You have a crafting menu full of starter recipes (Hunting bow cloth armor hatchet and the best part base building). The base building (foundations walls pillars wood and metal windows ceilings ramps traps spikes) is what really gets me excited because that's what made Minecraft so cool. Being able to leave your mark on the landscape. Voice chat is integrated and local (a'la DayZ) so anyone within about 30 meters can hear you talk if you hold down the push to talk key (""V"" by default). When you die your body drops a backpack full of everything you had in your inventory and it stays there for quite some time so you could feasibly hike back to where you died and get all your stuff.. or the guy who killed you could loot it and leave you with a torch. PVP is rampant unless you're in a non PVP server (not as exciting because there's no real feeling of danger). Let me tell you some of the most satisfying moments in this game are when you start from scratch barely escape death at the hands of better armed players construct a secret base that no one finds stumble upon a real gun (M4 bolt action rifle or a nice pistol) and the tables turn for the first time. Now you finally have a decent gun and/or kevlar armor. You did it by yourself (or with the help of random buddies you met in game) The game really strikes a chord with me. I felt like DayZ was always missing base building. And I didn't like the fact that all servers (in DayZ) remember the last place you woke up so someone could feasibly log onto a diff server then outmaneuver you and log back into your server behind you and pop you in the back of the head. This problem does not exist in Rust. Also in it's current state (wouldn't even call it Alpha really just in development) there are some very real issues with hackers. Just don't get attached to your stuff try a new server etc. It's definitely worth the 20 bucks.",Rust

2016-01-04,0,0,9,True,Recommended,I put in 8 hours into this game thus far. Its not a bad game but it does have it's annoyances. For example when I first launched the game I woke up on a beach with a rock and a torch. After about 15 minutes I came across someone with a rifle and and of course they shot and killed me. This happened several times through the 8 hours of game play. In my opinion In this type of game you really shouldn't be able to get up to getting a rifle and killing anyone just starting the game for ths first time. If the official servers provided a game type that was more a community style IE minecraft state of decay this would be a pretty rockin game. Theres also a bug where sometimes when you start the game trees and hemp plants don't respawn or spawn at all. You have to exit the game and go back in to correct this. I understand this is a work in progress game I just hope the dev's balance the game better and correct some of the issues. Graphically the game looks solid there are some graphical issues but overall its pretty good. Also the official servers wipe the maps every few weeks so it basically undoes all your hard work. In some other reviews people have complained of other people hacking/cheating in my game play I haven't noticed this but maybe thats why theres so many people with guns? Pro's Graphics are pretty good Great idea Crafting system is pretty solid Worth the current sale price of 10 bucks Food and water dimish at an acceptable rate to give you a chance to forage and gather meat From my experience anti cheat system seems to be workingCon's Guns shouldn't be permitted to give new players a fighing chance and actually enjoy the game Servers reset every few weeks which will undo all your hard work of gathering resources and building a base Sometimes required resources don't respawn forcing you to quit the game and go back in I would prefer there be an option to band together with other survivors to ward off the jerk players gunning down new playersOverall I would recommend the game if your into survival/resource gathering games at the 10.00 price point other wise I would hold off till the official release and see whats been improved on.,Rust

2014-04-15,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,"Okay let me start off by saying Rust is good on paper. I mean alot of things sound good on paper like in the words of Ian Comunissm but if every thing that looked good on paper actually worked good we would have a much different world with fart powered ligth bulbs.I digress. Rust is at it's heart a good game. But like all the famous kid's in families there is always that drunk uncle or father who finally shows up when the kid takes off like a star. And then that uncle or father politely BASHES THE KID OVER THE HEAD WITH A BOTTLE AND MAKES HIM DO STUFF SO CRAZY THAT MILEY ING CYRUS WOULD CALL HIM OUT ON IT. The point I am trying to make is that well the developers did not think through how a "" Admin "" should work. They think that "" Admin "" must be a fancy word in a foreign language that means ALL POWERFULL GOD THAT MUST BE ENTERTAINED NO MATTER HOW 12 HE IS. YES I YOU NOT ALL ADMINS CAN HAVE GOD MODE AND ANYTHING IN THE GAME THEY WANT. YOU GET THIS BY SIMPLY RENTING A SERVER. * Cough * Pay to win. Admins and their C4 aside What really wore Rust's weclome for me is the comunity. DO YOU LIKE LISTENING TO EVERY 8 YEAR OLD AND THEIR MOM SCREAM AT YOU AND PRETEND TO BE THE WORLD'S TUFFEST BANDIT? I KNOW I DON'T. WELL THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR COMUNITY IS A BUNCH OF 8 12 YEAR OLDS WHO CAN DOWNLOAD HAX IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES AND RULE A SERVER IN THE NEXT 10. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT. HAX ARE RAMPANT. NEVER B4 HAVE I SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE HACK DDOS ACCESS CONSOLE TELEPORT AND OH DEAR WHAT ELSE. THE POINT IS BANNING IS NOT A THING. YOU JUST JOIN BACK WITH A DIFFERENT IP AND PROBLEM SOLVED YOU GET ALL THE GEAR YOU WOULD HAVE LOST AND YOUR BACK TO BEING THE KING.In all seriousness this game could be good but because of the excues "" it's in alpha "" they keep on putting on the crutch when the whole track team knows it healed up months ago.

2016-01-05,0,0,790,True,Recommended,A refreshing original take on the survivor genre. Rust is extremely high risk high reward gameplay that will take a bit of patience during the beginning stage but you'll find the slow progression totally worth it once you've built a base with solid defense set up. As for the community its generally fight or flight interaction unless you have a mic in which case your PvP interactions may vary. You will be severely disadvantaged playing alone although its still fun if you enjoy a challenge. Finally one of the best parts about Rust are the updates. They are frequent and usually full of new content. By the end of each year Rust always feels like a completely new and more polished game. It is clear that the developers released this as early access with the intentions of finishing it.,Rust

2016-12-22,0,0,77,True,Not Recommended,The game itself? It's buggy but it's an enjoyable survival experience you can play with friends. Mileage will vary from server to server but most people are just trolls. But recently I got hacked because somebody on the server I had never seen before just happened to blow the precise walls and floors into my base and killed me and my friends. A quick google search reveals that it's super easy to hack into this game and nobody can do anything about it. Never playing this game ever again. If you want to waste your time into this game go right on ahead. I'm done.,Rust

2016-12-23,0,0,777,True,Recommended,Im gonna be sincerely honest this game's not easy but that's a realistic survival game I recomend it absolutely if u want a hard game with all of u need for funn and feel a survival game that's your game pvp pve buildings. I play survival games since much time ago I consider myself as experienced player and this is my favourite.,Rust
2016-12-23,0,0,1222,True,Recommended,Rust isn't perfect and while it is just the first survival game I've ever tried it also gave me a good enough impression that it broadened my horizons and I now want to try other survival games. I've poured several hundred hours of my life into this game had many sleepless nights and it has brought me joy happiness rage frustration sadness and feelings of hope which are eventually doused over and over and over again. In my opinion Rust is a game best played with friends. It is difficult to lone wolf but its doable and quite enjoyable (and intense). The community is a bit toxic but if you aren't a sensitive little there's some fun to be had. Remember its just a game and while the emotional rollercoaster that this game will take you on can be intense you will most likely find yourself coming back for more.The new updates with the component system are okay in my opinion. It makes it a bit harder to come up with the gear you want to craft but in a way I suppose that it ensures that even early/low level equipment will be more visible in the game which is good in my opinion.However there is one problem in this game and its the large amount of hackers present on Official servers that have slowly started to invade Community servers as well. Lots of aimbots and other hacks make this game very frustrating if you play fairly. Facepunch has been working double time to solve this issue but at present the problem still persists. In Community servers at least the Admins can ban hackers but then there are those hackers who have no problem with DDOSing the server until its unplayable for everyone else. I recommend this game despite the hacker issue and I recommend that you buy a pack that allows you to gift it to your friends. I believe its worth the full price but of course sales are the best times to purchase this.,Rust

2016-12-24,0,0,308,True,Recommended,"This game is the first game on steam that I have reached over 200 hours on. One thing I have learned is expect to lose all of your work to a 12 year old who camped your door for 30 min. Don't take the game seriously. Be okay with getting screwed over by a clan or being KOS. Nakeds can hold both weapons and loot. That is why clans kill you or raid your 1 x 1 hut. This game has a cancer community that you can love if you play along with them. I love this game and will put many more hours into it. The ""cancer"" is what can make the game so spontaneous and fun. I highly recommend this game. Just expect to be screwed over at the least convenient time. You can leave your base 50 times with nothing on you and no one will be there but the one time you leave with good gear there will be someone there to kill you. You might want to look at rust videos to learn things such as air locks honey comb why keys suck using the alt look backwards walls ect. In conclusion I highly recomend this game. If played with the right mindset this game will bring many hours of fun.",Rust

Its hard to describe what the essence of rust is to people that have never played it. Its hard to describe the feeling of sadness anger and defeat of farming making a base and to have it raided. Its hard to describe the feeling of joy and exhiliration when you make a play or raid a clan base. Rust really makes you experience the extremes of emotions.

2017-03-22,0,0,301,True,Recommended,Great game for the right player. I enjoy the easy building system with all of the customization. It takes awhile to learn how the game works and the dos/donts but once you learn it the game can be very enjoyable. It is most enjoyable with a group of people. Be prepared though to lose everything. It is part of the game you will get raided eventually. If you get butthurt about losing things you spent hours gathering then i wouldn't recommend this game. However the rivalry/survival aspect of this game really becomes captivating. When you are the raider it is verrrry satisfying. Especially when its in retaliation to people who have raided you.,Rust

If you spend three days getting enough to build a house someone will gank you and take your stuff leaving you with nothing at all. Until they release PVE servers this game is useless and I would not recomend it to anyone. If you want to play PVP play games like CS GO. To the Dev's by not having PVE servers you are alienating a LARGE portion of your customer base. Add PVP servers so people can not gank you or take the stuff you worked so hard to get and you may have a good game on your hands that will make you money.

Pourtant quelque chose faisait que je restais à chaque fois l'ambition des développeurs leur envie de rendre leur jeu de plus en plus équilibré et équitable.Nous sommes désormais en 2018 et Rust est devenu un monument du jeu vidéo. Système de crafting bien pensé graphismes impeccables sur une grosse config une véritable notion de ""survie"" que l'on ne retrouve dans presque aucun bon jeu du même genre et le tout très bien optimisé par des patchnotes très réguliers et des mises à jours hebdomadaires.Avant de vous lancer dans l'univers impitoyable de Rust je n'ai qu'un conseil à vous donner préparez des couches ça va chier !",Rust

I had one guy who plainly shot me while I was minding my own buisness gathering wood and after the death he said in the chat ""Lol which newbie did I just shoot with my pistol?"" I then replied and said ""It was me and that was kinda unnecessary I just started the game so good start for me"" He then answer ""So sorry it was just for the sport and testing out the rusty pistol xD"" Just this case sums up most of the community I my self with the experience I got find it hard to start up and even gather materials with people always killing you.. I have yet not got the chance to build a shelter cause I've been shot right before...So because of the community I will say this is not worth buying.. people are too strong and wont give you a chance to start up.",Rust

2016-01-25,0,0,264,True,Not Recommended,Okay okay......the performance updates are kinda nice! good job! theres only two problems left. first of all animals breakdancing and coming in to our bases from the wall are a problem! But the biggest problem right now is the optimization! I mean minecraft needs 4 gigs of ram but we need 16. That's outrageous! Please fix! And also 3Ghz for a game? my new laptop can run gta medium setting 60 fps. But in rust its 19 low settings......unplayable! I really like the game. Lovely devs....i know life is hard. Im a computer engineer myself but pleasse fix it in like 24h. Even the cracks are better optimized by the community than this.,Rust

2015-02-27,0,0,192,True,Recommended,Pretty addicting game if you enjoy PVP. They do have some PVE servers out their witch people are pretty nice and wont kill you lol. But if you like to build homes and compounds to establish your foothold on that portion of the map to enable you to hunt for food and materials for clothing to protect you from the harsh elements. Know if you more the bandit type then you go hunt for blueprints that will enable you to shoot and find explosive to blow someone elses base up and just take their stuff because hey you can. Theirs so many different play styles you got your survivor you just builds and forages then you got your bandit who just has small little hidden shack and raids during the night or you can just help other survivors. But remember first rule of rust trust now one! Second rule of rust lock your doors third rule dont let any1 know where you keep your goodies!,Rust

2014-04-19,0,0,31,True,Not Recommended,Ok dont get me wrong this is a awesome game its minecraft with good graphics and i understand that it is still under developement but my biggest issue is the fact that there are so many hacks in the game anything from speed hacks (allows the player to move really fast) flying hacks (as it sounds) and aimbot (instant head shots) and it seems like every server has a growing population of people that are now using these. i could understand modded servers having them but the official servers are 2 times worse i got killed by someone and tried to reprort him just to find out there isnt a way to do so then every time i spawned he would fly to me and kill me again. like i said its a good game but untill they get the hacker situation under control which also seems like the creaters dont really care about this game will only be for people that like to ruin the fun for everyone else.,Rust
2016-03-15,0,0,1780,True,Not Recommended,The game is awesome. everything works as it should. It looks good and has a decent community. except the hackers.

Between the players wildlife NPCs and machines it's the rush of danger that will get your adrenaline pumping. The events make it even more exciting.. or challenging depending on your time playing.You have nothing to lose playing this or at least trying it out.

(Joke) Honestly sometimes the community can be pretty toxic however the game itself is super fun I never play offical servers because you just grind to get a base and guns and everything and then it is gone with the wipe. I really suggest if you do get the game you could try and play offical servers and see if you like it otherwise stick to a 2x or a 5x modded server as they are really fun aswell and usually have some nice features that come with them like possibly kits and /home and mods that can help the gameplay and make it even better!

They've added too much to list but I'll list some TurretsPatrolling Tanks &amp HelicoptersSafe ZonesUseable Boatsand many more.This game has gone over so many updates its wild and while I DO recommend it it is extremely hard to get into especially on a high population server. You basically have to spend all your spare time on here to keep a base upkeep or join a big group of people and find some NEET friends to play it with so they can stay on it all the time.,Rust

2016-12-03,0,0,917,True,Not Recommended,Now I've had a lot of fun hours now as I'm reaching 600 hours... However some of this fun has now been removed and I will try to explain why.I have mainly been a player going for the 2X 3X 5X Gathering servers. Faster pace shorter windows before wipe and quicker rebuild. At the same time I've played on the Standard Official servers enjoying the slower pace fear when out gathering alone and the excitement of sneaking up your first real door with a code lock. This is now mostly gone. Day 1 more or less all groups of 2 or more will have guns roofcamping newer players or simply hunting in 2's or 3's. Gone are the days of the possibility to play by yourself or occasionally with friends you need to hardcore or happen to stumble upon wipe. Its a rush on the standard servers... and its even worse on the modded servers. Might be fun for a while but the thrill of actually building towards something fun as a solo player are gone. If you are a group of 3+ active players go for it its a fun PvP game for larger groups that can play a lot of hours daily.For me I cannot recommend the game any more. Component system is good but its too easy to get gunparts the time to gather enough resources as a larger group is too quick and now they have made the Tier 1 raiding cheaper... it means bye bye wooden doors. Sad to see it happen.,Rust

2014-03-23,0,0,128,True,Recommended,I like the game but I'd prefer to wait for private servers or servers that I can host for friends. People in this game are mean. For an example I was looking around found an empty house guys comes along he told me 'Put a wall here so people can't get in' I told him 'Not my house' and he 'Follow me if you want supplies'. So naturally I followed he LOCKED me in his house says 'Now you're trapped'. I hide in a corner he comes from the other door and unloaded a shotgun into me.What a wonderful experience I had. When I respawned I said 'Thanks for that you helped so much'. I lost my Stone Hatchet...I recommend this game if you want to get insulted by 8 years kids with Aimbot because they suck at games and need hacks.,Rust

2015-04-25,0,0,332,True,Not Recommended,I've played rust since it first realesed and back then i was able to survive on my own and thrive. NOW since the game was remade i cant go a full 20 minutes with out someone killing me for my loot even if I have none. It laggs at times but im alright with it but the constant pvp when i try to build a house which i cant even last long enough to do so gets VERY anooying. This is all on an offical server too if that makes a diffrence. Im one of those guys who wont kill anyone unless im being attacked and i try to make friends on this game and group up but its IMPOSSIBLE because anyone I try to talk to end up just shooting me in the face. Evry once in a while I will meet a friendly guy but would refuse to group up. So thats my expence in this game. Personally I liked it better before the game was remade even though it still had so flaws. So right now this game is terrible and will always stay terrible in my book.,Rust

2018-08-09,0,0,1974,False,Not Recommended,The players will ultimately run this game into the ground with a level of toxicity unparalleled to any other game Ive ever played. Everyone has god aim and will almost never miss you making it fairly difficult just to get off the beach or even go and do the basic tasks like farm to build a base or farm the roads for scrap as you will most definitely be killed by some brace face 15 year old telling you that you are bad. It is poorly optimized and the servers are laggy and glitchy with problems all over the npc's are op with insta headshot the animals running around are op For some reason when night time comes around it is so black its blacker than black making it impossible to see without a light which if you do turn on a light then everyone in the game now knows your location which brings you back to the beach as... dead yet again. Almost impossible to do anything if you are not on at wipe days and when wipe days are on there are so many people on that it makes the game almost impossible to play due to the shear amount of lag and frame loss that occurs. There is no reason this game should be sucking dry almost 16gb of ram which is an insane amount. If you want to die and respawn then die again and respawn in the same spot this is the game for you. But if you want to say $40 i suggest you do so and do not buy this game.,Rust

I enjoy almost every aspect of it and I think that the dev's and owners are on the way to creating a truly wonderful game.I mean there's still alot of work to be done... there's loads of really annoying bugs and stupid things that most of the time just make me chuckle but after the frustration of dying a few times or been raided they become less funny Personaly I've ran into a few stability issuie's with the client crashing I recently bought a new laptop so it may not even be Rust although I'm 90% sure it is.All that said this game is 10/10 even with all them flaws it is well worth the money and the time and with the weekly updates it really does feel like you're going to get your moneys worth!,Rust

2017-03-22,0,0,976,True,Recommended,I can't stress enough why I love and hate this game. First it's still having new content added all the time which is great but means my base is wiped once a month. I usually put 50 or so hours into building an fortress of hate and devastation which no man can enter without dying 554 times just to have the server wiped oh the humanity!I personally can't convey the pleasure of shooting your enemy in the face and then completely tearing his base apart and then to add even more injury of not only robbing his base but then placing tool cabinets in his base which if done right effectively ensures he can't repair his base or live in it again once you block up all the entrances with traps and other fun things like land mines.,Rust
2016-01-08,0,0,62,True,Recommended,This is an awesome game to play with some friends or to make friends while playing it.The crafting system makes the game both fun and frustrating.

2014-04-27,0,0,71,True,Recommended,Honestly this is a good game. Not a great game but a good game. I have put in about 33 hrs and for the first half of that everything felt like a fresh experience. Then for the second half everything became kinda stale. Yes this is in beta so of course things will change and then experiences will most definitely change as well. I was gonna write a legthy review but decided against it. Theres really not a lot to say anyway. This game has potential to be an excellent survival game. They did away with the zombies so now its supposed to just be survival. However after a short amount of time playing you will have everything you need and in vast quantities. So its no longer about survival but pure PVP. Which is fun to a degree. But thats not why I bought into this game. I dont wanna log into a server just to go hunt down other players everytime. This gets old. But so does logging in just to build up your base a little better to prevent it from getting raided again. So roaming the map to raid a base and kill other players is the only real way to have fun. Other games in this genre have this same exact issue. When it comes down to it these games lack objectives. Something you can strive for and in the end get that reward that will make that once tedious task now bareable. Its all a vicious cycle. I believe that the devs could have a gem of a game here. But its still lacking in the feature department as of now. Im sure they have tons of features and ideas they want to add but at the moment I feel what we have may be what the core gameplay is going to be and thats it. Im gonna recommend this game based soley on the fact that it is fun and that it is still in development. So the devs could add some much needed features to spice up the gameplay and give it that zip that it needs.,Rust

You just have to know the basics when you are playing this very first time there are alot of beginners guide on YouTube go through any one of them and you'll know what and how to do stuff in this game. In rust you gather build upgrade hunt be hunted blow things up raid people get raided.And to the people complaining about the game that it's based upon clan play and give advantage to the people who have a clan and put those into great disadvantage who play solo. Well name a PvP multiplayer game which does not gives advantage to clan play vs solo play? Clans or multiple friends playing a game together will always have an upper hand in any PvP multiplayer game.Servers get wiped every month this means that everything will be wiped players bases resources items etc. My advide for solo players is make friends with people who play this game or join a clan or simply ask someone to team up in main chat it's quite simple.,Rust

2015-05-19,0,0,260,True,Recommended,I have been wanting to grab Rust for a while now for me the survivability mixed with building sounded amazing not so much for the PvP aspect. Now after 40 hours and countless houses later I can say I am extremely glad I finally grabbed Rust and it is every bit worth the 20 bucks. A good server is key to enjoying the game (in my eyes) and the server I am on has a smallish population which works out great. There is enough of a challenge through the PvP that I am not constantly getting my house destroyed but enough people to still warrant a challenge and having to start over occasionally. I was even raided by the nicest people ever. They killed me while I tried to defend then took only the materials while leaving me clothes and food to at least survive! Haha.The survival aspect is great as well. You can get too hot or too cold which will kill you as will starvation. But it is not impossible to have even the smallest amount of protection to keep you safe. If you enjoy Minecraft but want more excitement Rust is your game.,Rust
2015-05-19,0,0,117,True,Not Recommended,So far absolutely terrible. It seems that this game is only multiplayer (unless of course you want to run your own server just to play solo). The main issue i have with it is that when you log out from a multiplayer game your character is asleep in the game world on the server. Absolutely anyone can find you and kill you during this time taking all of your stuff. The gameplay may be fun if you could ever keep anything you build. Three days in a row I played for 2 hours on a server that supposedly was 'noob' friendly only to find that after I logged off on each of the three days my character was killed and my house and everything in it was destroyed or looted. I have no desire to start over every day and I was the only person on the server at the times that I played. It seems impossible that anyone would be able to start on an established server because everyone will destroy all of your stuff every single time you log off. The fact that I can't defend my stuff because I'm at work makes this game absolutely worth it. I would love to get my money back. I think the idea of the game itself is fine and it works alright for an alpha but it is unrewarding to login over and over again to see everything you've worked on is gone. Absolutely the most disappointing game I've ever played. Hopefully there is a plan to address this very wierd outstanding issue in beta or at least before the game is released. But at this point the game is not enjoyable by any means.,Rust

2014-05-03,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Want a great survival game then look somewhere else. In short Rust (in it's current state 03 05 2014) is a very bad value for your money. The Graphics are ugly textures are washed out 'blood' when hitting people or animals look like they're borrowed from the first Doom game. It doesn't help that the whole map is so similar everything looks the same no matter where you go. The hit boxes are terrible to hit you will have to stand almost inside of a person/animal to hit it however animals can almost 'shoot' hitting from long distances. When hitting there is no respond from the humans nor animals. The gameplay itself aside from the terrible hit boxes is okay. It's your standard survival game get food get tools fight other players. Nothing out of the ordinary. Stear clear don't waste your money.,Rust

2016-07-02,0,0,1846,True,Recommended,I have been playing rust since it started back with the old single map format. Since then the game has changed massively and for the better. Gone are the rad towns with the zombies to the current and to be released soon XP system.Basic premise of the game is to survive not only against the wild but again other people. To survive you need to kill wildlife knock down trees and gather resources to build a shelter a home or a castle if you so wish. Building bigger buildings comes at a cost you can be raided. Other player can exploit weaknesses in your design and use that to enter your house and take your stuff! The world resources regen fairly slowly forcing the pvp aspect as time moves on. Although there are many low pop community servers which cater to new players with friendly no KOS rules. Personally i would start there to get the hang of the game before moving on.This Game is still in alpha due to a change in engine half way through the original alpha release. Meaning sometime servers have to be wiped to place the new version. this is a good and bad thing reset for an even playing field but also a loss of your hard work up to that point. Pro's Decent single player experience.Strong Team play experience.decent crafting progression.Strong sense of danger (bloody choppers)Con's Some s out there.

2015-05-20,0,0,95,True,Recommended,Rust isn't a game. It is a writhing mass of depravity that lashes the minds of those connected. It is a festering wound of social interactions that eventually oozes with sadistic thoughts. This isn't life or death survival against the elements this is fear or hate survival against the purest form of malice.,Rust

One can really feel a sense of achievement after finishing a 2 level wooden abode collecting enough supplies to keep one alive for the foreseeable future and maybe even crafting a nice handgun to fend off wild irradiated animals.

2015-05-21,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,"while most elements of a survival sim seem like they are there they currently do not work (as expected for an alpha) however its been over a year since release and they still haven't been able to implement the ""Thirst"" at all and hunger doesn't seem to work at all so there is no point trying to test that. In fact all of the actual elements of survival advertised such as ""Thirst. Hunger and cold"" Really don't matter anyway as it all takes a back seat to the PvP so as far as survival sims go its really just shoot before you get shot if your lucky enough to find a gun a fps shooter that lets you build stuff. its really the community that makes or breaks these kind of games so do not play alone because everyone is out to kill or steal your stuff while your logged off anyway. Cannot recommend because its not working as advertised this far into production better off spending your cash on a survival sim that actually works like a survival sim and not just an fps. so in Garry Newman's own words ""I wouldn't buy it"" (unless your into lots of male genitalia because you will end up seeing that ALOT both rendered in the game world and in the qualities of the people you will meet.",Rust

2015-02-17,0,0,263,True,Recommended,Hated this game before the change it sat in my library for a year but since they have changed the game it is everything I could have ever hoped for. It is pretty much the love child of day z the forest life is feudal etc. It is insanely frustrating to have a base you spent hours and hours on just leveled but it goes both ways. There is nothing more satisfying than sneaking into someones base and loot everything they have. It is a survival game so if you can't take the pvp don't play survival games. Too many reviews I see people talk about how people are just mean and troll and kill you nonstop and it gives the games a bad name. That is how these games are played and always will be. What do you expect in the apocalypse? A bunch of hand holding? No. So if you are that person don't buy it. If you are looking for an addictive challenging frustrating satisfying great looking experience this game is most definitely for you.Graphics 7/10ReplayValue 9/10Controls 9/10 (Very intuitive)ROI 12/10 (more than worth the cost)Overall 8.5/10,Rust

2014-01-19,0,0,650,False,Not Recommended,First Reviewed 19 Jan 2014 Review This game is fun as hell. It's not too easy and not too hard.Reviewed 23 Jun 2016 Two years since my first review of the game. A lot has changed.Initially the zombies were removed and minor tweaks to gameplay. This marked the point in which I stopped playing Rust and moved on.Then the game as it was got scrapped and re done. What it once was is called legacy and what it is now is called Experimental.The game has completly been overhauled with the shift to a new engine (Unity).The first notable improvement is the graphics what resembled Quake 3 is now at times the most beautiful graphics (providing you have a Rig that can handle it).This game has gone from oh hey another player to oh another player. Currently the way the game has been balanced the player interaction is purely KOS (kill on sight). The in game player interaction can be summed into one word toxic. The weapons have ridiculous recoil and most often you'll just lose that prized AK to a naked with a hunting bow. The combat system is heavily reliant on RNG (Random Number Generated) damage which often means a Rifle shot to the head and you'd be fine 98% of the time.The crafting system is a blueprint system where you need to gather enough blueprint fragments to reveal worthwhile items or gather enough blueprint fragments to research a desired item with the added risk of losing the item.Building bases has gone from home style bases to giant eyesore cylinderical or box style monoliths an 8yr old draws when told to draw a house. Bases are built purely for defense and the lack of aesthetic items in the game makes the landscape on servers resemble a barren war torn post apocalyptic sess pool of high external walls.Offline raiding is the bane for any solo player. As the game currently stands if you're a solo player you're playing at a great disadvantage.But the game is fun.Reviewed 23 Jul 2016 The game has gone from a blueprint system to an xp system.Ownership is now implmemented depending on the percentage of resources you provide to an item determines your % of ownership thus allowing you to reap in that % of xp earned by a player using the item.The xp system is great however it favours large clans with 20+ players. The animals are still broken you an expect ninja bear &amp wolf attacks.Weapon recoil is still 1 bullet for you the rest for the sky gods.The developers are pretty much childish in nature and do not know how to listen to community feedback and implement their own variation which utterly breaks down certain aspects even moreso. Rust as it stands is a Rock &amp Tree bashing simulator.Reviewed 12 May 2018 Pure cancer. Game is dead.,Rust

2016-06-28,0,0,2256,False,Recommended,Rust is one of the more unique experiences i've ever had in a game before it has a nice concept where you log off during the game your character falls asleep on the ground to where anyone can acess your inventory and kill you. The hardest part of this game is survival depending on which server your surviving in.

2018-06-08,0,0,343,False,Recommended,Great game. The trailer outlines basically everything you'll be doing every wipe. The only problem with the game is that if you get to a point where your really good you can score high teir guns and get to end game in about 8 15 hours which isnt that long considering how easy it is to get sucked into the game as theres almost always something to do. Me and my friends are usually able to score aks first or second day of wipe which makes it very easy to reck anyone the only boring part is attempting to find satchels and beancans and even if you do it takes forever to get the gunpowder for a good raid.,Rust

2016-11-23,0,0,338,False,Not Recommended,"Don't get me wrong. The base game is great. I've never played a survival game with farming as addicting as the farming in rust. Multiplayer raids are some of the most fun I've had ever playing a video game. I also like where the devs are taking it. The new items feel fun and I can't wait for vehicles to be added. My huge issue with this game is optimization. 10+ minute loading times constant hard crashes which force me to restart my computer and even taking key commands from the wrong keys. This is what you are in for if you get this game. Honestly I could run this game better a year ago before all the ""optimization"" changes than I can now. Not sure how they managed to screw it up this much but after my 2 000th crash at a loading screen I feel I have to say something about this game. Nothing is more stressfull than trying to log on and save your friends from a raid only to wait 10 minutes for the game to load crash and have to load in all over again. It is not finished. This one needs to stay in the oven quite a bit longer for it to be considered playable.",Rust

I've even reported hackers with proof and gotten results straight from the developer and when I pointed out that same hacker had several accounts they also banned thoses. I could not be happier with this game and the developers.Game is in CONSTANT evolution. Not change EVOLUTION. Stop playing for a couple of patches and it's a whole new game.

My total play time is 2.4hrs. because apon actually getting in game I relized real soon this game was lackluster compared to similar type games. So I tried for a refund and was denined due to that .4hrs. $20 down the drain but since I was stuck with it I figured what the hell let me give it some time maybe it will get better. I was wrong since the creator decided to use this game as a soap box for some socail bull instead of improving the game. Skip foward to 2017 and I find that some est. 30 000 poeple got refunds for this game. So in conclusion from what I can see game still is crap and I'm still stuck with it.

2014-03-03,0,0,378,True,Recommended,I Really like this game but there are alot of really crazy people that just want to kill you for your loot but when you make friends with those few good friendly players and team up then it becomes really fun exploring and surviving in a group.,Rust
2014-03-03,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,"I really wanted to like this game... I mean REALLY thought it had potential!! But it consistantly crashed before the game even started despite my system being well within the requirements. It was a 'pre release' when I tried it but buggy beyond all belief. Developers there is a difference between internal testing alpha testing beta testing a pre release and a retail game that's why they have those deliniations. I would be willing to pay for a beta test or a pre release but this game was clearly still in the internal testing phase in terms of quality. This game gave no clue as to what a user was supposed to do no in game tutorial and unless I had a web browser pulled up in another window it was a certainty that I was going to die during the first night. It was a rarity that I would find another player that wanted to help. Most just wanted to run up and slaughter me while I was still trying to learn the ropes... made me think of the South Park episode in World of Warcraft only everyone was like the guy with no life.This game has a lot of evolving to do before it's worth the money you pay for it. I actually wrote Steam and demanded my money back... and succeeded. Pre release or no if I can't experience a game I deserve my money back. I was not going to pay them to develop this PoS. You're much better off buying Minecraft and applying Optifine. As a matter of fact that reminds me of another South Park quote ""You've got a lot of growing up to do buddy. Suck my balls!""",Rust
2014-03-03,0,0,92,True,Recommended,It takes time and effort to say the least to get far into the game. Bears will tackle you and eat you wolves will chase you across the map and playerkillers are everywhere ready to kill even a freshly spawned noob. It keeps you on your toes and finding that one in ten thousand person willing to work with and help you is crucial. One of my complaints is the lack of official servers (that I can see anyways) and the odd weapon holding looks.Another is how generic the armor looks. It's minor but it can really help to know what armor your allies or enemies are wearing and what guns they're holding (all two handed weapons like rifles and shotguns all look like an M4 held like a pistol).It's a fun game none the less and I look forward for future updates even if it does reset all my progress.,Rust
2014-03-03,0,0,22,True,Recommended,At the moment I don't think the game is worth it's price but hopefully it will be in the not so far future. Right now you must expect to be killed by a hacker who kills you from far away with a headshot or shoots trough whatever protection you have. One even killed me and my mate with one shot. I just can't see the fun in that!However the game IS promising and if they fix the security leaks and annoying lag it can be really good.And please players this is not an episode of doomsday preppers. We are not alle enemies. This game sucks as a shoot em out so please try to cooperate ),Rust

Then I tried looting somones shelter and wound up battling him with a rock for a few minutes before killing him and taking his torch and bandages. Their are many more stories I could tell just from the few hours i've played so far. all in all if you love emergent gameplay in games this is a must play.,Rust

2013-12-12,0,0,26,True,Recommended,"For an alpha this is a very smooth game with very little crashes that I've experienced. The graphics are good the game play mechanics are great and I believe that there are only great things to come moving forward from here. I can't wait to see what they add or change in the future.So a great game...completely ruined by its community. On PvP servers it's incredibly difficult to do anything due to the mass amount of people who prey on newcomers and live to grief anyone who is in their path. Even on PvE servers it's nearly impossible to move around without seeing someone who lives to ruin your experience. They can't kill you on a PvE server but they can break into your shelter and steal your items...or follow you around until you die and loot your corpse. Hours have been lost to such events. PvP or PvE it doesn't matter you WILL have your experience ruined at some point. We've found some very helpful people in PvE ""Learning"" servers (You will LEARN not to trust anyone) but even that is overshadowed by the worst parts of the community. Hugely disappointing considering that game is good enough that you want to keep playing and discovering things.If you're a person who doesn't get frustrated easy can just let the trolls run off your shoulders or can get into a large group that protects each other right away this will be a great game for you. If you don't like virtually starting over every hour or two you might want to pass and see how the game looks sometime in the future.",Rust
2013-12-12,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Once you find a server whose admins don't abuse their power this a really fun and challenging game.

If you get mad very easy this is not a game for you. You could spend hours playing and then come back and have to start over. You can play this game with out killing if you want but you will be killed alot. Think of early Minecraft meets early Dayz. If you looking to kill then play to your hearts explode but if you make everyone mad they will kill you and take everything. Its still early game so just remember it can be a better game. I give it a 6 out of 10,Rust

2014-03-04,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,Just imagine playing minecraft with good graphics and even less of a point. Building is boring and the farming for what you will ned is even more time consuming. Nothing ever changes or is significantly updated. Pretty much just join a custom server with admins who have worked harder than the devs to create a fun server. U will never die to npc's oly people. Dont ask anyone for help or they will kill you. There is no structure to this game other than wrecking peoples days. Even when I play now I just log in. ruch to make guns and then kill people. If you enjoy trolling people and dont care about prgress then u may like RUST but for those of us looking for a game worth playing this isnt it. RUST is nothing more than a very boring time sync. If you have a ton of time to waste and dont want anything to show for it RUST is for you.,Rust
2014-03-04,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Only play this game if you have a group of merry men to back you up. A lot of people like playing bandits and will shoot on sight. Not fun if you're on your own. It's easier to play on your own on quiet servers but then not as fun.,Rust

2015-05-07,0,0,76,True,Recommended,(OLD VERSION REVIEW)Rust is literally one of the best games I have ever bought. The idea really is to find as many resources as you can without getting killed by the experianced people with weaponry and armour build a house build weapons when you find the blueprints and BECOME one of those people with weaponry and armour. No high end PC is needed to play this game. Rust can become very frustrating as it seems that everytime I log back into a server my house was raided and my possesions have been stolen but it's actually quite fun to do the raiding. I would recommend this game to anyone.Also you can kill ANY animal and get fried chicken out of it.420/69,Rust

2014-03-06,0,0,151,True,Recommended,I absolutely love this game and I am pretty sure I have already done all that the Alpha has to offer. There is HUGE potential with this going forward. The biggest downside so far is getting a foothold on a populated server. If you are just starting out its going to be tough if the other players are hostile and not willing to help you out. They probably have guns and kevlar armor....sadly you don't. Finding the right server for right now is the key.,Rust

I wish the createors would add a single player so you could avoid thoses situations. If you like survival games like the Day Z stand alone ( I recomend highly ) you would enjoy this game. You will hit bumps unless your friend owns a server and it is very fun with a group of friends. Over all its a good game great design concepts interesting multiplayer ( Very Interesting ) and great with friends if you dont know any one with this game and you cant get them to buy it it may be less of an enjoyable experince but with a few tweaks it can possible be the next minecraft.,Rust

It is a game that you must learn much from. I'm 750 hours in and still learn something with every wipe.. Wipes they aren't that bad. It is a good thing for the server to clean erase and start new. It allows for a whole new experience. Every wipe is going to be different. Some wipes you lose you die 10 15 times before even getting to build your first home. Some wipes you Some wipes however you win. There are some wipes that you are sitting on top of your dominating tower looming over the valley cooking sulfur to make explosives and planning your next raid. You look around at the nakeds who run by in terror and in awe of your creation that YOU built. At this point people on the server begin to respect you as you are a dominant force. You will find that people will do things for you just for items or weapons in return. Items and weapons that you didn't even have to make! At first I thought that losing everything was bad.. but then I realized the fun of starting new with a new map to make a new base back to bow and arrows and spears. The best moments of my gaming have been in rust. One moment in particular that stands out was when this group of guys were killing us over and over again. We were getting mad and extremely frustrated as they would taunt us after killing us. (We were unnarmed) My buddy and I wanted find a way to survive this harsh environment. Eventually got settled in a little shack under the side of a cliff. For the next hours we hid away and began plotting our strike on the group. Every item we found every chunk of sulfur that we mined brought us one step closer to getting back at these fools! Laying low under the mountain bought us enough time to craft the explosives needed. One day at the crack of dawn we attacked! Planted C4 straight through the front door! The boom echoed off into the distance for many others to hear.. As the debris cleared one enemy lay dead on the floor and then BANG! BANG! shots fired from behind the furnace! We duck out of the doorway for cover bandage ourselves up then together we storm the base! We jump in and deal with the remaining enemy. After the smoke cleared what we were left with was a room full of chests! Filled to the brim! Guns ammo meds explosives all of the things that we needed.. also all of the things that we had lost to these guys! We were so happy that we have gotten all of their loot! As we are about to head out the open doorway we hear footsteps outside... A massive sense of dread/adrenaline went through me. We did not want to fight anyone else with all of the stuff on us. My friend goes first instant gunfire follows. I see bullets flying by then blood gush out of my teammate. ""Nooo"" I charged.. Jumped out of the doorway and shot their pump shotgun straight at the guy coming up on my friend. Right after I kill him I reach down to help my friend up and bandage him. We then take off as fast as we can away from this place. As we are running back home the guys give chase with bows and arrows. We fire back at them with their rifles from attop of the cliff we were based near. After we locked our doors behind us and looked at all of the loot we had taken from out enemies.. yeah nothing quite beats that moment. I will say the community can be very toxic and hard to listen to at times. However I use it as fuel. I look for the people who are being the most toxic and now after had played some time to get better at the game I target those toxic/racist players. They are the first ones I raid! 10/10 Too much fun has been had. Has its flaws but every game does.",Rust

2016-08-10,0,0,138,True,Recommended,"Rust. Some call it survival. Some call it fun. Some would even go as far as calling is ""great"". I believe none of those explations do it the credit it deserves.The word that best describes Rust is Friendly.The survival. The murderous animals. BUT especially the community.Are you a new player in Rust? NO problem! Experienced and leveled players on the server will always check up on you and look after you! Whether it is showing up at your brand new tiny barely livable house at random times. taking your few valuable items from your boxes JUST for safe keeping or watching over your spawn point to make sure you don't wake up too early. (Some are even known to do a little renovation and knock a few of your hard built walls down. Just to surprise you!) Rust's community is just great!But it all seriousness. Rust in and of itself will be a great game when it is finished and is already really fun. The community just sucks and if you aren't one of the first on the servers then prepare to get murdered just for fun and your hard work destroyed just because they can. I loved the first few hours and was addicted until I had to deal with more of the players.5/7 would bleed out on the ground again",Rust

Great 1st impression didnt even get to see what or who killed me it was that fast i just heard laughing.After about 20 or so mins of this i get to spawn not die and now i spend another 2 hours running around looking for rocks to get stones from i get some at last start getting some hachets made then to have this naked guy come up to me ask for food i gave him some Then he pulls out a shotgun and kills me. Ok i get it its a survial game but really? is that not a bit overkill?? Spent 2 hours in total to get to that point where he 1 shots me in the back steals all my stuff and runs off laugh yea i found it funny.Pros Seems to be going places? would be fun if played in a big group of players.Cons EVERYTHING Die right as u spawn? No ingame help AT ALL not a clue what to do when u spawn etc a little help goes a long way? Would i play this game again? I might play it again now that i have to start all over again....I just hope with some future updates that alot of things get sorted.

2013-12-15,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Its a really good game but you need to remeber its in alpha so you will have some gripes with it. Its currently very hostile in the world ive played 6 hours and i only recently made an actual house and when i respawned 6 hours later somone already raided it and I lost all my progress. The learning curves just a little sleep rn and its almost too hard to brave it alone right now. I play dayz and arma 3 and other similar games with steep learning curves its just never been this apparent. I wont stop playing it Im just saying that its incredibly hard and discouraging alot of the times. Maybe some balancing at the begining or whateve idk.

2014-06-11,0,0,501,True,Not Recommended,"The review below was published in 2014 when Legacy Rust was the only Rust. I loved Legacy it was my favorite game. It's a shame to see what these putrid developers have turned my loved game in to. This game is everything you could want in a real apocalyptic survival game. First and foremost it is in beta any complaints about lag glitches and the like are just silly because that's the whole point of a game going through alpha/beta otherwise it would just be called released.Second and what should be more important gameplay. The concept is basic but great you wake up with nothing (realistically no stat pants couldn't hurt haha) and every piece of resource you need you have to gather. One issue on some servers is that resources aren't spawning quickly enough or at all from what I hear but that's because the game is in alpha... aside from spawning rates resource execution is great maybe in the future they will reskin some rocks to look like discarded metal for realism but as far as gameplay goes it's all the same. In a real survival situation you wouldn't find piles of a variety of resources naturally just some wood and minerals. Animals are scarce in some areas and that's completely realistic too unless you're on a farm if there was real life apocalypse you would not see bears and boars walking around main paths constantly.The sleeping bag is a great feature. You can save a spawn point and use a metal door to hopefully keep your things safe. This allows you to actually form alliances and make friends but doesn't add a ""haven/neutral"" point in the game which makes it so much more exciting.Lastly community discussion. Yes the people are mean and vicious and perhaps they are kids (I like how that's become an insult these days it's a videogame for Christ's sake!). This is what makes this game great. Who expects there to be tons of people out there willing to help others and extend trust and a welcoming hand to total strangers in an apocalypse? Most people you run into will be desperate and selfish some well run the other direction because they are scared lots will become bullies because they can and a few will begin to band together in these beginning stages of hard times. This is what I've come across so far playing the game and this is what makes it pee your pants scary...what I assume you were looking for when you bought this game.For anyone who wants a nice community with easy to gather resources and mobs that hit you for 3% of your health play minecraft. For those who played for 30 mins or an hour and got tired of crap server lag and crashes and glitchy gameplay just keep in mind it's in alpha and will get better. If you don't have the patience put it on the backburner for later enjoyment!",Rust
2015-10-11,0,0,3242,True,Not Recommended,Game is good Problem is the hacking If you can see players flying around everywhere Maybe you have hackers Right? It's simple to see who is flying around Hit your F1 key and type status If you see numbers instead of zero on far right of players name He's a hack. Oh sure On official servers they ban them But they come right back in under a different name. Start banning MAC addresses and you may have a decent game Otherwise DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HACKFEST!,Rust
2018-01-18,0,0,1155,True,Recommended,"Alright compared to some people my game time is MINIMAL. And honestly it's one of the most addicting games I have ever played. Hours fly by faster than you can imagine. The game itself is amazing and always has constant updates. As for the servers lets just say you might come across a few salty people on here. The crafting system is fairly simple to get down and if you're a person who doesn't like a ton of buttons everywhere the keys for the game are minimal which for me is great. A bonus to this game the modded servers. There are well over a thousand different modded servers on here and some have a great PVE environment if you're new to the game where it is strictly unallowed to harm another play or raid their base. LIke literally everyone is immortal so if your a noob and just wanting a great feel for the game I would def. check into that!Combat expect on official servers that lodge 200+ people to show no compassion for when you just start. You do in fact start butt naked with a torch and a rock. You will come across some prick who shoots you down even if you're no threat but once you get a small base acquired and get the grind in it gets addicting. Downfall Once you take the pride to build your base and have everything looted in your boxes stacked away you will get offline and potentially get raided. Trick is not to grow too attached to your home because it may end up being someon elses. Plus side you can do it right back to someone else and be ""that guy"". Overall I love this game I have met a lot of new people especially on modded servers who are very layed back and just thoroughly enjoy the game without being asses. Hope this helps you all out and best of luck to you if your purchase this!",Rust
2018-01-18,0,0,29,True,Recommended,So I started this game with no knowledge. I didn't know what to do where to go or even how to consume food. I started to die constantly by other players with better gear than me. That's when I discovered servers that are modded. The modded servers helped me understand the game by giving kits 10x resources etc. Although I am only clocking 14.2 hours in the game so far it is highly enjoyable I just don't have any friends That brings me to the downside of this game You will constantly get ganked by groups of players and without friends you can get very lonely in this wasteland. 11/10 (pls be my friend),Rust

2018-01-18,0,0,2412,True,Recommended,They should change the name of the game to dumpster diving as your relentless pursuit of scrap limits your gameplay to smashing barrels and looking in boxes all over the roads. The game used to be better at accommodating solo players and a nomadic lifestyle of crafting on the go. Now you're limited to having to craft in the vicinity of a work bench that costs a ridiculously large amount of rubbish for single player s to effectively obtain. Having to run home every 5 10 minutes to upkeep your home and build a junk pile doesn t make for fun game play. The game has potential but unfortunately within the last year the game has gotten easier for clans and limited the solo player s ability to have fun. It still fun for a brief stint repetive play the need for a clan too many restraints and a lack of dynamics in an open world setting causes the game to get boring again after a couple weeks.,Rust

2014-07-01,0,0,12,True,Recommended,This game is a great cross over of Dayz and Minecraft. You basicly spawn with nothing but a rock and you have to craft and build items to survive. The only bad thing about it is you do get to a certain point where you have nothing more to do. The optimazation is messed up as well as graphice options so the game can be slow at times but thats to be expected from an Alpha.

This game has since become a staple in the PvP playbook except for the poor sportsmanship of some of its addicts. When the new XP system is set up I believe the balance on this game will finaly begin to take shape. It will take some time to see if the upper tier players start to have a little heart for the ones starting out. I would say give it a couple of hours before you make a decision. I truly feel this should be a required gameplay event for anyone to claim they are a real gamer.,Rust

2017-12-20,0,0,1501,True,Recommended,Rust is currently still an acceptable game but every successive update makes me think the devs are climbing further up the spectrum. They aim to remove honeycombing (Extra layers of walls on bases) and replace it with traps which are already in the game. The funny part about this is that the traps either activate once and are spent or come in the form of turrets which can have all their ammo drained without killing anyone. They also decided to make it so that people couldn't camp the top of launch site (A monument with unique high end loot that cannot be attained anywhere else. Even then the chances of getting said loot are abysmally small) So they made it do radiation damage through a rad suit (The strongest anti rad equipment in the game) The damage is so severe you can't even make it halfway to the top without med syringes and meds don't grow on trees. There's a difference between camping it and trying to actually get loot from it but the devs didn't think about that did they? I love the game but with recent updates it just seems to get worse rather than improve. For this reason I still will recommend it because of how long I have played it as the actual gameplay is good but the lack of a good anti cheat constant ddos and never ending tide of chinese hackers can make playing this game a really fu.....n experience,Rust

2016-05-31,0,0,529,True,Recommended,It is a good game to play. I have over 300 hours of play and have followed this game in the early stages and I see improvements being implemented often. This game is still early access and many more improvements are needed. One glitch that I would like fixed is the animals run through rocks and structures. Also about the charactar that is used to play this game I hope there is plans for gender choice and charactar adjustment ability. Being able to change the eye color the legs and arms size or shape and etc... The recent features added are nice. The Hemp corn pumpkin fish trap and other things. I would like to have backpacks rides of some sort farming added. I look forward to more content and smooth sailing graphics for this game. Well all in all I enjoy playing and will continue doing so. Thank you Dev team for making a fun game to play. Good gaming!,Rust

2016-05-31,0,0,199,True,Recommended,Rust is an amazing sandbox open world survival game. I have played rust since it was in legacy and had zombies. Over time rust has changed a lot. Since legacy the game is much prettier larger contains many more items a larger player base and overall many things to do. I would reccomend this game to anyone who doesnt easily loose their temper. There are still many bugs to be fixed and I 'm unsure if it will ever make it out of alpha. For that I would reccomend the game. I rate 7/10.,Rust

2015-05-30,0,0,36,True,Recommended,It's An Amazing game all together. Some elements need work as with all early access games. The problems are not big. It's hard now to join a main large server and get anything done because other people will kill you and not care. (Lots of trolls and just plain jerks in main servers). Smaller community servers are great but you can't expect your stuff to survive. they reset their server whenever eliminating what you got done. This game is great for people who like to get so far one day but then want to restart again in a week or so. This game desperately needs a single player option like other survival games or at least needs a way to stop the trolls on the main servers from just destroying anyone new cause they can turn people off from playing this game or recommending it to other people.,Rust

When I had first installed there were no servers up (none). I think a practical pricepoint for this game should be $2.49. However if you are into needless hours of building up &amp feel like you constantly want to risk it all (Yes you lose everything when you die) then this may be the game for you.As I said I was on a PvE server as I have special needs in my home. When I had stepped afk for less than a minute a player killed me with explosives &amp everything I had worked for (for the last few hours) was gone. So much for ""Non PVP"".

2018-02-08,0,0,113,False,Recommended,"So I've been seeing that a lot of people are complaining about the game because the ""community"" is bad or the servers are bad and that's just disingenuous. The game is made up of mostly community servers and you can't blame the game when a few of those servers aren't run to your liking. Besides there's already servers run that fix these problems such as the One/Two/Three rule on some servers to prevent mass clans and if you're having problems being raided because you don't play enough there's no offline raiding servers. If you don't like one of those aspects just join a different server don't blame the game.I've had this game for a long time and seeing it come out of early access was a surprise so I checked it out again and I've got to say it's improved immensely. They did a great deal of tweaking and it runs beautifully and looks beautiful and STILL do community updates ALL FOR FREE. This game blew me out of the water with how much support it's gotten from the devs and although it's taken forever to come out of early access at least the devs waiting until it was in a playable state... except animals still dont move.To sum it up don't listen to reviews racking on game due to servers play a server to your liking the game has improved amazingly and I'm probably going to play it a lot more in the next few weeks.",Rust

2016-02-29,0,0,59,True,Recommended,I've heard a lot of bad things about this game from many different people despite that a friend of mine bought it for me and pretty soon i was hooked all in all its a pretty neat game. Yes it has been out for some time and yes it is still in Alpha however a lot of updates have happened since it was open for purchase. Now down to the game itself.Like most of you will already know its a Sandboxed survival game somewhat like Ark and DayZ the game heavily focuses on gathering resource hunting game/players to acheive the goal of becoming the best you create pretty much everything.You start bollock naked with nothing but a rock a torch and your own pixelated balls from there you need to gather the resource to make your clothes tools weaponary living quarters defences food health packs anti radiation. everything. there is a lot more to come in this game and it is heavily team based been a solo player will get your base raided over and over and you'll end up getting bilbo T bagged to bag end.anyway what im saying is get the game its cheap as faquar and play it ive had it 4 days and played 41.8hrs... thats good enough for me.peace out,Rust

Only problem is that this game doesnt really reward solo players because there are clans of 10 15 people that will always just destroy your base by grinding. The game is based on grind but wish it could be more skill and tactic base via shooting and building smartly. I'd still recommend it tho. Fun while it lasted.

2013-12-20,0,0,27,True,Recommended,"The twisting of DayZ and Minecraft with its own spin on immersing the player in an evolving world. To be able to build and craft you have to survive. What has surprised me the most is how diverse the game mechanics are from the first hour of playtime to the point where guns and ammo are common tools. The start out of your game is the ""Naked"" stage which literally means you are naked physically and metaphorically. You have no food or clothes but you do have a rock. This rock is your weapon tool and the stepping stool to survival. Maybe you'll be randomly killed by another player or perhaps a wolf will chase you down. If you're unlucky enough the area you search will have no resources availiable dooming you to starvation. When you actually do find your niche in the world you will prosper. Ypur humble abode will come together and you'll soon discover the key to survival isn't just food and clothing anymore. Guns and a Bow will ensure that Zombies and players are fair game. Players will make or break your happy experience. I found a group of survivors that took me in and we became rulers of a valley until a lone gunman used his superior skills and resources to wipe us off the face of the island. Another incident had a raider haunt our house for an entire night until we fought back unsuccessfully. Rust is kind of game you have play with people cooperation or competition is the best way to describe the interactions within the game.",Rust

2013-12-21,0,0,258,True,Recommended,"You've probably heard this before but if you enjoy DayZ (or even the idea of it) along with the inventory managment/crafting aspect of Minecraft set in an MMO world. There's a high chance you'll enjoy this game. The biggest issue with Rust is not with the game itself but rather the community. Everyone has a ""shoot on sight"" mentality and there's a very good chance you'll get frustrated rather quickly. Sticking with it however will bring great satisfaction and reward. Rust is harsh. You start off with nothing but a rock and you must mine and gather resources to start building a home and protect yourself. Many things can be crafted at the start of the game but you'll find loads of blueprints out in the world that will allow you to craft additional guns mods survival gear along with many other items. It does take quite some time before you even get enough materials together to even protect yourself from vetern users in your server. So chances are you're going to spend 20 30min gathering items just to be killed and have to restart. There is PVE servers (official and community made) some of which are more of a trust system hoping others follow the rules but there are servers were you simple cannot kill other players. If you really want to enjoy this game you're better off starting there. Get a feel and understanding of the game and how everything works. Find the quickest ways to get what you need to be safe out in the real world. Then take on PVP. Of course this is an Alpha So for example all meats are labled chicken breast you can't tear down built items along with a few minor graphical and animation bugs. On the bright side it's rather stable and you can spend hours upon hours playing getting lost within the game forgetting it's an alpha. If you have patients and enjoy what you've read so far $20 is a steal.",Rust

2018-01-26,0,0,613,True,Recommended,Great game but not perfect. Before I start let me state that this has to be the most intense game I've ever played. The mechanics of the game create an environment where a death or a kill make a huge difference. You don't simply respawn like in CS. Essentially you're trying to get your hands on better gear so that you can research that gear and build it once you have the resources.However this game mechanic can quickly create frustration and leads to the biggest problem with the game. That is if you don't have a group of friends to play with you're going to lose heart.A solo player will quickly find themselves swarmed by small to large groups. I had one group of 6 spend an hour smashing down my doors with their axes and swords and there was nothing I could do to stop them. You can literally spend hours establishing yourself and lose it all in an instant if you come across a group of angry teenage trolls.So while I do love the intensity of the game the develops still need to nut out the larger group problem. Currently there is a huge turn around of new players who simply don't come back to it after getting crushed so often.I recommend grabbing the game when it's on sale and spending a few days having a great time. After that uninstall and try again in 6 months. Maybe the developers will have it right by then.,Rust

2016-04-26,0,0,241,True,Not Recommended,7+ hours playing. 90 percent of the time is very lagy. 99 percent of the time when I die because of the lag. I have good internet. I get about 100 Mbps down and 15 Mbps upload. UPDATE (2/25/2017) Finaly fixed the lag about 20 50 hours into playing the game. After 241 hours total playing time since I bought it in Aprill of 2016. 55.6 hours for the past week alone.It has serios flaws. If you are a SOLO player If you play on a big pop. server your screwed. If you play on a low pop. server your screwed. If you play on a tiny pop (less then 5 active players) you might have a chance.If you join a big clan you should have a higher chance of surving the wipe. Thats if you know a clan or lucky enough to join a clan (I had no luck with clans).If you join a server that is in the middle or at the end of the wipe cycle your screwed.There are NO safe zones/areas!On the 1st day of joining a server you have to spend 3+ hours to gather resourses and set up your base so you have a slim chance of off line raided and get killed. That is if you join a low pop. server.Then you have to play every single day 6 8+ hours per day gathering resources and upgrading your base to you have a slim chance of not being RAIDED!After spending 55.6 hours in this past week. I played the best I had ever been gather tons of resources finaly able to craft and use a rocket for the 1st time ever making sure I make by base very hard to raid came all crashing down on me while I was off line I got raided! I think it would of taking 40+ rockets or 30 C4 (never able to craft and use one) to raid me.Did I had any fun playing this game? Yes for the most part.What I userly do after I been raided I userly don't play for about 2 4 months.This past week might of been the last straw.Will I go back playing Rust? Proberbly. Thats if I create a private server just for myself or become a admin on a plubic server (fat chance) or spend alot of $$$ creating a public server (fat chance).I am so depressed and mad at Rust I would trade the game to GameStop if I was able to. I do not like GameStop. I kind of regret $2 200+ on my 1st ever PC gaming rig and buying digital PC games. I think I should of stuck with gaming on consoles and continued buying physical copys of games no matter how under power the consoles are and less polish the games are.ON TOP OF THAT I THINK I MIGHT BE GETTING OUT OF GAMEING! I rarely play any games anymore.,Rust

2016-03-05,0,0,134,True,Recommended,"The Rust that's available to play now on Steam doesn't look remotely like the Rust you might have played last year. Though you can still play that classic version through the game's launcher (under the title Rust Legacy) developer Facepunch has been slowly iterating on a new version of the title for months a build running on a new sleeker engine. However a few features from classic Rust have yet to be implemented in its prettier successor fans of Radtown scavenging for instance are going to be left out in the cold.It really doesn't matter how kind and forgiving a person you may be when you're playing Rust you're playing The Most Dangerous Game.It's a difficult game to describe and not because its core mechanics which blend DayZ's survivalism with Minecraft's resource collection and crafting are especially complicated. It's because no matter how you talk about Rust it never sounds like much fun. ""Oh yeah I collected wood and stones for an hour made a bow killed a deer and then someone shot me with a hunting rifle and I started from scratch.""Yes that sounds terrific. I'll take two.The true joys of Rust are found in its unexpected emergent moments of interaction with its deadly world and deadlier humans.

If pvp isnt your thing you can play on pve servers. Guns/armor/building abilities are pretty limited. Still in Alpha so has some good potential.

I have played for about ten hours on a certain server until my base was taken by some dudes. they got rid of our sleeping bags and put a code lock on the door so we couldn't get in anymore. ouch. that sucks.furthermore I recommend you to watch some videos about it on youtube before buying so you kinda know what you're doing. please beware that this is purely a PvP game and not really about survival. it is easy to kill bears and wolves even with only a spear and fifty health. it is easy to get food. the only hard thing is players and players will ALWAYS kill you on sight they have to kill everyone on sight because everyone kills them on sight as well so they have to do it first(don't get too mad at them a lot of them will be nice enough to help you up)I did thoroughly enjoy this game even though I have gotten a lot of frustration about it when I get constantly spawnkilled or when I lose my stuff every now and then.good luck!",Rust

I've tried several times to play it now but it only gets past the loading process 50% of the time without crashing and then I can't get past 30 seconds in a game without it crashing. I'm on a 2013 27 inch iMac with 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5 processor 24GB RAM. My graphics card is probably letting me down (Nvidia Geforce GTX 660M 512MB). I don't know much about gaming but my computer seems to easily match the supposed minimum requirements for Rust.

There is a problem sometimes when i die (i am not sure if this happens to other people) it will not let you wake up and start playing. It will still run the game it just wont let you do anything I do reccomend this game for the sole reason it is fun and has interesting gameplay.

This game has come a very long way from legacy to current day with all these very amazing and clever updates and bug fixes I think Rust will be a game that I will always remember being a part of my life. I remember all the big clans on some really big Rust servers and taking part in some of them especially all the 5 hour long sky high rocket raids. The base building system was and still is one of the most simple yet effective ways to spark people's imagination when it comes to coming up with the next generation of base designs. I have met some very amazing and awesome people throughout my journey playing Rust because of it's amazing player base and community. Love this game and hope that it never dies. D10/10,Rust

2016-01-25,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,"Saying that Rust can't be fun is an over statement it can be great fun but most of that element comes from beneficial associations with fellow players clan wars and the ability to build your own bases. The crafting has some pretty good elements with an excellent layout and options for building plans. So basically it's a platform for clan wars with just enough crafting to make life interesting. That's it.So why the negative review? Aside from the fact that game runs relatively poorly for its visual status has no queue system built in has had very limited developmental progress has its share of bugs and very limited value from an innate gameplay standpoint (exploration is bland no story no intriguing PvE elements etc. etc.) there is one core element best quoted from our good friend Obi Wan Kenobi ""You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.""You cannot truly appreciate the intricacies and full scale of the human potential for gery until you play Rust. The trolls and egocentric personalities that make up CoD or WoW? They are nothing compared to the Rust bandit and they are legion! You will be robbed murdered shot and left for dead insulted mocked stalked and have hours of work taken out from under you in a matter of minutes purely for saddistic pleasure. Converse to losing hours of work in minutes (which if they can't take it while you're logged on they'll get it while you sleep) you will spend considerable amounts of time being alive for only minutes only to be slaughtered before you can craft your first tool.So my recommendation? If you want to try Rust find a group to run with first and hope they don't betray you set up a community and enjoy its benefits. Otherwise Rust will only reward if you prey upon others or somehow enjoy being bathed in anger and seeing what little trust in humanity you have left being set on fire. Nothing is safe. Nothing is sacred. Rust is a prison shower scene without the manners and I suspect they'd have it no other way.",Rust

It wasn't so bad in the beginning but now I'd say 15% of the people playing this game use some sort of aimbot not to mention theres a weird latency issue now that wasn't present before.Update. 10/04/2014Rust has had an overhaul. Supposedly fixed some of the for mentioned issues. I wasn't able to play long enough considering how BORING it was. Walked around for 30+ minutes on a server with 85+ people and saw no one. Finally after I managed to kill an animal(rare as hell) and get some clothing I was one hit killed by a player with a rock. He made no sound on his approach and I was dead before I knew what hit me. Do not buy this game until they fix this t. They don't deserve the money. It looks pretty though too bad im not playing this game to ing pretend im a ghost in the wilderness.Update. 1/23/2015I tryed to play this game again for reasons I do not know why. Hope I guess? Anyway the procedural spawning is MUCH better now. Once you get used to the new building style its really nice and intuitive. +1 for that. New items have been implemented and have relevance but animals are still difficult to locate. One thing I did notice is that the overall functionality of the crafting menus is completely counter productive. It's probably just me but moving stacks of items around inventories is like pulling teeth. The graphics are still nice but the my main 3 issues still exist in this ""New Beta"" version of Rust.1. Hackers People were no clipping through my doors within the hour of me playing.2. Jittering and lag/shaking/latency when looking at another player. You never really know where they are. This makes caveman rock to rock combat very difficult and unfair. I know it isn't me because this doesn't happen in any other game I play.3. Sound Other players often (95%) don't have a sound signature when approaching at high speeds or when they are bashing you with rocks.

2014-06-09,0,0,444,True,Recommended,This is one of those games that will make u rage dont buy this if u get angry easily! My friend bought this as a survival game well this is just shooting other and get shot lost everything. Start over... Let me tell ya a little story Once I started a new server after a restart. I collected some resources and one guy ran to me he said dont shoot I havent a gun. He tried to kill me with hes awesome rock I killed him. He was a fresh spawn like me. I ran to the next town called small rad. My friend was there waiting for me. I we found a pistol then we went to a field where we build started biuld a house add foundations few pillars OH WAIT... there is approaching kevlar crew with m4 mp5 and c4s bolt action rifles They shot my friend! I killed one of them and got killed DAMMIT ING S! Im going to revenge! (my friend rage quit and left the game) I was running that to my home then I saw a guy collecting some resources with a rock I had a stone hatchet I WILL KILL HIM! now I had enough stuff to make a bow and few arrows. While running to my home a guy ran to me and shot me with a pipe shotgun. GOD ING DAMMIT!!!! Then I spawned closer my home... nothing left... I would say this game is good if u have a gun. Then u will shoot everybody. This game is funny only with friends This is game where guys shoot naked people who have only a rocks I love this game and they may add a rocket launcher!,Rust
2017-03-13,0,0,226,True,Recommended,Rust is a game that takes time and patience and durability. On your first day you try to survive aginst other naked survivors then if you suceed you will be chased down with bows then if you suceed you will be chased by assult rifles and shotguns. you hide in a mine where no one has built and then you see a hole with a crate at the bottom and jump down you die slowly while regining health to loose a 2 hour complicated course of learning to build and iron equipment. You change servers to repeat the same steps but not to make it to iron gear whatsoever. That was my rust experience all the way. Good game but hard to master. I recremend it because it is addictive even if you are on the downside.,Rust

2017-03-12,0,0,523,True,Recommended,where to begin.... well first i recommend you get a friend or two to help you out then find a server that has a gather rate or more than X3 (the amount of resources you collect it helps for newcomers) and whichever other modifiers there may be that you like such as teleport home clans etc. (if you want vanilla that is fine but just be prepared to get your ed by people with AKs and if you join a server that was wiped more than a few days ago.) other than these recommendations for newcomers the game is great and it has a very active dev team that updates the game every week.,Rust
2014-07-09,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,The conept and design is pretty good. Gameplay itself isn't all that bad. Although what they don't/won't tell you is that it is a first come first serve frag fest in which you start out completely naked with just a rock. The developer claims that it SHOULD be a free for all because they hate games where you(the player) are ever safe. The downside is that there is nothing realistic about being born into the world as a naked fully grown adult that owns nothing but a rock in a kill zone surrounded by people with rifles.Like I said great concept and great game. Although not worth the $20 if you hate getting ganked constantly and barely ever getting ahead.,Rust

2018-01-07,0,0,392,True,Recommended,This game... Is just a masterpiece. I've got multiple reasons and let me explain some of them.1 The devs (Facepunch) are just f*cking amazing! They listen to the community and update the game weekly! In short They care about the game.2 The general gameplay is realy amazing if you're looking for a survival experience it can be so satisfying if you manage to get yourself started in your first few hours of gametime and yet you feel like that is only the pure basics and a beginning of a whole f*ck ton of your time happily invested 3 The comunity has it's ups and downs but in general it's just a bunch of crazy naked dudes trying to kill you. Praise yourself lucky if you find someone friendly BUT if you do it's just amazing 4 Vanilla servers are great for players that enjoy a slower progression but the modded servers are just a fun way to have fun in the weekly wipes it's totaly up to you how you play Rust! Conclusion Rust is a game that you just have to pick up it's still in Early Acces and it's improving weekly the game is best with friends but I personally had fun myself for 50 ish hours. Buy it and enjoy it. Bored? Wait 2 months and there are new and fresh mechanics added making it exciting again. Forgot to mention it's f*cking 20 bucks!! I know lollipops that are more expensive than Rust.. Just buy and enjoy Rust.,Rust

2016-05-03,0,0,444,True,Recommended,An unforgiving game that doesn't hold your hand. If you're looking for roleplaying don't come here because you will get shot and you will die and no one will care. But if you're smart you will survive. Don't pay attention to the kids crying about dying all the time you can't run around aimlessly if you want to live. Every action needs a purpose and you have to be on high alert at all times as a solo player. No game gets the adrenaline pumping like this one. Every time you open your front door (once you have a front door) a sense of danger comes over you and you can't wait to get back inside your base.,Rust

2018-07-24,0,0,181,False,Recommended,Rust is a really great game to play with friends but not otherwise. I have really loved my experience playing with friends on Low Pop servers. I heavily do not recommend starting on official servers as you will regret ever living with the EXTREMELY toxic community. I would have to say official servers are for experienced and battle hardened players only. Even on low pop servers the community is still somewhat toxic with KOS (kill on sight) being a large part of life. I also don't recommend playing with only your friends on a personal server as it kills the fun of having a battle with another play that has agreed to it. Overall while having an extremely toxic community Rust is a great game to play with friends on low pop servers. I would give Rust a 9/10 if not for the toxic community so therefore I give it a 7.5/10. Note Wait for this game to go on sale. Even with my playtime I would not say it is worth it for $35. I got it for $8.79 and I would pay a maximum of $16.99 for it.,Rust

2014-07-13,0,0,237,True,Recommended,Before I go on with any review when I first was looking at purchasing this I was thrown off by 20 dollars. The game looks kind of cool but things are always advertised better than they are. Well I have 111 hours logged and I can say the game was worth it even at 60 dollars.With what is actually in the game right now there's not a lot of content. But the content in it is great. The PvP aspect is enjoyable. When raiding a base you litterally raid a base. Put on your kevlar armor and your trusty M4 grab your satchel charges and take to your enemies wall. Not a PvP fan? PvE. Grab your axe cut down piles of wood mine piles of rock and create the biggest base you can imagine. It's hand and hand with PvP and bases.With how the game is right now the developers want to add a lot. I mean a lot. Farming and everything. There's a lot of games that have tried to make it to where Rust is and have failed. The thigns it does it does very well. With how everything is I'd rather have more building types more guns and more loot. The games base is amazing. If you can't cough up 20 dollars for this joy than this review is useless.The game is not for everyone and these are my pros and cons of the game.Pros Easy to get started. Weapons are found randomly and so cannot be camped or taken.Pros Basic gunplay leaving PvP fun and fast. Pros Greatly done base building.Cons Lack of items leaves collecting everything in the game an easy task.Cons Basic gunplay can become boring and flavourless.Cons Lack of building options leaves all bases looking the game usually.All in all in the current state I smack a 8/10 on this game. What it does it does well. It just need more things in the categories it does well in.,Rust

However there was a bug where when you'd open a door run through it and quickly close it it would disconnect you this happened to me a few times and next thing I know I got a VAC ban.I'm definitely buying this game again though.,Rust

The game isvery laggy on most servers unless you have great internet. This game is a must buy even if it was 35.99 i would still buy it,Rust

2018-03-25,0,0,145,False,Not Recommended,"Pretty brutal game for a beginner. I learned by playing on servers with only a few other players at a time. Then I started playing on my own local server because I preferred it... so I would say I'd like this game more if it had an offline singleplayer option where it's just PVE. The Rust experience seems to be kind of rammed down your throat repeatedly like a fat eggplant so that's a big negative. Playing this game is kinda like going to a busy Wal Mart with a t shirt that says ""F*CK GOD AND DALE EARNHARDT!"" it just induces rage and that's the entire energy of this game.

2018-01-15,0,0,558,True,Recommended,In this review I'll try and make it as clear as possible as to wether you should purchase this game or not.Perosnally I love this game.Really it is a game where you start off with nothing and you with your friends or alone will start to build up and become more and more geared and more powerful. You have to take into mind hunger thirst radiation and temperature along your journey which should be expected from a survival game. You will start off naked with a rock and a torch and you will scavenge for resources to build up a base raid other players bases etc.In my opinion I would recommend this game to anyone who would like an open world survival multiplayer game where you can build fight grind scavenge raid make new friends and more. P.S If you don't feel like grinding there are always modded servers which you can simply just connect to instead of community or offcial servers. More Warnings Include Don't expect to be friends with everyone you meet or for them to be friendly. Rust is a harsh world where anyone even fellow nakeds will try and kill you or destroy your progress to get what is yours but I find that to be all part of the fun and exciting.,Rust
2018-01-15,0,0,72,True,Recommended,Rust is a good game in its own right but a few things could be done to make it better. First off ppl still cheat in the servers and the anticheat engine doesn't always catch them. Second there should be a way to host a local game without having to create a server via downloading server files and hosting a server from that. Alot of games you can host a server directly from the game itself. Third would be a single player mode. To play sigle player right now you have to create a server running in the background via the downloaded files. A simple way to play the game with the server built in would be ideal. Still an all around decent game that is still growing.,Rust

2014-11-02,0,0,420,True,Not Recommended,Its a game where the only 2 things to do are grind materials and troll other players. Grinding helps you be better geared to troll other people but with enough practice you can log in and just get right to trolling. Its actually a game where the only thing to do is the stuff that most multiplayer games would ban you for doing excessivly. Its a great game for if you and 5 friends are really insecure and enjoy ganging up on people with fewer teammates than you or people who dont have any gear to defend themselves from you. Otherwise its awful.,Rust

I dont really need to say much about this game well really I dont have to say anything at all because it has taken my breath away. Lately Zombie Survival Games have been poping up absolutly everywhere but not many have hit that spot that makes a game what a game is ment to be. Now understand this game is still in Alpha and it already has the world talking about it. Now I know DayZ has all the glory history and rememberance it needs but please give this game a change would you promise it will hit that spot...

2013-12-29,0,0,103,True,Recommended,If you love survival games then you must give this game a try. It is still in Alpha so expect some bugs but you're hours will fly by as fast as they do while playing Civilization. Me and a friend play this game together and while I admit it is hard to find your friend right now it is very rewarding once you find each other. Gathering hunting building surviving all of it is much easier with a friend. Especially when it comes to other players trying to slaughter you once they find your camp.Hint Make sure you build sleeping bags ASAP once you and your friend find each other that way you will respawn in your camp instead of somewhere random and spend another 30 mins or more trying to re find your friend. Hopefully they will fix this soon to where you can see your friends in the world. Maybe through a map or a waypoint that only appears on your friends.,Rust
2013-12-29,0,0,225,True,Recommended,Very fun and exciting game. Tons more fun if you can manage to meet up with friends.,Rust
2013-12-29,0,0,58,True,Recommended,"For an Alpha this is an amazing game. the graphics are not the best but they are not bad ether. the gameplay in my opinion is amazing. Rust at it's core is a survival game. It does have zombies but it is not a dayz clone. Infact zombies are a very smal part of the game. In rust you have to survive. you must worry about hnger level radiation level body temp other animals (wolves and bears right now) the occasional zombie and the most dangerous preditor in the game. Other players. The community while some might think it is horrible is great in my opinion. if you press ""T"" you can type and everyone on the server can see it. You can get basic questions answered by the community this way. However do NOT run up to people to ask them questions. First that is just annoying and second they will assume you are hostile and kill you. Rust also has a really cool feature for a survival game. when you are in a particular proximaty of other players you can hear them talk (assuming they are holding down the talk button). they can also hear you talk. this can act as a warning system for possible hostile parties. If this was the finished product I would only give this game a 6/10 or a 7/10 because it is a bit buggy but considering it is in Alpha stage and you are still getting the final game when it comes out (not to mention you can give input and make this game into something that you would enjoy more) and the game makers are working on making the game less buggy and adding features I would have to give it a rating of 10/10 for now. Hopefully as it goes through production it will stay amazing.",Rust

Also they need to fix the DDOS or DOS on servers and let anyone to make their own server can be a private if u wanted or single player yourself. After all this game is very good if u like or played Dayz its similar but better well u can craft and build up stuff. Good game overall could be better though ).,Rust

2016-08-11,0,0,187,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I'm checking this as free because I got it in a bundle and instead of giving money to Garry Newman and his unfortunate lackies I gave the money to charity. Bite me.Let me just preface how much I hate Newman which is quite a lot to be honest not just for the attitude towards his consumers treatment of his staff and ungodly disgusting community he's spawned and harboured on Facepunch wherein a clique of nerds thinks they're top dog by being the only ones able to use 12 year old outdated technology and if you aren't in the mix already you never can be but mostly because his name is the same as that one fellow who wrote ""Cars""As much as I loathe Newman and his platform this game unfortunately is pretty decent.Ignore all the t what went on behind the scenes with developers being forced to work in awkward shifts not recieving payments on time and eventually being cut from the project with their content still in it (until of course the ""legacy edition"" went away)Despite Newman's best attempts Rust is really honestly an almost decent game. Granted it's pretty early but so are a lot of things I've played in my time and they typically don't have the same issues or even as many issues as this game does.Granted again I've mostly been playing on a silent community server with just myself and a couple of my jack off friends stuffing my labia in their faces whenever given the chance glad beyond glad I managed to roll a female character with this asinine pick n mix bag of skin tones and genitalia. She was even white curiously enough.Then as if punishment for my hubris out of said labia claws a wolf. One second there was me some furry with no pants playing a game in which I was also a furry with no pants and then the next there was a wolf.It would proceed to kill me in one hit before I could even swing.This happened four times.I also fell out of the world once but that's actually under par for me playing games so I'm going to add a point for that.Rust is unfortunately ""plagued"" by raiders as in all endgame content is specifically designed for raiding other players.This means that every public lobby you jump into is going to be a boy's club of people hitting well armed men with stones trying to defend their 14 pieces of corn from the invading marauders that just shot down their door with an anti tank rocket. Now this is the natural progression of things when the only content is guns and magazines anyone is welcome to come and get their issue pick a fight with the nearest naked man you're certain isn't hiding an M249 somewhere on his personage and then repeat ad infinitum.The game doesn't seem to know what it wants to be so really it naturally becomes this as players realize all the guns they just spent eight hours crafting can be easily pointed at another player. I mean like we've got boars and bears running around makes sense you're on some remote island that is eerily familiar of coastal Maine complete with rusted out structures like the world ended either 40 minutes or 40 years ago but then you've got the Super Huey flying in to blast anybody bold enough to wear clothes and a C 130 freely dropping supplies at arbitrary points on the map. Sometimes directly through the map but again that kind of stuff seems to cling to me like a bad smell.There's no real tone to it and the cutesy cartoonish HUD elements really do a good job of working against whatever themes you're looking at more often than not. UPDATEThe game at this point has become overly toxic the terrible overhead at Facepunch seemingly having no idea what to do at this point. Years upon years of being ""in alpha"" has led to them losing their way with the idea of a survival game with a twist and instead focusing on the 'three day wipe going deep' crowd painting the game almost exclusively as a hardcore PVP experience and making it all feel like a waste of time when some cronies decide to wait literally 10 12 hours online in order to break down your walls once you log off and take whatever menial goods they want only to lose them on the next wipe.It's a game without direction and it really shows.How do you make a game commit 8 10 gigs of memory to completely regenerate a procedural map instead of loading it from file from the server? Who in their right mind would think it wise to do individual asset warmup and precaching over the course of several MINUTES trying to get into the game? Why would it be at all wise to then remove the command to circumvent asset warmup forcing players to sit in a loading screen and risk getting offline raided rather than have a small hit to performance when encountering non precached assets?I wanted to come back to the game I really hoped it had changed and it really looked like it had.Unfortunately the changes were for the worse and I really can't see the game getting any better.",Rust

2016-06-25,0,0,601,True,Recommended,Let me start off by saying you will die A LOT and the way you will be able to succeed on BIG servers is either finding other nakeds who will actually listen to you either by showing ur dominance by beating their head in then picking them up or talking to them OR by playing with friends. Now you can play it like a crazy KOS player on these mainly crazy servers OR you can find a RP server or PVE server or even a low population server to meet people and enjoy building and surviving but its all how you deal with your first time raging against the people who get all powerful within the first week of wipes. Thes best thing you can do in this case is either join up with them somehow OR make them like you so they leave you alone. Ive played this game on and off since its initial release and Ive had so many fun times but its all how you try and play you have to be smart of your surroundings and even some people. playing weirdly and acting funny is probably the best way of not dying anyway id rate this game8/102 points off for the enraging community but 8 points for the pure fun if you get team members and the moments you will enjoy as a team.,Rust

2014-12-23,0,0,977,True,Recommended,Rust review Wow a lot has changed. This is a game that I would not recommend to someone with low experience on FPS and survival games. This game punishes new players. The only way you can properly learn is by playing with people who have decent experience on this game. PVP is a must know to succeed as well. Legacy review 10/10. This has got to be one of the best survival games ive ever played. If you havent played this yet then i recomend you do. This is also one of the best games ive played with friends. The only problem that i can see with it is that after raiding a few bases making the best base u can make having full kevlar and a boltaction it starts to get boring. and u lose interest in the game.,Rust
2015-06-12,0,0,956,True,Not Recommended,"Please try not to compare the game to some other finished game or some idealised version you have in your head. Compare the game now to how it was when we entered Early Access. That s the delta that we feel qualifies us to leave Early Access.""This is what they say about leaving early access on Feburary 8th.This game was 10 times better when it entered early access than when it left.Entering Alpha The building/raiding system was good.There were zombies actual AI that you had to fight/avoid to live. (As well as the occational bear as is in the game now. Much better than a random chopper that flies around and 1 tank that patrols 1 area). The community wasn't completely toxic. I remember on my first days in rust on multiple servers specific spots would be built in and set up as a public trader where people went to trade blueprints and gear and HELP not SLAUGHTER the naked new players.Exiting Alpha You cant solo You cant get started on a server with more than 25 people online as its like a sport for geared players to kill nakeds. There is hardly any dangerous AI (Other than the chopper or tank which are really just a joke). Traders are now vending machines that are locked in boxes so you dont steal from them and you hope to god you don't see a player when using them.Literally the only thing that has improved in Rust in the last 4 years is the quality of graphics. And even this isn't a free and clear good thing as now half the reviews are about bad performance and optimization issues.Way back when (years ago) i reviewed this game with a thumbs up saying it could be a $60 game. Now i feel like its more of a $5 10 game that you get just to play for a couple days then let it sit in your library. Looking for a game like Rust? Play Ark Arma3 (Exile Mod) or even Unturned.",Rust

Someone thought it would be funny to break what I was standing on causing me to die.I respawn. deep in the wilderness. Well on a beach really. The first thing I noticed was a source of light. Attracted I ran for it not aware of the dangeour ahead. I saw it. The rare species. The Naked Caveman. I proceed to run straight into his construction and defeat the caveman with a hit to his head with my rock. I swifly disarm him and steal his key. I reassure the caveman that his house would be safe I locked the door rescued the caveman and most of all run into the ocean with his now long lost key.May his construction be forever locked.11/8,Rust

After a about a week you reach end game and are left with pretty much nothing to do with except farm (which becomes a drag super fast) build or run around the map hoping you'll find someone to PVP with that's if you manage to make it that far.

2015-04-27,0,0,545,True,Recommended,My last review came out of the salt mine. The new rust is pretty good now that its somewhat playable. and isnt as buggy as it was. game mechanics make solid gameplay. gunplay is better than legacy by far (IMO). And building is a lot more customizable. An endgame boss. signs and maps to draw anything on (that means . Overall its good now(IMO) and with updates every week i cant really complain that they abandoned it. 7/10 in its current state but of course it is still early alpha and it shows. fkin deer still walk up cliffs in half a second. but fix most of the bugs and if they stop getting distracted from what they are working on and thats a solid 9/10 maybe even 10/10 idk. only time will tell. hell they might even make a newer rust P. recommended again.,Rust
2015-10-23,0,0,190,True,Recommended,Even though this is one of the most frustrating games I've played it's also one of my favorite. Now although I don't play this game as most do. I don't enjoy PvP as much as pretty much all the people on this game I tend to enjoy building up without constant attacks. They are working on more PvE aspects of the game to make it more enjoyable for people like me. But go into this game intending to meet some attack crazy people and be prepared to become one yourself. It's literally survival of the fittest. If you don't enjoy raiding and being raided then maybe wait awhile until the game is more PvE oriented.,Rust

Developers are invested and adding new content consistently as well as being open about development by posting weekly blogs.The community is generally great and you can sink a lot of time into the game if you want to. Equally there exists playstyles for the casual player and although you won't be able to build a huge base and be able to raid larger groups you can still annoy them by catching them offguard and stealing their stuff.I've found the best way to enjoy this game is to find someone that ticks you off (like someone that killed you when you had nothing) and then make their life hell (through the game).A recent example of this is when I wounded a guy that had shot me previously when I was only gathering resources. I made him watch as I planted explosives on his small base wall and stole his stash of weapons and equipment before running into the night. Nearly every time I play I come away with a good story.,Rust

2015-11-12,0,0,530,True,Recommended,"World's greatest Caveman Simulator ever! This game has had a rough start but it's shown promise since it's beginning as well. Most videos of this game you see on youtube are most likely from it's legacy release where nights were pitch black and there were zombies. People complained when zombies were removed even though the Devs kept saying ""They're only temporary we don't want them but the players need something to fight against in the environment until we can figure something out"". Later the zombies were replaced with aggressive (and somewhat dangerous) animals along with the harshness of nature and other players. Yes this game can be brutal to the average naked man weilding a rock.I've kept track of the development road and it's definately improved since the game's original creation. Although I don't play as much as I used to I'm still a fan of it even if there's some servers where murder runs rampant and a naked person could very well be a bandit in disguise as he pulls an automatic weapon out of his naked butt and guns you down for your rock.",Rust

2014-06-30,0,0,51,True,Not Recommended,Short version The game is a solid open world PVP survival game. No doubt about that.You can build a base gather resources with friends and fight off people who try to take resources from you. In a nutshell that's the core of the game.The only drawback I can see is that there have not been many updates in... well a while. I used to run a Rust server many months ago and there haven't been any updates really since then. I realize the devs are indeed working on things which does count towards progress but people should be aware the pace is a little slow with stable build releases at the moment.Would give this game an 7.5/10 how it currently is mostly because the content is limited at the moment and updates have been so limited.Overall I wouldn't recommend it right now until the updates come out. Still it's definitely a worthwhile game.,Rust

2015-07-23,0,0,208,True,Not Recommended,So I know that this isn't some sort of ultra gaming rig but my laptop's an Alienware 14 with a Core i5 4210m 8GB of RAM and a GTX 765M gpu. It's no GTX 980 but most games play very well with tweaks. Between this and a fast internet connetion (150mbps down 20 up) rust has me jittering and lagging fairly bad and before this update took away my FPS counter I was seeing 60fps with everything in potato vision and the moment the textures are turned back into visible surfaces it halved. Why don't you stop adding features for one or two weeks and just optimize the out of the game instead of doing it as a side task. Would I reccomend this to a friend? That's hard to say. It's not horrible right now but this is probably the longest alpha I've seen and it still runs like especially for others with mainstream laptops running Intel HD graphics.,Rust

Having been playing it for well over 700 hours I can confirm that this game has changed since the newest branch that they have been working is now the most played. Finally high FPS great gameplay and they are constantly adding new things to the game and arent even close to being finished. While this game is still Alpha I would personally consider recently gameplace on par with beta games. Sometimes their updates break things but that's a small price to play to have fun. Everything they showcase in the previous update that they are working on they tend to add the following update. Unlike other games they consistantly are updating game on schedule and are adding vehicles soon. If you have played it watch some lives streams to get the feel for the game if you have a few buddies then its worth buying and playing. Just expect to be raided no matter how you build it.,Rust

2018-03-24,0,0,368,False,Recommended,I've owned this game since it pretty much released in its alpha state when it had zombies. I've seen the good and the bad that this game brings. You will need friends if you want to actually have fun playing this because playing solo is incredibly hard groups of people will destroy your base if they deem it worthwhile. That might sound awful and will scare away people but dont. Its very fun with a group of people and can easily take up hours of your free time. Just be aware that you have to be on occasionally to stop your base from collapsing.,Rust

DEdit Have put over 200 hours now so here is a legit review.Rust is still bears win unless you construct a 2cm tall foundation stay away from everyone because this isn't an rpg or survival it's a KOS game (yes even if you literally just started you will be killed for just starting) flooded with underage children Either git gud or DDos them Admins will ban you if you get a headshot wooden projectiles &gt metal melee weapons still can't ride a ing horsePROS CAN GROW WEED AND SEE YOURSELF NAKED.,Rust
2016-06-18,0,0,554,True,Recommended,Better than Oxygen. Are you easily angered when you die and lose your possessions? Don't buy this game. You will die. Alot. You will lose your stuff. Alot. Go into this magnificent world expecting to get killed by a talking 10 year old or log in and find your base completely destroyed and your precious items you've been collecting all week missing. Do you have heart problems? Don't buy this game. I've almost gone into cardiac arrest multiple times trying to get an airdrop or going to my base with a ton of loot on me. When you get into a little PvP action you are most likely to have your hands shake palms sweat and heart bumping out of your chest.Do you like having a social life? Don't buy this game. Outside? Friends? These are ancient tales I tell to my child of the times before Rust. Before I woke up in the middle of the night just to make sure my base didn't get raided. You will chop trees hit rocks shoot bows and forget about the real world because Rust is your world now.In conclusion probably the most addicting game I've ever played I can sit on my computer for hours on end just running around looking for bases to raid and people to kill or (rarely) befriend. I'd recommend having at least one friend to play it with as solo play can get a bit boring and definitly a lot harder. For $20 it is a steal Facepunch is constantly updating a already huge world and listens to their player base more then any other dev team I know of. Although it is in alpha I would buy this game for $60 easy as I've found more enjoyment in this game then I have in fleshed out AAA titles.BUY THIS GAME.,Rust

2014-07-04,0,0,221,True,Recommended,"Rust in it's current state is apretty fun game in some aspects but not so much others. The community is surprisingly really good. Hear me out here.For a survival ""every man for himself"" game a surprising percentage of people are actually really kind. Some people will give all your supplies back after killing the guy who snuck up and killed you while others will tell you they will return your gear jsut so they can kill you again. But the fact that most players are respectful to new players or ""friendly"" players really means something.Rust is a scary game. I remember one occasion shortly after finishing my first house hearing gunshots in the far distance and immediately packing my things to go find a new location. Just the sound of footsteps make me sprint away weaving in case someone is handy with a bow and arrow.It's an interesting and fun game it requires a lot of time input because it takes awhile on a server to actually get a semi secure house and usually logging off before that is acheived results in losing all your gear.I think in it's current state it isn't worth what it's priced but the developers are constantly coming up with some great new changes and The game will be totally different from what it is now.

2013-12-29,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,Frustrating because of the bugs non rewarding in a lot of ways unless you spend a lot of time on the game or have friends that have done so. That is if you can even play at all because all servers are getting DDoSed daily by a French skiddie. So for the few hours of a day you can play its buggy and non rewarding.

2013-12-29,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Rust is an early access survival of the fittest type FPS that grants players the ability to build houses kill other players (There are PvP disabled servers for more casual players) create an arsenal and strive to forge alliances in order to survive the harsh apocolyptic wasteland given to them. Rust fits well in with tradtitional survival games by pressing basic needs into gaming by forcing players to hunt animals for food gather wood for a shelter and even use bandages when damaged by the unforgiving aspects of the wild. Pros Great Multiplayer game (Singleplayer doesn't exist but still a great MP game nonetheless) Strong survival aspects provide constant awareness ChallengingCons VERY hard to find any source of metal to build guns Due to lack of resources the experienced players can bully and ruin the experience for newer players Requires a HUGE amount of FPS unless you disable grass (Grass isn't needed though) The final verdict Rust is a fun multiplayer game that has challenging aspects to it. However it may be too challenging for those unwilling to spend hours trying to find the only metal ore on the map or those being bullied by stronger players. While it doesn't set any landmark strengths in the survival/FPS genre it's still worth the $20. Plus it's in early access so it has room to improve drastically.Rating Gameplay 8/10Graphics 7/10Creativity 9/10Quality 8/10 OVERALL RATING 8/10,Rust

2013-12-30,0,0,17,True,Recommended,There's been a large boom in recent entertainment for survival. Forgive the game's basic appearance for it's nature is quite remarkable. This is a game entirely driven on the nature of man in the wild. You start in the middle of the woods cold and naked with nothing more than a rock. Find some wood make a hatchet make a sleeping bag and then make a house to put it in. Make you home however you like. Though basic it is yours by the sweat of your brow. One day someone will try to come and take your stuff so find a community to team up and protect each other. Soon enough you'll have a town working together to further the general interest of a group that was comprised of Ex naked men from the woods.Buy it. While a raw game there is a ton of potential.

2015-08-02,0,0,1058,True,Recommended,"tl dr PvP is a crazy adrenaline rush. Raiding Is like a puzzle... or can be blow in shoot till nothing moves. Getting gunned down by a 20 man clan while you are just a naked with a bow can be annoying. No onther game does survival better than Rust.In Depth ReviewThere isn't much else that can give you a crazy rush like killing a geared guy with a waterpipe taking his ak and gunning down his crew. Rust I feel is one of the best games out there that has only player to player interaction. You get crazy stories to tell your friends from just one or two play sessions. ""I woke to a band of naked men beating on my roof with pickaxes"" like that. There isn't a game out there that does survival better than Rust. Spawn with nothing hunt animals gather build hunt people destroy raid. The beginning will be grindy but that just makes it all the better when you someone up. You know they went through hours of farming to get that gear. and now its yours in a 20 120 second period all of that dudes hard work gone because of you. The amount of emotional impact this game allows you to have on other people's feelings is crazy. You have the power to crush someone they could put tons of work in but you kill them in one pvp instance and now you have all that loot. When you buy this your first couple of play sessions are going to be not the funniest thing in the world. you are gunna get ed a lot. You will learn over time. Just keep waking up on that beach. Now that that is out of the way I am going to talk about a few things 1PVP 2RAIDS 3CLANSPVP Holy this is the best ing thing on god's green earth. Imagine this wipe day everyone is a caveman 300 people on the server all scrambling to get set up. you have the resources to set up a base you are just wandering around looking for a good spot. You are armed with a bow and a spear primitive tools. As you are looking to set up you get shot in the back by a crossy. All those hours of farming is on the line. You must win the instance of PVP or it's all gone not only will you lose all of that time and loot. You will make this feel like a god. He will be so happy to get your full inv of loot. I don't know about anyone else but the adrenaline is crazy at these times Like i can feel my heart pumping through my whole body.RAIDS Figuring out the best place to blow into is pretty fun it's like a puzzle. Also it's pretty fun to blow a hole in the side of some sad s house run in with you alone or with your crew. Guns blazing. shooting anything that slightly resembles a human's figure. Rockets C4 Flamethrower there's a lot of ways to go about rading all of them are pretty fun.CLANS This can be a problem for most players. I think its fine to join up with your friends and play some rust that's what the game is best at. but i think when you start adding people just to up your numbers is a bit y like 20 people clans. Its no fun to be zerged and it will happen a lot so just be prepared to be minding your own business when 7 dudes gun you down.",Rust

2016-01-04,0,0,35,True,Recommended,"Rust is not for everyone and I can't even decide if I love it or hate it and let me elaborate on this (my experience is from modded servers).First of Rust is an open world survival game where you spawn in a beach with a rock and a torch and you try to survive by collecting resources and building a base. That's almost the basic principle of all the survival genre. But Rust is somewhat different as it emphasizes more on the PVP element. When you log out your player stays in the game ""sleeping"".As other have said you will spend a lot of hours building a base and collecting resources (the multiplier of gathering is different for each server). You start building a base with the concept of making it raidproof putting traps reinforcing the walls and all of that. Then you start crafting weapons and trying to find loot and recipes to create them on your own. After investing a lot of hours completing all of these tasks you log out to continue the next day but this is where things get more complicated. No base is safe. Griefers or rather raiders as these are 2 different things might come and steal all your precious items that you gathered. Sure you can always hide your stuff etc but the state of your base after a raid can be a little discouraging.This is what I think makes a lot of people discouraged to continue after a couple of raids. the basic principle of the game is ""Nothing is safe"". But I also think this is what makes the game special. Considering things like wipes and raids you will do all these things again and again but in the end it won't matter. If you have a friend expect to have a great time exploring and interacting with others (even though you will most likely find hostiles rather than friendlies).If you are not prepared to lose all of your progress in a couple of hours then this game is not for you but to others I am sure you will have a good time playing the game.",Rust
2016-01-04,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Out of all the mulitplayer based survival games I've played on Steam this is by far the most engrossing one I've come across. While it's obvious it's still in Early Access it has enough content and polish that it's at least playable which is more than I can say for a lot of games of this genre. It's got issues but the creators at least apperar to be trying to hammer out all the kinks and continuing to update the players at a completely reasonable rate. I've already got some good stories to tell from playing with my friends on here and I look forward to having more as the game continues to improve.,Rust
2014-01-24,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,Before people think I hardly played this they're wrong. I played A LOT of Rust and first off there's no food. You starve so fast and you can't eat raw animals without slowing dying and you don't get enough supplies from animals that you need to cook animals. If you want a game like this get The Forest. Cheaper constantly updated and a hell of a lot more fun.,Rust

2018-01-07,0,0,320,True,Recommended,"Rust is NOT your typical survival game. Unlike your standard survival game people are the enemy here and this is essentially a purely multiplayer game (you can play solo but it'd be no challenge and devoid of any sense of worry and life). As you are no doubt aware people exist that are awful and terrible. These s will bring themselves to griefing you and destroying all your hard work followed by a teabag and a ""Wow you suck"" despite having a stone hatchet in an open field against two 12 year olds with assault rifles and metal armor.This game will destroy your very soul more than any other I have seen and is one of the most beginner unfriendly games that there is. There are servers that have fully knit communities and welcome beginners but I'd actually recommend not playing on those and instead ing around on your own or with friends and failing epicly and hating your life in the process. Having your base stolen by a psychopath doorcamper with a pickaxe not only depressed me though. I learned. And that's where the beauty of this game lies learning and improving. This game has some really good gunplay to it and if you're not accustomed to FPS games like myself you will suck some hardcore monkey and never even get to realizing this for your first few dozen hours. Not to mention you're gonna suck in other ways building maneuvering and general tactics. This game was NOT designed for you to have a good time and I'm still with almost 300 hours played dumfounded at the skill some people have.The game is also ing phenomenal to play with 1+ other people and is a great addictive time killer with some friends.In my attempt to give an accurate review I would recommend this if you love difficulty think you have the ability or the ability to GAIN the ability to mentally move on after losing hours on hours of work. If you like typical PVE survival games this game may not be for you as it is mainly focused on pvp and is vastly different from standard survival games. However it'd definitely be worth a try on sale. If you're not as experienced with FPS games or difficult games but STILL want to learn and improve try bringing a friend to make things a little more fun cause the early hours will likely suck some",Rust

2015-12-03,0,0,3581,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game that heavily centres around base building raiding of said bases looting and guns. Being a early access game and still in alpha (they remade the whole game so this stage has been prolonged) many people have avoided it. Honestly this is the best early access game out there. The dev team is amazing and provide frequent updates (no they have not given up on it and don't seem like they will). It has a healthy player base with new people joining all the time. The survival aspects are there. You start off naked with only a torch and a rock and you have to move your way up by creating new and better tools and weapons. You face dangers such as the wildlife a patrol helicopter and most importantly other players. In order to make new items you need to gather wood stone metal and sulphur from the enviroment. 'Monuments' and 'rad towns' provide land marks on the map and can be explored in order to find loot such as weapons tools and blue prints. Each item requires a blue print in order to craft (you have many 'default' blueprints right from the start) the more advanced the item the harder it is to craft and the harder it is to get the blue print.Rust uses a modular building system that allows players to build whatever their heart's desire. Want to build a shack with one room? You can. Want to build a massive compound with towers and a castle? You can if you put the effort into it. Be aware that people can make explosives in order to raid you. To try and mitigate against this make sure to design your home well. Try and make peace not war with your neighbours unless you want to make it a race to get C4 and blow down the other's base. Don't worry if you can get raided. It happens to everyone and not just once. Try and rebuild in a new area make new friends and new enemies. Explore the amazing open world.Rust currently updates biweekly compared to the weekly updates it used to have and each update is either filled with amazing content to keep the game fresh or backend developer stuff to hasten the introduction of new content and provide much needed improvements. The dev team seems to get a lot of crap for not catering to everyone's needs and by being a normal person you would understand that just isn't possible. I feel this has been caused by the dev team being so good many people have become spoilt brats. I guess that's a good thing. In my opinion this is the best dev team as they work hard and infact do listen to the community. You won't be seeing any DayZ style yearly updates (I still love you DayZ!).One warning is that Rust takes up a lot of time. Yes you can jump on and play whenever (you might want to play on modded servers which speed up the process of resource collecting. Each modded server has their own set of features) but to get the most enjoyment out of it having a weekend/week with little on is the best way to play. For $20 or the current sale price of $13.39 this game is a no brainer.,Rust

2015-12-01,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,First I played it in somewhere around may 2014. It was then from graphics to gameplay. I said it is ok the game is alpha and i can wait. I didn't check it and I almost forgot it exists . I had 10 euros to spend in autum sales and I said that this will be the perfect game to buy. From the screenshots it looked fantastic and I thought it upgrated from what it was like but nope. I opened the game and there were 5 fps (i need to mention that my laptopo has an i7 gtx680m(4gb) 16 gb RAM) . I did some settings and it was fine (60 fps ) but they didn't added much to it. The gameplay was still sick and all you have to do was just hit with a rock in other rocks trees and barrels that contained loot. There were lots of griefers . So in my opinion it sucks and if you want to buy it i think it is better for you to wait untill the alpha/beta phase of the game ends.,Rust

2015-12-08,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,"First and foremost this is a review from someone that really didn't put much time into this game (as I asked for a refund on the first day of playing it) please do take this in consideration when reading this.So this is how it went After buying and downloading the game I entered a random server a pretty well populated one (I believe it was London 1 or soemthing like that) and after some loading managed to appear in a beach sleeping. Wild ""Fps issues"" appeared! So I turn everything on minimal (so that you know my Pc is a capable enough machine running Gta V on almost max setting without any issues) which doesn't help I get killed a couple of times before even managing to get up. I log out change setting again enter a empty server to test it still problems I try to change it from there which causes a game crash okay no problem it's unity I get it no biggie I'm sure I'll find a solution on the internet later. But on the meantime a resolution change seems to fix my problem. Cool time to play. I enter a less populated server (55 people the least populated official one at that time). I start collecting wood A guy kills me with a rock didn't say a thing just killed me for no apparent reason. Ok I try again I found a naked guy on the beach and try to approach him. Nope rock to the face manage to run away to get killed by a guy with a bow. Ok nice. Then got shot and finally got stabbed with a spear.I died uttering with my last breath ""CONGRATS M8 YOU GOT A ROCK"".So is this game nice? Sure I guess if you have enough people to play with and don't mind having to deal with players that instead of trying to survive together and kill better equipped players for their loot kill every fu***ng one that they see just because.So yeah this might be an issue solved with the magical words ""git gud"" but as far as I'm concerned I'm outta here.Pd If the community ever gets better I'm gladly coming back it's a truly unique game with enormous potential and which I regret having to run away from due to the experience I had on it. Pd2 If there was an intermediate term between recommending it and not I'd likely click that button but and this is just my opinion which I don't intend to force on anyone I don't recommend this game as per right now.",Rust

2015-09-28,0,0,1028,True,Recommended,Rust is one of those games where once you start playing time ceases to exist. A few weeks later you'll finally rip your eyes from your monitor glance at the 258 missed called on your phone and 482 texts take a and bask in the glory of your armored fortress your fancy collection of human skulls and your large wooden box filled with c4.The idea behind this game is simple survive and by survive they mean by any means necessary. Chopping wood smelting ore refining crude hunting animals building shelters crafting weapons ammo tools clothing collecting blueprints and avoiding that damn copter. Make allies and enemies form crews or play solo. The possibilities in Rust are endless.Your game play experience will highly rely on the server you join. Recommend server hopping until you find the right one for you. Game play has greatly improved with devs adding new things/fixing bugs with every patch. Out of all the survival multiplayer games out there this is definitely one not to miss and I'd say one of the top if not the best.,Rust

2016-01-06,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,As an individual who has played an astounding number of hours on rust I feel compelled to tell you why you should think twice maybe even three times over before buying this product. To start a witty game buyer rcan develop suspicions of this game by looking at the game's current state and genre. Early acess survival games combined with massive multiplayer can be great and all but when there are bugs that go unfixed and a good chunk of the community being narcissistic survivalists... this game fails at making a constant enjoyable experience for all that play. Secondly I feel the developers limit my constitutional rights by denying my right to freedom of expression. When spawned you wake up and open your inventory HUD only to find a sensor around the phallus of the player. If I want to see my players semi erect let me I have rights. Finally and most importantly if you are just a casual solo gamer you better be willing to put in a countless number hours like I have to make yourself feel a deep feeling of satisfication and accomplishment. Your stuff will be lost many times yes you will get mad yes you will encounter many warmongers its not different from minecraft lads.

2016-01-06,0,0,53,True,Recommended,"For those who have played ARK the style of gameplay is very similar.Collect items from the world around you build tools to colelct from new sources/more efficiently and don't let the vicious animals see you or they will eat your face. In Rust however there is no character creation. You all spawn as a big naked dude. Thank goodness for the pixelation or else I would have had a LOT of explaining to do to my mother.It is quite difficult to figure out what you are doing in this game especially on a server. I reccomend either finding an empty server or starting one in order to get used to what is going on. Early game it's easiest to hang around the towns where you can readily find blueprints water food and items.Right click is usually ""throw"" avoid clicking this unless you want to fling your items into the bushes to be lost forever.As far as finding your friends navigating the map is rather hard. My suggestion would be to either find a rad town and follow the road/powerlines until you locate one another or to have one person set up a quick base with a sleeping bag for the other person to spawn in.Starting as a new player on a server with established clans isn't going to work. You are going to be killed repeatedly it's going to be frustrating and you're never going to get to actually play the game. PVE servers are great for learning and the people there are usually very willing to help you along just pay attention to the rules.Helicopters are evil. If you hear a helicopter RUN. You cannot win againt this thing without some serious firepower. Hide somewhere with a decent roof and away from open windows/doors.Watch the sound levels especially when first logging on. If you think the footsteps are loud? Wait till someone sets off a shotgun near your head. I about jumped out of my skin.There are a few serious glitches in the game but nothing that absolutely breaks it. Be warned bear traps do NOT in fact work on bears. Doors can be glitched through under the right circumstances and occasionally the naked people who logged off will float above the ground for no apparent reason.Overall this is a fun game but seems to be one where you can upgrade everything to a point and then have nothing left to do. This is solved on PVP servers by having others around to attack/be attacked by however it leaves little to do for those on less populated or PVE servers. Hopefully there will be more updates for the game as I am greatly enjoying it so far and hope to continue.",Rust

2016-11-04,0,0,89,True,Recommended,I had played this for a while when it was first gaining popularity and I must say it has truly come a long ways.Gradually the game was getting more polished and the devs really listened a lot. They were also stiff when they needed to be.I like the path this game is taking. Graphics are pretty good but rendering problems will crop up once in a while on lower strength machines.The gameplay is fun but somewhat unforgiving. You also need to find a server that is just right for you. As far as combat goes I love it. There is truly many ways to go about fighting. While on the other hand there is crafting and resource gathering.It can be tedious but when you have a full set of gear and a cozy little base it truly is rewarding. This is a game that lives on the players interacting so be ready for plenty of that.Generally this is a great game and I hope it keeps going strong. I recommend this highly for people who enjoy multiplayer combat.,Rust

2016-11-04,0,0,829,True,Recommended,This game is not good for Build and defend Some of the materials used to defend bases have gotten nerfed. Example of this is the High Stone walls Health only being 750 and was 2500. Considering the thickness of the High Stone walls you would think it would be at least 4x the health of a normal Stone building wall which is at 500 this is not the case. A nerf of 2000 would have made more sense. The foundations being a main component 1000 hp being fully upgraded is not enough it would be nice to see them have more health considering the thickness of the object and importance of them.Although the building defenses seem to not be using logic or a calculator to figure out the health of objects it makes the PvP/ Raiding in the game so damn easy and makes the game fun again.Honestly if what i said i was addressed in the game i believe it would balance out the game making it great for both Raiding and Raid Defense.,Rust

In the beginning I bought it because it promised a crafting survival experience with great multiplayer capabilities.Here comes when I do admit that this is under development and still getting new content.BUT I bought this almost 2 years ago and the game have not changed and the feel of it went from survival to mad max style bandit game and in not a good way.Has absolutely no point and no ""sense"" in any way.Honestly it really seems that the developer just messing around with it rather than actually doing anything real development.The project was completely rebooted once and it managed to catch up right at that point when the old version was left... and then nothing.Ohh wait... they added procedural maps. wow.I have bought other games where you can see the developers way where they want the game to end in ""dev"" phase and have a story but this game just have not figured itself out.I can not see any way this is heading I think I just check back on it one year later and see if it is not completely abandoned...

2017-12-30,0,0,36,True,Recommended,If you have the time and friends you'll enjoy this game. If not you may have a hard time getting started because of the investment needed to progress. Many servers support mods that shorten the time required to progress considerably but even then it took me about 20 hours to get to where i wanted to be with a friend. The frustrating part is that the 20 hours you invested can be meaningless if you get raided which is a high risk depending on your location and server population. This game isn't for casual players or those who get frustrated quickly. Unless you join a pvp server you can't just hop and play. It's a high risk high reward kind of game.,Rust

2015-07-23,0,0,92,True,Not Recommended,"TL DR It's a great game awe inspiringly terrible community wonderful outlet for sick power fantasies.Rust is a mixed bag of a game and wether or not I recommend it is the hardest review decisions I've made. (after playing it some more It isn't as hard as I first thought. more on that later) The gameplay is simple and not bad at all the game flows nicely and makes sense and it looks good too. Resources are usually pretty self explanatory to gain or they flat out tell you how to make them. The base building aspect is well balanced and executed the resources are spread out competently what you and your characters learn is carried over from server to server and charactyer to character (ex. a new player may not know how to make an AR but someone who's 15th out of 83rd character saw it can) the backstory is mysterious and in the background without being nonexistent and overall the game is quite compitent. This leaves one question left. Why am I relatively turned off from this game? Well let me answer my own question with another question have you ever played public Payday 2? Without anyone you knew just random scrubs who own the server that you're on? If so this game will feel like a return to the olden days. That's not a good thing. Raiders pillagers creeps and noob abuse is not only common it's something you plan for and still fall beneat hthe mighty tread of. The way to start a solo game or even a game with one or two friends is to take your rocks and run for the hills off of spawn beach to build the beginnings of a base hidden from the prying eyes of nude greifers. The ""nakeds"" act like savages the people with guns imitate natural disasters on player populations and being in between the two phases just means that you get targeted by both. I have fond memories of paying someone for killing one of my earlier nude pursuers only for the guy to break into my house and kill me twice. Yes you Ex0. You suck. Later I met a man of similar tastes and tried to start a clan with him. The server died we moved on built a new home learned technologies had a nooby base of loyal soldiers and then got ravagted by the server's equivalent of Donald Trump. The reason for this was that we'd killed their newest emmber after he was caught sneaking up on our base and they sent ROCKETS after us while we had what we'd found on the dead guy and basic handguns for protection. We died got killed again by a different group at the second base then I gave up this pile of forever. Here's the deal should you decide that you want to check the game out further ask yourself if you can alternate between murderous paranoia and phsycotic rampages. If so Rust is the game for you. Otherwise you better be able to do one of those things really well.",Rust

2014-02-15,0,0,308,True,Recommended,For most games being in early access for as long as Rust means that no work has been done on the game and it's been left to rot by the developers. However with Rust the developers have done no such thing and have been making massive improvements and have added many new things every single week ever since the game had a massive revamp. This game has many things in its future and has many things right now. If you get this game today you'll have a ton of fun (though you should really have some friends to play with that makes it 10x better). Though I wouldn't blame you for waiting until it is fully released because when it is it'll be AMAZING. These developers know what they're doing and whether you get this game now or later you will realize this.,Rust

2015-06-11,0,0,194,True,Recommended,"Written by AndreasMy first day on the island did not go well. Waking after some unknown calamity it was only a few minutes before I stumbled upon a man made structure and encountered its owner working diligently to expand and improve his home. He was somewhat less pleased to see me however than I was to meet him. ""Leave or I kill "" he said four short words I failed to take sufficiently seriously and a few seconds later he hit me in the face with a hatchet and then again and I was dead. That's life and death in Rust an open world survival game that falls somewhere between DayZ and Minecraft and has a way of bringing out both the best and the worst in its players.A babe in the woodsRust's only goal is to survive and it's always challenging. You begin with nothing but a rock a torch and a couple of bandages and if you try to spend more than two nights out in the open in that condition you will die. It's an intimidating sink or swim introduction to the game but Rust isn't a forgiving experience. Most of the game world will do its best to kill you and while epic multiplayer battles are rare ambush murders are not. Nor are you particularly durable unlike conventional videogame characters and if somebody puts a few bullets in you you will die. Yet that fragility coupled with the near absolute freedom offered by an open world no rules arena is exactly what makes it work. ""Go forth and do whatever the hell you want"" is exhilarating.There's a primal thrill to running through the jungle like some latter day Tarzan but if you're serious about staying alive then sooner or later you'll want to build some form of shelter. Construction options are quite limited so you won't be erecting any great architectural masterpieces but having a relatively safe place to crash and store your stuff can extend your lifespan dramatically. Crafting is an even more important component of the game and while it's likewise neither particularly interesting nor flexible at this early stage of development better equipment is the key to survival. The transition from prey to predator can be tedious but once you're packing heat (and pants) the real fun begins.The conventional fauna is bad enough but there are also deadly zombies and radioactive hotspots that give the game a faint whiff of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Worst of all are your fellow players who ensure that no matter how powerful you are you're never entirely free of danger. At one point well armed and equipped after several hours I was hunting zombies near some radioactive fuel tanks. Quick double taps from my MP5 dispatched them and I was starting to feel like a real badass which is probably why I wasn't paying as much attention to my surroundings as I should have been while my attention was occupied by the inventory of my latest undead victim a pair of bandits snuck up from behind and creamed me with a shotgun.That's not to say that everyone you meet is a paranoid kill or be killed social Darwinist and in fact there's a considerable degree of cooperation to be found in some locales. But it comes cautiously while vicious violent death lurks everywhere. There are non PvP servers for those who prefer less capriciously lethal entertainment but while that cuts down on griefers it also does away with one of the most undeniably exciting parts of the game Random encounters with other human beings in which anything can happen. As frustrating as it is to be blown away without warning that pervasive uncertainty is a central part of the survival experience and Rust is vastly diminished without it.It's not too soonThe Rust alpha test is available via Steam Early Access and as you'd expect it's very much a work in progress. The graphics are no great shakes and you can expect wonky shadows occasional clipping errors and other glitches and the sound effects don't even pretend to venture beyond minimal. Lag is sometimes a challenge especially when you find yourself caught up in a spot of unpleasantness with your fellow island inhabitants and simply finding someplace to play can be a hassle Official servers tend to be crowded while unofficial ones can be unreliable. Server wipes happen with major updates so it's best not to get too attached to your stuff and there are plenty of gameplay oddities for instance every animal you kill from boars to bears provides ""chicken breasts"" for food. (I haven't found any chickens in the game.)Rust's alpha is rough but it's surprisingly playable. The underlying systems are essentially complete and functional (or at least appear to be from an outside looking in perspective) and recent updates have dramatically improved the performance of the server browser. Rust has a ton of potential and it's an intense and impressive experience even now.Price $20Release date Out now via Steam Early AccessDeveloper Facepunch StudiosMultiplayer Server dependent typically 128Link http //www.playrust.com/Play it on Dual core CPU 8GB RAM DirectX 9.0c video cardAlternatively DayZ",Rust

A small group of people (3 4) will almost always be able to overwhelm a well equipped solo player.Playing in group can be fun but finding people to play with can be difficult because 95% of people are trying to either kill you or take your things.,Rust

(papanomaly reference)So today i will give you my review of Rust and trust me its not going to be a lot because at the time of writing i only have 2 or 3 hours in game play time!So what i love about this game is the Battle Royale because you have nothing and you need to find stuff like weapons cloaths and health packs/bandages and you need to survive against other players. Its not that hard but i like it so much because i like looking for stuff and killing other players!What i do not like that much is the reloading time of the crossbow and the inventory system. I just want to 2x tick my items by clicking on them and then they automaticaly come into my hotbar. And now you need to pick and drag them and that takes a lot of time and defenetaly in battle royale.So this was my little review of this game! I hope you like it and i give it a thumb up because its a fun game!Bye bye! (If you want to play this with me you can add me ),Rust

2016-11-14,0,0,664,True,Recommended,I started with this game back in Rust Legacy in early 2014. Took a break for a little while came back and was impressed with what was done. The game is an all around solid FPS survival game but be ready to get beaten down a lot especially if you are planning on going the solo route. I played as a Solo surivior for the majority of my time played with only a bit with my brother and a few friends so I can't really rate the huge base building/organized clan efforts which is pretty impressive. The graphics have been steadily getting better and are pretty impressive. The community isn't the greatest but what game has a great community that being said I've met a lot of really cool people playing. The best aspect of this game to me is the Developers it actually seems like they care the game is constantly updating and progressing into something better. 20$ well spent. I always recommend this game to any gamer I talk to.,Rust

If you are looking for something casual and fun to play where you won't feel like you need to pour all your free time into it turn back now and find another game. The sad part is it isn't the developer's fault. Facepunch did a great job. The game works exactly as advertised. It's the community that makes the game rotten.TL DR version Game itself is a solid 6/10 but the community is a 1/10.Pros Nice graphics areas are beautiful and structures look nice Runs well no crashes or errors so far Decent building system Fun to explore as some areas give off a very creepy vibe. Neutral Grindy. Could be a pro or a con depending on your outlook. Mods can be used to make it less grindy. If you find it relaxing to go farming materials in Minecraft Ark etc. you'll enjoy this part too.Cons Lack of a true single player experience. You cannot load up a local only single player game where you are in control of what mods are used. The only way to do this is if you rent a server host at an additional cost and time setting up. If you're not interested in that you'll just have to hope you find an empty server that has mods you like and a bearable connection. The existence of other players. You will always be shot and killed on sight even if you're a brand new player totally naked with nothing but your rock and torch minding your own business. The meager belongings you have on you and the pathetic twig shack you'll cobble together after a few minutes won't be worth the gunpowder used to make those bullets but no lifer PvPers will still spray their AKs at you. On high population servers you will have no room to build and nowhere to hide. Constant wipes. Every server is constantly wiped of all content most on a weekly basis others more or less frequent. This means that whatever progress you've made you will lose. Your base your gear your collected materials gone. Even if you did manage to make a foothold for yourself somehow it will be gone soon anyways.,Rust
2017-03-30,0,0,281,True,Recommended,So since I've played this game for a while now I think I can review it...but since Im bad at reviews and theres not much to say Im just gonna talk about some experience I had in game.My first time playing Rust I managed to join a crew but not as an equal member but as a slave it was pretty cool as I got a cage outside and they gave me clothes and stuff but that night we got raided while I stayed in the cage and waited. The next day I ran into a crew from outside the walls that gave me my own base but only if I gave the sulfer every few hours. It was nothing special but being as a new player I got guns and furnaces so I was happy. This lasted for a few week until the monthly wipe.While staying on the same server I started playing solo. Since I was still new I didnt lock my doors and some people got in and killed me so I struck up a deal. I didnt have to give them anything but I wasnt aloud to shoot at them or raid them. I did as told and started building. Sooner or later my base was done and made out of stone and I happened to get someone to join my crew. This was the peak of my time on that server as we where bullying people left and right the tower was now fully metal and the loot was endless. We had so much loot we built a seperate building for it but then got raided for the first time (They didnt take much and never came back). Then the wipe happened once more and I waited to play once again.I was solo again and I had a pair of pants then I got shot and they took my pants.Over all I give this game a 10/10 not for the mechanics but for the people I played with,Rust

2016-08-14,0,0,4122,True,Recommended,REVIEW OUTDATED I have over a thousand hours in this game started in the bp system played like 20 30 hours a week. It was pure fun even in high pop servers ive also found a couple friends to play with but when they switched to XP system everything had changed. It became grindy and boring all my friends stopped playing rust.I dont want to talk about how this game beacame. I just want to ask questions. WHY developers making polls on twitter about the future of the game. Every idiot can vote even lil kids or my grandmother. Why not asking people who has some experience. Who da hell asked for this XP system why was it so important what was tha purpose? Why it doesnt matter that recommendations dropped by 20 percent? If you are planning to buy Rust i would say wait for the next discount OR tha update which allows you to use the researchbanch. But in this precise moment its boring it was so much more before.Update They added a kind of researh thing made a graphic overhaul and darkness is real. Gathering XP is still slow so solo players sucks hard but in a group the game is enjoyable.At this stage i could recommend it again.,Rust

2016-07-23,0,0,1833,True,Recommended,Rust is a very good game. The developers are extremely hard working and release a status update every week showing the amount of progress they have made. It's clear that the developers spend a lot of time creating concepts and models for the game as we constantly see detailed art for unimplemented mechanics such as the Caretaker and cars. However Facepunch doesn't always make the best decision for their game and this results in a lot of backlash against their efforts. Recently the developers released an XP system which was in development for several months and the community hasn't received it so well. Rust essentially shifted genre from a survival PVP game to a survival MMO. What's wrong with the XP system? Previously the method of progression was a system involving blueprints. You could go to radtowns for hours smashing barrels hoping to find the blueprint for an AK or high external wall but come back with nothing of use. Where the blueprint system shined was the research table. With the research table if one owned the item they wanted to be able to craft they could research the item (in its best condition) for a 30% chance of receiving the blueprint for that item which can be traded or learned. This chance could be increased by consuming an amount of blueprint fragments farmed from radtowns. This system was PERFECT. If you weren't good at pvp you could farm at radtowns for hours looking for the blueprint you want or you could trade for it. Someone who was good at pvp could roam around killing people with better gear and bring the gear back to their base and research it essentially skipping the radtown grind. With the introduction of the XP system the research table was trashed essentially FORCING YOU TO GRIND. You get XP by hitting rocks and trees picking up rocks/wood/hemp opening barrels/crates/trash piles killing animals sharing tools fishing and crafting things for the first time. Gone is the excitement of roaming with a crossbow and wood armor and hoping that you happen upon the stereotypical spray and pray large clan member who will get you that high level blueprint. You can have the item in your hands and not even know how to craft it. I have lost the excitement of killing geared people because there's no reward.No one goes to radtowns anymore even though they are the best source of XP. You have to hit rocks for days to get max level or else you will be behind everyone who has floors full of sulfur from hitting rocks. Once someone reaches c4 level they basically have hundreds of loot pinatas scattered around the map to choose from because anyone who is a decently high level will have chests full of stone and sulfur. The XP system was implemented extremely prematurely as there are no dynamic ways to level up. All of the ways you level up involve repetitive left clicking/pressing e except hunting. It's too bad the animal AI is horrendous as you can defeat a bear with a wooden spear by building a twig foundation and standing on top of it. The only way Facepunch can save this game that is quickly hurtling downhill (concurrent players went from 60k to 35k after the XP update) is by reintroducing the research table.I'm still going to recommend this game because the XP system will probably be fixed in a year and once that happens Rust will once again become my go to game. However the grindy nature of the XP system discourages casual play and causes the people who can hold left click the longest to become the kings of the server no matter how unskilled they are. Buy this game and wait until they fix the XP system to play it. It's not worth playing right now.Edit Can no longer recommend. Seems like XP system isnt getting changed which is a shame because the previous system was perfect. I can't see any players except veterans enjoying the game anymore you are forced to grind for hours to advance through the tech tree. Wow the latest update has totally changed my mind. The component system brings back the nostalgic feeling of hopping servers and making an early play to skip progression. Facepunch has finally nailed the legacy feeling and it's amazing.,Rust
2015-11-05,0,0,460,True,Recommended,"9.5/10*Crude language ahead and spelling mistakes.I've waited a long time to make a review on this game so I'll be as honest and heartfelt as I can Pros This game has given me more individual memories between my friends and I than any other game the sheer potential of a game that relies completely on player interaction in such an intimately violent medium is vast. Rust essentially gives you all the tools you ever need to be a bad person and a player's value is determined by his refusal to become this bad person or his ability to trancend into a next level of hatred who ambushes strangers plotting day and night for no end except that his target will suffer. The essential effort of Rust is to be so ruthlessly and creatively a degenerate that your opponents will stop playing Rust. When I started this game naked in the woods with a rock I admired a game with no tutorial only wonder of what my ability was. Thats the great part you never know the end of your ability. It was not long after I learned to craft my first spear that the power got to me thus beginning my two year spiral into hateful despise of all my fellow man. Soon I was sticking up the non opportuned with crude weapons just to hear how upset they were looking at how to backhandedly kill every person that stumbled my way in the desert and wood. I built an empire from the cracked skulls of the countless hordes that fell before me each one more butthurt than the last. But as Rust evolved so did it's community it's idea. Soon there were bigger fish. The previous sessions of my pals and I cutting down the poor were rustled apart by a new age of war where armored men with assault rifles ruled the land and my tactical prowess could not compensate for their brute force and firepower. I became a scavenger poking about the rusted shell of my former empire to hopefully slaughter the weak and destitute that fell in the wake of those stronger scrapping by and hiding from vicious people who walked the Earth. Like Rust I eventually evolved. The same massive encampments that had harmed me and kept me in hiding would unkowingly make me a force to be reckoned with. With large numbered forces ruling the game I was forced into a life of guerrilla warfare and everything changed the weak were now quick to bond with each other and the powerfull had become content. In no time I could band together a group of fighters with bows and arrows and a lot of hate attacking in the dark and from multiple directions abusing spawnpoints throwing desperate bodies at the enemy. Blood laden assault rifles clattered to the ground under the weight of a thousand naked bodies before the poor began to replicate the enemies stolen goods. All of the goodness had been stolen from my people and only hatred filled demons walked the Earth. We killed all in sight and ushered in an age of crippling violent paranoia the likes of which have never been seen. The world has been weakened now made even and the line between success and extermination has become forever blurred by inconsistent chaotic violence. I walk Rust now 390 hours into hell and remember every moment that I cant turn back from here. The game is very aesthetically pleasing with good lighting effects and attention to small animation details and events. Progress in game developement has been consistently effortful and players have been kept up to speed by developers Game has given me two years of enjoyable play with various friends without ever becoming too stale. Every player has lost their mind and will listen to outlandish ideas if you just role play them. Map design does a great job at forcing players to compete for resources instand proximity chat communication makes for good player interaction and seemless transition from talking to panicked shooting. The volatile nature of the combat system makes it possible for someone with 1 hour of gameplay to best someone with 400 making the game always keep you on your toes.Cons Character model is not customizable. Armor and clothes make character identification and uniforming relatively easy but I would be able to mentally invest more of myself into make character if I could build him/her from scratch. Although the Somalian pirate like nature of my code generated character and his abnormally large genitals have lead to some funny interactions I just love a game more when I can make my identity. The frequency of server wiping updates can demotivate players against large projects but the game is in Alpha and that is completely understood. Notes The game is very difficult to progress through on your own this game has been great for me being in the military because people are forced into situations where I have hours to explain my Rust eploits and win them over to it. But if you are less of a social gamer try to team up with people in game using proximity chat and work with low level people first. Starting the game working with powerful people will hurt your skills in the long run Rust is all about journey rather than destination. I wish the best of luck to anyone who plays this. It's been the source of many ""HELL ING YEAHS!!!"" and ""GOD DAMMMMIIITS!!!"" for me and I hope it can give you as much of a ride. Also there are a lot of over experienced players in Rust where my 400 hours seems like small potatos compared to a lot of players.Pro tip The Eoka Pistol can fire shotgun shells. Be wary.",Rust

2014-01-05,0,0,207,True,Recommended,This game is still in alpha so it's still got a long way to go Even still it's looking really good so far. Manage your hunger survive the cold nights build your home/base gather resources craft equipment join with players or defend yourself against them everything you'd expect from a multiplayer sandbox game. This game is especially fun with friends. However in its current state I'd still avoid recommending it because of how ridiculously easy it is to hack/exploit. My friends and I worked hard to build ourselves a heavily defended structure. It took us days to set up. During the set up we put up with multiple attacks griefers bandits 24/7 players etc. But in the end even with all of the resources and planning we put into our structure and all the crap we put up with it was all for nothing. Why? Because two s decided to hack/eploit. That's probably the biggest problem with the game. Even with everything looking great for an alpha all the effort you put into this game will all be for nothing because of a couple bored s decide to literally walk right into your base 'for the lulz' or some other like that and steal everything you've got.Besides the jackasses in the community the game is off to a great start. I'd recommend it once they at least fix this glaring issue. There are some other issues that need to be worked on specifically balancing issues removal of some items which (IMO) either shouldn't be there at all or should be made difficult find or craft. But those will be addressed over time (hopefully) If you don't mind knowing that everything you worked for could be taken away easily give the game a try. Until the exploits are fixed (at least so that it's not so easy to do it) I don't think i'll be wasting my time on this for now.UPDATEChanged to recommended now that hacking has been reduced slightly. Still not perfect but at least they're on the way to fixing the issues up.,Rust

2015-12-13,0,0,8,True,Recommended,I have a strange relationship with this game.I really really hate playing it. The world is toxic. The players are toxic. The ever impending sense of doom is hanging over your head. Logging off is a nightmare because you then can be killed in your sleep or worse you can wake up to find yourself entombed in stone.And despite me absolutely hating the game I'll still be logging in again once I get home.,Rust

2014-10-04,0,0,89,True,Not Recommended,"This game had potential. then it became popular and hackers and scummy s came. They made a anti cheat 50 thousand times better than vac but that didnt stop s from playing this. The crafting and basebuilding could have redeemed this game. that is if you couldnt get 1 hit by rocks when youre wearing the highest tier armor in the game which takes hours to get to. if you manage to go a few hours running around trying to find a biome with supplies in it you may be able to make a 1x1 shack which will eventually be broken into buy an exploiter who builds all around your front door so you cant leave. or youll find supplies and you will be rushed by a freshspawn and 1 hit while your dumb hands take 2 minutes in an attempt to wrap a cloth around a rock to make a hatchet. even then you will be 1 hit by a freshspawn because this game doesnt like it when someone is succesful. upon going into a server with 180 people in it i asked in the chat if anyone has succesfully made a gun. this is a server which is 2 days away from being reset. the only real reply i got was ""i made a bow once but a guy with a rock killed me before i could finish crafting it"" 10/10 would get wolf meat from a pig again.*EDIT a year and a half later this game is great but the community is kinda cancerous",Rust

2014-06-02,0,0,54,True,Not Recommended,I feel this game is more of a social experiment than it is a game basically lord of the flies with naked adults really. It is often not fun to play and can feel like work while you get bludgened shot irradiated and hungry. You slowly gather resource and build better gear while getting a lay of the land. Then your time and effort into the game starts to pay off you'll have a base know where to gather resources and have a basic understanding that everyone else who plays this is an (even the admins). I have had one friendly experience out of countless much less than so. Then you'll connect to your home server to find that you've awoken not where you fell asleep last. You commit suicide a few times getting reasonably close to where you think your base is only to find it's been raided and someone else has claimed it as their own with all our implements to take it back safely locked inside.,Rust

2016-08-25,0,0,65,True,Recommended,Rust as many of you know is a full survival game. The survival aspect of this game is pretty spot on. Where as most survival games you need to work hard to get enough food to survive but you also have to do it with caution as the wild life in this game can be pretty ferocious. A boar is just as dangerous as a wolf or bear. There are many servers with plenty of players. The are a fair amount of cheaters but not as bad as in early Rust. Since the game doesn't have a PvE setting you have to kill or be killed and you will most likely not get shown pity or any remorse for trying to be friendly. There are some servers that are PvE and the owners will punish you for killing players. A good one is Plague's PvE. Plague (the owner) is pretty cool and has a good community and the people are nice. Rust has a dynamic survival feature that many games I've seen/played don't have. It has caves that can go on for ages fish traps copying the genes of plants to grow your farms production and the everyday struggle of getting food water ores wood and variety of other items you'll need to survive Rust. Their are plenty of weaponry ranging from spears to bows to guns even to a flame thrower (who doesn't love using a flame thrower on that bear at your door P). Get your group of friends get your trusy rock and go play Rust,Rust
2017-07-17,0,0,2635,True,Recommended,If PVP is not your thing I wouldnt recommend it. If PVP and the community that evolves during such is your thing its great. Peace through force of arms. Avoid the hackers go to a community server. Id suggest one but I dont want hackers to come to it. There is no FRIENDLY.. till you kill each other enough an alpha appears. No naked toons are NOT safe. Dont believe ANYONE is a good rule of thumb. ( it IS! early access so keep that in mind ),Rust

The one thing that I can say is the game is what you want it to be...If you want to be a PvP'er it's there.If you want to be a builder gatherer it's there. Every game that has multiple players on it will have good eggs and bad. If you're getting fragged on one server find a nicer one. I've been fortunate to have found a lot of good people on here. I have many fond memories of teaming up with strangers to have a great experience.You will die.... many times.

2018-01-05,0,0,880,True,Recommended,"Yes I do recommend the game. Unfortunately though it has the most toxic community you will ever encounter online. Definitely try a few servers to weed out the bad ones as there are SOME servers which have fair play rules. Dont for a second think you are safe just because you joined a server and are naked with just a rock and nothing for anyone to steal from you because 90% of the people who play this game are people who dont pick on people their own size so to speak (meaning players who at least have some sort of weapon or armour). The fact that you just joined a server and have nothing and the next person who has been there for a week or two has an ak heavy armour and tons of bullets and resources in a very high security base means nothing to them. A normal person would leave you alone to start the game allowing you to get to a point where you would represent a challenge to them but they dont want a challenge. They will shoot you on the spot call you a noob regardless of your thousand hours on record and to them thats ""winning"". In other words dont hate on this game as much as you probably would within the first month of playing. Try a few servers get killed a million times by idiots as described above eventually find a server that has players who actually treat the game as it was meant to be played and not as a pvp haven and profit.I give the game a 35/47",Rust

2014-01-07,0,0,14,True,Recommended,It's still early access and heaps is being changed but this is is definitely going be a great game. I currently feel like if anyone got into the hut I'd built it'd be like starting the game all over again (which it would because I'd have nothing) so if there was some way to definitely prevent that that'd be great. 1,Rust
2014-01-07,0,0,9,True,Recommended,It's a game with a lot of potential I would recommend buying it now if you have the patience to wait until they finish the game because it's cheaper on alpha. But as it is right now in my opinion the game will only be entertaining if you have one or more friends playing with you And you will have a lot of trouble trying to find your friend because tere is no map or system that makes it easier. So overall I'm expecting a lot from the game in the future and if you like the concept you should buy it.,Rust

2014-01-07,0,0,25,True,Recommended,Rust is an open world PvP sandbox in which you must survive. Build your base hunt animals scavenge ruins for loot and live to see another dawn. Think Minecraft crossed with Day Z.The idea and for the most part execution is brilliant. Considering this is in alpha it looks stunning and the crafting system is intuitive enough and will at least tell you what you need to make something. I spent hours crafting walls forging my weapon and ammo to survive in this unforgiving land. The community was helpful and we thrived made fun of each other and traded. It was a great time.Then one day I was running home and a bloke shot me with five of his mates. All my loot gone for no reason. I respawned in my house neaby only to have the wall blown off and bed murdered yet again my sleeping bag destroyed and my spawn point lost. This is what will make Rust fail the overly toxic community. Fine steal my stuff. I get PvP it's a survival game and no one is safe. But destroying the sleeping bag is deliberately being a prick for the sake of it. It's actions like this and people who don't want to go to a PvE server and fight against the bandit players (because your stuff can still be blown up in a PvE environment) that will fracture the playerbase in to the Lord Of The Flies 'kill anyone you can see' attitude. The idea of game is that you can progress. With relatively little effort prospective months of progress can be lost when you're not even online and the hours will count for nothing. This is the one major flaw with Rust.The rest however is fantastic. Get on a PvE no sleeper server and log off with all your valuables on you and fall in love with a beautiful survival game that will suck away your weekend.,Rust
2014-01-07,0,0,38,True,Recommended,it's fun. i love surviving games like this. farming building and communicating with other people.but once you die in this game you lose everything you have and have to go all over again except you have a safehouse with sleeping bag on where you can respawn at. this is great but compared to other rpg game things to do are limitted.,Rust
2014-07-20,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,Almost but not quite for me anyway. I will stick with it though and see how it develops over time.I purchased DayZ and 7 Days to Die (7DTD) as well as Rust in hopes to find a good survival game to play with my sons. Though all 3 are still in Alpha I've had the most fun so far with 7DTD. I'm a Walking Dead fan and playing 7DTD gives me that same feeling of man vs zombie and other men and resources and time and on and on... If I had to rank the 3 I would go 7DTD DayZ Rust.As far as Rust specifically I like the open world sandbox concept the idea of survival of the fittest teaming with others to advance personal and team goals the graphics...I don't like difficulty in finding critical resources early (i.e. stone food) being completely defenseless as soon as the game starts (maybe a 1 2 day grace period to give you some time to get just a bit settled before getting shot in the face for your measely 5x stone and 20x wood) or start you off with a small amount of the critical resources lack of crafting depth (though I think this will change as the game develops so not a big concern).If you can wait then wait. No need to rush in and get this one right now.,Rust

2014-07-23,0,0,28,True,Not Recommended,"So let me start off by saying that the game itself is pretty good. Sure it has bad design in some places and sure some things don't work but this is all to be expected as the game is in early access. While all of this is true the community surrounding Rust does not match up to it.Lets start off with my very first experience in game. I first log in alone and try to get wood (as you must in most survival games). There are a few houses in the general area but I think nothing of it and keep chopping. Needless to say I was immediately team killed by a group of two people. Angry I respawn and look for my house but seeing as there is no map system whatsoever I get hopelessly lost and decide to find another area to start over. I am killed again.This cycle occurs over and over again and while at first it adds to the survival aspect of the game you soon realize that most of the people that kill you are either on godmode or using aimbots. Almost everybody people in the game kill on site and even if you get lucky it's hard to continue when admins are always destroying your stuff for fun.After a day of not touching the game my friend comes online and I phone him up so we can play the game together (I bought it for him too originally expecting a game that would be fun with others). We spent an hour trying to get the game to not lag on his computer (A half decent Asus machine) and finally opened it up. This start revealed an entirely new issue not all of the servers were on both of our lists. We spent a bit finding a server and eventually logged on.Trying to find another player in Rust is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. We spent hours trying to look for each other with such dialogue as ""Are you next to a mountain"".""Yeah""""Is it a big mountain""""No"" etc.One person would look for forty minutes only to have the other be killed by a hacking player or abusive admin. We finally met up only to be killed by a twelve year old screaming something into his microphone about us being ""noobs"". Needless to say it wasn't a fun experience and despite finding each other multiple times the longest we were ever together was around ten minutes.Despite my current seven or so hours of gameplay only about one to two hours of that was actually spent playing the game while the other five to six hours were spent trying to find my friend or trying to run from a bunch of naked players with way better guns than me (fun at first gets old quick).When it all comes down to it rust has some fun aspects however they are masked by the constant player level imbalance irresponsible admins and the amount of people that hack the game. I am sure that over time they will improve whether it be adding better systems to get rid of hackers or adding better ways to report people. Either way all I have to say is do not buy the game in its current state. One to two hours is not enough to justify 20 dollars being spent.",Rust

2016-01-02,0,0,208,True,Not Recommended,"What a stupid game. I'm using the term ""Game"" here sort of loosely. You have an open environment and a fairly interesting crafting system punctuated by a user community of trolls and retardation that somehow manages to be worse than the worst bronze hell lobby on League of Legends.With absolutely no real way to secure your developments in the game even with the best upgrades and equipment the minute you log out you can generally expect to log in again with all of your equipment missing and all progress reset by other community players.They really should have called this ""Futility The Game"". Spending money on this is ill advised you may play it for a weekend and then move onto something much more interesting and less infuriating.",Rust

2015-10-13,0,0,368,True,Recommended,Things I've learned from Rust 1. Never ever trust anyone2. You CAN hide an Assault Rifle in your when naked3. 5 makeshift shotguns is better than one better gun4. Groupthink is real5. There are no consequences to eating another person.6. Practice Taoism. Nothing is permanent. In fact everything will go away very very fast.7. When life gives you lemons use those lemons to beat other people into an unrecognizable puddle and take their lemons. Then use their lemons to kill more people to accumulate massive amounts of lemons. Then retreat with your stockade of lemons to a safe location that looks like nothing and protect it well so you can go out using the same amount of lemons you would have used after killing the first person over and over again until all of your lemons go bad and the world destroys your home and there's nothing left to do but cry about how many lemons you wasted and how you just got amazing super explosive lemons and now it's all gone forever and you have to do it all over again so you decide to swear off lemons for a while only to crave them later like a depressed hopeless housewife to an abusive relationship (not to make light of domestic violence those are horrible situations and anyone who puts their spouce or children in the way of domestic abuse deserves to be lynched and castrated.)7. Chickens are ing worthless.10/10 would take your lemons and leave you in disrespectful positions again.Also I think 350 hours of entertainment is well worth $20 and if you don't you can go suck your own randomly generated privilaged,Rust

Get chased by 20 nakeds screaming allahuakbar10. DieRust is a really fun sandbox game if yoo are into pvp and being competetive this is a good game for you. If you don't like starting over don't get this game. You tend to start over a lot because people in the game aren't very nice. Otherwise talking about performance. You will need a decent pc to run the game well. They are working on optimization but that could take a while. All in all I'd give this game a 9/10.,Rust
2015-10-13,0,0,285,True,Recommended,A very good game 9/10It has a few bugs like animals glitching through walls and they also jump up rocks but the gameplay is mint.I definately reccommend this game!!,Rust
2015-10-13,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,rust is an amazing free survival game but it takes about 10 30 mins to load up and then it take about 10 mins to load the server and then on top of that it freezes and then closes down so when you have worked your bum off for about 2 hours farming and it randomly closes you have to wait about 20 40 mins to be able to get your player to a safe place and hope no one has seen your random body on the floor and kill/looted you (9.9 times of of 10 they have) So basicly the concept of rust is amazing but the game at this moment is really really really bad,Rust

2015-12-31,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,A sadist s wet dream that s what this game is. It can be a fun romp with friends that s for sure but past that point...well things get rough. The one true enjoyable experience that I have had within the game consisted of me strumming a guitar while my friends and I were running from a hail storm of sniper rounds and sure I admit this random player curated aspect of Rust is quite enjoyable but that is not how I play these games. I am a builder and the fact of the matter is that I cannot get past putting up the third wall. If one has any aspirations of thriving or having fun as some call it you would need to live by razor thin margins in terms of how much if the game you would actually want to experience. As a naked you are at the whim of anyone and anything and while that may seem fun at first. The fact of the matter is that you won t be able to get past that point very easily and if you were to try you would end up doing nothing but losing your items to someone else and wasting a few hours of your time. Rust is an RPG that brings out quite literally the worst in all who play it me included and quite frankly if you are not someone who calls other people fam and actively participates in the t meme culture that is all so popular these days you will not like this game because that seems to be its whole player base and they have no chill once so ever. You will be shot and killed a plenty and left to start again. Past my personal view if you are someone who likes to befriend and join clans to screw over weaker people well you re a sadist and this is the game for you!,Rust

2015-12-31,0,0,313,True,Not Recommended,One of the best survival games on Steam but given the field of survival games that isn't saying much. Gameplay mechanics are intuitive but the community makes this game like all survival games almost unplayable by yourself. Without a squad of friends you'll spend the majority of your time collecting resources only to be shot in the back. Since resources are scarce it's almost impossible to build a proper base without investing more than a few hours into the game. If you can play with a small group of friends Rust is enjoyable. But if you plan to play alone you're wasting your time and will find yourself very often outnumbered and outgunned in encounters with other players.,Rust

2016-01-27,0,0,183,True,Recommended,This is a ing wierd game and let me tell you why it's so but so fun. Reasons it is &gt They strayed from Legacy style (Which was smooth the effects were nice the rads actually worked)&gt It's buggy as all hell.&gt Hacking is more than out of control.&gt The devs don't listen to the players.&gt It runs like absolute (For the first 30 minutes on max I run at 60 fps and then I drop to about 10. My friend with a 970 I have a 960 can't even max this where a 750 ti could max legacy rust)&gt Building system is ed up.&gt Blueprints (in the regular experimental) are way too random.&gt Don't even get me started on the community.&gt The gun sound effects are dull and boring.Reasons it is fun &gt Buggy as hell&gt Easy multiplayer experience (DON'T PLAY ON OFFICIAL SERVERS)&gt Fun to goof around with friends&gt Fun PvP&gt Derpy dongersOverall if you like survival sandbox type games this game is fun but the fps is often unbearable and the people are ing toxic. I'd say yes but that's only because I like this game type and I think it's still moving along faster than DayZ. I love this game it has a great art style and they're getting around to doing optimizations. I'd recommend and I think it's way better with friends.,Rust

Though two years later after launch this game really did come a long way. It still could use some work but it is actually worth playing. The game is ONLINE ONLY and cannot be played in singleplayer.

Cons server wipes you will work hard to build a wonderful house and the next thing you know youll log in and every thing will be gone the game is still in alpha meaning its not yet finished admin abuse (in community servers) lag and fps drops (I have a gtx970 and rust s it over for some reason??) overall since the game is not finished i cant recommend that you play it yet although if you do buy it you are supporting rust to get better. you should at least wait until server wipes arent a thing or are very rare and the game is out of alpha.,Rust

2016-01-23,0,0,336,True,Not Recommended,ForewordFirst and foremost this is a game with great potential however I will state that it is unplayable in its current format yet I feel that this could be bigger than minecraft if properly implemented.IssuesFirst IssueHackers have completely overrun this game and grief on a industrial scale for fun. Due to the steam refund policy Hackers use a 24 hour window to cause mayhem then get a refund and a fresh steam account and proceed to start the same circle of griefing. Nothing has been done by Facepunch Studios or Steam on this issue and for the foreseeable future this will continue to blight this game meaning any protracted amount of time in game will be ruined eventually by hackers.Second IssueThe second issue is that this game used to have a Minecraft style of play where you could delete entire buildings but this changed later on to prevent people from wiping player buildings. What has occurred is that servers are now loaded up by half finished structures and this has caused major issues with latency (think of playing on a server with 300 400 ping and you have a clear picture how frustrating it gets). AfterthoughtsTreat this game as a hard alpha if you must buy it but I would make a personal recommendation to wait until this is in beta and the 2 issues above are fixed.,Rust

2015-11-29,0,0,80,True,Not Recommended,So much potential and compltely squandered. Being there the moment the server resets is key. If everyone was on the same level as the skill required to shoot a bow it'd be fine....I've dodged dozens of bow shots in a row but unfortunately the guns are brain dead. Zero skill involved. So once the server approaches gun saturation just concede. There's no fun to be had. If you do give it a shot there's a very good chance that even if you're insanely cautious you'll be the victim of hackers that wall in your respawn spot (There is absolutely no reason to do such a thing other than to grief not to mention they shouldn't be able to get to such respawn spot but hey you installed that AWESOME anti cheat right?DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

You'll need to learn things such as basebuilding shooting knowing what and when to craft certain items the proper way to stay away from others who/when to engage in bandit fun learning what is raidable and way way more.Don't expect to be good at this game 3 hours after you get it don't expect 50 expect closer to 300 hours before stuff starts to make sense and you're kicking other people around rather than being the kickee.This is a game you start every Thursday when the update comes out and build a base after all the servers wipe you don't start in the middle of the week unless you're looking to get totally destroyed.Stick with it it's one of the most unique and incredible games I've ever played even if it makes me want to break everything around me.,Rust

2016-02-09,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,First of all this game is NOT for solo players. If you want to play it by yourself you won't have as good of an experience as if you played with friends. I recommend playing with at least two other people.My #1 problem with this game is that it is wayyy too difficult to raid. They nerfed tools to the ground so that it takes like 200 pickaxes just to break through a stone wall. This is completely illogical. The best way to break into a base is with rockets or C4. But good luck doing that because it will take you 100 hours just to get enough C4 for one raid. The most frustrating thing is that it takes 8 C4 to break down a wall that it took no more than 10 minutes to create. 8 C4 will take you at least 25 hours to make.. 25 hours for 10 minutes of work... ok.If you don't want to play a grindy game like your typical MMO don't play this game. If you have a lot of friends who will play with you and love doing the same thing over and over for hours for a small reward this game might be fun.I enjoyed the game at first but once I realized how much of a grind it was I felt like I was playing Runescape all over again.If I were to offer some constructive feedback for the game it would be some things like.. Add an advanced leveling system so that the more you play the easier it will be to gather resources. This means that even if you get raided and lose 100 hours of work you will still keep your levels so it won't feel like you are starting over from scratch every time. Increase the damage and durability of tools when hitting buildings. Add boats for crossing water and let people ride horses on land More random events less rain Try to remove the grindy feel from the game. Remove/Reduce griefing. Let people do something like set an area as personal property (like with the build cupboard). If your house gets raided then the raider can decide whether he wants to steal your house or not. If he does then he can take over your tool cupboard and place walls and stuff. Otherwise he cannot. Limit the amount of 'property zones' you can have so people don't just place them randomly all over throughout the map. It's really dumb to have someone come in to your house place walls all over and ruin it and then not even keep the house.Hopefully this game will make some solid progress and I can change my review. For now I'm definitely not recommending it to people.,Rust
2016-02-10,0,0,194,True,Recommended,10/10 Rust is a grinding game but has some awesome graphics. You will die...alot be it by bear wolf human or your own stupidity. As of 02 10 16 hogs horses wolves bears and deer can go through rocks you cannot...so if you are hunting them it can get frustrating. The building structure is where you will probably spend most of your time I think it is one of the best parts crates are too heck most of this game is great especially for an alpha build. The developers are constantly upgrading and I cannot wait to see what is instore for the game next!,Rust

2015-11-04,0,0,199,True,Recommended,Let me just tell you how this game works. You run around and have fun gathering materials to build your base and arsenal. You do this for a few hours get a good base going and are all around having a fun time. You then decide to get off for the day. You log back on the next day to continue progress on your base and you are on the beach with nothing as a fresh spawn. You teleport back to your base to see that it was raided and is now rubble. You then switch servers and repeat the process it just keeps looping. Still a fun game but the community is ruthless. THEY WILL RAID ANY BASE THEY WANT AND WILL KILL ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THEIR WAY.,Rust

2017-03-19,0,0,2,True,Recommended,WARNING I said yes because I know its a good game and I've had good experiences with it OUTSIDE of my pc. The reason why I don't recommend it to everybody is because on my mac computer (Sorry! But this review may only apply to mac users) the load time's are ridicoulously long. If you can believe me on this but it took 45+ minutes to get onto my first server. Then graphics are an issue. The textures don't render properly sometimes and the framerate is so slow I couldn't interact with anything. That doesn't mean the game is bad. It's really fun (I've played on my friends way to expensive gaming pc and I had a blast!) But until the dev's can fix issues with the mac its not very friendly for mac users.,Rust

2013-12-28,0,0,61,True,Recommended,For old review look below. REVIEW First of all this was written on the 26th of November 2015. Some things may have changed since then (now for me)First the basics of the game.Graphics Sound and Performance 4/5Highest settings take quite a beefy setup but I can get a fairly steady 30FPS on medium settings.The ambient sound effects are alright but I don't hear them much.The game looks amazing when you have a good computer.I will now review the gameplay in 2 ways a busy (50 100 player) PVP server(A) and a PVE server(B).Combat/Hunting A) 3/5 For a game where everyone is instantly hostile the combat could be improved/made more realistic (like Fallout's crippling system making hitting the legs better) B) 4/5 The animals are difficult to kill sometimes from the AI both helping and hindering at the same time.AI A+B) 4/5Sometimes it is very realistic as hostiles will follow for ages and the movement speed is just right for hunting but I have seen horses run up vertical cliffs.Building A) 3/5The system is good but the community just tears it apart.B) 5/5I would have been happy with this game if all I got was this building system. It is complex yet easy to learn and upgrading is the easiest thing to do. The construction cost is balanced.Community A) 1/5My experience is that as soon as another player finds you they will follow you with a rock till you or they die. building is a nightmare if you are on a raid server.B) 5/5The server I am on most of the time has great admins players and we all respect each other. No hostility just the beauty of the games graphics.Overall Score A) 3.5/5B) 4.5/5Would recommend for the PVE only recomend PVP to people who are good at or like that sort of thing. OLD REVIEW written approx. March 2014?Gameplay wise this is great. But... (obviously a but as its a downer) The Community. Is. The Worst.

Very well maintained and updated by the Devs and they do play and listen to the community. But almost every server ends up a version of Lord of the Flies. You will lose everything often. But when you learn how to survive your base can last days. Just dont give up and practice with a bow.,Rust

Review To spawn in naked and quite literally clueless can sometimes push newcomers away rendering the game too frustrating for them. YouTube is your friend here. Watch tutorials to understand the game's mechanics. Find some friends to enjoy the game with as you learn. It's a game of survival and the most valuable tool you have to survive is game knowledge. That and an AK of course!,Rust
2014-10-29,0,0,28,True,Not Recommended,Honestly the game itself is pretty good what ruins it is the fact that every single person you come across will probably want to kill you. This game is littered with hackers too it's awful. there's absolutely no way that I've found to deal with them either. it's nearly impossible to get any sort of team together unless you have some friends or you're a youtuber and it's nearly impossible to survive for long without getting your head blown off by some jackass who feels like shooting something. And I hate how easy it is to destroy someone's base. I hate how you can work on something for months and then in 2 minutes it's just gone because some jackass stored up c4 or some hacker was feeling like ruining someone's day and you just happened to be in his crosshairs. If you do want to play it do it with a large group of friends maybe 20 or so to defend a base with or just on a small server that has maybe 4 or 5 people on it. I'd say don't waste your money wait until the game gets updated a bit more and is a bit less crazy with naked idiots with shotguns. Also I don't have the best computer but it can run games pretty well at medium settings and on this game even on the lowest settings the game still runs like sh*t.,Rust

2015-11-04,0,0,258,True,Recommended,"It's DayZ but so much better. Very much PvP survival as the PvE aspect doesn't pose too much threat. The building aspect is well done maybe a little too central. Somewhat grindy but worth it. Most advancement is researched based so some exploration is needed in order to find ""blueprints"" to craft better things. You can make some pretty freaking awesome super forts which are overkill for playing on an empty server so give yourself a challenge and make yourself a target.

The DOWNside... you will get INSANELY deppressed when logging back in to find your armor fortefied bunker is little more than a memmory just a few hrs prior. Skills are kept as any new tech learned at a research table. The theme seems to be dont give up when you're wasted and reawakening on the all too familiar beach with but a Torch and a Rock.,Rust

Havent played enough to know what all has changed but one thing is for sure...THAT HELICOPTER IS WAY WAY WAY TOO AGRESSIVE NOW! Used to be that when you heard it coming you could hide in a bush or up against a rock and 9 times out of 10 it wouldnt see you. This time it killed me from quite a long distance and I didnt even see it coming. I faintly heard it so I ducked down into a bush. Didnt help any! There are not enough places to hide from it. I for one dont like to die and loose all my stuff that I worked hard to get. My home in the rock cave is gone now too so I am starting completely over which sucks. If it wasnt for a friend helping with supplies I would have to wait until a day I can just sit here for hours on end (which I dont mind doing just dont always have that much time) to collect more resources and build my home all over again.,Rust

2015-11-06,0,0,114,True,Recommended,At first the community seems to be quite horrible but when you dig you just realize that it's way friendlier than it seems. Competitivity is a huge part of that game and you'll have to deal with it but like everywhere else it gets cooler when you get to know other players. Always be extremely careful make sure to trust the right people and this game will become one of the greatest experience you'll ever know.On the technical side this game is a memory CPU and GPU hog. However developers are always improving the engine. One month ago it would've ran at 10FPS if I pushed the settings on max on my GTX970. Now it runs at 30FPS avg on max settings.Last advice Try out those high drop rate servers they're quite great if you can't invest yourself that much or just to learn the basics before going on vanilla servers.,Rust

It could be difficult to find a trustworthy friend but why not. Just find a random and play with him 3 You trust him so much you live in the same house and then you finish all the work and go sleep 4 Guess what you got raided by him 5 Uninstall rust 6 Go watch some anime! ),Rust

So i went back to the house i was building to carry i as wasnt letting be killed stop me but the same group kept on raiding me so i could not enjoy the game at all.

So far optimizations are far from good. 16GBs of RAM as recomended memory says it all. I have those also good graphics card (AMD 390 8GB) and yet frames can drop from 80 to 3 in a blink for no reason. Restart the game fixes it. But also FPS drops happen in most of the battles not so big but really annoying. I know it's an alpha and they are working on the game everyweek but they need to adress the optimization so everyone can play with powerful computers and more common ones and feel a smooth play.,Rust

Only problem though is the fact that the devs keep adding in roleplay stuff instead of guns and other pvp items one other problem is the occasional lag.

I like the learning and evolution from naked and with a stone to guns and armor from just a campfire to a fortress. pretty good game in general. 50% of the community are friendly where as the other 50% are trolls and asses. THE ONE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS GAME!you have a building Cabinet which allows/prevents players to/from building in a radius around the cabinet. you think ""Great my house is safe from people building up to my 2nd floor which has windows. and my first floor doesnt."" WRONG!Rust has a mechanic to where if youre not allowed to build in the building zone you cant build. but if youre just outside the building zone you can build in it. thus allowing players to build where they are not authorized and thus defeating the purpos of the cabinet and the safety of your home.As i said before I like this game alot because of 50% of the community and the concept of the game i WILL not play this game untill the issue with the cabinet is fix.I dont not recommend this game to anyone who Does not like getting raided Does not like getting raided because of a mechanic flaw Does not like getting killed by bears.",Rust

2015-08-28,0,0,145,True,Not Recommended,Old rust was amazing beyond belief me and a few of my friends would all play together and it was a blast but then the devs were like .. Lets make it graphicly pleasing for console kids and remake our early release game to being an early early release game. You basicly need a NASA supercomputer to run it with good fps and for the envirnment to not look like a patato. But they added all these new items like a guitar and you can draw paintings in game its soo kooool you might say. and your right they have added new things like that into the game. Does it make up for the lost charm old rust had? or a map that you could navigate? or even the radtowns and how critical they were. The game keeps moving forward and maybe in a year it will peak my interest to try it out again until then im done with this game and i'd stay away from the game unless its super cheap and you want to try it.

Further more in order to be able to even connect to a server you need at least a connection of 15 megabits or more. So if you have ATT you're out of luck!

At the moment its the equivilent to buying a toilet that doesnt flush. Pointless.

Wolfs in this game are true ninjas (running out from the rocks) You can shoot freshly spawn pen...players! Crafting and building system is cool If you log out you will get raided and players will kill you when you sleep so the gameplay is endless! ISN'T THAT COOL TO LOSE ALL ITEMS AND START GAME FROM THE BEGGINING? I wasn't payed to tell what I don't like about this game so,Rust
2015-08-31,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,You'll awaken naked on a beach and immediately begin hitting things with rock to scrounge whatever meager tools you can quickly improvise. It will feel familiar if you've played any other hi res Minecraft clone. You may start to make plans or mentally assess your surroundings but really none of that will matter.Within a few minutes a nine year old with auto aim will tag you with a spear giggle like a sociopath or clumsily insult you and then you'll get to listen as he carves the meat from your still twitching body.This is the chief issue your first five minutes of Rust and the subsequent hours are going to play almost the exact same way.You can join others if you are lucky in whatever defensive structure they've managed to erect. But this game does not incentivize teamwork AT ALL it incentivizes exploiting people to do your heavy lifting for you. Ultimately you'll be betrayed by one or more of your members all they have to do is type your four digit password in Steam chat to a member of a raider clan and that's the ballgame.Because of this heightened tension you are as likely to be killed by your allies as you are by your enemies due in no small part to everyone looking like everyone else. You can also be easily overrun or simply killed and farmed repeatedly by raiders while trying gathering resources outside the walls until your entire operation becomes anemic.Clothes are tricky to build because you either have to enter the killing fields of the forest to gather hemp or somehow spear the very few animals which spawn. There is no farmable crop to produce cloth or wood. And because you will be killed often you (and virtually everyone you meet) spend most of this game with your pixelated dong flopping in the breeze.People have logged over 800 hours in Rust and there's a reason for that. There's something to the appeal of a game where you have to struggle and suffer for every inch. If you enjoy titles like The Forest and The Long Dark where you are actively hunted at all times Rust will offer a superior experience. Human players are infinitely more creative and brutal than AI regulated MOBs.There are two core issues 1) Rust is easy to hack because of the Unity system.I saw several players glitch through walls and a few flying through the air. A persistent and authoritative moderator could mitigate this but it would take an exhaustive amount of effort. The Steam Anticheat protocols help but they do not remedy every issue. And any game can be ruined by hacking eventually but when it's this simple it becomes pervasive.2) The Rust community is god awful. They often have severe personality issues and tend to make the experience feel cheap. Their schemes are largely transparent their jokes are cringey and the game mechanics bring out the worst in almost every single one of them. If you're a functioning adult the experience will likely be nauseating. You can to an extent alleviate this by playing on a lower volume server or running it on a password coded private server with a 7 10 friends.A few elements could improve Rust a greater level of terrain destruction the ability to fabricate autoturrets a larger animal population. But at that point you might as well play a game which already features those elements H1Z1 Ark DayZ 7 Days to Die or Life is Feudal to name a few.If you have a book report due on Lord of the Flies and you're having difficulty getting the tone of the work or if you really enjoyed the 1994 film No Escape you should play Rust. If you want to see measurable semi permanent progress in a game you into which you sink hundreds of hours play almost any other survival/crafting title.,Rust

The developers are constantly adjusting the game and trying to make it a better experience. Ive played through the BP and XP crafting system and the new component crafting system is by far the best. There are always servers that are populated (albeit KOS'ers) and there are community oriented servers as well. If you're a fan of survival style shooter games then you need to get a copy of Rust.,Rust

I love the building in it even though sometimes I just wanna build through a rock like I use to be able to do! or build to the sky! but it changes to make it more realistic... sort of. lol. but again great game especially if you find a great server like I have. amazing people and just fun to play.,Rust

2014-11-18,0,0,386,True,Recommended,MY RUST ADVENTURES SO FAR wake up surrounded by wooden houses start running in the opposite direction into a field. At that point I had to go to the bathroom so i did when i came back my head was getting bashed in with a rock. i died respawned got a better start this time. I got wood metal and almost had enough materials to start making a house (even though those are not very good idea) but i wanted to anyway. i made a metal door and a little wood hut and went out with my bow feeling confident to look for some more metal for a gun. was walking along when all of the sudden a pack of red eyed and furred wolves started chasing me. I started to run and try to shoot them with my bow. I was low health stumbling up a mountain with just 2 more wolves chasing me. i had run out of medkits and was running towards a cliff with 8 health left and still wolves chasing me so i tried to jump to the next ledge but sadly missed... the next thing i knew i was in a field with some naked guy standing next to me threatening me with a rock for all my tuna (i'm guessing he is a pauseunpause fan) and so when i said i had none he started running at me with a rock i instinctively tried to hit back and we were in at that point running around swinging giant rocks at each other like mad men. all i could hear in the background when we were fighting was we are the champions playing from the other guys mic... So after a long rock battle i finally smashed his head in and ran away with his rock at that point a group of 4 people in kevlar came from the mountins came running at me screaming at me for me to give them everything i had. i did and they repayed me by blasting me in the head with a shotgun. so after i woke up again nothing really exiting happened so i worked my way up to getting a waterpipe shotgun and a revolver and a 2 story 1 x 1 shack. eventually those same people in the kevlar (at least i think it was them) came to my humble abode started to break in i killed one as they smashed down my door with c4 i pipe shotgunned him in the face ran up to the roof and made my last stand there shooting at them with my revolver untill they at last killed me with a bunch of M4s.REALLY fun game 10/10 will play againEDIT This is about a year and a half later and I can honestly say that this is probably one of the most unique epic fun and intense games I have ever played. I wish I could triple recommend this game. The only thing is that you NEED as in this is a necessity to get the full effect of the game to have a medium to high end computer to really get the feel for the game. The graphics are absolutely stunning. And the sound effects are literally the best in any game i have seen. There is honestly nothing like sitting on a hill watching a huge base being torn apart by a attack helicopter while the inhabitants desperately try to defend themselves. Hearing the explosions and seeing the huge balls of flame as missiles rain down is worth the 20$ alone.Some of my favorite times in this game come from what is called the purge night on the rustified server. Where admins start giving out guns and spawning in like 5 10 helicopters is an experience that is only found on rust.In all I can't say enough about how amazing this game is.... the only thing is that this game makes you rage extreamly hard as well... something about working hours on a base and gearing up only to have some other guys with better gear come and kill you and take all your work is a bit aggravating to say the least.,Rust

2015-11-02,0,0,83,True,Recommended,A story by a noob.So dispite all the hateful things my friends told me about the game I decided to get it.I joined a server with with around 40 people online a little bit after joining the server it was getting could and dark and I needed a shelter so I'd then ask my fellow peers how to build after countless request for help I'd then have to try to figure it at three minutes after I finaly found out how the next morning I was really running low on food and needed to go hunting If I'd like to live any longer I walked outside and wen't to the near by river and was sniped (it was a head shot)luckly the server had a tp home otherwise i would of never found my house. after my failed attempt to hunt (and survive)I planned on fortifying my house to protect from raiders I went mining and began very fastly began making my base a place raiders could not get into. (so I thought) two days later I saw to men walking a bit to close to m base so I fired a few warring shots to prove a point (they had lowgrade gear on clothing) moments after they bolted and were no were to be found two nights later I was working on making blueprints for the ak I found durring that day I then would start to see things that pointed towards a raid on my base it was extremely dark and then 7 lights began to dash towards my base I managed to get a few kills then a rocket flairs toward my base I'd then perish lucky for me I had hidden a few chest round the world just incase I was raided by the time I got back there was nothing to save I was defeated. I decided to abandon my base knowing that wasn't going to be the last time they came on my long journey I was held at gun point by the enemy clan to the one whom just destroyed me I told them what happend and they they let me join their town that had a big wall and watch towers they showed me a place I could set up my house and I stared pulling my weight and was accepted as a full members like all good things peace in the town would soon end the clan who destroyed my last base planned to destroy the town a big bang happend at our southern weak wall we all rushed towards the wall and a swarm of 15 men ran through the town we had lost a few men but we survived all the clans had had enough of their random attacks so banned together and marched to their compound we blasted our way in and left nothing but bodys lying around. my story shows that you could be a lonly helpless noob and half a day later be one of the power houses of the game.although I cannot garantee my story may be your own I can tell you that you will regret not buying itI would buy the game regardless what your friends have to say (but the game is best with people to survive with) From what I've heard (correct me if I'm wrong) the dev team updates every weekend so it's not one of the games were you will get little to none updates.my rating on my full experience(although short) 9.5/10,Rust

All in all a game with potential for a lot of fun most of which isn't to be had yet./edit Game has gotten a lot better since I initially wrote the review.

Each month a (more or less) major update put some new things to explore use or kill yourself with.Rust is clearly my favorite survival game.This said you'll find on other comments the usual pros/cons and I'm too lazy to write it. Rust is the best survival out there imo with a great future and an amazing tram behind it. If you like those games give it a try!

2016-03-02,0,0,931,True,Recommended,I very much enjoy this game. At the beginning I couldn't get started with all of the KOS (Kill On Sight) experienced players did. After learning to not play on Official servers I found a great community one that was noob friendly. I have put 300 hours into this server alone am now an admin and am now helping new players. I love the people I play with now. I suggest all new players to go to noob friendly servers to learn the game then go from there.I bought this game after being overly frustrated with H1Z1. That game was bug after bug and no update on survival. That's not the case here. They do weekly updates monthly wipes w/ big patches adding more interesting items every so often have a ton of concepts they are producing. There are Battle Royal servers for those that like to fight there are creative PVE servers for those that like to build. There are great community servers that are like family to one another then there are massive clan servers. You pick your poison. You can go modded gather everything quickly and have a fully protected base in 5 hours or spend days just getting your first floor to sheet metal. The devs really pay attention to the community and give them what they want. They fix the game in a timely manner and are awesome people all aroundFind a good server make some friends have fun. Play your way and follow the rule's on whichever server you choose.,Rust

2016-11-24,0,0,288,True,Recommended,This game has been great to me! I have enjoyed it immensly for over a year now and while playing on and off have always had a great time! First of all i'll start by saying that if you intend to play on a vinillia server this game is HARD when playng solo or in a small group. There are many different ways to sucseed in building a base collecting materials hunting ect. and everyone has their own way...that's what makes the game great. The building aspect is absolutley awe inspiring. Between all the walls windows doors and other such items there is a lot of opportunity for big and small groups to build bases that will deter raiders. How you do so is again different for everyone. Besides the gameplay the graphics are really good once you learn to forgive the blur motion. If you take the time to look at a sunset or an airdrop there is really a weath of visual information that all plays really well with the lighting. As far as updates go they happen almost EVERY WEEK Gary is very committed and always hardworking. For $20 this game will test youre abilities to hate love fail and succeed but in the end it's all worth it.,Rust

2014-06-20,0,0,124,True,Recommended,Good Game very good looking even on lowest settings easy to play with a bunch of friends as long as you dont speak using in game chat because 1. it sounds horrible and 2. it gives your position up. Whilst playing this game I came across a load of players that like to put down fresh spawns like helpless dogs its quite annoying especially if you're the fresh spawn. But anyway you find noobs who like to do this yet if you straif a little they are hopeless and you kill them with a rock. As a whole this game is good but it needs touching up.

2015-09-17,0,0,371,True,Recommended,I bought this game in the very beginning and have been a fan ever since. Legacy was great but the new version is even better. Hackers can be an issue sometimes but with the new VAC and EAC countermeasures you see a lot less. First off trust no one. Don't trust naked men (should be obvious) and don't trust anyone wanting to be your friend. I suggest teaming up with friends from the real world and working together. You will die but the way that the new blue print system works helps make death less of an issue. Build your bases strong and find a rad town to snag new tools and weapons from boxes and barrels.Good luck and be prepared to stare at a lot of wieners.,Rust

2016-03-15,0,0,950,True,Recommended,Ive been playing since Legacy and Ive seen all of the changes made to Alpha. Components is the new progression system and I myself am really enjoying it more than BP and XP. BP I did like but everyone built near a rad town so there was lots of competition. XP was...well y'all know what that was. But components are nice. They can be found anywhere on the map and I mean anywhere. That gives solo players like myself (as of right now over 550 hours with groups bigger than 10) a chance at playing the game casually. I have enjoyed rust there has never been a moment where I had doubt in the game. 10/10,Rust

2017-08-14,0,0,230,True,Recommended,Great game if you have the time to commit to it. I would consider myself fairly casual. As a single player who only has about 2 hours an evening to devote to playing video games It is hard for me to play in a meaningful way. Just about every time I have a good start after a wipe the next day I log in it's back to square 1. This problem can be avoided if you have a group of a few people as there is a point to which you can reach a low risk state and less potential of an offline raid. Because of this I have stopped playing regularly. I follow the dev blog to watch for how they are adapting to the playerbase but unless there is something that changes the gameplay to be more rewarding for online raiding I will most likely stay away. Every Thursday I think about starting a week. I'm to casual for an official server but solo/duo/trio servers are still a strong option for a player like me. Enjoyed my time and will continue to enjoy watching the development. This game outgrew 7daystodie which was my time competitor for a while. Now that Ark is full release I will give it a go to see what it's all about.,Rust

2016-12-07,0,0,568,False,Recommended,I have had Rust since Legacy in 2014 and this is still one of my favorite games to play. Player interaction is great graphics are great building system is great and the list goes on. Yes this game will make you angry because of the high amount of KOS and cancerous players. brings me back to playing it and grinding on it nonstop for periods of time. Roleplaying servers typically have more friendly people than modded and official servers. The gunplay is great in this game and puts you on edge when you hear others around you. Also the dev team is fantastic for this game. Rust is constantly being updated every week or 2 weeks and was just released out of early access several days ago. The game looks gorgeous ever since they added new landscape textures. There aren't a lot of bugs with this game and not many hackers (more in official servers.) I would highly recommend this game if you are looking for an open world survival game that is massively multiplayer.,Rust

The depth of base building strategy is bananas but the creativity in just how you go about aproaching the gameplay of Rust is also pretty awesome. It's a very flexible game. You die a lot. The servers wipe constantly. You get used to the impermanence of everything. Rust is the hyper violent Tibetan sand mandala of the gaming universe. It is glorious.,Rust

2015-12-27,0,0,47,True,Recommended,My friend and I were playing Rust about a month or so after it was released. We managed to get a bow some arrows and a nice wooden shack. Eventually we hear a barrage of gun fire outside our home and the screams of men being gunned to their demise. We close our door and extinguish the fire and pray they don't see us. Are prayers failed as our door was blown to bits by c4. A man then rushed into our home with an AR15 and held us hostage. Our door was then replaced with a metal door. We urgently start messaging a man we met earlier to come help us. He does and he blows the down the wall of our home. He is unfortunately swiflty shot down. Our captor then exclaims he was out of ammo. We took this opportunity to bolt out the hole in our shack and run for the hills. He was apparently not out of ammo and we were shoot several times in our skulls and perished. 8/10,Rust

2014-07-14,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,If I could sell this or return it I would. I was so dissapointed with this game. First off the game concept seems really cool something that I have been looking for for a long time. However as most of the other reviewers are saying the player community sucks. You can spend an hour trying to build your area up with shelter weapons caches etc. Basically you do this to have it ****** up by some player who pops out of no where. Which wouidn't be so bad or unexpected if they didn't then camp spawn you or have this same scenerio happen every 30 minutes or so. It is like the community doesn't want new players to actually be able to play. I bought this game when it first came out and you could buy it in pre release... Mistake. My first experience with this game has darkened my all around view of it. If there were better developer decisions made certain things within the game wouldn't be such an issue. But it really is a free for all which sucks because you build from the ground up. Unless you quit your job break off your relationship ignore your kids and move back into your mum's basement your chances with this game are little to none...,Rust

2016-05-02,0,0,5552,True,Recommended,Update 9/1/2017I will admit this game is not like it used to be of course that's obvious because of how much the game changes every Thursday when they release a new update that fixes/removes/adds content. Despite these constant changes this game never fails to bring something exciting to your doorstep. Playing this game will make your heart pump more than running TheFitnessGram Pacer Test over and over again. It gives you a feeling like no other when adrenaline is rushing through your body and the high of being in a life or death encounter with other players who want what you have. It's intoxicating and extremely addictive and one of the few reasons I love this game so much I honestly do. It is one of my favourite games and has helped me meet extremely amazing people who also share love for this particular Early Access game we know as Rust. I've been through most changes to this game and I'm a rather experienced player I know the ins and outs and I know how to PvP well enough that it makes it fun for me and that's personally MY preference this is game that is OPEN. You can explore whatever you want whenever you want and how you want you can play to PvP or play to PvE you can even fu cking play to roleplay it does not matter because it is YOUR preference. This is game like no other game I've ever come across before and due to how unique it is I am completely obsessed with it.There are many players like me that love this game and the devs that release weekly updates in HOPE to better the game (I say hope because usually they release something completely untested and hope the community responds positively but usually it's pretty bad. Ex aimcone heavy armor nerfs muzzle brake buff etc) truly do love this game. This community is pretty toxic in the way they treat their devs believing them to be brain dead and stubborn but the truth is the devs do care the devs we know as Maurino Vincent Andre Taylor Diogo Alex and Garry. They all are great devs when they listen to the feedback and they usually do. It might take weeks or months but they will listen. TL DRRust is game that allows you to choose how you want to play and has commited developers that release updates every Thursday although stubborn developers that release untested changes they are willing to amend their mistakes and listen to the community so long as the community is willing to complain to them non stop.r8 dis gaem 11/10,Rust

2014-10-03,0,0,669,True,Recommended,This game can be split up into two talking points. The developers and the game.The developers I purchased Rust and played it before the dev team swapped over to the Unity engine. It's come a long way from where it was. From what I have seen the developers have put a lot of work into it but in my opinion they aren't as focused as they should be.Just an example the developers planned on adding a female model to the game. This was announced around their 65th devblog. We re currently on devblog 87 and no sight of females being added. In fact they haven t seen them mentioned since the couple of devblogs after the announcement.Not to say they never add anything. They've added a lot of things to the game but at the end of the day things aren t balanced or fun for everyone. Their approach to game design focuses too heavily on adding new things than making what they have currently balanced fun and stable.The game Rust isn t earth shattering. It s okay. The fun isn t about playing the game. In fact the game is pretty boring. Summed up actually playing the game consists of the following Day 1 Thursday (Wipe day) If you re lucky you were able to keep your blueprints. If you did it s a rush to get resources to build a house. Which is boring. You re competing with 80+ other people over resources to get a house up before them you get killed with the resources you ve collected so far. If you re lucky you succeed and you re safe for the time being. If you re not you ve been killed and now have to spend the next 30 minutes banging a rock against another rock until you have enough stone to bang your rock against a tree so you can make rock tools to back against more rocks and more trees. If you weren t lucky enough to keep your blueprints get ready to spend the rest of your day getting killed in radtowns while searching for barrels and boxes.Day 2 and onward If you kept your blueprints at this stage you re just going to kill people. Yup. You re going to kill people and take their stuff. So you can make better stuff. Once you get better stuff you can use that to break into other people s bases to take all their stuff. Until next Thursday. Next Thursday all the stuff you have stolen (or all the stuff everyone else has stolen from you) will be wiped from the map and everyone starts over again. So. Mechanic wise the game is pretty . There isn t really a point to gathering a lot of resources. You re going to lose it next week anyway. If you re not raided before then that is. Where Rust shines isn t in its mechanics. It s in your interactions with people. That being said. You re going to have more fun if you have people to play with. If you are a solo player you re generally just going to be a target. You will get raided by bigger groups and the game will just be frustrating. Play with friends and it will be tolerable. TLDR Play with a group or you re going to have a bad time. If you don't have friends to play with don't buy it.,Rust

Old rust was great you were a caveman that ran around and had rockfights the next day you had long gun fights it was glorious. As for new rust the game itself is fairly good for being new. There are plenty of bugs but overall its a great game.

2015-06-24,0,0,73,True,Recommended,It's not bad but it's not brilliant either. The only thing i didn't like about this game is that ( and i think a lot people would agree with ) It could be single player. I like single player gay more than multi player so play those types of games. Single player would work with this game because it would be much more worth for the price and also to appeal to more gamers. More choices for the player. It's just my opinion. But for the most part the game is great! If you like survival games this is a must have game in your library!,Rust

2016-11-26,0,0,1092,True,Recommended,This game is a very fun one for the survival freaks that like games like Don't Starve or The Forest. It's a really great game with a amazing community that might or might not shoot you. There are 3 types of servers Official Community and Modded. With official you are playing straight up rust. Find materials and survive with normal loot dropping. Community being the same but you might have a few seconds off of your crafting and some more wood when chopping. Modded however is crazy and fun! There are different gamemodes you can play some giving you 200 000 wood when you hit a tree and you get starter guns. Some like one in the chamber where you play with 1 bullet and a rock and its 1 hit to kill. All in all it's a great game and if you can get some buddies to play with you it will go by very smoothly until you finally get your base setup and then armored even. 10/10,Rust

2015-06-23,0,0,610,True,Recommended,Really good survival game.Not only is it a beautiful game but there is a great survival aspect to the game. Not the best to play this game alone you should really play with a few friends. PVP isn't the easiest in this game so you may have to practice or have some friends to back you up. The building is a simple and easy mechanic that is perfectly made to appease any type of player. Have fun ),Rust

2015-06-23,0,0,367,True,Recommended,Rust can be described in many ways. Fun hard diffrent bad etc. These are all good words to describe rust. Rust is like any other survival game with a few diffrent things. For one the map is huge one of the biggest I have ever seen for it's genre. There are forests desserts snowy mountains and even just fields of nothing. It gives you the choice to build your base wherever you desire. It has great mechanics and awsome features a lot of other games don't give. You need to find certain items to learn how to craft them or even build a research bench to learn how to make game changing items. You can craft c4's and rocket launchers or even grenades. All of them with their own unique and diffrent design. Grenades are basically bean cans filled with gunpowder and some guns are just you hitting the end with flint. While there aren't an extremely large ammount of guns they all do diffrent things. Although as much as this sounds fun this game has an side you wouldn't see at first. The people who play rust can only be summed up in one sentence. Complete s. Now not everyone shall be this way but you will most likely spawn 5 25 times where you just get shot or beaten by someone with a stick. You may die multiple times in a row. Then the combat is very bad. Atleast at first it is. You could build your first little pistol sort of thing. And while you may feel empowered with it you are not. No that gun is not as good as you think. It may do less damage than a spear thrown at you. You could shoot 5 shotgun rounds from it at someone and hit them each time but they live. But they grab a bow and kill you in one hit. That leads to the major bad part about the game. If you have no friends who play rust or can't then you are immediatly screwed. Without multilple friends (around 3 or more to start) then you won't get anywhere. You could have an assault rifle but three guys with rocks come up behind you and kill you. You could have a great base which would be great with multiple people. But 3 guys with some ladders and spears come in and immediatly kill you. While this is great allowing the game to be balanced and allow anyone to win a battle it doesn't do it well. If you have spent hours in the game just for you to lose it all in minutes by some noobies then it is unfair and very frustrating. So I only reccomend this game if you have friends.,Rust

2014-07-28,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,its ok. the graphics are lovely an it plays seemlessly most of the time. tactically it could have been saved with a better camoflauge system more undergrowth and evasions skill sadly there are none if someone decideds to kill you you are going to die usually while you are busy tring to play the game.it is a good game and has a good crafting system but i can hide in my house forever when i do leave my home i am insta killed by uknown forces usually no more than 50 feet from my door so i cant play this game as there are much better models similar to this availible that require skill to survive rather rust has the feel of monkeys hitting each other with stick pretty nailed.edit This game is a total waste of time and energy its populated with hackers and over the top exploits. i dont know how you can justify playing for 5 hours to get things evryone can obtain only to have some hacker walk through the wall and put all the things you saved in his inventory using exploits. its outragous and a total waste of time and space you will porobably regret having this on your steam game list and there is no way to remove it once you buy it you have been warned. its jusy monkey city populated by lowlifes.,Rust

2014-06-22,0,0,285,True,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUYI have played 90 hours of this game and I cannot stress enough to anyone who is maybe interested in this game that it is and will be a waste of your money. At first glance it looks like you're run of the mill survival game. Which is very apealing but upon actually gettting into the game you realize that it is all a lie.If you can actually get into the game it barely functions. Lag. Dissconnects. DDOS attack. Hackers. 12 year olds screaming through the in game voice chat. Did I mention hackers? Dont even think about building your base because the second you have something valuable here comes a flying (yes flying) aimbot script kiddie screaming at the top of his lungs through the mic headshotting you with a 9mm while he zooms around in the air. Maybe its the server? NOPE its every server. Even the offical ones.Disconnects/lag/DDos attacks The game was playable up to a point. Recently it has gotten MUCH WORSE. Try to get into game and get disconnected 10 seconds later. Come to find out that rust itself (Which is flagged as a virus by AVG/Malewarebytes/Norton/Bitdefender/Kypersky) has DDos'd your modem and has crashed it. Dont even think about posting on the dev website. The devs and fanboys will ridicule you call you dumb for trying to troubleshoot THEIR software problems to make workarounds for the countless problems with their game. 100/10 DO NOT BUY,Rust

2015-06-26,0,0,817,True,Recommended,I really like Rust. There are a few things that are bad but just can't be changed (Young kids with mics). Like the description says the aim is to survive. This is very accurate in terms of gathering resources and fighting for survival. There are a ot of servers to play on and it is defenetly a chalange to overcome nature animals and other players. Overall Rust is a great game for people who like survival and are up for a challange.,Rust
2015-06-26,0,0,254,True,Recommended,If you are in a group with your friends of 3 or more this is a very funny competitive and addictive game and for a game still in dev mode I think this game has much much more potential and will grow bigger every day. Game looks great if you have the right settings and it's very time consuming and addictive which is nice for the $20 you will spend.Only bad things for me is there is still alot more improvements like glitches bugs and missing features but it still is in Alpha so that will be fixed. Also this game is very performance intense and if you want to play on good looking graphics you should make sure you have a real decent PC.All I can say next is to go put that $20 in your wallet and buy this game you won't regret it.,Rust

I didn't exactly trust the direction it had been taking untill recently. I had logged on from time to time to see the changes it had made and would shake my head. After seeing a recent youtube video it sparked my interest to log back in and see where this game was at. It appears this game is back in the right direction. Random maps better building/crafting/UI and seems to be starting to be better optimized. Of course things still break with the updates but they are active in fixing them. As for the negative comments I've seen there are different servers to play on and if one doesn't suit you there are thousands to chose from.,Rust

2018-02-05,0,0,1727,True,Recommended,Biggest pucker factor I've felt since Demon's Souls or any of the Dark Souls games. It's incredibly frustrating and rewarding. Rust is a lot like an adult Minecraft it's less imaginative but more competitive in every way. I highly recommend it to anyone who has the time and patience for a persistant world where people can raid your base when you're offline if you haven't properly defended it. For me it's easily the most motivating/addictive game of all time. For its flaws it's definitely a labor of love with a regular update schedule (once a week for EA once a month once released) that makes it evident the devs really care. Check out the blogs.,Rust

2017-09-28,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,I literally can't even. I don't understand how this game could be patched so often and be so frustrating to even get working properly (when I can run similar games like Life is Feudal on max graphical fidelity with no real issues). I had to go on youtube to figure out a work around on how to actually get the game to launch to begin with. Just loading up it stops responding several times (and sometimes crashes while doing it). Loading into a server can take 5 10 minutes. Once in game features seem to be constantly breaking or stop working the way they did minutes ago with no explination (despite asking about them in game looking at the guides and sarching for info on it otherwise). On the most minimalistic graphical settings it crashes constantly or refuses to stay connected to servers. There are hugmungous frame rate drops transitioning between areas. Steam even crashes while trying to play this game. Even after exiting this and steam my computer runs horribly until I reboot. I can't even tell if I like the actual game or not because I can't play it long enough without issues with running it to really get into it.,Rust

However I do like the new grapich changes and inventory changes aswell as the new crafting system even though I didn't get to use it. The game is heading to the right direction but as with Dayz it needs improvements. EDIT So I played it some more with friends and I enjoyed it. For me however this game is only fun to play if you have friends to play with. Only then can you build a base and actually keep it together. Don't buy this if you are alone. Otherwise buy this game if you sine budds with you to play with.,Rust

Only annoying thing is the stupid wolves and bears aggro to you and chase you around for like 5 minutes at a time. Shouldn't take that long to get rid of them.Current Review Still a fun game although now that the map has changed it's gotten a little tougher to find friends you might want to get on and play with. Also the animals are even more annoying in this one. You go to kill a deer and he runs through a rock and ends up running up a wall where you can't get to so that sucks. Although awesome addition of the spear. That made starting new a LOT better as it's easy to make and a lot easier to hunt with.,Rust

2015-08-19,0,0,66,True,Not Recommended,Sadly I cannot recommend this game let me explain why. (if you care to listen.)I do not recommend this game not because of the gameplay making building weapons and that soort of things but because of the community.I really do like this game and the potentional of the game my major problem with this game is that you cannot develope your building/character or anything without getting raided.Doesn't matter with how many people you play it doesn't matter what server you join you always get killed by someone or some thugs who has superiour weapons than you even you're trying to be friendly.Like all I wanted to do is making a house and all whatever people does is kill you on sight without hasitation.Anyways.... about the gameplay I really like what they did with the building mechanics it's nice and simple.Only the door lock you know the one you require to open up with the key is quite rubbish in my oppinion and ever since the door lock with the code panel is hard to find it's still better then a door with no lock am I right?The thing is whenever you die you lose your key fine by me but why doesn't it let me recreate a new one? I am stuck in my own house for a weird reason and it happend towards me multiple times in different servers.I have a mixed oppinion about this game but if the community improve I would love to try this game out again.For now I am not bothered to play this game anymore since I know I keep getting killed and raided all the time.,Rust

It would be nice if the survival aspect of the game was a bit harder e.g. More mobs more fall damage and quicker loss of hunger and thirst. Overall not many games can beat the play style of Rust as it really is a free roam/sandbox players dream. Definitely would reccomend 5/5.,Rust

2015-08-05,0,0,354,True,Recommended,My opinion and an early access reviewGreat Game. I played the legacy version mostly. It was fun how everyone was feinding for weapons. People setting up little trades in side chat and adding each other to do secret meetings. The paranoia of player interaction. How people would cry when they had their bases raided and when people backstabbed one another. I myself guilty of backstabbing lol. Good times.The social interactions like gaining their trust to let you see their base location only for me to come back later on and raid it. The no lifers guarding the server 24/7 raiding when people are offline letting them build up slowly over days only to destroy it all in one peaceful night of players being offline. Savouring the moment when they all log back in and cry. I am guilty of this once over lol. Had to be done for a good experience.Very tough game solo you really need friends in this game.Now Legacy has been abandoned hackers run rampant. But if you find a good server it is still great.The new rust is poorly optimized for my computer atm. I cannot run it smoothly so not much to say about the new rust.I look forward to playing the new optimized rust it will surely be great! And the finished product will be an EPIC game im so looking forward to it biding my time.10/10 in my opinion,Rust

2014-08-02,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,When I first bought Rust over a year ago I was expecting an unfinished but functional game. That was more or less what I got. I will admit it was pretty entertaining at first. There were some actual updates coming in and there were hardly any hackers in the beginning of the game. Even if there wasn't many supplies away from the road so there wasn't much room for exploring the (small) world. I set the game down for a few months to focus on other titles. When I reinstalled I opened up a no PVP server to get started and was met with a gun to the face. I was confused. It was a no PVP server?? I spawned somewhere else and after an hour of hitting trees with rocks and making a shack some person noclips through my wall and shoots me. A couple deaths later I leave and uninstall. Que another few months later and I start up the game again hoping to see improvement. What I see is more hackers more useless admins no more zombies and a smaller world to explore.

2014-07-15,0,0,19,True,Recommended,Hey there the idea is so good! But to call it realistic... not so.Things that you could improve The trees should fall when they are out of wood. When you mine you could also go into tunnels or create your own too. Cars Motorbikes... Not everything needs to be from wood I mean yeah you can choose having metal materials but come on it's not supposed to be stone age either. Story what's behind everything? Something to explain every detail in the game and also even have a tutorial to teach newbie players how to play this game (for example me). And if Rust has actually a lot to do with wood introduce farming to the game so players can create their farms for food.I could go on forever but the important here is that it's in Alpha and it could change anytime.Good Luck developping it!,Rust

2015-08-08,0,0,163,True,Recommended,This game is bad but only if your with friends.I personally play on modded servers as they are more fun and easier to get started so don't read this if you want to play hardcore.This game will be really cool in the future at the moment it is still in really early production and is showing signs of being the best survival game ever made it combines all elements of wasteland style survival with a perfect physics based base design system.The only downside I see is the guns the game needs them but there are too many in circulation it would be better if you couldn't craft them but only find them.There are so may pros and cons in this game it would be impossible to name them all but I would definetly pick this up if you want a good survival game! 8/10,Rust

My computer is way above the requirements for this game and yet i could only run the game on the fastest graphical setting while getting a decent framerate and even then it was still terrible.For now do not buy this game if you can't wait for it to be released and really wanna play be my guest but prepare to go to the steam refund page and get your money back.

You can play rust solo for sure as long as you know how to get that 2x2 up and fortified as soon as possible.i recommend buying rust with the mind that it's always changing. for the 3 months that ive played a lot have been seen and done and changed around that makes the experience new every two weeks. Sure it's in alpha for 3 years but it's gary we're talking about... he made a mod that has been sold a lot of times rust wont dissapoint. expect a salty community cause this game calls for salt. if you dont like salt in your meal then don't.Rust needs the salt and that's what makes it more and more motivating to fling a ton of rockets and c4s to the s base and teabag the scumbag.Salty Rust is the only Rust.Still a great game!

2016-09-16,0,0,888,False,Recommended,Rust is a game that unironically rewards skill brains dedication and charisma. Every single negative review is from people who lack these things. What makes rust such a good game is the incredibly fun gameplay and the charming community.Here's how your first wipe will go 1. Stupidly aggressive PVE will frustrate you. You'll die while trying to get resources for a base.2. After hours of work you'll finish a base.3. You'll get into your first PvP encounter and get ed.4. You'll get sniped from a tower and get ed.5. You'll get ambushed while looting and get ed.6. You'll grind for weapons and still get ed.7. You'll kill one guy and be happy maybe tell your friends about it. Your effort has finally achieved something.8. You'll get raided and then quit.How your second wipe will go 1. You'll avoid bears and aggressive mobs get your base up faster.2. You'll get your first air drop and maybe a couple of kills.3. You'll get ed and flamed by someone better than you.4. You'll get some decent blueprints and gear and maybe even finish a base with high externals.5. You'll make some friends. Maybe have a small village or coalition against the big groups. Maybe you'll be terrorized by the big groups and try and suck up to them.6. You'll raid bases that aren't just shacks.7. You'll get raided and then quit.How your x wipe will go 1. You've played through a few wipes. Mobs aren't really an issue anymore.2. You'll find bases as a caveman and ambush them murdering unexpecting victims and taking their resources.3. You'll get a reputation and some people who hate you because you beat them not the other way around.4. You'll get a base up with high externals.5. You'll ambush and kill people take their things and maybe flame a bit.6. You'll use guerilla tactics around airdrops and have hour long skirmishes.7. You'll organize a raid against another powerful group or join a coalition against one. After hours of grinding for resources and organization you'll start the attacks.8. You'll drop C4 go running through the smoke gun down your enemies and after hours of work you'll eradicate the group from the server. You'll flame them at least a bit.9. You'll defend raids against groups larger than you but because you're better than the noobs who hate you you'll win.10. You'll raid those around you and make them quit.If you reach wipe x you'll see why rust has such a dedicated community. Don't listen to the people who haven't reached it.,Rust

2015-07-27,0,0,222,True,Recommended,Great game!!!,Rust
2015-07-27,0,0,180,True,Not Recommended,I cant recommend this for one simple reason you will always wake up to find all your stuff gone. Even if you are skilled and merciless (which this game requires) and manage to get good stuff (usually by stealing it) it will never last. making it past the noob with a rock stage is almost impossible since you will get killed by people or animals. gathering enough stuff to make your own gun takes amazingly long (in which time you will almost inevitably die) and the gun you get will still be no match for the AKs some people have. so really the only way to make progress is by ambushing people with your stone hatchet when they have guns and hope they dont notice you or are in their inventory or something like that. but even if you manage to kill an AK wielding raider with your hatchet you will wake up to find it gone. The only way to avoid this is to play in a group where people are online 24/7 but this is unrealistic for most people for a few reasons.1) you need to have people in different timezones but these people will play on servers close to them due to ping2) if not people in diff timezones you will need people who stay up all night but these people are hard to find and even harder to befriend3) nobody wants to sit at the base just protecting it which leaves you vulnerable to attackLastly even if you manage to maintain night time protection for your base you will probably just get raided during the day since your base will probly be undefended because nobody will just sit there defending. That is the most boring thing imaginable. Why buy a game to just sit there? Who would sit at their screen for hours on end doing nothing but watching carefully?,Rust
2015-07-27,0,0,291,True,Recommended,Rust is just an amazing game no matter how you look at it. No NPCs (except animals) at all. Start out with close to nothing a rock and a torch... Well soon you will make tools and with those tools you will make tools that are at a higher tier. With your resources you can fully customize your base to fit your wildest dreams! But watch out because once other players see your base it's game on. Defend from raids with traps or guns! Yes that's right you can go from a rock and a torch to an AK 74! The game is truly limitless with what you can do. Make allies or enemies. Your choice.,Rust

2015-09-27,0,0,1846,True,Recommended,great game to build a secure base with different types of walls barricades windwos and gates so you can build your own castle just the way you dreamed. interesting ways to raid bases with ladders and c4. nice pvp with only a few wepaons but no overpowered weapons while you raid people farm materials get airdrops or just run around in the world. sadly the whole game got destroyed by hackers who can roam free on the servers and the defs cant or are not willing to do something against it. there is a high potential in the survival games market but yet every company so far failed extreme hard to make a game that is not destroyed by hackers.if you are looking for some short fun to build a base chop down some trees build some weapons and gather materials while playing the game for 2 5 hours a week this game is good. if you are looking for the endgame with a big base raids and pvp with a group of people u will get dissapointed. it takes time and work to get the endgameequipp and hacker can just take it from you within minutes without getting detected.,Rust

2015-02-02,0,0,1075,True,Not Recommended,Legacy Rust Great game great starting ground tons of fun. Decent ammount of hacking which sucked but otherwise pretty clean game. Experimental Rust(current version) Great starting place has new engine or wtv. cool maybe they can work on it better. See dev posts and changed every week. Have hope the glory of rust will return. Father Garry tells me that it will be like legacy again. I shed a tear and await patches. Patch 45 games still not even close to legacy. Every new little thing that gets added causes tons of errors and causes the servers to wipe just to introduce more bugs and problems. Don't get me wrong this game is soooo much fun. But every patch kills me more and more as they don't adress the communities needs and simply enjoy ign with what Garry called his creative project. Well have fun playing with your game Garry because honestly I can't take the inventory looting bugs the stacking issues and the fact we wipe every week just trying to get the new patch and then you don't live up to your word and its even further from legacy rust than before. Animal run 1000 miles an hour hit boxes are incredibly innacurate as are every weapon in the game but the AR. And then the AR is more accurate then God's sniping capability. 10/10 great game 5/10 poor production team.EDIT So I saw this game was up to be on sale this week and I had to update my post. At this point the game has been in production 2 years and is no closer than it was day 1. Changes still happen but they are small and are not what needs to be done to finish the game. Currently they have no plan for release and could in all honesty never release this game. A lot of the hype has died down now and servers are boringly empty or overun with people who play daily and will destroy you before you even get a chance. I urge you do not buy this game untill you hear them start working on final builds. I cretainly got my moneys worth from the game but 90% of my fun was when I was with friends and back when it was in the original version.,Rust

Having an army of people means they will get everything first. Anyone not in a big clan will be at an extreme disadvantage even if with friends and if you're anywhere near a clan base you can kiss resources and peace goodbye. Some servers try to prevent clans from joining or forming but they never work as they can work around the attempts.,Rust

2018-03-03,0,0,1434,False,Recommended,Extremely fun I enjoy this game daily it makes your heart race every time you make a play and or go out roaming raiding or inter combat with anyone.Starting up is a bit of a challenge especially solo but can be rewarding.My advice is play with a small group 2/3 people(DONT BECOME A ZERG!!!!)Early game combat is my favorite when its more of a hunting type instead of a fps bows are extremely fun to use and can deal a good advisory iv you are skilled with it.Night time is aids and nobody enjoys them you might as well just craft GP or play on your phone at this time.Overall I have come to love and enjoy rust its actually the main reason I came to PC.P.S. The Rust community is extremely Toxic try to improve it and be kind every now and then. ),Rust
2018-03-03,0,0,134,False,Recommended,The game itself is amazing the community is not as with most game these days I love playing it and getting far though that rarely happens since I usually seem to get offline raided solo is impossible unless you're playing on a small modded server or a official even then with the official you have to be experienced and the constant pvp makes it almost impossible to win in any match unless its unfair for the other person or fair for you duo is aright besides the fact that I cant ever find anyone to play this game with and its a bit easier than solo just takes some teamwork and contribution from both the people and both the people being coperative trio ive only done once and I would have to say is the most fun easier to get started easier to get loot and easier in general one of the best parts is relaxing trio is less stressful than duo or solo since you have everything easily and if you're not good at pvp well your friends can make up for that and also I cant wait till it comes out on consle I will have more friends to play with in total I would have to say this game is a 10/10 its fun and nice the community though makes the game 10x harder so the community is a 2/10 in my opinion but still it can be fun so I will recommend this game.,Rust

Very realistic it is like a revamped minecraft. My tips to you is that if you don't want to be killed don't kill other people to give them a reason to do the same.Edit 12/26/14After they released the new version of Rust it has gone downhill.Edit 2/22/15The new version is actually now becoming pretty damn good. A few more major updates and it might be as good as legacy.Edit 4/24/15The new version has gotten very fun.

2017-12-12,0,0,2958,False,Not Recommended,This game was great during the summer of 2016. Since then the developers have ruined it with every patch they put out. Instead of fixing the real problems that were occurring in game the developers wasted time and effort on other things. Some prime examples would be the cheaters. I remember a time when modders could noclip right into your base steal all your loot and aimbot you instantly. This went on for months. The forum was filled with complaints what was the developer s response? Let s introduce item skins. Just one of many examples of Facepunch fixing everything except what is broken.Did you spend months farming blueprints? Developers &gt Introduce XP system. Once the community backlashed against the XP system Gary released a flowchart claiming he had great changes in the patches were praised by the community for a short period of time then people would complain again. This I thought was inaccurate. If it isn t broken don t try and fix it. He went on to encourage people to quit the game. The XP system was scrapped then the even more terrible component system was introduced. Then they brought blueprints back with the components. The next thing that breaks the game for me is the new recoil system. Really? A gun that recoils in the shape of an S? Now I must learn a different recoil pattern for each gun?Even if I get past all the other BS that breaks the game for me and decide I just want to build a base now I must keep farming materials and keep it stored in the cupboard so my base doesn t super decay? I wish this game didn t depend on some central server somewhere and I could find a rolled back version. This game had great potential. I loved it. Now I can t stand it.,Rust

I've watched how this game has progressed and it has change a lot most for the better some for worse depending on how you look at it. This game really comes down to you finding the right kind of server for you. If you are completely new i wouldnt recommend a high populated server. You will die that is all i can say. If you like being able to build a place hunt harvest blow sh*t up and kill. You can make friends or be that lonely d**k that just does his own thing. There is a lot of learning from experiences of failure and you progress as you learn the game. I've played a few other games for this price and I have to say Rust was probably my best buy.,Rust

2015-08-09,0,0,522,True,Recommended,Day 1 I wake up on the shore completely naked with nothing but a Rock and a torch.Day 2 meet another player and asked if was friendly they said yes.Day 3 trusted player enough to share base with them Thought met a new friend and fellow survivor tohelp survive this.Day 4 new friend steals all my guns and food and builds a base at the other end of map after killing me and detroying my sleeping bag.Day 5 Raided a Rad Town and found an Assult Rifle and a ton of ammo.Day 6 Crafted some explosives to prepare for revenge against the jerk.Day 7 blew off the front door took all my items back and shot them all and then Blew up their base.DAy 8 built a new armored base to store all my weapons and shoot everyone on site D.Btt in all honesty this game is awesome All in all id give it a 9 out of 10 due to the bugs and getting kicked to the main menu once in a while but then again my computer is lower than the min specs reccommended for this game and it still runs somewhat smoothly. I would definately reccommend this game to anyone that looks for a good survival game with raiding etc. just have to watch out for the occasional troll or 2 that will probably kill you upon spawning bt thats why its best to find a server with a large map so when respawning theres a small chance of ever running into that player again.,Rust

2014-06-25,0,0,657,True,Recommended,"So while I haven't played this for very long I happened upon a server with a bunch of experienced players who immediately showed me the ropes. After I was outfitted with a gun and some armor that they gave me I went out trekking into the wilderness of Rust. The first thing I have to say is that the game handles really well. It's a clever mix of minecraft style survival with mild FPS overtones and even with a slight ""Sims"" feel to it. If you're lucky enough to play and hop onto a server like I did you'll find it a lot of fun to communicate with different team members and take down bears while your houses become mansions. If you're not so lucky you'll have fun with your first few hours trying to build just one wooden shelter before being eaten alive by wolves. Even while being in the Alpha the game plays brilliantly. The environments are huge and captivating the enemies fierce and frightening and the crafting and various items add a clever survivalist feel. As it's in the Alpha I hope they get around to changing some of the minor concerns (messy GUI small amount of materials not a whole lot to build not a whole lot of scaling) because this game has a hell of a lot of potential. If it doesn't look interesting don't get it yet wait until the full and final version. If however you're intrigued it's definitely worth the price and the servers are always populated.",Rust

2015-12-22,0,0,532,True,Not Recommended,This Games Performance is Very good. The way you build things is amazing. There has been a lot of added content sense the legacy version. However I Never play this game It just sits in my game library only to be poked at every couple of months. The Reason is I just simply can not enjoy it whe ever I try to play. No its not the EVIL EVIL NASTY player community that disgust me about this game. Its the Build limitations or should i say lack there of. The amount of player made structures across the map makes the game so annoying that its is unplayable to me. I can not..... CAN NOT.. stand playing the game because there is a player made structure EVERY 5 FEET in game across the map. And if you manage to find a place that doesn't have a structure built you can bet that after you make a base log off and then log back on. Somebody is going to build RIGHT yes RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. In order for me to ever pick this game back up their must be A VASTLY HARSHER build limitation system. That is why I rate this game Negative. I suggest that a player only be able to have 2 or 4 tool cabinets And only be able to build with in the zone of a tool cabinet. Any building pieces out side of the build zones I.E. if a tool cabinet gets destroyed should be erased when the server resets.,Rust

I sure hope they enjoyed my rock and torch the only items you start the game with. This is the game every spawn every server. Spawn points are populated with shacks of other players just waiting to murder you. Fun.Why waste time effort and energy programming this if it turns into spawn camping from the get go? If you're a troll then this is the game for you. Everyone else avoid this.,Rust
2016-08-14,0,0,288,True,Recommended,As of writing this review most of the recent negative reviews are because people don't like the XP system (Though I prefer it over the Blueprint system) or can't run the game on their low end hardware. As far as open world survivals go Rust runs better than most. Now for an actual review. Once you find a decent server to join based on the ping and population you start out by spawning on a beach. You are naked but you at least can't spawn in the frozen north or the desert south. For whatever reason you have a torch and a rock with you. For a while the rock will be your only real tool. The torch however is mostly just a great way to get yourself spotted and killed. Your goal is to find enough resources to not starve or get murdered. From here there is 2 main paths you can take you can try to build a base upgrade it to wood stone and metal amass resources while leveling up and only killing players for self defense. OR you can be a hunter going around to monuments and landmarks (in which every one is referred to as a Rad Town by older players (Not to be confused with the actual Rad Town)) to break barrels and loot boxes and crates hoping to get lucky and find some valuable resources/weapons. This method involves killing everyone on sight. You won't make any friends doing this but it's high risk high reward. And while that is the basis of the gameplay Rust has a lot of good things going for it. The dev team figureheaded by Garry Newman and lead by a guy named Helk are usually very open about their plans for Rust and listen to community feedback to make (and revert) changes. The team is constantly doing what they can to improve performance while also updating the graphics and visuals. You will get mad. You will get murdered. You will murder people. You might even make some friends to murder others with and take control of servers with them. Which in turn will make others want to kill you. Rust is an experience you simply cannot get anywhere else and it's one hell of a time sink.Garry pls add birds.,Rust

2016-08-13,0,0,215,True,Not Recommended,90% of Rust is a game where you run around and kill people. You can do other things while killing and being killed but all activities take a back seat to fighting with other players.RUST IS NOT A SURVIVAL GAME you die all the time including committing suicide. Death is no big deal in Rust.Rust is a FPS with the goal of gearing up as quickly as possible. So that you have statistical advantage over other players. The setting starts post apocalyptic and quickly becomes full of player built walled compounds. Resulting in two modes fighting in the open using natural ground cover or attacking/defending compounds.,Rust

And newly in charge Helk stated that xp system fixes were taking a back seat to other fixes? imho when your game starts tanking in rating off ONE implementation of new mechanics (xp) why would you back burner that problem so many people were excited for xp 60k+ on patch day now we cant break 45k and dropping before server wipes its often near 20k sometimes lower. Please fix this game before you put the tombstone in it. This game was revolutionary. Now its not even playable. Why cater a game to a 1% player base who has 16 hr a day to play. give the other guys some fun too. i put 500 hours in rust but i cant see myself putting much more last server wipe i made it to level 19 i had enough mats from killing other pl ayers to make 60+ rockets.

2018-01-21,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,"The game is very meh. It throws you into a survival world with little knowledge of mechanics and it has a fairly steep learning curve. Not to mention you HAVE to play on an online server that is wiped every month. I found little to no enjoyment on any of the ""suggested"" public servers as it seems to be full of the toxic variety of players. A lot of servers are also very poorly moderated. While it's more of a petpeeve thing when a server says you can't kill people after spawning on a bed roll or something and it happens but nobody is around to stop the person from doing it over and over it looks bad. The game itself still needs a lot of work and when updates are made the changes are the small things not the big major issues if there are any. Last one I remember was the fix for the keypad lock exploit. It can be fun if you get some friends and friends of friends together on a small server or for a close and small game community to just screw around in. But I shouldn't nor should anyone for that matter have to go and buy a server to have an enjoyable time.Rust needs a lot of work in the community which I know isn't really possible for the devs to fix and the game itself before I can even say it's worth the price tag. If you really want it wait for a good sale. I wouldn't pay more than $10 to $15 for this in the state it's in.",Rust
2018-01-21,0,0,579,True,Recommended,Rust....First off i do not recommend this game for solo players YOU WILL get rekt. I recommend atleast a duo as you can pretty far with just 2 people(I play duo most of the time). Rust also requires alot of tactics whether its pvp or base building. It is also a grindy game i do not recommend it if you dont feel like grinding or if you do not have the time to be on atleast a few hours a day(i have only been playing for alittle over a month and have 410 hours yes i dont have a life). All your grinding and progress can all go to as you can be raided by someone over night so thats something to keep in mind. It is easy to learn the basics and get into but hard to master such as pvp it will require some time and practice to get used to recoil and guns etc. this isnt your typical call of duty style pvp it takes alot more skill(I recommend you go onto a battlefield server and get the feel of the game). Overall i give this game a 9/10 I'd say the price is worth as you can spend endless hours playing Rust.,Rust

There needs to be a short built in start up area for people to learn the rope before they are let in the wild. If the game would run without crashing I might of given it a better chance but I feel like I wasted my money DO NOT BUY.,Rust
2014-10-07,0,0,1212,True,Recommended,My previous review was unfair for this game as I have enjoyed hundreds of hours of fun playing this game throughout the many stages of its development. I've been a player and an admin and both roles proved to be entertaining in Rust. As an admin the posibilities are endless for this game you can play nearly any way you want if you know how to configure a server well. As a player the game can be frustrating but I've found half the battle is in selecting the appropriate server for your playstyle. This is a hardcore survival game that is unforgiving and the smallest mistake will put you on the radar of a group of raiders just looking for something to do. If you are new join a small group server and don't build a huge base. Build small well hidden and don't run around blowing up or spraying machine guns because someone will follow the sounds and show up looking for a fight. As a new player don't talk in chat about your location or plans as veteran players will help you learn the hard way and use this information to raid you or camp your doors.,Rust

2015-03-09,0,0,1336,False,Recommended,Rust is a game where addictive gameplay and infinite possibilities for creativity pull you back time and time again. In the beginning of Rust's development the game was plagued by hackers and cheaters but in its late development it seems to have solved that problem. Rust is beyond a doubt the most dynamic base building visually satisfying suspenseful and addictive survival game on the market today. It's first person shooter elements are also professionally done but this isn't like most shooters. In Rust if you die you can be looted and subsequently lose everything on you so while carrying that fancy new gun you spent days trying to find might give you an edge in combat every second you carry it is another second you risk losing it.Getting sweet revenge on that jerk who killed you and stole all your materials early on is a satisfying experience to behold. But you could also be raided at any minute and you only have your base design and various traps to protect it when you're offline. If player's successfully raid your base and make their way to your loot rooms you could potentially loose everything. Fortunately the game offers a variety of defenses including autoturrets flame turrets shotgun traps land mines and bear traps etc. Maps also come in a wide variety of sizes and are pseudo randomly generated. This offers players the opportunity to build their bases in as remote or hidden locations as they choose. You can build in the rocks at the top of a snowy mountain far near the edge of map across long stretches of tundra or even in hidden cave structures where players rarely venture. If you choose to be closer to the action you can build right on ruined roads where barrels and other loot items spawn in the middle of open pastures where your towers or open windows can grant you visibilitry for what seems like miles or nearby major monuments where the rarest and most highly sought after crafting materials and items can be found.Rust has been a game in development for many years and it has tested many waters but in the end it has evolved into a very rewarding experience for any survival gamer. Today's Rust is a no brainer. For most it'll easily be worth a purchase.,Rust

2016-07-04,0,0,348,False,Recommended,Rust isn't for the faint of heart. The only negative reviews on this game are from people who obviously didn't read the game's description or watch any videos. I recommend watching videos of gameplay since it's very different from most other games. Countless hours of fun to be had and plenty of killing naked Russians and taking over bases that took other people hours to build... also Trust no one.,Rust
2018-02-08,0,0,129,False,Recommended,This is my favorite game of all time plain and simple. Never in my life had I had so much adrenaline and fear pumping through my veins while playing a video game. If you arent careful someone will walk up behind you kill you and take everything you've been working for stealing hours or even days worth of hard work from you. Everything you own is constantly on the line and you have to be able to defend it or at the least run away and hide it. You have to be willing to die a lot and often and keep fighting to improve if you ever want to achieve anything in this game. If you like your games eay and fun then this likely isn't for you. People are going to kill you and they will do it often. They will make you trust them and then shoot you in the back. You will die over and over and almost always due to some sort of treachery or someone just being a You just have to be smarter than they are hide your base and goods and keep pushing on.,Rust

2015-12-24,0,0,86,True,Recommended,This game is pretty fun experience. I never had such adrenaline in other games. Its nearly impossible to survive alone u have to find clan or alies to get on top. Building bases strategically so raiders would have bad time raiding. I dont have much experience but personaly i love this game. I started from the bottom now im here. My history is i found my self some alies then we started to gather recourses i was the woodcutter secondly we made a base it was pretty basic. But after we rebuilded the base into a big one we had to defend from raids and it was hard. First of all we dint have that good equipment i was the one who had a Bolt (sniper rifle). Not that many guys had even thompsons. So we somehow managed to survive the attack but that wasnt the end. After 2 hours they came again but in that time we had ak's and i wasnt the only guy who had a bolt. There was a problem they had c4's... We collected all the loot we could and ran away. Now we are building a new base.Id say buy this game if ur not a ragequiter cause u will die alot like ALOT. Even when u are very strong u will die and u cant do anything.,Rust

2014-11-18,0,0,404,True,Recommended,Wait till it releases and don't waste your money on it until they make a finished product. I think this is what lead to the downfall of this game. Beta games should be free with donations to reward hard work. Rust got rewarded way to early and now it seems the developers are taking it slow.The game used to be good but the developer decided to start all over again and the current version is still inferior to the original version.Rust used to have a vision a direction which is now unclear where this game future is headed. The game is also getting a lot of competition now and it will eventually be surpassed by something better because they are taking to long to finish the game. Anyway if you want to try it hey go for it just don't except Rust to be done anytime soon.The game is playable and enjoyable if you like pvp. I changed this game to recommendation again because the game is finally playable and almost as good as legacy Rust. Still think people should wait for a finished product.,Rust

2016-06-11,0,0,176,True,Not Recommended,"Oh boy what a wild ride this game has beenIt started okay during the very early alpha stages it as very rough but playable with some friends. The best memories I have from this game was during that stage like the first time I met up with my friend after searching for almost 2 hours.But as the game got ""better"" the community got worse... like really ing fast.They started drifting away from the survival crafting aspect of the game and started leaning towards more pvp oriented gameplay and it this point this game really is just a bad shooter with basebuilding and crafting mechanics.To win rust you basically have to be the fastest person to get and gun and be the guy who can stay online the longest.If you don't stay online 24/7 someone will destroy your base and take your stuff while your buzy doing thing in real life instead of spending your time defending your virtual valuables.There is no ""friendlies"" in this game everyone who can will kill you no matter what. Walk you to someone and I'll guarentee that 9/10 times they'll shoot you in the face even if you don't have anything.You could say ""just join pve server if you don't like pvp"" but the thing is that the PVE side of this game is barely present anymore there is no challenge or interesting aspect especially when there aren't any non player enemies except the occasional bear clipping through the mountains. There is no struggle for food water or shelter either. If you build a shack find some apples a can of tuna and a waterbottle you're set for days and don't even have to think about anything else.So I guess that's the excuse for people to pvp there literally isn't anything else to do in this game anymore but to kill other players.Other than that there are minor things like hackers bad building and the fact that the game has been in EA for like 5 years or so.oh and don't forget the developers toxicity towards his own playerbase even before he created Rust.

2018-01-22,0,0,602,True,Recommended,Not advised for solo players or average small teams. Rust is a hardcore pvp shooter experience. I haven't played since my husband told me about a game breaking patch a few months ago and before that it was almost impossible to play around my work schedule. This game can easily take your weekend up or whatever days off you have. If you start on a low pop server then you're safe until the hackers and elite players get banned from the higher pop servers a few days into a new wipe. I said hacker and elite players. Hacks are the main reason I haven't given this game a real try again since I left my old job. You can't be too good in this game and you can't play private servers if you don't know the admin either. Over half my hours are from Legacy and I admit I miss it but I like the ideas and how things look now. I really liked the exp. system even though I didn't have the time to sink into the game. All it really takes is to have that one person that does have the time in the group. If our group calls us back we will likely go back but right now I think everyone needs a break from this game.,Rust

I was a little stand off ish to begin with because it is a little bit of a grind as a solo player right now. when I play with my clan it's a dream but as solo its a bit of a grind but doable for sure. just gotta make the plays. The community from when i first joined has changed a lot it became super toxic in the sense of KOS or insta raid from the first couple of hours but the new BPs have changed this forcing more interactions and changing how people act to one another. I've really enjoyed my 1k+ hours in the game sure there has been plenty of BS moments but I've made some really good mates from this games and some truly entertaining rivalries and enemies. Give it a go take a chance give it some time and you will enjoy it.,Rust

2018-02-08,0,0,246,False,Not Recommended,I really want to recommend this game. This game has a lot of potential to give you unforgetable experiences and those 'top ten gaming moments'. It has weird social interactions a world setup for awesome role play and a great loot and crafting system for replayibility. All this is buried under the mounds of t.It's 50/50. Either the game or the players ruin it for you. I am still having issues with memory usage with this game. This is partially a fault of my own hardware but when you have to input a command into the console so the game will flush out junk in the memory instead of doing it own it's own is unacceptable.The community is also a biggest complaint by many in this review board. You either play alone on an emtpy server or play with friends you know well on populated servers. There is no inbetween as far as basic gameplay goes.I've been dealing with these issues since I recieved the game years back and I honestly don't think it's fixable at this point.And now this game is leaving Early Access into a 'Full Release'? Sure....You're better off watching YouTube videos of people having a good time then wasting over 100 hours for a single good one.,Rust

2015-06-07,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Many people have different opinions over this game and I can understand why. If you want to buy Rust you will need a lot of time to play videogames this is not a 30 min come play and leave. As it is said on this page Rust is in Early Access and that means a lot of changes happen and servers reset a lot meaning that if you make a base don't expect it to go on for two weeks in fact it would be a miracle if it survives for a week. As of June 6 2015 the game is kind of unbalanced in my opinion in which you can easily raid bases with c4 or rocket launchers and it's hard to make a good base. Rust has a lot of potential for becoming an even more amazing game than it already is but in order to get there it's going to take time. I woud recommend for you to play with friends and to not get frustrated the first time you play as you will probably die 10 times before making a base since you will probably have no clue what to do. Watch tutorials on how to do stuff and you will be ready to go! I love Rust but sadly it also has a lot of problems it needs to fix. Would I recommend it? Yes. Rating 7/10,Rust

It might have changed a lot since then.) Without any friends to joke around with and help and to dream with it is just a contiuous repeat of the same menial tasks over and over again.

2014-10-08,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Well... I may just be bad at the game but well this game is probably made for them who like to die and start over completley.IN GAME I couldn't play on a single server without getting a lack of food. Sometimes I wouldn't even see a animal one single time it clearly felt impossible. you would just end up dying with the stuff you have collected these minutes of playing. itThe weapons i don't have much to say about because I've never used one ( because of the first reason l ) but the bow is just stupid. Well it's a survival game where you have to collect sh*t and others sh*t to survive and those arrows can be the meaning of life and death but Rust's creators made so that you dont even have a aim for the bow not even a little dot in the center of the screen which clearly made it impossible for me to use it.PLAYING WITH FRIENDS This might just be because the game is in alpha but it took ages to find a friends server and if you did find it it would most of the times take ages to join. IF YOU LIKE THE GAME Be careful about bying the game if you have a bad download speed. I got 0.25 mb/s ( I know it sucks b***s ) but i can play a normal game with 60 constant ping but now to the point. Every day or atleast every second day they will make an update that is between 80 mb 220 mb and it may not be the longest update in the world ( prefered to Planetside 2 which made me stop playing that game ) but after a while you will get sick of it.

I recommend this game as It will be in my top 10 (Without keys). I'd just like to see where it goes the best possible outcome and the most fun I've had playing was the opportunity to make huge forts and fight between one another instead of fighting individual battles for 'who owns a random house'. It's not the games fault but it's how people are. I hope the rust team could put more emphasis on that.Keep up the hard work guys and the game is starting to look really awesome not that the graphics made the game better just the building style (Without the keys).,Rust

You're going to be constantly looking over your shoulder creeping through the forest wondering if your being watched. You're going to die a lot. Eventually you will make a base somewhere that you can feel a bit safe. Until the moment you hear footsteps outside your door and hear the faint beeping of the enemy c4.You could play the game passive build far away from others hunt mine build. Or you can build right smack dab in the middle of the map in the heart of the towns and surrounded by 20 other bases. Kill a guy take his stuff get killed lose all your stuff.

Best of luck )EDIT (October 2014) This game has changed a lot recently. The zombies have been removed as frightening as it may sound. That means an end to PVE (except for some wolves and bears. yay...).On the bright side the level design (environment) has grown very beautiful and waay better than the previous version.

2016-01-12,0,0,43,True,Recommended,"Still early access so the game still has bugs. Not greatly optimized yet so it runs a bit slower than it should at times. But none of that takes away from how fun and addictive it can be. It's a crafting and gathering sandbox game wtih a heavy PVP aspect. Survival where everything can be gone in an instant whether it's being on the losing end of a gunfight having your base raided overnight or having allies turn on you.There are a bunch of servers to select from official to community run ones that go from vanilla to heavy modificiations. Most seem to be PVP a few run PVE. PVE is less dangerous though NPC bears can kill you and you could still get raided.My first twelve hours were spent on a heavily popuated PVP server with clans Within minutes as a ""naked"" I was sniped. Repeatedly I would respawn naked on the shore. Sometimes I was far enough from others that I could figure out how to gather and craft basic things like clothes and crude tools. Going solo and being new these ventures rarely lasted long before being killed. Sniped clubbed beaten with rocks mauled by bears and attacked by wolves get used to death. Seconds after a respawn death by sniper. Building a shack solo don't be surprised to be shot before you're done.You can certainly find strength in numbers joining clans or finding random people to help you. Most people I ran across killed me on sight on PVP servers though. Wanting to figure out a fast and effcient build order getting to the point where you can kill and explore the abandoned towns and learn new levels of crafting makes the game very addictive. If you're at all competitive in nature you'll waste endless hours seeking social and strategic ways to get ahead in this game.",Rust

2016-08-24,0,0,34,True,Recommended,This game is pretty awesome. I got it through humble bundle but I would definitely pay full price for this any day. There are some nice people in the community surprisingly. I was expecting a lot of toxicity and was told to steer clear of people but several people helped me learn the controls and what not since it isn't very straight forward and there's no tutorial of any kind.It took me a few hours to build a pretty nice base gather a bunch of materials and get a good feel for the game.I've taken down a boar and a deer and it wasn't too hard. I have yet to run into any hostile wildlife but I hear that bears suck a lot.It's not hard to get started at all just some of the work can be a bit tedious.Loot crates and drops are your friend in this game. Big time. I would not have gotten nearly as far as I did if I hadn't found an ice pick in a loot crate.But be wary of air drops on crowded servers. If you are not prepared you will die.Search abandoned buildings that aren't player made when you first start out. Thats where you can find loot from weapons and tools to ammo to medkits and even food if your lucky.Everyone seems to build near the beach but that's only because it's easier to build on flat ground and the flattest ground is near the beach.I was chatting with a player who had been with Rust since the beginning and I made an offhand comment on how I liked that this was a survival game without zombies and they said there used to be but not anymore.I could not be happier for that. I love survival games and finally finding one that wasn't survival horror is amazing!I went in expecting buggy stuff for it being in alpha rude players and few server choices. I was pleasantly surprised when the only issue was ping every once in a while and if I was on a smaller server there were supposedly Koreans who KOS.All in all this game really gives you the feeling of human survival. You can easily starve to death but it's also easily preventable. You can bleed out hurt yourself falling. Burn yourself on fires! It's all there but it's also a pretty easy game if you're used to survival horror games where you die 8 times in 10 minutes to freaking zombies.If you want a game where you can plan out your base and possibly band together with a few buddies without the awful moans and groans from zombies this is it! I don't think there's a better game in it's field zombie or not.,Rust

2016-08-24,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,I remember a lot of people on Youtube playing this game 2 and 1/2 years ago and thought it looked like a great game and to be honest at the time it was a very good game with so faults (ex. poor graphics) but that wasn't a serious issue it was a newish game still being made. I bought it and I found out it didn't work well on my computer at the time. A year or so later I upgraded and decided to finally try Rust out and everything had changed. There were some improvments but what made it good seemed to have been removed crafting was different zombies were removed starting was near impossible because you get killed on sight etc. Whilw it does look much better I think they've lost too much if this game had a time it has long since passed.,Rust

Don't understand the word 'friendly'. Then this is for you.Updates come hard and fast. Devs LISTEN to communities. The sky is the limit with this game. I've played and watched it grow for sometime now and it is incredible.Base building is second to only one (Hurtworld I love the nodes style they implement) combat is great and is growing in leaps and bounds. Enviroment is harsh and beautiful. Bears are and wolves ninja drop jaw clamp you at every turn. This is truly a game that will turn even the most harded gaming into a people hating rage monster within 6 weeks.If I lost my steam account today I would buy again. 10/10,Rust

It has come along way in constant updates to know being one of the best games I have found on pc. The biggest complaint I have for this game is that there is no transport whatsoever. You have to run for miles and miles and miles and cars or transport where mentioned by the developers but seeing this is a fully released game the transport methods should have already been implemented. Besides that issues I am loving the game. Being that this was originally 19 dollars it is now 35 dollars which I don't understand why they doubled it up. Should have stayed at 19 to be honest but hey. Do I recommend this game Yes. I think this is something you truly will have a great time with.,Rust

I have watched this game evolve from an unpolished ruthless survival PvP to a polished well designed survival PvP.In the early days Rust was a hot mess. The community hammered the devs on how they were under developing such a high potential game. What surprised me is they listened.Out of all the early access games I've participated in Rust stands alone as the one and only early access game where the developers pulled their heads out of their asses and became a true professional game design company. There is no more you could ask from these guys. They proved their ability and deserve every penny they can muster from this title. I for one can't wait for the next!If I could say anything at all to the developers of Rust ""Thank you for not giving up! You have trully created an epic game. As it stands today you are the benchmark that all other early access game designers should be striving to become.""Do I recommend this game? YesIs this game a raw survival PvP that isn't for the weak at heart?

2018-02-08,0,0,422,False,Recommended,So as you can see from my playtime I really have enjoyed this game. Been playing for years. If you are playing solo then you will die alot there are a few things you can do about that 1) Look for modded servers some of which are PvE rather than PvP focused. I've seen servers that are PvE during the day then PvP at night for example2) Set up your own server. Takes some tech skills and of course don't try to set up a server and play from the same computer if you run a potato.3) Look for friendlies on a server and join their group.Rust is primarily PvP based so dying a lot should come as no surprise. You can play solo and have a good time just pick the right server or make your own.I've been running my own server for about a year if that is not your cup of tea you can get a hosted server as well. Either way you need to know a little about computers to get it set up. But once you do you can do things your way.The gameplay and graphics have gotten better and better in my opinion. The crafting has had its ups and downs but is decent now.Even playing solo on your own server can still be challenging...I've lost track of how many times I've been killed by a bear or wolf but that is part of the excitement of the game trying to survive then thrive.The game has been around so long you should be able to find plenty of reviews and videos to help you decide if you want to try it.I highly recommend it!,Rust

2015-05-09,0,0,117,True,Recommended,"Well it's a great game! A few ya know MAJOR PROBLEMS 1 Raiding. Think your base is safe? Wrong. I found out the hard way about 50 times. Greifed into quitting!2 No ""Local"" games/ servers. No SP. So you always have to worry about getting raided killed greiffed and cut into skulls.3 Constant server/ game whipes depending on the server. Sometimes whipes are mandatory. So be prepared to have to completely restart after being greifed/ raided OR the server being whiped.4 Slow resource collecting. The best thing to do is to find an OXIDE server a modded server with x3 resources or something like that.Dont get me wrong this game is absolutely amazing but i cant play it anymore. Im just so tired of spending REAL LIFE days to make a house for some asswhipe to destroy it and make me have to completely restart. This game NEEDS either free custom server hosting or the capability of hosting a LOCAL server/ game with a max of 4 players multiplayer for free. And having a ""Keep inventory for every world"" option would be nice and it could be turned on or off by the host of a server to allow players to bring their items from other servers or to restart fresh for that server only.Get past the raiding and constant restarting 10/10 IGN",Rust
2015-05-09,0,0,478,True,Recommended,How to explain my love for RUST.......i can't not something i can put into words the game is truely amazing whether you play standard community servers or Modded servers the game is fun either way. only downside to rust is if you join a server for the first time and it hasnt been wiped for a week or so you have tonnes of people running around with guns and timed explovies killing an destroying everything they come across even if your a freshie so you will get some rage from that but if you can go past that the game is truely amazing and extremely addictive. Make enemies and allies to build survive and raid others always a challenge around each corner new updates always coming new players every day and even new servers coming online each day trust me you will LOVE RUST.

I started this game on one of the main servers and it took me forever to find a safe place to try and build a base the reason it took so long was I kept getting killed by other players with guns constantly. This continues forver and constantly dying isn't helping me expained my knowledge of the game so I moved to a none pvp server. Guess what I found there hackers and possibly admins. Dying wasn't the problem this time getting all of my stored resources stolen from a secure base was the problem and you can't stop them. I would play this game for days if the community wasn't a bunch of the dark souls community is kinder than them. I would also play this game if it had a single player setting. Fun game terrible people dont' buy it.,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,118,True,Recommended,"I was skeptical. I was unwilling to buy this game after hearing about the downsides of it all I took a step back took a breath and braced myself for the cold water.I am now warm and swimming happily. Mainly because it's not that bad. I've played on PVE servers and PVP server PVE of course being much more enjoyable. However PvP isn't always ""Spawn and get mowed down"" You spawn and have time to collect things. Don't be an idiot and don't dawdle around you won't get shot. Also DO NOT build your home near or even slightly far from ANY spawn points or out in the open. They do have a chance of being looted if you don't have a metal door.This game does have hackers sometimes. It's alpha I'll say that. Rubberbanding annoying. Keep in mind that'll happen. No matter what rig you have. Frames are awful even on high quality rigs. Animals somehow phase through player structures and they're all made of chicken breast. (That stuff is delicious though.) All in all not everyone in every server is terrible. This game has potential. You're investing in something that isn't complete. Remember this. Hopefully the devs continue their great work and don't let this game die.I recommend this if you know what you are buying into and have checked the game out via youtube before hand.",Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,155,True,Not Recommended,Rust BF4 without the vehicles. That's the best way I can describe Rust in its current state. The game has MASSIVE potential but that potential currently goes untapped. What does that leave you with? Mindless PvP where newspawns are killed for fun because there's nothing else to do once you know how to play the game. The building aspect of Rust is currently nothing more than lipstick and the novelty of it wears off fast. The first time you play you'll probably spend a day or two building your perfect base only to find that game is currently so imbalanced it's not funny. It takes a matter of seconds to break into buildings that people spend days making and that leaves you wondering why build at all? This conundrum has lead most servers turning into a PvP fest where gangs roam around griefing newspawn because it's about the only thing to do. Should you buy this game? Right now I'd say no. Don't get me wrong. You'll be hooked after playing it for the first time but unless you are a prepubescent teenager that has no job is on holidays and can stay up all day drinking red bull then you'll come away from this game more often than not feeling frustrated and annoyed.

2014-08-17,0,0,90,True,Not Recommended,While the concept of this game is good it's still missing a lot of components to being a real game. Of course this game is only in Alpha so these components should eventually find their way into it. Now to discuss the Alpha there are a ton of servers running this game and one should easily find one to their region with that being said don't expect to live long in this game. I have tried at least a dozen servers and they all had griefers on them that will kill you without hesitation. Even if you are a noob just running around with a rock they will murder you to get their jollies. It's really sad that one cannot even play the Alpha to see if the game appeals to them without these children with guns (lots of them are Russians) running over to kill you just for the sake of it. Therefore I cannot recommend this game (in its Alpha stage) until they sort this out.,Rust

2015-09-09,0,0,55,True,Recommended,"When I think about ""Rust""and the things I've done while playing the game makes me wanna punch my closest friend in the teeth and yank out his eyes. Why? Because this game can really stress you out! You will burn out in no time! It's fun while getting the hang of it but the community will do anything in it's power to prevent you from advancing in the game. Survival of the fittest defines this experience. There are moments where the learning curve gets a little too steep and you begin to grow ever more impatient. At one point you will just quit the game. Such game genres have a mental expiration date. Also when it comes to content it's got ways to go until it have a decent amount thing to do. With the not so recent graphical overhaul the game has gotten unstable for certain hardware like mine. It's playable but at moments the FPS just drops. For me ""Rust"" will always have a special place in my heart and I do have fond memories but I just got burned out. I hope that the developers continue to develop the game. Score 8/10 Just don't build your house near rad town or some random dude will pay you a visit with a bunch of C4.",Rust
2015-09-09,0,0,728,True,Recommended,First off I want to first say that not all servers and not all players are s on Rust. I have over 500 hours logged and Ive met alot of cool people and had alot of really fun gameplay. There is a high possibility of running into someone and getting screwed over but thats kinda a part in every game. I look at rust like a post apocalyptic survival game. I spend the time not in conflict preparing for war because someone will eventually find you. I think that kind of gameplay make the more mundane parts still seem fun. Setting traps and fortifying your home. If you dont like that much conflict and want to create There are thousands of servers with low populations that are friendly. The second aspect to the game is raiding and firefights so If you like action then you will be pretty happy. There is a joy to breaking into someones base and stealing their after hearing them call you a over and over again in the chat. On the larger population servers it can get a little difficult to survive without friends and you often log in to find your stolen but thats just motivation for revenge. It is early development and I have had some issues with the dev team when it comes to the gameplay. There are highs and lows to each early access. I fell in love with runs back in the legacy days and its just about at the same playing level as its predecessor. There are annoying crashes and bugs occasionally but the dev team is easily contacted and usually fixes the issues pretty fast. All in all the game is one of my favorites now. I had owned Rust for 5 months before playing more than an hour of it and it has transformed from a basic minecraft parody to a new much more advanced and beautiful survival crafting game. In the past few weeks the additions have included custom clothing and weapons modifications. Soon we will be getting vehicles. Mad Max here we come.,Rust

2015-09-09,0,0,434,True,Recommended,10/09/2015 12 hours played only so not full review just quick word of my first game on it. )I was torn between getting this or Evolve both atm the same price this is a bargain for the money now get it if you want a great MMO survival game to play similar in a way to ARK still in early access and so much content to it thats the main reason i wanted it so much to do and actually an excellent looking game at first i thought it looked ok but water is set low default and a few other sliders and effects to change times i look when playing and do think photo realism i do love a game to look real good in the graphics i know gameplay is most important but both together are a perfect mix.I have played ARK on a friends setup it is a great looking game and i had played many hours on it nearly wanting to buy it myself but now i am on RUST and am really happy with the core gameplay i in learning mode now but like the fact the DEVS are really putting great effort in constant updates and fixes/tweaks.I have found most servers are lag free 95% oof the time what is great the server count on some is upto a massive 500 players! that is a real big multiplayer! and there is always many players busy infact 24 hour cycle.I feel this is well worth the asking price of under 15 as i have said much more going on in this for the money than EVOLVE not that EVOLVE is no good at all but maybe just short of general content for what it is i know it's a different type of game but just because they both a shooter type.I won't say muuch about RUST yet as i have not played it enough but have enjoyed my first number of hours and feel it easy to pick up and get into even with not asking for help just going with it at my pace i do think it's worth a shot if you bored at the moment and want something to play. I have played DayZ a bit in the latter weeks but find it to be a little boring at times still it is good but it does need much more work hopefully the DEVS will add to it more and tweak out the engine and of course get a great Zombie nation ravaging the lands as i haven't seen any Zombies in it for ages maybe one in about siz sessions of play. P i know it's early alpha to think Duke didn't that take ten years to make in the end??? something like that. )I feel looking at RUST/ARK/DAYZ i know the latter is Zombies and the middle being Dinosaurs but you know what i'm saying mmoFPS's THAT RUST is a real contender of GLORY! the stats will say in a year or so....i'll look them up in the future. Anyway keep the peace and enjoy whatever you gaming....&gt &lt &gt &lt &gt &lt &gt &lt &gt &lt &gt &lt I'll be back in a month or so to add to this...,Rust

2014-01-18,0,0,276,True,Recommended,Overall my experience has ranged from chill to heart racing cortisol pumping panic. Loot raw chicken breast from dead bears while you desperately search for just one more pile of wood.. always one more. Depending on the server you may have the island to yourself or be forced to face countless bandits as well as those that seem to simply watch the world burn although so far nothing can actually be set on fire aside from the one torch you spawn into the game with.It's still in Alpha so there are some rough edges which is to be expected.

2014-01-18,0,0,7,True,Recommended,The gaming experience in Rust is unparalleled to many similar games of a genre so hyperbolized in systems graphics and gameplay. It becomes so difficult to truly find which game is best for you. So how does it compare?Rust is undeniably one of the most impressive and well established survival games I've had the opportunity of playing. Despite this game being in early access (has been 1 month and 8 days since release) it is already extremely well built and enjoyable. Initially this game boasts an extremely well populated community with hundreds of players on a game at a time with hundreds of games running in all. In game the game plays fairly well with solid fps even on moderate laptop and pc systems. To sum up the experience you will find yourself spawned in any random locaiton of the map (an island) with a number of biomes ranging from plains and mountains to radioactive zones and coastline. The day and night cycle is impressive with a general atmospheric experience that has you truly immersed. While there currently isnt any weather system in place I am certain there will be one in the future. Wildlife and enemies are sparse throughout the game a situtation that has plauged gameplay as explained in the cons below. Furthermore a simple yet enjoyable crafting system and random event (air drops) makes the game extremely pleasurable. Lastly the crafting systems leads to an impressively fun building system allowing players to be creative with their homes and defenses. CONSDespite the amazing well built gameplay and graphics the game lacks in the MOST important aspect of all the multiplayer.My ONLY critique of the game is the overall lack of stability in multiplayer. Inititally playing I had faced multiple players as a fresh spawn often times finding myself outgunned by veteran or well established players. These players undeniably hold themselves to a standard of KOS (Kill On Sight) rampaging and hunting players throughout the game. This can be EXTREMELY disconcerning for players especially for new ones. I have oftentimes been attacked within the relative safety of my home as bandits attack new players' homes until they are forced to come out. Oftentimes this results in a shotgun blast to your head an instantaneous end to all of your hard work. To add to the inequality of the game loot and resource spawns are extremely unequal. Oftentimes spawning in specific areas of the map resulting in highly contested areas of extreme wealth and other areas lacking any (if at all) resources. This makes it extremely difficult for these new players to establish themselves if they are forced to contest these resource soaked areas while undeniably outgunned by established players. IF there is any lasting note I have to say about this game it would be that Rust is an enjoyable impressive and entertaining experience for any/all gamers to the survival genre. Multiplayer games can be enjoyable while the game runs smoothly in an impressive aesthetic world. Further enhanced by its crafting system. Only qualms are that you should worry about other players and initial inequality. But once you find your mojo and truy begin to establish yourself in the game the experience becomes second to none. I highly reccomend this game and do hope that the issues (few as they are!) shall be fixed (this IS early access afterall!!!) eventually. So go out and play some RUST! You will learn to love it!!,Rust

2014-02-08,0,0,76,True,Recommended,Rust is a very intense survival game for the gamer that likes the difficult struggles of the wilderness.This game is amazing considering it is a early access alpha.I can't wait to see what the developers come up with in these next updates.,Rust
2018-01-21,0,0,43,False,Recommended,"There are a large number of survival games these days.""Minecraft"" is kid friendly sandbox of digital Lego.""DayZ"" and ""7 Days to Die"" simulate a zombie apocalypse. ""Rust"" on the other hand simulates ""Lord of the Flies"".You arrive in the world naked hungry and only carrying a single rock and torch. You need to kill animals to eat make tools make a base and learn new skills up a tech tree to find ways to survive as long as possible and outlast everyone else. The environment and other players on your server will ensure that you experience enough challenge grief comedy and frustration in the process.Unless you band together with real life friends in the game to form a gang you don't really have much of a chance of surviving very long.... and you need time to develop the essential skills you need to survive. While it's possible to make friends with other players and work together in the game this is unlikely to ever happen. The optimal solution to the ""prisoner's dilemma"" game theory is routinely used since the rewards of killing other players is greater than cooperation with them. To the rational mind it is stupid. The primitive civilization that exists at the start of the game could get much further ahead if everyone worked together but this simply doesn't happen. Hence the only rational playing strategy is shoot on sight kill or be killed. Often the mere sight and sound of other nearby players should strike fear into you.The possibilities abound for the evil player to cause grief. Of course you can pretend to be friendly and then turn around and stab someone and this is a common and cliche tactic. You can also pretend that you are naked and carrying nothing to lure in opportunistic thieves only to pull out an AK47 assault rifle. You might simply choose to be an opportunistic player who camps outside other people's bases ready to kill and get inside as soon as they open the door to leave! There's some strategy in base building to be learned but it simply delays the inevitible. Most people will set up base near loot rich areas on the map close to landmarks which are interesting to explore in their own right which creates common areas for random encounters fights and death to occur. Aside from online barbarism you can also have some fun with roleplaying. You can offer yourself up to clans and get forced into indentured servitude to other players. You can set up your own shop and draw signs and pictures for others to see. You can try to be a wandering door knocking religious pacifist preacher (with the expected results!). You can start handing out weapons to your more primitive neighbors to see what happens. The best moments of the game occur when the game's entropic dynamic is turned on it's head and the other players own descent into madness creates hilarious conversation and emergent gameplay opportunities most of which ends up with a swift death!Getting higher on the skill tree takes a lot of time effort and resources. The more players who work together and simply put more hours into the game than you did will get there before you at which point it's too late for you to catch up. In order to really ""win"" you need to be playing the game like a full time job with a large number of friendly players and that's just not feasible for many people. Nor is it a good or fair gameplay device. To top that off the ""always on"" nature of the game's servers mean that when you log back into the game you will often find your base raided looted and destroyed. It takes a long time to build a base but only a short time for a hostile raiding party of other players armed with bombs and assult firearms to trash it. Your problems simply compound if you are completely wiped out by other players and have to start all over again from scratch.Ulitmately the brutality of Rust will crush your spirits. As the game's name implies Rust is all about entropy. There is a total lack of fairness and balance in the game although it feels like there should be but this is interestingly determined by all the other players. By no means is anyone compelled to kill but they do. After a while the server becomes chock full of everyone armed to the teeth with firearms and base destroying rockets and bombs. A newbie entering the game naked will simply get killed on sight ""just because"" and fail to make any headway. Rust eventually becomes like a heated game of Monopoly where not only do you lose friends but you start the game with nothing while all of the colour groups are owned by other players who have built hotels everywhere for you to land on. After a week or so the servers have to be routinely nuked clean to set everyone back to a level playing field. I presume that this is the ""final solution"" because the game does hint that you are living in the aftermath of a nuclear war!Solo players would be better suited to other survival games as they simply won't get to see all this game has to offer. If you do want to play solo then it's best to find a server that isn't very busy. That will give you time left to your own devices to learn enough crafting skills from blueprints to be able to compete in combat at least. Later on you will be able to build a small base that will dissaude powerful players from mounting a siege. If you REALLY have a huge bank of knowledge you may be able to set up a shop or bargain your way into larger gangs who may want to utilize your skills. Even still however the higher level items require huge amounts of resources to research and the game requires an inordinate amount of busywork when you aren't being constantly hunted. Cooperation with other players is supposed to happen at this point but it doesn't. If playing solo prepare for many frustrating deaths and if you live that long a huge grind for loot. There's a lot going for the game graphically and the mechanics of the game are well thought out and executed however the learning curve is brutal. Aquiring blueprints for crafting items is a bit random. Many people will simply give up in frustration at some of the toxicity of the other players. Even those that make it far enough to develop a nice base after spending many hours will eventually be heartbroken by the base raiding. It's fun to be on the other side of that equation but it's really not much of a victory if the base's occupants are offline. It deprives players a chance to defend their base and hence ruins an otherwise good opportunity for an epic siege battle with people present to at least ""try"" to defend it. At the moment the offline raiding doesn't feel fair at all. Aside from the base raiding your base will degrade if you don't spend time to maintain it. Combined with the regular server wipes that will ultimately clear out all your hard work you are constantly reminded that nothing is permanent in the world of Rust. Combine this with the brutality of the other players and this makes the game feel utterly futile on some level for artistic effect. Since you can't take everything with you when you die in this game just as in real life you may as well jump in cause as much chaos as possible and try to have a good time doing it.It's games like this that teach us what a lawless anarchy looks like when there are no laws no incorruptible police force and no restrictions on weapons and firearms. It also teaches us what humanity must have had to go through to reach the civilization we have today bringing new light to colonial conquests in history and seeing them through a new lens. The game is stragely addictive and educational at least. If not it's a subtle warning about the darker side of human nature.In this game you will either die a hero or live long enough to become Rust's arch villian. ""Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven"" maybe as Rust's world truly is a paradise lost.Rust works in this way as a piece of philosophical art.",Rust

2015-05-16,0,0,53,True,Not Recommended,"""Very posetive"" t. I bought this game early on in its development and paid four dollars for it. Not even worth that. This game is stupidly unforgiving and that dosent even account for the players. Basicaly you'll start off with nothing and spend 45 mineuts at least just to get the resources to build a measly shack But good luck getting there because every player and their mother who isnt also just starting (and sometimes them to) will be out for your blood for no reason whatsoever. If they kill you good luck finding where you died or the house you started on. After ages of grinding and avoiding the overabundance of players you may finaly get to settle into a cozy little house that you feel safe in. Let me remind you that this is at least 3 hours into the game (if your lucky). Congratulations for not dieing thus far. But look at the time! You should be getting to bed. WRONG! No! your not allowed to leave this everlasting torm of bad map design and even worse players. You leave its over. if your gone for more than 8 hours and you dont have a house made entierly out of reinforced steel its all gonna be gone when you get back. Yep players can kill you and steal everything you own while your not there and theres nothing you can do ab out it. The amout of time you have to sink into this (actualy pretty boring) game is rediculous for the rewards you get. Theres no point of even starting unless your playing a 12 hour session and even then after you get up from your power nap and inject more Mt. Dew into your bloodstream theres' still no gaurentee that all your wont be gone and you'll be back at square one. DO NOT BUY. EARLY ACCESS AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

2015-05-16,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Alpha game. Doesn't have all the features implemented. Not optimized. Even though it's in the alpha stage I still expect a perfect AAA release quality game NOW! I can't wait I paid for it now why isn't it perfect? What's the developer hiding?Also this game is a PVP survival game. Other players kill me all the time for no reason! Why? I knew the theme of the game when I purchased it but I don't like how I keep dying! Other players shouldn't kill you in a PVP survival game. Also don't like the survival aspect. Now that I've covered what most of the negative reviews say I'd like to give my own perspective.It's probably best played with a pre existing group. You WILL get your shot off while carrying nothing but a rock and/or spear. No warning just shot. The strong dominate the weak and it's hard to become strong. It takes skill and a whole lot of luck. Your best bet is to make friends on the server. This will be extremely hard unless there's a nice group around but if you can get in you'll be okay. just prepare to die a lot and lose your stuff. It's a true open world game. Go live in it. Die in it. Don't expect to become king of Rust. Set your goals low see if you can do better next time.,Rust

2017-05-06,0,0,619,True,Recommended,"Once apon a time there was a young boy who wanted to play rust. He got the game from a humble bundle at a criminal price. The little boy had seen lots of rust and those who played it. He thought that rust would be a game with common goals for all players. He thought that that common goal would be to have the best base and most guns. He was right except he forgot about 75% about all of the videos he had seen. He realized that each video had someone being raided or raiding. He had overlooked this key fact. On the first day he built himself a nice little shack out of wood. He came back on not 30 minutes later to find out that the entire base had been burned down and he had been killed. He thought "" Oh well. **** happens. "" This continued for days. And the days turned into weeks. Until he just had enough. He thought that if he had played more than an hour on a small server he could get atleast a small unraidable base. He was wrong. Very very wrong. So he quit rust. But the allure of getting good loot had won him over. So he had enough. He played 7 hours straight until he had a big base. He then logged off for a day. He was blessed that the rust gods had favored him. He had not been raided! He played almost endlessly. All the way until he had raided many and had many enemies and allies. At the end of the day he was very proud. What he didn't know about was the fact that the wipe happened the very next day. He was depressed but he still fought. And to this day he still plays rust. The End.Now that the story is over Rust is a game that has no end to fun. The rage meter is high with this game. Think about the most you have raged at a game and then multiply that by 5. That is how much you will rage. The game also takes a lot to get used to. But overall if you want a game with almost endless fun then purchase rust. I had gotten rust for 5 dollars in a humble bundle sale. The price that is listed on steam is still criminal. I do love rust for the friends i have made playing this game and i reccomend this to any average gamer because all servers are not PVP. If you want to sharpen your skills or just build then join a PVE server. Don't join PVP unless you want to rage like a bull.",Rust

2014-01-26,0,0,20,True,Recommended,The game to me in it's current state is basically Don't Starve meets DayZ. Within the first five minutes of my playing a wolf killed me. The next ten minutes included me finding some resources getting some raw food from a pig and finding some shelters built in the middle of the road. Then I started starving because I could not figure out how to cook food using the campfire after searching for a little while on the internet I came back to my game to find a man standing near me. He talked to me and taught me how to cook so I made my food and ate. Went to a hidden area made small shelter and got off for the night. The next day (real time) I got back on and the same guy was on. he told me he was making a base somewhere off. He said he had some blueprints he didn't need along with some other stuff so he came all the way back to where he met me the night before and gave me said blueprints and a gun with bullets. Then he led me to his base. Since then we've been resource gathering and building our bases I built mine right next to his (we're making sort of a town). I came into the game expecting all bandits but he's given me a lot so far including a flashlight mod pickaxe guns etc. The rest of the people I met on the server have so far been friendly. Some more populated servers may be really bad with that but so far my expereince has been just. Right now there's no real goal but like minecraft you can make some goals. Currently my goal is to make a house and make it well enough to where if bandits do come they won't be able to get to me and my stuff. Also there are a lot of craftables in the game that I can't even delve into right now because I need the blueprints.,Rust

2016-03-28,0,0,1034,True,Recommended,"Playing in both Legacy and ""New"" Rust I've had a quite enjoyable experience. I still remember my first house from two years ago my first friend my first enemy my first server. Sometimes while loading the game I still get that excitement that I got when I had first purchased it. However the days of hacker valley and the P250 are over. The ""New"" Rust looks better than ever coming from untextured plains to a world with several environments to live in with mountains valleys and lakes. Although I dislike that the focus has strayed to far from survival and is now simply a gather and kill FPS in which you eat someone's leg every few hours to fill your food bar. As I say that though the devblogs have revealed concept art for the reintroduction of rad animals a nice addition to the group of adversaries. As of the current state of the game the wolves and bears still come out of nowhere and destroy your like no ever could and players enjoy killing you for your gear or for the sport. But it is definitely managable. Playing solo is possible if you are smart and finding friends is not that incredibly hard unless you aren't socially adept. Even cancerous trolls can find some Nazis in a cave to base with. I would fully recommend this game for players that enjoy surival games in which some amount of skill and game knowledge is required to play to their fullest potentiel. Tips for new players1. Find players on the reddit forums to play with2. Find a server that you'll be able to succeed on One without too many big clans3. If on a server with big clans become a slave Gather resources for them while they teach you of the game and give you blueprints Do not single handedly betray them unless you like that pixelated to get by 10 dudes4.

I understand that things change you want to improve the way your game is this company and the game rust have alot goign for them and always have and always will. My point of this review is to say how disappointed I am that they just completely forgot about what people call rust ""legacy"" now. I dont expect daily weekly or even monlthy updates to the rust ""legacy"" however i feel the community that supported this game from the start at least enough to make this a big deal have felt left out and betrayed. Give us the sniper scope as the 5th attachment give us a few bug updates. at least to make it more complete. It just seems this company has done so well they have almost forgotten about the ""old timers"" if u want to say it like that. I've taken time to play both versions and I know legacy is my game of rust i prefer..please someone understand this and spread the idea of legacy getting some more updates at least to polish their old ideas...for the ones who dont want to move on..for the ones who dont lifke change..we paid for the game to you know..we have a say.good luck to this game and its developers.",Rust

2014-05-21,0,0,44,True,Recommended,The idea behind Rust is a great one. Sandbox resource gathering crafting survival. Realizing that it is still in Alpha stage it delivers on all immediate fronts. That being said... it looses its appeal rather quickly. More so if you play on your own server and full access to everything. The amount of griefing on other servers happens to be substantial though there are ways to keep it from happening. At the moment I wouldn't say it was worth the full price tag. $5 off maybe but not the full $20. There needs to be more added to the game to bring me back. Bigger world space more towns bring the zombies back with better AI (still not entirely sure why they were removed). Great game... just needs a little more to keep people in bring previous players back and gain new ones.,Rust

2014-05-21,0,0,33,True,Recommended,Interesting take on the one man against the world survival. Still in development (as is quite plainly noticable) and as such it still leaves somewhat to be desired. It isn't greatly intuitive and there are a fair few bugs and 'interesting' mechanics but I think this has the potential to be a very good game. Maybe deserves a slightly lower price tag at this stage of development but assuming the final product meets expectations I would consider it a worthwhile investment.,Rust

2014-01-20,0,0,20,True,Recommended,"So it had taken me several hours to get enough food and wood to make a small shack and start building a proper house. I had died several times and had to hike cross country to find my stash of food.But now I was doing alright huddling in my shack at night once or twice huddling while a bear snuffles around the outside. But I had a house with walls and part of a ceiling. I had a furnace and I was making metal for the doors.I was near a barn that I could steal rarer supplies from and rocks and log piles showed up in a nearby field across the road. One day I was super lucky I had found a laser sight in one of the crate.I came out of the barn to see the bear. It slowly turned towards me and I started running. I was almost to the road when I heard shouting over the growling. ""Stop! Stop! you n !"" I spun around in surprise. Three men in leather armor were chasing me one had a gun. They shotgunned the bear. One of them kept on calling me the ""n word."" Once they killed the bear they yelled for me to leave it was their kill.I went back to my shack I had a larger store of materials and my sleeping bag in a house higher up but I didn't want these three to know that. They didn't seem to want to kill me. I had the problem that I didn't want to use my microphone and chat seemed to have stopped working.So I began off loading my stuff into the small box I had in the shack. Then I heard them. ""Here's where the n lives."" This guy was in charge and he clearly was an . I had to be careful. ""Come out you n !"" I came out. The guy had a hand cannon I though about pulling out my 9mm I had just finished. No I couldn't win a fire fight with the three of them. I didn't know what the other guys would do.They checked my box outside there were only rocks inside. ""I'm taking your rocks n "" I didn't care. Then he threw me a pickaxe ""get to work you n "" He and one of the guys ran off. I was going to survive. The last guys stood there. Then over the voice chat he said apologetically ""here have some food. Sorry man."" I grinned this was Rust. I didn't tell him I already had 30 cooked meat. I took the offering. I didn't mention that I had a better hide out. Later I found my shack ransacked the box inside was gone but the box outside had some good leather armor. That night I put metal doors up and went to bed. Who knows if I'll be safe in the morning. But I don't care.",Rust

After a few days I finally met a good group of people who took me in and taught me the ropes. The game (once you can finally get going) is great. Its extreme mincraft in a sence. Craft or die kill or be killed. Sadly the kill or be killed part is all to true. if you see a player don't try to be friends unless its a new spawn and ou can take him down if you need. If you do have to fight grab cover and be ready cause firefights are intense on a perma death game like this. Goodluck to all who play!,Rust

2016-09-09,0,0,762,True,Recommended,RUSTIt has so many layers to it so where to begin.Well. I'm no writer so I'll try to keep it to the point.Typical negative stuff said about RUST Hackers haven't ever seen one. 587 hrs on record. Grind Sure. But there are tons of servers with x3/x5/x10 even x1000. You think it feel like a grind simply pick another server. Griefers Once again. Pick the right server with no griefs allowed. Griefed anyways pop a quick message to admin and they'll help you. If not then you're doubtfully on the right server. Lag Not really not anymore than the next game even though there has been some at late I haven't really noticed any since 2 updates ago. Only people who shoot on sight Simply not true. Alliances are made and RUST has somewhat of a self justice enviroment. Especially if you like to be part of the social aspect chat helping people ect. It's my clear opinion that jackasses often get's as deserved. It really is a living social world where you'll meet the same people many times which is why you'll know who's who form alliences build neighborhoods ect. If you are a lone wolf like playing solo well unless you're one of those Chuck Norris kind of guys unlearn that quick to survive ) Offline raiders Build better bases it's a big part of why I enjoy RUST. Trial and error baby learn from your mistakes. There is alot of different ways to keep those unwanted visitors out and I personally love to see how raiders have to give up. I don't understand why people get so upset over raiders. They are doing you a service by testing out your design... for free and they use plenty of ressources to do it. Unless ofc they find your lootroom..What else.. What do I don't like?All of above still jazz,Rust

2016-07-12,0,0,219,True,Recommended,"heard this game was terrible but after awhile I gave in and bought it.Day 1 woke up naked discovered my amazing breasts and beautiful black skin. Score. My only possessions a rock and a torch. Using my rock to smash trees until I unlocked some tools and a spear. Built a spear now I am a neolithic woman of power. found an elk snuck up on in because I am a rogue seriously. I stabbed it once then threw my spear at it and watched it climb a steep hillside instantly with my spear hanging out of it climbed up the mountain like a boss because of my powers found the elk with a wobbly spear hanging out it ran right at me and so I screamed and smashed it with a rock for the win retrieved my power spear met my buddy who came online to help me we build a nice two level shack and gorge on pig meat after another hunt We add a third storey to our shack and stand on top of it marvelling at our domain and quoting the lion king ""Everything the light touches is our kingdom"" spot a small foundation built within spitting distance of our dwelling head out on a quick raid to demolish it. While breaking it down a dude jumps out of the bushes and throws a spear into my chest it wobbles there and I scream still alive jumping and whipping out my own spear which I plant into my assailant's instantly while my pal bashes his head with a bone club. We return to the base and dine on man flesh then wait out the night sitting by the fire laughing about our fortune in battle. the sun comes up and we prepare ourselves for a day of gathering stone wood and meat We stand on the top deck literally seconds from departing on our day BAM a bullet rips one of the walls off and we dive for cover as a pair of dudes with AKs and rifles basically shred our entire existence inside of 10 seconds. They came with the dawn. We are so very boned. I am shot and fall to the ground screaming and bleeding out while my homey valiantly defends our claim with his stone spears. With his dying effort he heaves the spear like Leonidas at Xerxes but it misses and he goes down in a hail of gunfire Wake up in my sleeping bag another raider standing right over me shoots me in the face again. 240 seconds to respawn and they have taken everything from me. I respawn literally on the other side of the map. My second life went so much better. Survived three human days had a fort on top of a hill like KING THEODEN. Went to work got a text from my homey 30 minutes after I left saying how we lost everything while they went out smoking.11/10 would bring dawgs to the yard with neolithic breasts any daySigned an enthusiastic gamer Day 632 (161 hours playtime)There are no safe places in the blasted lands outside our valley. Here the grasses are lush and the trees spread their limbs toward pale windswept clouds while elk graze in the meadow and wolves howl on the ridgeline loping long shadows that seem to drive the night. Their mournful howl slames the cold fear of death into my very soul. The darkness creeps over our meagre claim closing us in its cold grip. The night holds much terror but soon we will be much safer.We are nearly ready to begin construction of high stone walls to encircle the entire claim. This will take many days of stone harvesting but our group's cohesion makes these runs easier and easier each time. More warriors have joined our tribe sat in peace by our fires and spilled blood in the name of our brotherhood. Nearby tribes wish to break bread with us and pass by our clansmen without bloodshed though with their numbers they could easily have overwhelmed us and taken our belongings. Perhaps they fear us but the truth is unknowable. We place our faith in Big Brother the dark face with eyes that reflect moonlight. He guides us and his eyes watch over us.",Rust

There were a clan of literally 10 peeps on a server pop with about 20 25 ppl. They had over 100 c4 about 7 m249's (idfk how but they did) and my friend knew how much gear this was and I had no clue. Just as I was leaving a smaller but more deadly clan came along and I had a full inv of c4 guns armour and mats they insta killed me with their guns and m249's.

You spawn in and get killed before even getting a basic weapon. Other people team up in groups of 8 or more to kill a solo player. You either join with 12+people or don't even bother. More than that. Do you have work or school? Forget about even playing as even one day without 2 or 3 sessions of about 3 hours will get you killed while sleeping. Also you have to provide wood for real time protection of your base. What is this??? Browser game era??? Such garbage. Glad I payed only 7 euros on a sale a few years ago. Though it would change when release fully but it got even more trahsier if it is possible.If you ever consider buying this use the money on some other great games on sale as Rust isn't even worth playing for free and now they charge 30 euros for it.

U can't see any menu entry so u can't join any server because u can't see the serverlist (u can join by randomly clicking on the screen or joining a fried through steam) but that is it. Because of the missing menu entrys u can't craft anything which means that u are deserved to die. Except u have a nice freind who take care of everything for you (does not make fun). Even it is Early Acces i can't understand ehy it is still not fixed. The Bug was reported more than 3 months ago. They should take the linux version out of the store until they managed to finish the game. Btw. Windows Version runs fine. No game killing bugs so far.,Rust
2015-05-23,0,0,6,True,Recommended,"So I turned up late to the party with rust as I was curious what all the hype was about after spending 5 minutes trying to figure out how to play the game I come across a dog which I instantly wanted to befriend as I approached the dog with only my rock in hand he didn't respond very nicely and ate me alive..... This was a learning curve that rocks come across as a harmful weapon. Once I respawned I decided to find human friends which would help me get used to the game as I walked towards a massive structure I made eye contact with a ""Mr.Bubbles"" who was holding an AK. To avoid the same experience I had with the dog I removed my rock from my hand and said ""Hello"". This was a mistake as he clearly desired my rock and killed me for it (The same as the dog) I then decided my heart couldn't go through the loss of another rock. logged off and uninstalled.11/10 Rocks are clearly more valuable than I thought (R.I.P Rocks)",Rust
2014-01-21,0,0,85,True,Recommended,Amazing game a little hard at first but that's to be expected especially when it's early stages. Depending on what server you get in your experiences will vary you may end up starting off in a great location or be surrounded by a bunch of players that are and kill you immedately. That being said I would definitely recommend it to others.,Rust

2014-01-21,0,0,16,True,Recommended,For all those Minecraft lovers out there! this is an awesome game! Sure it's still in it's alpha stages but the gameplay is very good. Here's the scenario You land on an Island naked. All you have is a rock some bandages and that's it. you have to crush rocks and trees to collect materials to craft better weapons and armor. Don't forget that you can als starve!There seem to be some sort of powerplants that are full of radiation.

Cannot figure out how to cook meat die of poisoning from eating raw meat. Start over. Forgot to put a door on my shack first night and zombie killed me Start over. Build first home with wooden door. Gets broken into first night and lose all my stuff. Start over. Build a home without a ceiling and someone build a staircase into my home messed up stuff and killed me Start over. Ran into wilderness for 10min to log out in a field somebody killed me while i was sleeping Start over. Watch someone get killed by zombies pickup their full rad suit and several weapons FEEL LIKE A BOSS. Get squashed by Airdrop and loose all my new toys. Start over.Needless to say I keep playing the game because at its core it is fun as hell. If you don't like the frustration i mentioned above play on a PvE server with Sleepers disabled but be prepared to have a difficult time finding resources.Considering the game is still in ALPHA i HIGHLY recommend picking it up!,Rust
2014-01-28,0,0,249,True,Not Recommended,"i realize the game is still in alpha BUTthe developers need to SERIOUSLY (!!!!!!!!!!) address that player killing player issueThe game is really fun (if u dont get killed) u can search for food resources building sites make your tools weapons etc. (and i highly recommend to play the game together with friends) but that fun ends when other far more advanced players than you kill you with automatic rifles raid and take everything you had and destroy your home with explosives and u couldnt even do nothing because the only thing u have is a freakinghandmade shotgun.i wouldnt mind that same skilled players would fight each other but thats not what happens. same skilled players seldomly kill each other its almost always axes vs rocks guns vs bows M4s vs handmade weapons.it's an interesting expirience full of ups and downs but in the end if it makes you rage and you are and feel like it was a waste of time (because you lose everything again and again) than its certainly not worth it especially for that price (19 )i clicked several times on the No button to make sure that i dont recommend this game to anyone as it is nowbefore i played this game i read somewhere on the game's website ""we want to make a game that will be really awesome trust us"" or something like it well i feel really betrayed now D btw.. hackers paradise...for me its a game than makes you more angry than entertaining... so this br&gt bye bye rustNamaste",Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,105,True,Recommended,I played DayZ for a good long while and though DayZ and Rust are very different they are very similar. It's the things that make it different though in my opinion that make Rust a better game. I feel like it's smoother and makes more sense. The only things I would like to see in the future is less modern stuff and more primitive crafting. I think the best part about Rust is that you start out so primitive and make a huge tech leap or die trying at least. That and maybe more RP aspects. Character customization and some new skins could really improve that aspect and make your story your own. One last thing BEARDS I want beards.,Rust

This only goal in this game is to make all the other players cry uncontrollably or get so angry at that game that they break something in their house.

2014-11-22,0,0,3268,True,Recommended,My Review of Rust . As this is a pre release that is not a finished game we should expect issues in linux and windows.Over all the game is good even at this stage when it's playable. after todays update it stops at bootstrapping or the like and will not load. also before this after a update the text to get into the servers was too light to be seen you have to guss what server and key to log in. thats all my gripes with the game so far (besides getting kicked).I was able to play for long time. and while not the most over high demanding scenes it is well done . game play was smooth most of the time. due to features not being setup you can't save servers etc . So I've played on had and on newbie servers alike. So i've had to restart many a time and not just from other player killing me.It is kinda Dayz Forest Mindcraft but better visuals then mindcraft. the game makes building fun and I've seen house/base designs that truly impress(mine not so much) after a long time of not being albe to cook meat and asking for so long that i'm sure players i asked wanted to cook me (by the way you can do this meat from humans).Player range from those that are way ahead of you to same as you in level and lower . New players if you can see server list start on a newbie server to gain skills etc.meat is gotten from animals you kill with a rock your default weapon go for pigs. if you run into a wolf or bear on normal server you most likly will die. killing these animals is also how you get to not be naked.If this offends you and or you don't like this don't let your kid play . no girl models are in the game as yet as we can guess what the male gamers would do alot of the time just watch Dayz and you will see . but girls do play.I'm on a intel i7 2600k 8gig ram nvidia gtx 650 + linuxMint 17 64bit and it plays very well.As now early in the day you can find empty servers also good for new players(weekends as well).I love the game and besides the issues at the top of this post/review you will enjoy the game.It is well worth the money in my view . try it out you will have fun and your supporting a new game on your platform of choice . I look forward to future addons and the full game.It's open world thats is done pretty darn well . you build your base weapons etc and in the end it makes the game that much more your own. No one will have the same base and just the size of the world is nuts.Oh snow areas desert areas have lots of rocks to get your ore up . forest has food and trees and ore.it's all a balance you have to learn and work with . You will end up and deal with those that prey on the weaker players. your house may be broken into. you may and most likly will be killed many times. your stuff will be taken on servers that allow it.I learned all this the hard way. I just jumped in .enjoy The Modding Den,Rust

2017-03-29,0,0,1018,True,Recommended,Rust got me back into gaming after a long break. The videos on Youtube looked hilarious and fun.I'll admit it can be maddening at times frustrating and hateful.BUT you just roll with it and keep going and it has some of the best gameplay I've ever experienced.The world is gorgeous and feels realistic. Aside from bears phasing in and out of reality the wildlife is threatening and life like.Building is fun farming is actually not unpleasant. Now... you are going to get killed. A LOT.I was murdered by a rock to my skull literally in my first two minutes of gameplay the first time I logged on.This hasn't really slown down in the higher population servers.But you get smarter. You get friends to join you or you join them. Or you make new friends.OR you just go quiet like and adapt gameplay accordingly.Some updates you'll hate but for the most part you'll enjoy the ever changing nature of the game.10/10 I recommend.

Playing this game is like being in a relationship you keep getting abused in but you keep comming even though it tortures you by letting you know how bad you are. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE...but its can be the most rewarding game ever As a guy who has over 1 300 hours into this hell Let me sum all the good and bad about this game.PROS Base building get creative and protect your stuff with traps and show off how good of a builder you are. Gunplay For the most part feels pretty balanced and when you lose it genually feels like its your own fault. RNG Maps every map you play on always feels unique your probably never gunna play on the same map twice in rust. Built in monuments these places are the uniqe part of rust with all the style and loot you want and desire. Survival although clearly not at its peek the survival elements you face do tend to be a big factor on how you play. Community servers PLAY ON THESE SERVERS IF YOU WANT ACTIVE ADMINS 24/7. Updated Frequently Because of this the game never really feels boring knowing your going to get new updates soon. AWSOME DEVS seriously underrated and underapreaciated thing in the whole game are the developers that make it they love this game more then we do and it shows.CONS New players im sorry but your going to struggle more then anyone else in this game because 9 times out of 10 the person you try to make friends with will very likely kill you before batting an eye at your plead for mercy. Solo life the struggle is real every time my advice for solo players is to get on solo or low pop servers. THE GRIND weither its for stone components or scrap the consistent grinding for stuff will wither on your soul. ZERGS the worst thing about rust are the s that band like 30 people in one group and take out anyone that even looks at there general direction. Offline raiding unless your solo your scum for offline raiding pure and simple and most of the people that play this game are scum. Also there is no real way to protect your base from offline raids but traps do help. Hackers people who dont have any skill use hacks to ruin everybody else's fun feels bad when you actually earn and some asshat with an aimbot just takes if from you. Server deaths most servers just die too quickly in about 2 or 3 days having no people on for you to play against sucks. Offical Servers STAY AWAY unless you want to risk being in a server with hackers and no admins to help with that. The Community I know all games have there cancer part of there fanbase but rust has at least 75% of there population made up of egotistical memeing thunder that will camp your door for hours just to get bug the out of you. Its actually at the point that the community are scaring away the new players that just want to play for fun and thats .PROS FOR NEWBIES TIPS They just recently added some helpful goals and advice for prople new to the game. Wooden lock update also recently added was that you no longer needed a key to keep if your the one who made the lock and key raiding is now no longer a thing good for yall ) I'll be honest even if you fall in love with this game your still going to hate it eventually but Im glad this game is offically out it deserves to have more people on and i look forward to the future updates of this game according to the roadmap of rust this is just the beggining. 8.5/10,Rust

Devour their innards and make clothes out of their hides this is a great survivial simulation. Come across another person who is role playing as a native who has never came across another person outside of their tribe. Diplomacy is attempted but instead spears are exchanged and arrows are released. End up on the beach again with no clothes and the feeling that making friends on this game is impossible. Came to the conclusion that the default nature of mankind is to over your peers. I now roleplay as a serial killer who holds no hostages I HATE YOU ALL AND WILL TRACK YOU DOWN AND SLEEP INSIDE YOUR CARCASSES.. YOU ALL!,Rust

One thing that really annoyed me as a new player in any old server or new is being killed before being able to experience and progress further into the game. They should really implement some sort of ""Newbie"" protection for a certain period of time in the early development of a characte to let the new players immerse and prepare themselves for the PVP aspect of the game.",Rust

2016-07-19,0,0,919,True,Not Recommended,Read this if you want to have a completely unbiased opinion on playing SOLO in the current build of rust otherwise go and read someone elses eview. I have played this game on multiple servers and the style of play doesn't vary. Therefore I put it down to the game rather than the players for the current state of the game.To save you reading this whole article if you don't want to you simply can no longer play Rust casually solo and enjoy it like you used to. Now I'm not just gonna slate the devs of this game because all in all they're doing a ing good job however I am gonna explain why some of the new features will never work like they have intended. Back before XP update the game was simple. You earn items by unlocking them through a blueprint and then crafting them with different recources which were obtainable at any stage during the game. At any time a player could obtain a high value item from a blueprint simply by hitting a barrel. Now the XP system has been introduced and updated multiple times you must grind for a minimum of at least one hour to obtain the weakest projectile weapon the bow. Before the XP system all a new player had to do was grab himself 50 cloth and a bit of wood and he was able to engage in tense early game pvp. The fact you could join a new server and get straight into pvp is what made the game so immersive and enjoyable for me.In the current version of rust I hate to dissapoint you but as a solo player 90% of you will never unlock a higher tier weapon than a crossbow. I have played for 2 wipe cycles now and by the end of each cycle I was not able to achieve a higher level without labouriously farming and grinding for an amount of time that summed up to literally hours. Of course in a larger group it is a lot easier to get levels provided you know how to utilise the ownership method to maximum efficiency.Being a solo player this is not the kind of game I would have purchased when it first came out. It's not that I completely despise the concept of farming because that is what creates part of the survival element in the game. HOWEVER as we all know if we have played rust the outrageously intense PVP is what sets this game apart from all other survival games. The fact that players must now grind so much in order to be able to fight other players now means that majority of players (unless in a group) will be at a huge disadvantage when it comes to PVP and therefore do not do it anywhere near as much as they used to pre xp update. This means that for all other solo players they will rarely find a situation in which they encounter another solo player for those intense battles the game is renonwned for.Let me know what your thoughts are and I hope that a dev will perhaps stumble upon this review.,Rust
2017-07-02,0,0,284,True,Recommended,What the **** did I just play...I literally went from running butt naked along the beach to cutting down a tree with a rock wrecking animals with a spear and then getting an AK...Woah we skipped some steps... This game is for the gamers that have time... For the gamers that are passionate and will play constantly because if you don't you will abandon your base get raided and get nowhere in the game...This game is a grinding game in which you need to gather a lot of things to make bases weapons and systems like quarries to get resources faster therefore you should connect with your friends and make a huge fortress...You need to remember that in this game once you die you lose everything so get ready for a wild ride in the world of Rust.Also keep in mind that the game has mods in which you can practice your pvp before risking your items in battle and also that the game is not well optimized so you will most likely need a pretty good rig or just stand many frame drops with no constant fps at all. 8.5/10,Rust
2017-07-02,0,0,258,True,Recommended,It is a very fun and beautiful game I really like it but it really needs to be optimized I have a GTX1060 video card and even when I turn all the settings down fully I only get 100 fps. (CS GO on ultra settings runs at 300 fps on this card)so yeah.. Also the loading times... for me the game load for at least 3 minutes and then joining a server takes ing 6 minutes. So if you own a laptopor an older PC I really really dont reccomend this game to you.,Rust

2017-07-02,0,0,187,True,Recommended,"Even though i recommended the game there are problems with it. First problem is the ""wipe"" feature. I understand its mainly to get rid of buildings that someone has left and not touched but that ruins what players who DO play often have made. My friends and I have made countless fortresses and castle like buildings that took hours on hours of work only for the server to wipe it away. Also if someone says ""Its to add the update into the game"" games like Minecraft and others do that and don't wipe what you have made. Doesnt matter on how different the games may be. The second is frame rate / graphics. Obivously this is an early access game so i dont mean this as a big problem but a little more work into the graphics would help. Its a great game and has potential but i personally have stopped playing due to the #1 reason being i personally can't stand the wipe feature. Overall id say give it a shot and maybe if would fit you.",Rust

However I prefer Legacy anyways. No lag on low settings awesome gameplay I love being able to craft build and survive. It is very well done in terms of having stuff to do. The mechanics are fine the graphcs and models are a little wonky but it makes Legacy what it is. You meet a lot of people on this game. Some friendly others that you never want to run into again.

2014-12-12,0,0,42,True,Recommended,So although I recommend Rust I do not recommend it to the faint of heart. This game represents the circle of life you live you hit trees with a rock you eat and then you die (probably to the hand of another player). You can be the master of a whole server of half naked or naked if you prefer people and show how the person with the gun most of the time wins or you can be the underdog and create an uprising to take out the biggest contender in the server leading the charge with only a small hachet in one hand and a cooked steak in the other. The choice is yours. 10/10 would watch my friend become a hostage to partially naked people with guns again.,Rust

2014-06-03,0,0,146,True,Not Recommended,"Poor ventilation in the bathroom causes problems like Rust. The game is as alpha as it gets so I'm giving it some credit for the massive potential its concept has. But the execution so far has been poor...and the ""community"". The people who play this game? Foul antisocial adolescents. Not a game for grown ups atm. Or people who prefer not wasting their time with absolutely no defense against griefers. The general gameplay experience is as follows Spawn Get wood Look for rock Find no rocks and eventually starve to death naked and weaponless. Repeat until bored. Quit. The game is also very laggy in more than one respect. The servers obviously but the menus also freeze for a not so insignificant amount of time when navigating and choosing options.Not to mention the OVER zealous banning system they created I am for all intensive purposes banned. What is my crime? I dunno. I got a message on the game stating i was banned no explanation. SO i contacted the support team. Asking what or when it happened. The response was "" your ban was legitimate."" Not what or when. the best i can surmise is the poor connectivity I have with most ""official"" servers. So ya I've had this game for a LONNNGGGG while. and you know what. I waited for it to get better. IT REALLY HASN'T.

2016-07-05,0,0,493,True,Recommended,"So I decided to change my review. My choice to change it happened when I realized that the developers are working not only to get new skins in the game but also to make the game run more smooth. It seems to me they are always trying to find a way to improve the game. I only noticed the design and ""feel"" of the game developing previously. Now I'm finally experiencing it. This game now runs smooth on the minimum recommended specs maybe not on ultra settings but still. Smooth. And the developers are not afraid of trying new things. The most major change was when they implemented a level system but maybe the most interesting time was when they removed it after a while realizing Rust wasn't that kind of a game. Also I'm a PVE player allthough 95% of my time has been on PVP servers. With the new items and the desire to implement new stuff such as power and powersources more and more PVE servers seem to pop up. In the end you shouldn't be surprised if the whole system has changed from being mainly a PVP game to a game where settlers sometimes NEED to co operate. But that's only speculating. I am very excited about this game and the future of it. I highly recommend people to start playing now. This has proven to be a great journey so forth._________________________________________________________Previous not recommended review ""So unless you have 12 available hours to start your game and you know exactly what you're doing and have found a spot where noone with explosives can find you this game is not for beginners. Like beginners in Rust. This game is almost only for old time Rust players. There are no friendly servers only raiding and killing. Don't matter that you're obviously new you're just an easier target and you will get killed and raided. Unless you have a bunker as I said. ""You wake up naked on a beach with a rock and a torch. You have about 1 hr to make tools for hunting or find wild growing food before you die of starvation. Bear and wolf will attack you and kill you. So you must build a house to be safe from wolves and bears. You can only ""harvest"" wood and stone for building material in the beginning. Bears have no trouble getting into your wooden house so you need a second floor or find more materials to build a tool storage so can upgrade your house to stone. If you're not into running around naked while doing all of the above you also need to find materials for clothes. But the biggest threat are other players that will kill you on sight (most probably) raid your house and make you start as you did first time you pressed ""Play Game"". You can make your house unraidable but then you need a furnace and a lot of materials. And of course ppl have explosives so they will get into your house unless you make it all armored but that take even longer time.So unless you have 12 available hours to start your game and you know exactly what you're doing and have found a spot where noone with explosives can find you this game is not for beginners.

2014-06-04,0,0,114,True,Not Recommended,Rust is an Ok game at the moment but it is still in the alpha phase of testing but at te moment there no real updates to improve overall gameplay. After playing this game for 15 minutes you will already have done everything there is to do in this game. Most of the time you play yourjust gathering resources because that is all there is to do theres only 2 types of AI that try to harmyou wolves and Bears. Almost all players will try to kill you if your are on a pvp enabled server. you will also get radied multiple times while playing this game so you got to get used to dying and restarting all over again. The only real hope for not being raided is build a looking place with hundreds of walls around it or joina server early on before too many players join the server and become a bandit yourself. Also the weapons are very limited you get 1 assault rifle 1 smg 2 shotguns 3 pistols 1 bolt action rifle a bow and an axe. those are your only weapons available in the game.,Rust
2014-02-07,0,0,50,True,Not Recommended,Ya sure rust is a good game and it's woth 20 bux but the developers do jack The last major update was when they removed the zombies and that feels like ages ago. I will probably never buy another game from facepunch. It's just money money more money. For example working on updates and better gameplay is more important than PUTTING THE GAME ON ANOTHER STORE. And in the devblogs they say that they're sorry and but they are just ing with us this point. They'll probably just keep it on steam untill they make enough $$$ from it and take it off again. I mean lets face it. Facepunch does not give a about thus game. I'm sorry but I cant recommend it untill they actually dedicate themselves to it.,Rust

2014-06-04,0,0,74,True,Recommended,"Rust sells itself as a survival game ""The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players.""That selling is only correct in the last sentence.I assumed that there was a more compelling ""man vs. nature"" element to the game scarce food scarce clothing scarce shelter and that it would drive player interactions. Sure I may team up with someone and make a shelter together. Or it could be that only one of us can live with what we've got. In which case one of us may have to kill the other. We may team up and defend ourselves. Or we may turn on each other or hunt players as the best means to survive against the elements.In reality there's an over abundance of resources. The materials to make food clothing and shelter are everywhere. One doesn't have to kill anyone to survive against nature. Ever.Which brings out the actual gameplay one has to kill other players because they will kill you and take your stuff. For fun.This isn't a man vs. nature survival game. It's a PVP/looting/raiding game. Which for some reason wants to start you out with a rock and no pants.Still it's fun in it's own way.

2017-11-22,0,0,1130,False,Not Recommended,Rust is a very interesting game with a lot of potential but in my opinion removing a very liked system (the bp system) from the game and replacing it with a bunch of different less liked by the community systems (xp component) ruined the game. I say this because of how the game feels now versus back in the bp system rust used to feel like a community game full of solo and duo groups that were relatively friendly towards eachother but since the gain in popularity the playerbase has shifted to extremely large and hostile groups removing the fun of playing casually. Now I understand a change like this makes sense but the devs haven't helped simply made it easier for large groups with every change they make for example the components system made it easy for groups to control monuments and prevent the spread of compenents necessary to aquire almost everything. AKs need rifle bodies to craft and that means loot spawns can be exploited so you have no chance of standing up to larger groups with better weapons than you. Rust's buiding system used to be so fun to play around with but alas now it has been downgraded for mostly smaller groups. How was this done you may ask 2 changes 1. Allowing building within an unowned building cupboard 2. Removing wall stacking from the game. Wall stacking was an amazing feature that allowed for strong bases that were very compact and it was very expensive to scale it up to a large clan size so it mainly helped everyone else.TLDR Not worth $35 play with a group of friends you don't care about losing,Rust

The base was still intact meaning hackers have glitched their way in and looted our entire base.M4's are gone. Shotguns are gone. EVERYTHING is gone!2nd Day after being looted by hackers I get bored and venture with a bow.I kill some guy weilding a shot gun and I try to run back to base when a person 'Kickasspanda' flys right in front of me to kill me.

2016-09-23,0,0,137,True,Recommended,"I love this game and I hate this game.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF you want to do anything other than raiding and PvP unless you play on your own server. The playerbase is a toxic puddle rivaled only by League of Legends. SURVIVAL in Rust is not about fighting the elements disease or even hunger. It's about human interaction. You know what you're probably on your PC to avoid. Anyway I suspect the ""Survival"" tag must be a Facepunch joke because you never ever will.What is hilarious about the playerbase is that there are people who claim to be friendly but just like a real life situation you have no way of knowing what will happen. This results in interactions with players that are so tense you could swear every player's butt is physically gripping the very seat in which in rests in anticipation of a hostile action. This is going to result in a lot of ruined computer chairs.The economy of this game is raiding. If you play on a public server and you don't raid you're a naked broken pile of that now owns a decrepit decaying hovel has no food no means of defense and a broken angry disappointing view of life that hates itself as much as it hates you. If you play on a public server and you do raid you're a naked broken pile of that just raided another naked broken pile of But your place... well your place isn't so bad any oh you were raided.",Rust

2016-03-12,0,0,436,True,Not Recommended,the only reason rust is in positive reviews is that legacy was the best version. if you ask legacy players what they think of the current version of rust they wil cry.woud i recommend this as a game maybe only for the hardcore grinder with a big clan. woud i recommend it as a legacy player NO because if you compare this to legacy you wil rainbows so bad is it (graphics are not every thing)the only way they coud fix it is to put back the old map size and remove all the funky armor (the guns can stay! but give it a option to get military weapons like the legacy m4 in supply drops) and just make the old map beutiful like new rust and then i coud be fixed but all the stones need to be in the same place! then ii woud reccomend this game to you,Rust
2016-03-12,0,0,260,True,Not Recommended,i see players ing about other players and rust's pvp elements and how they kill you when they see you even if you're butt naked and got nothing more than a stone and a torch with you etc etc.but that's not the problem with rust. i think it actually adds a lot of thrill and a little bit of difficulty to the game.the actual problem with rust is it's emptiness.after more than 2 years of development it still feels like an empty shell. once you got all the craftable stuff and a nice home base there's nothing more to do. the game ends. of course you could team up with other players and raid some bases. of course you could expand your home base make it huge. but for what? after less than 100 hours of gameplay you already saw everything. researched everything. explored everything. did almost everything you could do. the experience comes to an abrupt halt as you reach the limits of this game.the real problem is rust's lack of content.another thing that bothers me is more technical in nature.there are still plenty of bugs like weird lag when an active player is near you (gives you sixth sense P). teleporting bears and wolves. wildlife that runs through rocks and walls. bears and wolves spawning right next to you or directly under your foundation killing you through walls. etc. etc. etc.altogether i enjoyed the game so far and i'm looking forward to more content. and yes i'm going to play it in the future. but i really can't recommend it as it is right now. buy a game with more content till they fixed some bugs and added content that increases rust's replay value that's my advice.,Rust

2014-01-26,0,0,264,True,Recommended,Excellent Game its fully online there is no single player unless you create your own server. The standard servers are crazy so many players killing noobs. The community and modded servers are much nicer there's Rust++ and oxide addons to download for your server you can control pvp day settings chat etc.. The basics of the game is to stay alive. Gather wood rock and metal to build houses clothes and weapons. Make bombs to blow up other players walls and raid there house shoot them and steal there loot. You can't dig or fly there are no cars or bikes. The map is big enough for about 150 players but you notice 20 50 online it is easy to get lost but not to the extent ull never find home again.My advice its worth the price I brought it for a weekend game something to do IM now hooked with a full M4 with laser dot holo sights silencer and a flashlight as well as a sniper rifle a huge metal house with spikes on the walls. kevlar armor and cans of tuna!

2014-06-11,0,0,63,True,Not Recommended,The game is fun to build a base and scavenge for loot but there is very few things to get. And when you have built a good base and got all the loot you desired theres no reason to still play. More examples is a ugly game with fps problems. The game looks ugly even on high settings and is full of lag. So just spend your 20 dollars on some good game for now.,Rust

2014-04-22,0,0,37,True,Recommended,This game is incredibly frusterating at first imagine huddling naked in a hut while men with shotguns and machine guns break down your door and kill you on sight. Sure you can try to talk them out of it. You can tell them that you have nothing or that you'll give them everyhting you have but none of that ever works. However if you can get past all that and try to form an alliance or play with a friend the game becomes phenomenal. Trust me. I recommend playing on a noob friendly server at first to get the hang of it and then work your way up to the competetive servers.,Rust

2016-09-26,0,0,603,True,Not Recommended,I love this game I loved legacy but honestly #FireHelk. I understand he's turning his game into his vision but now it's just getting ridiculous.Twig update needs to be reversed raiding is stupidly easy and you're lucky to survive one day on a server.Servers empty out within 2 3 days. (20/300 online players 560 sleepers on most servers I play on for example) Incompatibilities with most software like f.lux and MSI Afterburner cause stuttering and sometimes just making the game unplayable. No documentation either just forum posts and finding out the hard way.Early Access for 4 years still isn't in Beta. New roadmap shows another possible two years before game is fully released.EARLY ACCESS IS FOR GAMES REQUIRING FEEDBACK OR ALMOST COMPLETE AND NEED BUGS REPORTED. A BARELY DEVELOPED GAME SHOULD NOT BE FOR SALE AT $20.Constantly changing between core systems.Blueprints worked fine and people are actually switching back to that old version and finding it to be better.XP System was complete garbage and they removed that after a while.Components is unbalanced and barrels are broken as you can hit a barrel get a gun or hit 30 barrels and maybe get enough gears to make a decent door or a ladder hatch. Random components that do nothing fill the loot tables as well.I've played this game way more than I should have. I've made a lot of friends a lot of enemies and I've spent a lot of time having fun but at this point I just can't recommend it to anyone when the stuttering and issues have gotten so bad if I can even launch it. This is not just me either most of my entire Discord of 30+ people are unable to have good gameplay.,Rust

Gets you comfortable and secure with its unique crafting/build system then when you get raided just motivates you more for vengeance. Only downside so far is if you join a toxic server some admins abuse there power a bit. Some serious fun if you have friends who play but going it alone is sort of satisfying aswell.

Finding the right server and community to play with being part of that community getting friends getting betrayed and a lot more is included in this game.The company developing this game Facepunch developer of Garry's Mod keeps the game updated and it contains loads of fun especially if taking into consideration the fact that it's still in alpha stage. Bugs and such do exist in the game though usually they are minor and the most major ones are fixed by the team in few weeks even days.Getting started in Rust is going to be a long journey if you have no knowledge of the game. Gathering enough resources to craft your very first Stone Hatchet is a satisfying trip to learning more about the game and what you might find when proceeding closer to the end game gear. Got your base ready set of Kevlar equipped enough weaponry to beat anyone who comes at you? Go and blast a wall of another player. Grab all the loot you can. Get the hell out.

2014-06-13,0,0,110,True,Recommended,I would like to start off by saying that this game is astounding! The element for survival can cause hysteria adding a thrill. It will cause you to panic but teaching you that survival works best if you have another player with you. Once you play for a while you will eventually get a virtually indestructable base you will get nicer weapons and you(and hopefully friends) will all raid bases in hope of obtaining better loot. You need to have friends to have fun. Even with friends you can expect to die by other players but that's all just part of rust. Would reccomend 9/10,Rust

The lack of server security is extremely disheartening. You spend hours farming and establishing ur settlement only to have some person come in through a wall or your locked door maybe even shoot you through the wall from across the map.

2017-05-12,0,0,447,True,Recommended,I love this game! The open world survival game is just so fun everytime. It's is hilarious to play with friends and bigger groups! This game is also very intens if you are playing solo but it is fun after all. Grafics are very nice. It's getting better and better every day. Why I love this game is probably because it has been updated for the last years when it was at early access. So much new stuff and still getting updates regularly. PVP is fun getting loot building base protecting yourself from struggles. It's great! It's never too late to get the game! Buy it now! You won't regret it ..,Rust

2014-01-07,0,0,21,True,Recommended,One of the most frustrating games I have ever played yet it is one of the best survival games i have ever played. It's like minecraft into a non pixilated first person survival simulator. I definitely reccomend this game to anyone who is interested in purchasing a survival simulator. Although it is a bit buggy but you can't expect much from an alpha game.,Rust
2014-01-07,0,0,178,True,Recommended,Early alpha lots of assets used from unity3d but the core gameplay is pretty solid with more tweaking more toys and more research options this could be the survival game I've been wanting for a long while.Again it's an alpha. I'd recommend this if you don't care about dying a ton to mean mean people.,Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,39,True,Recommended,To all whom wish to purchase RUST! Its an amazing game even for its early development. First couple of times I played I died before the first day was out mostly from hunger. It took me a while to get to grips with the system but it is very addictive I've been playing with my brother and set up a small alliance and within two days we had enough resources to build anything we wanted. But as we were developing and building our fortress we got raided by two other players. RUST is a good game and a good take on the Survival genre. But be prepared for ALOT and I mean ALOT of A**holes.I would give it a solid 8 out of 10! ) Again its survival of the fittest!,Rust
2014-01-28,0,0,202,True,Recommended,This game is fun to play and gets addicting even though you may die multiple times on a daily basis.,Rust
2014-01-28,0,0,216,True,Recommended,Such an amazing game ! at first i thought there is no way im gonna survive this but it is easier than it looks it just takes skill !One of the best games I have ever played!My Rating 8.7/10Well done to the creators !Thank you !,Rust

2014-09-02,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Pretty much the best game ever. Lots of hackers though '((( but when they fix that it will be perfecto,Rust
2014-09-02,0,0,169,True,Not Recommended,so you spend eight hours building a base gathering resorses and staying alive them some whos more powerfull blows up your base in one hit that you never saw even when in your base and you have to start again in your underpants with nothing but a rock. basiaclly means your wasting your time because some can one hit your whole base and your time is watsed. because they use cheat codes. after this happens three of four times in a row you have to realise that youll never get those hours back and really whats the point of a game where your progress cant be saved and your one line of cheat codes away from oblivion. a great game with good promise except the annoying start over any time some hacker retard wants to have fun.essentually youll start from scratch each time you play which means six hours of grinding to gain the thosands of wood and resorces needed to build your home stead also the sparsity of edible resorses means you can run and die multyple times before you kill enough animals to build a sleeping bag to respawn at your base. only to have it one hitted by a cheat. and start again. if you like constantly starting over this is a game for you.,Rust
2014-09-02,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,no point hackers just kill you.,Rust
2014-09-02,0,0,23,True,Recommended,It s a great game but the comunity sucks also be careful on wich servers you re playing because i played on a server and fall off a rock and got kicked for violation then couldn t join any server from there after that saw that i have a VAC ban on my profile... this wasted 20 euro,Rust
2014-06-29,0,0,87,True,Recommended,rust is a great game it is espcially good when you have a group of friends who can play with so that you can work as a team and take control of an entire server,Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,66,True,Recommended,This is a fantastic game for people who enjoy being creative in construction and who have alot of fun in Raiding and PvP'ing.The games is still in early Alpha so dont expect everything to be perfectly made things to point is that the first 2 days (In Game) can get rather tedious and a struggle from gathering resources to surviving. I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoys Hybrid MMO!,Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,230,True,Recommended,It is awesome!,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Quite an enjoyable game in my opinion however it is a bit hard to maintain a home on a server unless you're playing almost daily. I logged out for a few days and somebody had broken into my house with some c4s built two or three stories on top of my house placed tons of storage crates. When I logged back in I was in the bottom story so I walked through took what I want broke down the door placed my own door replaced fences and a gate took my house and then some back. I love the player housing building supply gathering hunting it's all pretty great especially for an alpha. But you may want to wait until the full game is released depending on your attitude towards glitches and other issues you may face with an alpha.,Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,260,True,Recommended,This game is epic! If you ike DayZ I reccomend this game. Rust a survival game about crafting and looting. This game is still in Alpha So expect many bugs. I cant wait for the actual release for this game. Its just 20$ get Rust today!,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,5,True,Recommended,I weep for humanity.,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,If you love an open brutal survival game then Rust is completely for you. You can starve bleed out be killed by zombies animals or other players. It has a great raw feel to it. However I have trouble building an attachment to the game due to starting from scratch on a constant basis. If you die you can randomly appear anywhere on the map (with no map to travel by) and lose everything you had worked to gather. I totally get the premise of the game and if I had hours to commit to it I'd be into it. This is a good game just not for the faint of heart. D,Rust

2014-01-09,0,0,60,True,Recommended,Very good Steve!,Rust
2014-01-09,0,0,75,True,Recommended,Start off with a rock and a loincloth. In a short matter of time you'll have built up your arsenal of weaponry and constructed a large fortress overlooking zombie infested towns and plains (occasionly) filled with resources and wild life. The possibilities of Rust are endless and the potential is defientely there in a game in alpha.You'd be crazy to overlook this game. So why wait any longer?,Rust
2014-01-09,0,0,28,True,Recommended,This game has some fantastic qualities. It really makes you feel like this world is desolate and anything could go wrong at any moment. It is harsh realistic and makes me execute choices I would actually make in real life. Such as whether to shoot someone or to talk it out with them.There are also no bandit points which measn no one is FORCED to be good. You always need to watch your back. Its also has things i would like to change. Sometimes groups can get way too powerful and just take over an entire map. That should be balanaced out. Also finding guns is way too easy. You can find freaking military style rifle blueprints EVERYWHERE. The guns need to be trimmed down or much harder to find. I find the idea of more homemade guns much more exciting and challenging and realistic. Also the game needs ggraphic help becuae sometimes it gets really really laggy even on fastest graphics.,Rust
2014-01-09,0,0,265,True,Recommended,Awesome survivle game,Rust
2014-01-09,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Fun game only problem is the amount of banidts that make it impossible to get started.,Rust
2014-01-09,0,0,28,True,Not Recommended,Well the concept is good but the game is not confusing as hell and poorly constructed. Now i dont have much time in the game because its hard to get into theres no map very glitchy and laggy (and its not my computer i have a 2014 alienware mx17). Also the resources (other than wood) are SUPER hard to find. I have played 1.5 hours so far and have yet to find stone/ores its impossible. Many feel the same via chat. RECCOMENDATION TO THE MAKERS Please please please add a map for starters first thing hands down next make resources easier to find and mabey even a different color than the mountain of boulders. The game is just to hard in the beggining very frustrating and discouraging. Lag and glitches seem to be the norm so mabey limit the amount of players in a server and reduce some detail. My setting is on fastest and its still horrible. In conclusion i think you have a great idea and i do reccomend the game based on the vision but as far as were is stands now I do not reccomend to people this game at its current stage it definatly is not worth $20 as it is.,Rust
2014-01-09,0,0,6,True,Recommended,I cannot log into a server so i am unable to play the game.,Rust

2014-01-29,0,0,228,True,Recommended,"An addictive and amazing game at the start ... absolutely boring and pointless after a week of playing. I'm curious which way the creators of this game will go ? They made a huge amount of money today barely a month after the start ... I assume that the alpha phase will last a very long time and no one will ever finish this game until it ""dies"" and why should ? I hope I'm wrong ... I see in this game huge potential.",Rust
2014-01-29,0,0,207,True,Recommended,After playing this game for a few days now and reading a lot of the negative reviews Ive come to realize that most players judge the game by a few idiot players who dont want to build or craft. All they are interested is braining others with their rocks and hatchets. Advice Find a good server (shop around) you paid money right? Take the time to find a good server. Ive been through about 12. Cheating admins who give their buddies full kevlar and M4s bad server. 189 ppl out of 200..... probably bad server. People screaming and chasing you... probably bad server. Find a low population server Less populaton means less chance to run into someone and more resources for you. Having a fresh wiped server helps too. Even playing fieldPlay with buddies!!! this makes the game SO MUCH BETTER! its kind of obvious but still...Lastly and probably the best advice I could give for solo play build AWAY from the road. I understand its a pain in the to be away from zombies as they drop good stuff but thats where most of the population sits. Build a bow craft some cheap armor hit the rad camps when no one is on or at day break. Learn the map and where you can pick off a few easy crates and zombies and dont bring anything important with you. Its a huge map use it to your advantage. Everyone has a unique oportunity to see this game grow and anyone with a brain can see the potential this game has. Agreed not everyone is a PVP fan but its gonna happen. Very few games had people interacting like this who has power who doesn't what to do when you give a hand grenade to a caveman who is at his neighbor? It WILL you off you just have to take the time and play the game and not write an angry review after someone blew a hole in your wall and took all your chocolate bars.Lastly... again If anyone important is reading this... this game needs DINOSAURS! Pick a hidden corner of the map and put a valley of the dinos or something.,Rust
2014-01-29,0,0,988,True,Recommended,This has to be the best 20$ i ever spent. Every server is different it has endless replay value. Everyone who dislikes this game just hasn't learned how to get through the beginner stage of being killed all the time and plus who doesnt like a game that gives you raw chicken when you kill a bear!,Rust
2014-09-19,0,0,81,True,Recommended,This game is early access and very promising. I went with it over DayZ and very happy with my choice. They are updating it weekly and the guy from Gary's Mod made it if you don't know anything about it. I was afraid my graphics card couldn't handle it but it can although I'll probably be updating soon now that the new Nvidia's launched. Either way this game will probably get more intense graphics wise AND also be optimized so I could probably hold off but I want to play everything ultra and be ready for directx12. Anyways this game will inevitably have a Large modding community going on already does but kinda limited mods so far,Rust

If you have friends to play with it's thrilling. Yet there's a sensation of something missing. It doesn't give the feel ing of a realistic survival game.

2015-05-28,0,0,808,True,Recommended,I have played rust on and off for the past year (started in legacy) quit due to hackers just taking over everything. Came back due to new Rust being playable to the close point of legacy and i can honestly say it has been a WHILE since I have had SO MUCH FUN in a game. The last game to give me this feeling was legacy and I am truely glad its back into my rotation of games. For 20$ i cant say enough good things about this ALPHA game. BUT keep in mind the game is in alpha and they will add and remove things to test them you paid your way into being a lab rat so to speak but teh fun you recieve is well worth it for me!,Rust

2014-01-30,0,0,83,True,Recommended,This is such a great game. Especially for being in ALPHA right now! Suprisingly small amount of bugs and great gameplay. Very environmental feel to this one. For example when it is cold outside I almost feel cold in my room until I build a fire to warm me up. Totally would suggest this game to anybody.,Rust
2014-01-30,0,0,137,True,Recommended,Fun if you are a patient person hard if you like to play alone (tho not impossible). One of the best points for me is that even if you loose everything because someone killed you you will never start from 0 thanks to the recipe system.There is no much to do right now due to its current alpha status apart from farming resources and killing people but at least you are able to play without any important bug bothering around. Im sure this game will be a great one in the future.If you like sandbox survival games buy it you will not regret.,Rust

2018-02-26,0,0,222,False,Recommended,Overall Rust has so far been a very enjoyable title and I don't generally have much to complain about. Although some things obviously do not make sense being it is still in development. A bear running towards me at should probably definetly NOT be able to survive two shotgun slugs consecutively in the cranium. I'm no scientist but this just appears very implausible to my pea brain. I would only reccomend this game if you have a few friends willing to embark on your adventure since in fact not only do you have to deal with other large teams but bears that have super powers. I kindly request my loot to be returned as soon as possible. Thanks!,Rust
2018-02-26,0,0,219,False,Recommended,I think this game is pretty good overall.If you are looking for a survival game you are at the wrong adress. It's mostly grinding and PVP.Interactions between players seem really scarce mostly everyone will just shoot and kill you even if you have nothing since there is no reward for not doing so.Base building is pretty simple and easy learnable at least in my opinion.if you playing solo as a new player you are gonna have a hard time.I would recommend this game to poeple who love to PVP / dont care much for interactions and poeple who do not mind losing everything (including theyr base and stuff) and start fresh every now and then.,Rust
2017-02-14,0,0,56,False,Recommended,This game's improved a lot since its first release.

It's truely an amazing game filled with a heart pumping experience and challenge most games can't come close to. However defeats in this game are not easy to take. This is not an easy game by any means. The combat takes getting used to you will lose everything you worked so hard for and most of the community can be quite unpleasant. That being said walking away the winner of an adrenaline crazed gunfight there is no better feeling in a video game. I highly recommend this game.,Rust

Also in the morning the sky and surroundings get too red for sunrise cause my game to completely drop in fps me and my friends refer to the sunrise in rust as ""Satan's Spawning"".

2017-03-25,0,0,56,True,Recommended,"Great game but could have a few adjustmentsThis is an awesome survival game probably one of the best yet. Very hardcore though you have to play it often because when you go offline your character is sleeping and can be looted and killed. This is fine for most people and it certainly makes the game more exciting but if you dont have alot of time to play i dont reccommend it. Ive had alot of fun with it though despite being killed multpile times and having to start over. DProbably one of the biggest ""cons"" for me atleast is that it takes alot of internet connection to play smoothly even with graphics quality down. So unless you have some of the best wifi around DEFINETELY turn down your graphics quality.Suggestion/complaint Beside the connection requirement really th eonly other problem i have with rust is that you spawn with a random gender and skin tone. I did a bit of reading and i learned that it was created like that to be realistic. I understand trying to be realistic but i personally think its over the top.

2014-01-11,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Rust so far has been an impressive comparison to Minecraft for a survival genre. It lacks the extensive creativity and freedom that Minecraft gave you but it offers up a more challenging experience. The days are as dangerous as the nights save for the light you're given by the sun. The variety of what you can make and how you can get materials is fun in itself making you find plans to craft better items rather than handing it all to you. The only downside I have found thus far is the lack of animals that spawn unless you find one of the few areas that are teeming with them. At the same time it provides little love for any new comers risking your survival by placing you in any random location including ones with the more dangerous mobs. I look forward to updates and the completed product.,Rust

2014-01-11,0,0,41,True,Recommended,"Firstly when playing this game you must remember it's in ALPHA. That means it's still undergoing a lot of development so nothing I write is based on playability or glitches. That said if you choose your graphics setting carefully at the start (there are only 3 options to change) it is pretty good for an Alpha release.To set the scene you're a survivor of an apocolypse. The world has been sent back to the stone ages but survivors have a lot of knowledge of 20th 21st century inventions like guns and buildings.If you're one of those players who like to reach a goal in a game this game is not for you. It is ruthless! Actually it's just that many of the players are ruthless the game itself just gives you the tools to choose how you want to behave.When you first spawn you're almost a caveman. You're naked (only males in this game which is sad for the perverts out there) and you have in your possession a rock (that's your weapon and tool) a couple of bandages and a wooden fire based torch. You're in a large world like environment similar towalking around the map of Skyrim.Don't light the torch!Torches fires furnaces etc can easily be seen by other players especially at night It makes you a potential target.The location you spawn in is fairly random but having respawned next to ther players like me I'm guessing the spawn points are pretty much pre decided but that's OK I'd rather spawn near some noobs with the same limited items than appear in the middle of a gunfight.The next thing that usually happens for new players is death. That's because most people playing the game don't trust anyone. Not even someone with an almost harmless rock as a weapon. They tend to kill and ask questions later. Don't get upset it's the nature of the game. You will get used to it.There is no built in map no compass in fact very little to help new players other than blogs and guides written by other players. Sounds boring doesn't it? Let me assure you it isn't.If you only like games where you always gain the upper hand in a fight this game is not for you. If you're a rage quitter this game will ruin your keyboard from quitting so much. You will get angry you will make friends (make friends seriously if you don't you will die a lot) you will feel pride in your achievements and you will become house proud of a few bits of wood nailed together to make a shack or hut.Research the game download and print a map (there are some online) and read the guides. At the very least read the beginners guide written by a player and hosted on the Steam guides page. Next you're ready to play.If you've already played or ignored what I said in the previous paragraph you died didn't you? Get used to it In this game you will die a lot and respawn in pseudo random locations. The trick is to figure out where you spawned and where you want to be so you can get there.If you read the guide and survived your first night here's a few tips to help you move along in the game.1. Find a place to liveSounds easy? Not when you have to build it yourself away from too much traffic and close enough to resources to build it quickly. Don't start off planning to build a super fortress similar to others you're likely to see You don't have time yet. Build a simple hut (not a shack like the guide suggests) so later you can add to it. Once you have a small home put a sleeping bad in it. A sleeping bag makes a future respawn point if you leave the game. You do not respawn there if you were killed.2. Keep warm.When you kill animal for raw food (every animal give you raw chicken even a wolf or bear) you also acquire a few by products like cloth Make some cloth armour (be honest they're clothes with a fancy title). It will keep you warm at night so you don't feel the cold but also make you an attractive target during the day as it signifies that you have something worth taking.3. Make better weaponsYou will need them. At the very least make a stone hatchet to improve the speed you acquire resources and replace your rock with it.3. Grab some blueprintsLet's be honest we're not all engineers. To learn how to make better things you need knowledge. in this game knowledge is power. You gather blueprints from several places including zombies (the black ones usually harder to kill of course) a few suitcases dotted around and by disassembling an item you acquired from another player you killed.4. Avoid excessive radiation exposureDid I mention the game was set in a post apocolypse? Several areas in the game are radioactive and can cause you harm especially if/when your 'rad count' exceeds 500. The good news is the rad count decreases when you're not being microwaved by ambient radiation. I wondered why the game designers would include such no go areas but it seems there's lots of loot in them. If you can get in and out quickly you can gather weapons and lots more. There's even a blueprint for a rad suit to make you immune to the stuff.Beyond that it's a case of building a better home (or base) making friends online so you have a clan or allies and stay alive as long as you can. You can choose to be a bandit (typically no base as such just roam around and kill people) or helpful. Personally I try to help. because I've had my face blown off enough times to learn how much it hurts.There are many new elements being added to the game (like cars they're planned for a future release) and always something new to learn. You can talk in public via text chat (visible to everyone) or you can talk verbally (nearby players only). Usually clan members and allies will talk privately on Skype etc but you'll soon figure it out.Many common questions I've read and replied to include 1. How do I cook food?Kill an animal get some raw meat build a campfire look at the campfire and when it says ""Use"" press and hold the ""E"" key. This opens a small sub menu and allows you to use your mouse to click ""Open"". Add raw food (I suggest 2 chicken per spare slot) and some wood (1 piece will cook 2 pieces of chicken in each slot giving up to 6 pieces for 1 piece of wood). Light the fire and wait till it goes out then the food is cooked and safe to eat.2. Is there a map?No. Not in the game itself read above and find one online.3. How do I know where I am?More importantly how do you know which way you're facing? The sun will tell you this. It rises in the east sets in the west and typically a game day last 45 minutes the night lasts 15 minutes. To figure out ""where"" you are run down the road and find a common landmark. You can usually work out where you are on the map once you find one. To help work out the direction you're travelling if the road seems to bear to the right you're usually travelling clockwise handy to know if the sun is overhead and you have no idea which way is east/west.4. How do I craf something?Open your inventory (press the TAB key). At the top of the screen is a crafting option to open the menu. From here you can select items to make and also determine what resources you need to make any item you're aware of.5. Can I go to one server craft something and bring it here?No. Each server is a self contained world. You can play on multiple servers if you want you cannot transfer resources between them.Overall I love this game even though I'm really bad at playing it. I was never fantastic at shoot em ups but I love playing them. I never really got into building games except maybe Little Big Planet and this games puts both of those games into a blender mushes them together and produces a FPS building game combining all that's best of games like Minecraft and Call of Duty with a medieval twist.If you don't like dying (a lot) this game is not for you If you like a challenge you will love this! Friends enemies and bob the builder all rolled into one!",Rust

It's an alpha game at the moment that has plenty of hooks to keep me playing and was well worth the $20 pricetag. Rusts runs well smoothly with very few bugs that either aren't noticeable or they are easily fixed via console commands. This game has PvE content but the main focus is PvP and base building. There are problems with cheating/hacking but if you find a good server with a vigilant admin then those problems become non existant. I am playing on a Canadian server and having a blast and am impressed with the admin's ability to step in and ""resolve"" problems.",Rust

2014-01-31,0,0,161,True,Recommended,So as some of you may know I recently purchased the video game Rust a survival game roughly based on the likes of Minecraft and DayZ. Day 1 I was dropped into the game as a naked caveman (don t worry it is censored) with nothing but a rock torch and flashlight. What could possibly go wrong right? Well this is exactly what I thought until I realized that there were two people with guns and in full armor heading towards me. Without a second thought they shot me in the face and I had to start over not that I had accomplished much.This is exactly what Rust is. Kill on Sight mayhem having all your hard earned supplies stolen from you dealing with liars and bandits but despite all the FRUSTRATION and ANGER at the game and other players to begin with you finally start to get the hang of it. Before long you ve crafted your first hatchet and you re happily gathering wood Chicken Breast (which comes from every animal in the game strangely enough) cloth and stone. Eventually you ll have a bow and arrow and are able to defend yourself from zombies and wolves except at this point you are still highly fearful of other players who may have guns.The game is based in a post apocalyptic island in the middle of nowhere. The island is MASSIVE and at any one time there can up to 300 people connected to the game. Walking through the wilderness for hours on end not seeing a soul or even so much as an animal but yet seeing the ruins of people s houses that came before you people that made mistakes and got raided and killed is a very strange and even eerie feeling. You learn that even though you can become powerful in the game control all the guns enslave others it is a very slippery slope back to being a naked caveman again. Once you have fallen why would people trust you again and help you back up?I honestly don t know what keeps me drawn to this game but it draws me like a magnet. The game is incredibly fun long term but very frustrating short term. Whenever you lose everything be it from death by a wolf naked caveman with a gun or simply starving to death yes it s annoying yes it angers you but you gain experience which makes bouncing back even easier than before. I had a mansion but it is now little more than a pile of ashes on the ground thanks to raiders. This sort of thing will make you very angry however you have learned not to build near the road.Lastly even though you meet people who kill you on sight the thing that makes me feel really good is when you meet someone and they don t kill you instead they give you a gift or help you with something. These are the types of players that make the game worthwhile these are the players that restore your faith in the game and these are the players that make this game work so flawlessly.,Rust

2014-01-13,0,0,22,True,Recommended,I was very sceptical of this game to start with I played for a little bit when I first got it and was not happy with it probably due to the constant death by naked cavemen but after a few tries later and getting kind of good at the game I've got really into it. This game is just so creative and fun I love it plus it is still early in development and there is only much more great things to come.,Rust
2014-03-02,0,0,11,True,Recommended,"Rust is very fun. That's basically why I would recommend it. Because despite various bugs and glitches at its core it is fun. Especially the tense (and the silly) moments it creates. Like one experience I had the other day I was struggling to find food when suddenly I came across a small valley full of boulders and animals (targets for my makeshift stone hatchet). I quickly killed and collected all the animals and resources (because screw animal lovers I guess?). Then darkness fell and I went back to my little hut. Night is quite long in my opinion and this story happened the day before the patch that made night not so black. During the extensive period of pitch black a naked Irishmen approached my door with a revolver and a hatchet. He attempted to break down my door. When I talked to him over the mic he offered to let me live if I gave him all my stuff. Well I thought then I might as well die. I told him ""You know I have shotgun.""I lied...He replied ""we both know you're gonna die."" And then I thought...SCREW THAT. I'll kill him first! And so while listening to him smack my wooden door with a hatchet I crafted a pipe shotgun and 30 rounds of homemade shells. When I was done I opened the door and fired a round into his torso. He shot me twice before I closed the door. He started swearing at me and said I must be hacking for not dying. Suddenly an unknown savior sprinted into the clearing and blasted my assailant with a shotgun (a real one not a homemade one). I found the Irishmen's body in the morning with a nice load of food and ammo but he was missing his gun. If I had to complain or give constructive criticism I would say navigating is difficult as the lanscape is all the same. And night is still too dark.",Rust
2014-03-02,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,my friend made me get it. sucks.actually its not that bad but it is kind of repetitive and not really an end game. plus wolves and bears always kill me so that is stupid. they chase me for hours and then i die naked.

This game is a lot like Minecraft in the sense that you gather resources and build a house town city etc. I hope this game becomes better than it already is. The only downside is that there is no single player/offline mode. But other than that this game is awesome.9/10That no single player/offline mode was a real killer for me.

My first server i fought against a clan of 12 year olds that called themselves the Wolf Pack and when they attempted to raid people they howled at the moon and shortly after were shot in the face until they stopped making noise. Sad story but A for effort i suppose xD.Overall one of the best survival games to date. Graphics are excellent if you have the rig to support fantastic graphics.

Although ARK has more content and a more rich landscape sometimes less is more. This is the case with Rust. It's stability and bare bones survival and PvP focus makes it in my opinion the best survival game to date. The fact that the developers are constantly working to improve it and update it consistently is also just wonderful.

2014-01-13,0,0,52,True,Recommended,Easily one of the best survival games I have played and far better than DayZ. 5 minutes into the game I met another player who helped me kill a wolf and get some cloth armour. He gave me a pickaxe so I wouldn't have to use the rock and gave me some pointers told me if I needed anything to just come by his house then sent me on my way. I was then taken by surprise by three other players with leather armour and M4's they were asking me about raiding their camp but I told them that I had just started they took my word and even gave me a full set of leather armour and apologized for threatening me. That first encounter is what really made me want to play this game more to help other newcomers. It is an amazing experience alone but fantastic when you have a friend to play with. As it says the only aim is to survive. If you've been looking for a good survival experience that is still only in ALPHA look no further than RUST.,Rust

I Love it...It has got me into an unhealthy addiction and I am ok with that. I hate losing all my stuff to some who thinks its funny to kill you when your chopping some wood or mining rock...but when you kill them back its awesome. Here is one piece of advice. Don't build your fire on top of a rock near a road. It's very easily spotted and you'll probably be gang banged. Unless of course you want to kill a bunch of people then set that fire as a trap and wait for the ""moths"" to fly in!

2017-06-21,0,0,446,True,Recommended,It took me a while to finally decide to buy this game. I was on the fence for quite a bit after reading about hackers and toxic community issues. I am VERY happy I bought this game. Yeah you will happen across jerkface people but you will also happen along decent people. There are a ton of different servers for different type of game play making it almost like more than just one game. If that doesn't make sense buy the game and it will. For being early access it feels like it could be a complete game as is. The building/crafting is awesome. Going out on scavenger runs that you have to plan for in order to hopefully make it back to your base camp. There are plenty of reviews that list pros and cons so I'm just going to sum it up by saying if surviving/crafting/gathering/killing/ect is up your ally then try this game.

2014-03-03,0,0,45,True,Recommended,The game is fun but don't get attached to anything. For the most part the community is horrible as you ve probably already read about. The first time I played I used the actual game server and that was a horrible spawn die repeat sequence. I finally found a low pop community server where I could learn the game and the people were friendly. Still there is always the guy that just shoots you while your gathering wood or something else. Also when you log your guy just sleeps and anyone that can get to him will just kill him and take your stuff (Though I think that s an option the server can turn off but not sure).If you re the type of person who gets real angry in games I d think twice. You can gather/build for hours only to watch someone kill you and take it in the blink of an eye. Or you can log off with full armor and an M4 only to log back on the next day naked with a rock.,Rust

2014-02-02,0,0,47,True,Recommended,I bought into the hype and purchased Rust in a drunken holiday sale binge. I'd never played any sort of survival/free play game (like DayZ etc) so the concept alone was new to me. I also did no research or reading on the game so I entered completely blind and dumb. I'd say it took me a good 5 play sessions of 30+ minutes apiece to start getting the hang of things. Figuring out how to even gather resources the 0th step essentially took me some time not only because I got KOS'd a couple times but also because resources aren't available everywhere (wood is from trees but it's super super slow/inefficient). Once I found resource spawns then it took me awhile to realize that crafting is available all the time from a dropdown at the top next to inventory and armor. After that it's less a survival game and more of a social engineering/navigation game where you are more worried about being killed gathering wood by some random player than zombies or bears. But there is that drive to keep surviging longer each time. I've died a ton and have only gotten started on a 'base' that might actually survive a day but it's been a blast and it's awesome being able to experience it all as it is developed.,Rust

2017-10-28,0,0,1075,True,Recommended,REMINDER This game is in Early Access it's not going to be perfect!Pros Graphically beautiful! Each map has a variety of different environments (biomes) all hosting distinct features!Easily understandable progression system (subject to change). The blueprint system has made this game less EZ MODE for clans which is good and bad for solo players.Forces you to be social! Sorry you hermits you either make friends in the game or you die!Cons Not optimized to it's full potential. There are some areas that can come under some serious FPS lag. (This issue has gotten better over time.)Side Notes This game is kill or be killed. New/Solo players can/will find it hard to play if you jump straight in to a high population server! Please don't hurt your chances of loving this game by going somewhere that's above your current skill level! I've seen too many new players get turned off by the fact that the more serious players on high pop servers rip them to shreds on sight. This game is great and has amazing potential once it hits beta. Please play with friends or start on low pop servers!,Rust

2015-02-24,0,0,260,True,Recommended,Ok let me put this straight. I. LOVE. THIS. GAME! its pretty sweet to fool around and play pvp/pve (depending on the servers) There hasn't been one moment where ive disliked playing this game at all. A few bugs here and there but nothing you cant get by and not something that makes the game implayable. You get to play with friends and you learn to trust your gut when unknown player says he/she is friendly. Building your house can be alillte clunky atm as nothing that i do semes to improve the stability on the house but other than that.. I would def Reccomend this game. Also for you devs out there i really hope you see this as the game needs a sound setting in the main menu so you can adjust it for playing your own music or other things as skypecalls etc. Cus its annoying that the game music is at full blast constantly. at anyrate keep up the good work guys this game really shows promise and the new style youve added really makes this diamond shine like the sun ),Rust

2014-01-15,0,0,25,True,Recommended,As I'm sure has been said a thousand times Rust is best described as a cross between Minecraft and Day Z You wake up in a relatively deserted landscape collect supplies build a house craft weapons explore and survive zombies/animals/other players. And like Minecraft and Day Z there is something inherently fun about this simple goal. Yet in it's current state (an Alpha pre release) it tends to be quite frustrating too.Playing with only a handful of other rival players can be difficult and playing with a full server is pretty much impossible. A lot will obviously be changed over the course of the development but I really hope they make the early part of the game easier to get into. I almost gave up after the first time playing as it's fairly easy to spend a lot of time building supplies only to have everything wiped out after getting killed by a stray zombie (who will continue to hang around your house and kill you over and over if you attempt to collect your items).I have a lot of minor complaints most of which I wont bother with as I'm sure they will be addressed in future updates. But they really should re engineer things like stucture decay and looting. It's demoralizing coming back to the game after only a couple days absence and finding everything you've worked toward completely gone. What makes a game like Minecraft fun is that you can keep building on what you've done. But in Rust you are forced to start from scratch too frequently and collecting the large amount of wood an rocks required to rebuild a house isn't fun enough that I want to keep doing it.I am recommending this game because it shows potentiial. No matter what direction the developers go in I'd be willing to bet modders will eat this game up. And there will eventually be gameplay styles for all tastes and sizes.My rating (so far) 3/5,Rust
2014-08-03,0,0,103,True,Not Recommended,Don't waste your time with this game. You might have some hours of enjoyment hell maybe even get your money out of it. But with how things are going this is appearing to be another abandoned project in favor of other smaller ones. It may or may not get finished.As well The community mindset is a terrible one kill or be killed. Even if you establish a house or base to live in somebody who has been on the server far longer then you is going to find it ruin it and kill you because they have nothing better to do. The game gets repetative after only a few hours so unless you like resource grinding running the same routes over and over and losing all your progress when you die or your house is destroyed then this isn't the game for you.As well Don't expect to be able to host your own server for a very long time unless you have additional funds to shell out to a third party company every month. There is NO hosting ability outside of that you will be forced onto servers other people have and goodluck trying to set things up with your friends. The community is toxic and not fun to try and associate with.Again I wouldn't reccomend this. Yes I've gotten over 90 hours out of it but that was before it became a chore to play.,Rust

2014-01-15,0,0,74,True,Recommended,with a persistent character presense on the server (ie when you log out your unconcious body is still killable) you need to carefully plan out were you hide from scavengers and bandits. wildlife is definitely a consideration even the zombies but the most dangerous creature in this world is the ravenous greed of other human beings and this game presents this well. The building mechanics work very well but easily griefed (yet more strategic building considerations to take into account).all in all considering this game is still in alpha there is a LOT like and with the recent fixes to most of the hackers the game environment is more and more fun.word of advice though. find friends and find them fast a solo player is easily squished.,Rust

Never liked MineCraft but LOVE this!!!10/16/2017Even after all of this time Rust is one of my favorite survival games of all time. It is constantly going through changes to perfect itself. I know to some people a game that has been out for this long should have found it's final form and settled into a consistant environment with minor tweeks and additions here and there. I feel like the periodic changes to Rust keep the game fresh and alive. I would still recommend this game to anyone despite all of the changes throughout the years.,Rust

2017-10-16,0,0,1001,True,Recommended,Mental Anguish.If you want serious emotional highs and lows so much indeed I feel comparing it to crack wouldn't exemplify it enough! I have experienced each emotion within a single gaming session(6.4 hrs avg.) I feel I should be seeing a shrink. However if you are looking for a replacement to Minecraft that is more in tune of mature audiences then Rust is for you. If you are looking for a zombie survival feel but instead of mindless zombies trying to kill you its intelligent(sometimes..) humans and AI trying to kill you. Then Rust is for you.That being said I love this game and am looking forward to more updates(vehicles?!). The survival aspect is amplified in this game which is a serious desire I had not previously known existed. You must survive against violent animals and violent humans plus more things designed to kill you. Disappointment is constant feeling. And yet I must find my way in the unforgiving Rust lands and design the most secure yet awesome looking base I can while still conforming to honeycombing(look it up) lest I be annhilated within a day. For the small victories are worth the pain it takes to get there...TIR,Rust

2014-09-19,0,0,77,True,Not Recommended,The gameplay is fun but there are some serious issues that need to be taken care of before it can be successful 1. Aimbotters are all over. They make it impossible to play the game because they'll headshot you from 70m away with a pistol. Two consecutive shots and you're dead already without even seeing them. With a BAR or maybe M4A1 I can understand but not a 9mm pistol.Along with this they do not seem to have any form of moderation on their official servers. Private servers obviously have some staff to address issues like aimbotting but the official servers do not have any.2. The game has horrible white noise 24/7. The day is worse than at night. It's like a constant waterfall in my ears and it's NOT pleasant. After playing for an hour and taking a break my ears shouldn't be ringing when I'm on 7% volume.This white noise can't be from radiation as radiation doesn't actually create the noise.Those are my problems with the game. I understand that aimbotting is always going to be there but there should at least be people on the official servers who can combat it.,Rust

2014-09-19,0,0,183,True,Recommended,An all round hilarious game. You can either be a passive or agressive player. A passive player makes a stable base and is friendly to other players an aggresive player kills anyone they see and survives by stealing other peoples items. I cannot believe how fun this game was even at its alpha stage. The glitches and bugs make this game what it is ridiculously funny! Rust is better to play with a friend rather than alone. For me personaly it is a must buy.9/10 (RUST NEEDS TO FIX THE BROKEN SERVER BROWSER),Rust

You spawn fresh and geared players kill you Try to help someone and they stab you in the back i have around 700 hours The community is full of If you want cancer come play here No seriously do!Jokes aside rust is a good game has very good potential Would not advise trying to team with people you meet in game you need friends you can trust to play with!Game can be fun but like all games things don't go your way and you will get fustrated.,Rust

2014-12-21,0,0,94,True,Not Recommended,The gameplay is really fun. I really liked how your player is still in the game when you arent playing. Making friends and exploring or banding together and fighting against other groups is really cool. I've put about 80 hours into this game and theres always something new. Logging on and seeing that the camp we all tried to protect was raided sucks but its also kinda fun! It's part of the game. One problem this game has is cheaters. By cheaters I mean hackers. When someone crafts or finds door charges then blows a hole in the side of my base or blows open a door I know they worked hard to craft those charges or get to an airdrop. Seeing people fly around and glitching through the ceiling of bases and taking everything really takes away from the fun of this game. I couldnt reccommend it to anyone until hacking is eliminated.,Rust

2017-10-18,0,0,1784,True,Recommended,Best 20$ I ve ever spent on a game in my life. With over 20 years of gaming and more then 1300 hours invested in THIS game I can honestly say it is my favorite game I ve ever played. At times the community can be extremely toxic but the same is true for any multiplayer game. I m greatly impressed with how quickly bugs and exploits are fixed and the rate at which Rust is being developed. You can tell the dev team really cares about it. A desperate market existing for in game skins is a great way to generate additional revenue to continue developing further content. I strongly recommend this game above all others in fact and have only now reviewed it at the request of Kcmo Vertiigo Suspect and Helk after watching the latest KCMo video on YouTube (10/18/17). I do agree mostly with Vertiigo that the game needs more of a survival aspect(I.e. more scavenging environmental hazards air encounters etc.) but as is the game is exceptional. Good fighting the good fight devs!! Your work is appreciated.,Rust
2017-10-18,0,0,2874,True,Recommended,Let me be clear about this review I am rating my experience with rust so far over my nearly 1600 hours of game play (so far). When I rate this game or any game it s about the hours of enjoyable played time you get vs dollars spent on the game Rust is a 20$ game so you should expect at least 20 hours of enjoyable gameplay out of it right?Wrong.Pro s Rust is an open world survival game that gives many people thousands upon thousands of hours of content and it s still in early access. I have plainly and simply enjoyed nearly all the time I have spent playing this game and I ll list the reasons why below.1) Semi weekly weekly bi weekly monthly server wipes provide endless content and keeps the game fresh.2) Active developers who pop out weekly updates and are vigorously trying to improve their game.3) The game has a big team aspect that encourages players to play with friends.4) Recently improved gunplay gives firearms in this game a higher skill cap for more gifted players to shine.5) Raiding system encourages good base building as a counter measure.6) Current farming system feels right in the amount of materials given and keeps the early game going longer.I m sure there are more pro s but for now this is my list.Con s Helk hear me I say this with love.1) Auto Turrets are too over powered 1 or 2 turrets outside of a base that s being raided and it s almost impossible to counter and achieve anything.2) Gun damage isn t high enough on some guns for example the Semi Automatic Rifle and Revolver take like 5 8 shots to put down a full geared guy depending on distance and where you hit them. Not everyone is Curtis Jackson and can manage getting shot 8 times and living to tell the tale.3) Med pens are too easy to make I feel that they heal for the right amount but they need to do something to make sure someone can t just pop down a wall and use 6 med pens to full heal if you just shot the guy 5 times and he didn t die.4) High external walls should be for base defense (only droppable in TC range) and not be deployable in the open this causes too many entities in the server and for some people with less extravagant computers often experience lag because of the hundreds of entities introduced by the new BP system5) I am not a big fan of the new bp system because of how it extends the early game it s mainly because I m not that good at primitive combat and am mainly skilled with fire arms.6) This is NOT friendly to solo players or people who are new to the game.With respect this is one of my favorite games of all time I love it it needs work but that s why it s still in early access. If you have friends that play and can show you the ropes this game is great. I recommend it 100%.,Rust

2017-10-18,0,0,1105,True,Recommended,This game is cutthroat. Make no mistake. You will die a lot. You will try things and you will fail. You will work hard and another player will roll up on you and take ALL of your stuff. And that is what makes this game unique and fun.I'm not particularly good at this game and I tend to lose my bases to clans or I lose fights because I get outnumbered. But that's competitive online play no reason to be salty about it. I just jump on again later and start from square one. The progression is fun the combat is good and the building/crafting system is far better than what every other game has to offer.People complain about changes lately but this game is evolving faster and it catering to the community more than any other game that I have ever played. The devs are putting in hard work on this game and that needs to be recognized. So much love and effort has gone into this masterpiece and it shows.,Rust

2016-08-29,0,0,950,True,Recommended,Rust is a brutal PVP game. People arent friendly or trusting but you can still make friends and it is highly recommended that you do. The recent update slowed progress dramatically has kept servers alive much longer and in all has been a positive step forward. With the continuous support and updates from the dev Rust is an easy buy for anyone who wants to dump a few thousand hours into a game. I myself am well on my way.,Rust
2017-10-18,0,0,70,True,Not Recommended,I'm going to make this simple.If you have SEVERAL (Think 6+) good freinds who are all interested in playing a game with friends and loosely cooperating you will probably haver a very fun time.If you try to play alone or with a small number of freinds or friends who can't keep their attention on a single game and find yourself regularly playing alone you probably going to have a terrible time. If you have 8+ friends but they are jerks you will probably have a terrible time.With the assumption that almost nobody has enough close friends to play this game the fun way I'm not going to recommend. But if you really do have ten friends all ready to play together by all means this one is probably a great option.,Rust

2014-02-12,0,0,163,True,Recommended,I reccomend this game but not the newest update. The reason is that I had a house on this one server it was a small shelter. Now people can destroy your objects and guess what SOMEONE DESTROYED MY HOUSE TOOK MY LARGE CRATES FULL OF AIRPLANE DROPS AND TOOK A LOT OF STUFF FROM MY SMALL ONE IN MY HOUSE WITH MY DOOR CLOSED!!!!!! I LOGGED ON TO THE SERVER AND I GO TO MY HOUSE WHICH WAS MOSTLY INCLOSED BY A SMALL WOODEN SHELTER TO FIND THAT MY SHELTER+DOOR+LARGE CRATES FULL OF PLANE DROPS WERE ALL GONE JUST MY FURNACE SLEEPING BAG CAMPFIRE WORKBENCH AND THE REALLY BAD ITEMS FROM MY SMALL 1ST CHEST/CRATE ON THE SERVER WERE LEFT WHERE I PLACED THEM IN OPEN AIR NO WALLS OR DOORS!!!!! WTF!!!! I know you can't get my base back but if peoples things werent able 2 be broken that would be great. This was also on a non pvp non raiding non sleeper server. It is overall a great game and I would reccomend it to everyone. definately get it. but if you don't have to take the newest update or if they rollback the update It would bring the definately to a definately x 100000000!!! I hope facepunch sees this and takes it to heart.,Rust

Rust teaches you if you to work hard work countless hours towards a goal and you'll be rewarded with great things!....rust also does a great job of teaching you that someone else will think it's way easier to just kill you gloat about how awesome they are and take all your stuff.You may hold on to your morals/dignity for a while but eventually you'll give in and realize that the only way to get ahead in ""the game"" is to become that which you hate.Later after establishing yourself and ""making it"" you'll have the oppurtunity to help other people by providing them with supplies and friendly banter. Sadly once out of your line of sight they'll be pillaged and left for dead. On the upside at least you feel better about yourself!End game is pretty boring though. Once you've built a house and collected more than enough supplies their isn't much else to do at the moment. Your bordem will lead to ransacking your neighbors houses for more stuff that you don't need. Eventually you'll need more room in your house to store the stuff you don't need and have to build a bigger house.....and it goes on and on.5/5 I enjoyed the social aspect of the game.

2017-10-18,0,0,710,True,Recommended,Rust is a crazy fun game with a few friends if you can get passed the first native stages of bows and spears. Getting your base down and crafting up the weapons tools and armor to go terrorise the locals is rewarding and creative enough to keep you coming back for more. As a solo player this game is ruthless filled with teams of experienced killers waiting to find your lonely buttocks to take all of your hard earned loot. Staying alive and under the radar is key to surivival alone. It may seem hopeless at times especially when you can't get passed the hordes of spawn killers at the beach. Strive through the turmoil and find the most rewarding experience you can ask for in a game not hospitable towards anybody. You are not special in anyones eyes. If your social skills can earn you new companions you may find friends you keep for good. Those few may teach you the lessons required to survive in a heavily PvP oriented crafting survival masterpiece nowhere near its completion. Expect more from this game than you can imagine. There is still more to come.,Rust

2015-02-22,0,0,2560,True,Not Recommended,Rust EA alpha was one of the most fun experiences I have had in years sadly it was very short lived. The developement of the game itself was virtually nonexistant. The vision and route the creator and his team had for the game was almost exactly opposite of the community at every single turn.Great basebuilding and player created raiding and combat were quickly made a non factor by rampant uncontrollable hacking throughout every server.The entire game was ruined with in a few months as the community left and the game slowly died. Instead of dealing with the issues and fixing the rampant hacking they choose to design an entirely new system game and abandon their progress in the old version.This further killed the playerbase and ended any enjoyment people were currently having in private servers despite the hacking.I will never again trust or support a single product from garry his company or anyone in conjunction with.Peace.,Rust

Zombies can 2 shot you players can chase you down and break your doors in.This game has a lot ohead of it but I can say this. It is by far the most playable Alpha build I have ever bothered to try.My advice. Get this game get your friends to get this game and bring them with you. You will most likely need them!(Don't let the deaths from players get to you thats the best advice I can give you.),Rust
2014-01-18,0,0,81,True,Recommended,Love the game recommend it for anyone who likes mine craft or DayZ. But I have no clue why I cant stay in a game for more than 10 sec before the game crashes and my screen freezes... it probably has something to with my computer being a Retina MacBook pro with the new maverick os x but I just don t know anymore.,Rust
2014-01-18,0,0,461,True,Not Recommended,Terrible performance on my alienware laptop which run games that are much more demanding than this one I7 8mb RAM 750M. I have to turn the rendering all the way down and type all kinds of stuff into the console to turn off the grass to even let the game be playable at around 15 20 fps. I know it is aplha but for $20 I should have a game that is at least playable graphically. I hope it gets fixed soon beucase the concept of the game is great. Lots of fun as long as you dont have to accuratly aim or defend yourself in any way.,Rust

2014-01-18,0,0,3,True,Recommended,IMO this game does survival Better than DayZ. In addition to the various survival mechanics (hunting hunger warmth) you also have the ability to build and communicate with other players with earshot voicechat. This provides something to strive for!I have 2 complaints about the game though 1) it's poorly optomized. It runs on my computer (2.4GHz dual core CPU GeForce GTX 675M 16GB Ram) but the framerate is a bit sluggish and my comp heats up prettly badly compared to my other games. There aren't many options to adjust this.2) Stones. In a landscape full of crazy cliffs and rock formations you'd think this resource would be abundant. Sadly the only rocks you can mine are scarce lone boulders which give off more Sulfer and Metal than they do Stones (4 stones a pop). Also WHY does it take 5 stones to make a stone hatchet? (which is literally a single stone tied to a stick.),Rust

2017-08-31,0,0,503,True,Recommended,The Game is really fun but the only probblem i have is that i have seen vids on how people are creating glitch bases and it makes it so that they can hide loot which is unfair to a person who doesn't know about it. Another thing is that their needs to be a way to teach people how to play rust because i've seen people who try and play the game and they find it's to hard to start and they give up which is bad for rust and they don't get to have fun.,Rust

2016-06-25,0,0,1655,True,Not Recommended,"Wow.I'm so sad I'm writing this review right now.Anyway Rust is a post apocalyptic survival game as you probably already know. And I would say its worth buying but it just doesn't have the same charm as it did back in experimental. Back then it was hectic scary exciting... it was really fun to play.And then slowly it was turned into a boring grindy and well the community's gone down the sh!tter (but thats not really Garry's fault).I remember first getting this game and falling IN LOVE with it!But now I don't even really have the drive to play it any more.It started once they left experimental for me and its just gotten worse from there.You can't even play this game solo!At first it was hard to raid but now the game benefits clans so your base will be gone within 48 hours. And its not all the developers fault because the COMMUNITY suggested these ideas and when Helk or another developer puts it into place the COMMUNITY says ""actually i changed my mind"" and throws a fit. What are the developers supposed to do?Anyway I will definitely change this review if the game changes.Overall I'd say 3.75/10(P.S. the game is very nice on the graphics side therefore being quite demanding.)",Rust

Secondly the level of enjoyment from this game depends on the people you play with. What I mean is if you are on a server where everyone is a complete and spawn kills you it becomes hard to enjoy the game while you could just find another server if you have been playing on the server and have a work in progress house it is very sad to just give up on the house all together and leave the server in hopes of finding a better one. Sadly you can't reason with stupid which is what I run into on most servers I am willing to stick around on and end having to leave because I can't make any progress in the server.,Rust

2014-02-06,0,0,80,True,Not Recommended,"It's not a bad game. I said it. BUT it's no longer a mix of survival horror and crafting. Currently it's more a mood survival game (zombies are gone) with crafting. But they seems to be into an identity crisis so purchase this game at your own risk (I recommand you to wait). The current problem with this game is than it get unbalanced really quickly once people know how to craft kevlar and have automatic guns when you start naked with a rock. So when people get bored well they ""raid"" (and often destroy with C4) other people bases kill newbies and such. So it can become frustrating to have put time and effort building something when you can find it in ruin the next day you log in. On the bright side the sunlight and nights are well rendered (and its VERY dark at night so a shelter is HIGHLY recommended) its beautiful and realistic. The crafting is well done at the beginning making you feel like you are crafting basic weapons out of an apocaliptic movie... as for the end game you get rifles kevlar armor laser target... It is currently very unbalanced and the end game doesnt fit the beginning. As for the building it is easy and well done. It is an Alpha and as the creator say ""only 10% is in the game"" so I hope it will evolve into something great.I will recommend it once it's clear where they head because right now people get bored and even if you get a taste of survival at first the current end game is more a bully simulator...",Rust

2014-11-02,0,0,64,True,Recommended,"Rust is a game in which it is completely survival in turn can create a multitude of options if one desires to do so. You start out with a rock you must be thinking ""A rock? What the hell do I use this for?"" but this is not any rock this rock is the only thing in your possesion at the moment that stands between YOU and NATURE (and society for the most part). Now you have gathered some wood by hitting trees and piles of logs with your trust rock! Time you built a shelter! With all the trusty wood you have collected you make a fort to call your own! Night now comes you make a fire in your shelter to sway away the cold you hear some noises you someone or something laughing you hope to god it's not the devil himself. You pek through a crack in your house it's a noob with a shotgun peering right back. You crawl to the back of your fort as the madman kicks down your door laughing. With one single blow your DEAD wondering why you died. With one final thought you considered that putting your fort in the middle of an open field was not a good idea. Rust is a good game if you know what you are doing if you don't well I think I have explained it well enough already.

2014-08-08,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Rust used to be impossible to play all by yourself because in the begining you will strave before you would have time to built a camp fire or a furnace but if you eat raw food you will throw it up. Meaning you need to have one person hunting and someone else working on a furnace or campfire or you will end up dying. They fixed that now but Rust at this point is way to laggy and incomplete to even brother playing.,Rust
2014-06-30,0,0,214,True,Recommended,I love almost everything about this game. The map could use work meaning adding more loot zones and more places outside the road circle. The road circle is nice tho and should be in new maps. Also shift clicking should be added to make putting things on easier and putting things in chests easier. When putting items into inventories or boxes if you dont put the item directly in the center of a square it pops back to your inventory or box. Allow snapping for that. Add more hostile things such as hostile mobs like raiders not zombies. Zombie enemies are outdated. Add a way for your friends to find you more easily. Trying to group up takes time to find eachother. Add vehicles. The weapons break really fast which seems odd. Otherwise I like this game.,Rust

2017-09-19,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,For all I can tell this is a fine game. The mechanics are decent and the world looks nice. But enough of what the game might be because I have no clue how this game actually plays. I ran this game initially at the second highest setting which I can do with most games made even in 2017 (see specs below). The opening screen looked pretty terrible and upon booting into game the game ran at an abysmal frame rate. Even looking directly at the ground I could not get a stable 60fps. There is so much going on that the game contsantly dropped down to 20 or 30fps. This made the game unplayable and I immediately quit to turn down the settings. The same thing happened on the next setting down and so on and so forth until I got to the second worst graphic setting. The game peaked at 100 fps and was still frequently dipping down to 40 or 50 fps. For a game that is almost 4 years old this is completely unacceptable. This may sound very whiny but you have to understand that constant fluctuation in frame rate makes a game terrible and for this reason alone I can't reccomend this game.SEPCS i5 6500 3.2GHz (underpowered I know but still runs games like R6 at a constant 100fps)GTX 106016GB DDR4 2400rpm,Rust

2015-02-14,0,0,67,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game hands down. It manages to be relatively in depth in all aspects while also mainting a pretty simple and user friendly UI/crafting system. There is a variety of servers with different mods and such allowing for many different types of players to enjoy the game equally. I'm not going to go too far into detail on the gameplay though because it basically comes down to if you're the type of person who likes survival crafting games. If not steer clear if so I'd say this is a must have. The only reasonable downside is that there is no singleplayer but finding a friendly or low pop server isn't difficult.,Rust

They have weekly updates and the new engine is reaching and starting to exceed the gameplay of legacy now.Great game.,Rust

2017-11-17,0,0,116,True,Recommended,I'm very new to Rust but from what I've seen its a great game. I do not like the forced server wipes every month but thats a nessesary in a building game. I don't recommend this game to anybody who wants to build forever and not have to restart your base frequently.,Rust
2017-01-05,0,0,1008,True,Recommended,Rust is a fantastic survival based scavenger pvp builder with decent graphics.The community of players is toxic as ... and the reason being is this game is dominated by 12 year olds who find screaming the racist homophobic and sexist slurs the most entertaining thing to do in the world. Every 50th player you come across has a 10% chance of being decent.Playing solo is doable if you know what to do and how to play but its still very hard (you need a good amount of luck to get anywhere solo). Its too bad the game is also dominated by 10+ people clans that wont play on clan servers because they suck at the game. So they build and play on normal servers preventing anyone else from being able to do anything.There have been some solo/duo/trio servers but they just die out too quickly or never get a large enough population to attract other players. Great game but it kind of hurts it self because there is no hard regulation of how the devs want the game to be played. Clans are killing the game they will end up being the only ones who play and they wont end up playing because all the solos and small groups will leave.,Rust

2015-11-26,0,0,13,True,Recommended,Rust was/is different. I went in expecting a progression of assistance as I moved forward. Turns out all of my help came from online players in the chat and they were possibly hostile. This creates an interesting dynamic. As far as gameplay goes it plays like a detailed survival game giving you the option to make bases raids teams etc..... Performance wise it is very poorly optimized. With a r9 270 I had to tune the settings almost to the lowest possible to keep a steady framerate however I am on Linux so that may be on my end.,Rust

There's another really terrible survival ""game"" which could learn a lot from Rust. This game is relatively simple and has room for development but it's already really fun and addicting. I would definitely recommend buying it but when you do make sure you find a good server without too many people there to ruin your experience. The huge number of custom servers and the modding community really add a lot to this game especially for newer players but if you join a game with 100 200+ players expect a lot of idiots running around spamming their mics and slaughtering innocent naked men.",Rust

One thing I've learned is that not to trust anyone in the game. If you see someone run like a bee is chasing you feel free to scream too. Sometimes the wild animals are bugged and sometimes you can get lucky and kill them with just the rock but if you don't have any weapons run away. I've yet to build my hut any further than stone as I keep getting killed and still have lots to learn but it's a fun game still.,Rust

2014-01-23,0,0,1465,True,Recommended,Rust most defintely plays out in a different direction than its current survival competitor DayZ. Instead of scrounging materials to survive in the shells of old residences you harvest materials for construction in much the same way as you do in the king of all survivals Minecraft. However instead of digging a hole and holding out against creatures of the night instead you build a residence or fortification and begin to carve a space out as your own within the different valleys. The main difference comes about with playing this game with a friend or two and working to build a community together. You are allowed to build structures and fortifications but are limited to the size and scope of your buildings through the placement of your foundations. As a result if you are aiming to achieve a stylized look or feel to your town working with some friends will get crafting and building done much faster. Definitely recommended as a great exercize in communal planning and collaboration but this comes with a caveat. Although the large majority of players are looking to be your friend or do their own thing there are always a few people in the servers looking to grief new players.,Rust

When you think of a fun game and want it not to be over 20$ like the basic steam card most people want games like DayZ or Arma 3 but those cost WAY to much. This game is fun on your own and even more fun with your friends and family. I myself am addicted to Minecraft and have spent at least over 10 000 hours (Yes I did the math) on that game and Rust is a game to have I would perfer it over any other game even minecraft. I hope I am helping you out by saying BUY THIS GAME! It is so much fun!,Rust

2015-02-26,0,0,427,True,Recommended,The new version of Rust is cool and all but it still has some pretty devastating problems.One is that bases are horrendously underpowered. You basically spend hours building up your base just to have someone axe down your walls and steal your loot while you're sleeping. (Yes I said axe down your walls a few minutes of cutting at a wall will break it).Another thing is that the coding is bad. This game has been in early access for over a year now and they have not addressed any of the serious bugs. In the older version (Rust Legacy) the game was well optimized and had all of the serious bugs addressed. In this newer rebooted version it is plagued with optimization problems. My computer is pretty strong for a gaming computer I can run games like Crysis 3 and Battlefield 4 and Ultra settings at around 60 FPS. However on Rust despite being on Unity my computer will have framerate drops and my components would be working on overdrive just to run the game. People with not as powerful computers find just navigating the start menu a pain in the The best part is that instead of addressing these game breaking bugs the dev team just keeps releasing skins textures and items.I was excited for a Rust reboot and gave it a chance multiple times but I can no longer recommend this newer version to anyone. If I were Gary I would scrap the reboot and just continue building up Rust Legacy. For now on Rust Legacy will be the game I play. The only reason I'm giving this a thumbs up is because I believe the old version alone is worth the $20 you spend.,Rust

2014-01-23,0,0,69,True,Recommended,"We joined a server not knowing what to expect. I was (and am) new to the game and was struggling to simply get on my feet. About five minutes in we realize the server we were in was a Spanish speaking server. ""No problem"" we said we didn't plan on talking to anyone outside of TS and I know enough Spanish that I could survive if thrown into a Spanish speaking country. About ten minutes in one of our friends runs into a group of people in ""The unraidable base."" They all have Kevlar M4's AND CHICKEN! SO MUCH CHICKEN! So he screams at them (in English and using a harsh southern accent). One guy opens the door and kills him stupid fast. But he got the guy's name. So we waited... and waited... and waited for this person to log off the server. An hour and a half later he disconnects. My buddy changes his name to the guy who just left's name. He runs up to the giant base only a stone hatchet in hand. I tell him how to type ""share the door with me."" After a few seconds he starts laughing histarically. They let him in! He goes in and shuts the door as these people are speaking all around him in a language he doesn't understand. He says he will be right back and goes into a corner... waiting for one to actually go AFK. Then one does behind one of the barricades in ""the unraidable base"" He hatchets his head in takes all his armor gun and ammo. Then he started shooting. He killed them all in seconds. Looking up he could see a few spawn and put bullets in them as well. We ran in me and the friend without any gear and decked ourselves out. Setting up a base then in the hills we lived care free away from any other people. The only other times we would speak to people is when I would scream at them to ""stop"" ""put your hands up"" ""drop everything or we will shoot you "" and then... ""I'm sorry!""",Rust

2016-04-09,0,0,244,True,Not Recommended,Edit 8/24/16I have done many things on rust...from playing solo and getting chased down by bears. To joining Role play servers such as dark ages and then meeting the KING whom was on shadowfrax's youtube D!!! And also joining clans whom hold up innocent people and KOS. Rust to me is more than just a battle royal kinda game I play it as a surivival game. I recommend new players finding a rp server with a no KOS/kill on sight rule! I have had a ton of fun so far even with the XP system. edit 4/25/2017XP system is out and components are in. My review stays the same. If you're gonna buy the game and play on it play with some friends and join a decent modded server. The offcial servers are the ones you want to stay away from. I have ran into zero cheaters. The server I play on is Dark ages which is free of kill on sight. People are very friendly on there. And its numbers reach over 50 players. Give the game a shot. They have given us many updates and are working their butts off. People are always going to say bad crap about a game just because they are salty or they've gotten bored of the game. edit 5/5/2017Griefing is now more likely to happen thanks to the Devs. Truthfully just think they're trying to kill their game off. Maybe they should just completely remove the cupboard since now its basically useless. Grats.,Rust

It went from a smooth good looking game that was fun to an ugly poorly thought out game that doesn't run or look anything like it use to. Also the community has really gone in the same direction. Before you could find good servers with good people looking to work together to make cool stuff. Now it seems like every server I join is just filled with greifers and people that just kill anything that moves. I use to be excited about what this game had in its future now I just see it as a game in use to play.

2017-09-12,0,0,40,True,Not Recommended,There is no major problem with the game itself the major issues are with the players who think its fun to kill people who are just starting out trying to do their own thing or a bit of both. The people in the game with way too much time on their hands instantly have an advantage over someone who is either new or just plays the game casually. Don't buy this game unless you plan on putting an obscene amount of hours into it.,Rust

2017-11-27,0,0,3968,True,Recommended,This is the most polished Alpha game I have ever played. More so then most full releases. The video above regarding first day / first week in Rust really does give a good indication of the kind of game it is. It's survival farming building exploring looting raiding hunting playing accoustic guitar making traps setting up trading shops/vending machines... it's whatever you make it. There's no rules no limitations put on the player... if you find it you can make it. So it really is whatever you make it. Fair warning it's easy to invest alot of time in this game and have it quickly undone by being raided or killed. The converse being that sometimes you get the drop on someone or raid a base and make off like a bandit filled rare and wonderful loot. And sometimes you make friends. It's a little bit of social commentary on how people will treat each other given that you all wake up naked with nothing but a rock on a deserted island. I have over 3.7k hours in this game. I HIGHLY recommend it more so for a full time gamer but also for casuals (just don't be a solo if you're casual join a group )),Rust
2017-02-02,0,0,92,True,Recommended,This game is merciless and completely unforgiving many people have given up on it simply because they couldn't do anything they kept getting raided and everything I myself have not even played the game and that is my fault I bought it thinking my PC could handle it but it cannot I did otherwise watch tons of videos and seen many people play it and I can say that the game is pretty good the devs are for not doing what they promised and they still have not fixed the performance the game doesn't load the game downloads every time you join a server if you have a good PC you wouldn't mind but I had high hopes for this and I'm actually really sad that I cannot play.I will see past my idiocy and still give this a positive review but I would only give the game a 6/10 if I would take all the promises the devs made and everything that the game could've been.If they simply made this without promising to do something else about 3 years ago and still hadn't done it I would've given it a 9/10.,Rust

2016-04-10,0,0,321,True,Recommended,The game is good with alot of potential however there is a steep learning curve to the game. For instance like 90% of the players you run into are hostile and will kill you for no reason. The game is really fun though once you learn the basics. Base building is very nice and has limitless potential. Gun play is nice in the sense of realism someone can't just spray you down from a long distance because horizontal recoil is almost impossible to controll. Overalll I recommend this game even in alpha its fun as hell.Pros Base building is very simplistic has many possibilities. Realistic gun play. Tons of content to keep you occupied for hours. Modded servers that change up the game in a good way.Cons EVERYONE kills on sight very rarily will someone actually be friendly and help you so watch your back. There are few weapons at the moment but i'm sure the devs will add more as the game progresses (this is more of nitpick than a con).,Rust

2014-02-12,0,0,334,True,Recommended,I can't seem to put this game down. It is oddly addictive.You start out butt naked with a rock 2 healthpacks and a torch.You have to use the rock to forage for wood ore and also use it to bash the out of wild boars for chicken meat..yes I did not realise this either that pigs bears coyotes and wolves are made of chicken. Fan ing tastic.By this time you would want to start worrying about building a shelter. Once you get your out house looking shelter assembled then make sure you put a nice wooden door on it. The door will help keep you safe inside your house until the shotgun toting hillbilly players break it down steal your hard earned loot and leave you naked in a pile of blood.. If you have managed to get a shelter build up some good stacks of wood ore chicken and also throw together a makeshift shotgun then it is finally time go killing ZOMBIES! Oh wait I mean you can kill wolves and bears that are RED....and each of them seem to drop a kitbag with supplies. I killed a red bear he dropped a kitbag Inside the kitbag were 4 metal doors a med kit and a 9mm. This bear really had his together. I used the 9mm to kill a naked dude that was asking to take up refuge in my shack shelter and stole his rock. I then used the 4 metal doors to make a sweet hide out in which I had 4 ways to enter/exit. All in all this game kept me entertained way longer than I thought it would and it is much better than I tought it would be. It is only in alpha so it can only get better!,Rust

2014-09-17,0,0,221,True,Recommended,Had a lot of fun with game. It gets monotonous having to constantly gather material such as wood and certian minerials. Like honestly most of the time your cutting down random piles of wood or breaking random boulders for metal ore. Or killing animals for meat and fat. But once that crap is done you get to make guns and explosives and pretty cool bases with locked doors so only ppl you want in can get in ( or out )). It has a decent size community so you have ability to make friends and enemies and generate a lot of drama on a server which is where this game really shines. I think the devs should focus on that aspect instead of just another grinder game. I'm sick of performing the same task over and over again. That's not fun nore is it a good use of my time. I greatly enjoyed the time i spent making friends and going on hunts/raids and defending others when they needed help or asking for help from the friends i made. I'm waiting for the game to come out not as an early access but as a full release.,Rust
2014-09-17,0,0,122,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game that beats Minecraft and any other competitors on the market. Rust allows a realistic fun feel of survival. In normal Rust there is plenty to do messing around with friends running down the road screaming in your microphone and even being a naked man running around with your rock bashing down houses. Experimental branch is where I would say the fun really starts. With all the new updates Garry and Facepunch Studios release there is no deadline on what you can do. Climb to the tallest mountain build the titanic explore caves or simply build your epic fortress against all the other cannibals. Garry and his team are always releasing new updates to the game and I can't wait to see you and the future of Rust!,Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,175,True,Not Recommended,This game would be awesome but there are too many hackers.I've never played a game with so many cheaters.Developer needs to fix this as it seems to be far too easy to hack.also because its based off Unity game engine you see it has many problems.This game has been developed for many years and still you see animals going through the terrain.There are no decent post effects. no volumetric lighting and no other effects which makes it feel very outdated. Overall they picked the wrong game engine. Unity is only good for simple mobile games. no serious studios use unity for desktop games.,Rust
2016-06-10,0,0,437,True,Recommended,I think it is a great game it just needs quite a lot of fixes and glitches that is clearly noticeable for first impressions. This can turn out to be a great game if all these glitches are fixed and when it gets out of Beta version (which it probably won't for quite a long time).

2016-02-26,0,0,635,True,Not Recommended,I decided to edit my previous review since so much has changed since I wrote it. All I can say is holy !! This game has gone downhill in so many ways... I used to enjoy this game. HOURS of fun and gametime. The community was terrible when I started playing but it was bearable. But its 1 000 times worse... Its so bad that the fun has been completely taken out of the game. Every server is full of annoying little kids who have yet to experience what natural selection should have delt with a long time ago. I'm not complaining about dying or getting raided (don't get me wrong it sucks). The truly annoying part is the complete immaturity of %80 of the community. Now that I discussed the issue of the community I want to mention the issue of hackers. They're on EVERY server. I even watched a guy raid my ARMOURED base with just a bow and arrow but whatever just try a new server (where I THOUGHT I'd be safe). But recently I was on a server where a guy admitted to hacking and the admin permabanned him but before he left he said he doesn't care if he gets EAC/VAC banned since Rust key's are only $7 8 %90 of the time. Once I heard that I had to really ask myself if it was worth it. All I can say is avoid this game it's not worth it. Unless you don't mind hackers and/or a game with one of the WORST communities in the history of gaming.,Rust

Even on local servers people can be seen teleporting out of your view because of connection issues.Okay now for the positive the gunplay feels better and bows are better. we now have radtowns. animal movement works with where the animal is in relativity on whether you shoot them or they attack you (meaning they dont moonwalk anymore). There are still mods for it and they make the game much more fun to play. we still have airdrops. codelocks mean you can have a secure house now.all in all still a good game but wouldn't recomend it to you if you don't like waiting 50 years untill its a full game10/10 would have trust issues with other people again,Rust

If you think GTAV has long loading times prepare yourself for some epic You can t do anything while the game loads can t use Steam can t Tab out. You are literally stuck and forced to watch the numbers roll by... Very very annoying. (And I have this game on Potato settings due to the RAM issue...)I have 8GB of RAM and this game uses all of it to its core. Wich forces my computer to shut the game down every 30 minutes due to memory loss. Atm this game is unplayable for me. They should defenetly optimise this game instead punching out weapon and spawning tweaks. How about you take care of the performance before you start implementing useless stuff day in and day out. )It feels like there is an Update ever third day wich may sound nice but with an own Server the maintenance is just tidious. The looting system is good allthough it s too easy to find everything you need with one run. The housing system is nice nothing revolutionary but never the less decent.

2014-10-31,0,0,847,True,Not Recommended,An unbelievably addicting game. Right on release me and my friends spent days without sleeping in fear for our digital lives and loot. No matter how much time spent on the game the only thing that got old was the very beginning of your life and even that could get interesting. You can have 0 loot and people will chase you across the entire map for 40 minutes just to kill you it's absolutely hilarious. Some of the client is helpful/friendly and about 95% wants you dead thats what I love about it. For the longest time I was a bandit i was the guy who got accused by every little whiny little kid for hacking because i had a good shot nothing is more rewarding feeling than messing up some angry people on rust. The only problems i had when it's legacy was the main game (basically where all my time was spent on this game) was the lag hacking and ddos attacks. I honestly believe that the first version of the game was better than the new version. My reasoning isn't because of graphics or anything like that just the uniqueness of the game. It was simple to build easy to gather resources and through almost all of my time playing the game i spent laughing at situations only the legacy version brought. The new version of the game is extremely great looking has realistic and immersive armor but in my opinion had they just worked to improve lag and bugs and fix the hacking problem on the original game i would be more likely to play the game like i used to. The original version can never get beat on their mission to change the game completely they lost a lot of their clientell. Spent the greater part of 6 months waiting for them to do a big update and they basically scrapped the game and started all over. Still i can't not recommend this game for how much fun i had and how gary neumann actually keeps his community updated and interacts with them.All in all the game has gone backwards the new version may have upgraded features but it is downgraded from the original game. The first alpha version 11/10 New version 6/10. They should have just upgraded the first version.EDIT The game has practically died now. The old version was much better dont waste $20 on a game nobody plays anymore. The legacy version was the revolutionary chance for this game to take over but Gary gave up and hackers took over along with russian fake servers. The new version just isn't fun if that's what you're looking for. you build like in minecraft but the PvP is broken and buggy. Nice way to kill the game Gary should have added these changes to the legacy.,Rust

2015-01-31,0,0,12,True,Recommended,I've had this game since very early alpha. I bought it about a week after it was released into early access. It was kinda boring you had to make to many things to make one important thing. Resources were scarce. The HUD was too small and it looked funky. From what I saw things have improved. HUD looks great better crafting menu trees actually yield a nice amount of wood. Here's where it all goes downhill. I have a high end of the medium end gaming PC. It runs most games I own at between 120 150 frames. But the grass in Rust. The grass.The way it waves so sexily in the wind makes the game unplayably laggy. I checked the ping of the server I joined it was low 27.I knew it was a client issue becuase as soon as I stepped off the beach I woke up nude on and into the pretty forests my FPS took an epic cliff dive. 5/10 until I can change the damn grass settings.,Rust

Yes there are a few servers that are fine but most if not all have some clan(s) trying to control them these guys tend to be no lifes who will play maybe 20 hours in a day and join a new server as it's wiped stick together and basically ruin the experience for most other players.Get this game if you have friends who you can play with never play it alone unless you plan to become a rust youtuber.Basically good game bad community and the latest update broke everything giving the ultimate power to the raider scum""The world of Rust is an online representation of how harsh the real world is""",Rust

2014-02-13,0,0,58,True,Recommended,A game where you spend hours gathering resources under constant fear of a quick death from your fellow players. Everytime you see another user in Rust your heart rate will double. That is really the thrill of the game. Sure there is building a base and gathering resources even animals you can fight and kill but it's the interactions with other players that are the core experience of Rust.Most of those experiences really depend on who you meet. There will be some players that kindly say hello and might even offer to help you. For every such user there are at least 5 players that will murder you on sight which can make for very nervous interactions with others.There is the ability to build in Rust which is necessary to store your resources and protect your sleeping body when you log out. Building is horrendously expensive when you move past a single wooden shelter. It takes thousands of wood or metal pieces to create a base solid and complex enough to prevent other players from simply using 1 5 c4 to enter and take EVERYTHING you own. In contrast that c4 is very easy for a player that was fortunate enough to research both c4 and explosives allowing them to produce unlimited amounts. C4 is expensive but only a fraction of the resources obtained from raiding.This is the main problem in Rust. Unless you are an offensive player that was fortunate enough to obtain a source of C4 you are essencially just collecting resources for the 1% that do who grow exponentially more wealthy as time goes on if they remain unchallenged. This eventually leads to a completely untouchable one to five player group with a base so large and laiden with walls traps and expensive to destroy decoys that they are nearly invincible to all on the server.As a result of all this if you don't have a friend or two to play this game with find one or skip it. Having a partner you can trust and work with will make everything easier. Essentially it doubles or triples your ability to collect resources build and defend yourself. If you work together running into another player is less of a big deal there are 2 3 against 1 and those odds are usually good enough to be left alone. Even if you do get smoked you buddies will be there to get revenge protect your dropped inventory or just get you back up on your feet. And if all you stuff gets raided you still had a good time with friends and will recover twice as fast rather than just thinking about how you wasted the last 20 hours of your life grinding to lose it all.Conclusion If you play Rust alone you're gonna have a bad time.,Rust

2014-02-13,0,0,9,True,Recommended,I have only played this game for a couple of hours and I really enjoy what this game is offering. Its like it wants me to fail. I start off with nothing more than a rock to use as a weapon or mining a torch that will give your position away a health kit (for when you are attacked by bears wolves or people) and you have no armor. Besides that the game looks amazing and seems to be on the right track in its alpha stage. The very thing that i enjoy about this game is the teamwork needed for survival. Once I was able to join up with some friends the game became more enjoyable and we worked together to build a base gather some materials and build up our armory. When the time comes to defend our fortification or remove unwanted visitors we are ready. The game has a lot to offer and with it only being in alpha I am excited to see what it will bring to the table with full release. **BE WARNED NOT EVERYONE WILL BE A FRIENDLY JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE HOLDING A PICKAXE DOES NOT MEAN THEY WONT KILL YOU WITH IT**,Rust
2014-02-13,0,0,36,True,Recommended,Rust is a lot of fun... At first. However after a few weeks of owning it and putting many hours into it it's grown stale. I do believe the game is wonderful if you have the friends to play it with if not it gets boring and frustrating alone. Another issue seems to be the way the community is right now. There's a large issue of hackers in almost any server you go into. At first I joined a less populated server to explore and build with a friend but as he started to not play as much that stopped being interesting. A lot of the fun comes in player combat as well. That being said this can also be a downside since often spawning into a new server with near nothing means getting killed by everyone. So if you're lucky enough to find a spot where you're secluded and have resources then you can build yourself a nice little base gather weapons and defend yourself. But the opportunity for this to happen has been rare to me. I'd say this game is still interesting. But with it being early access many bugs and changes still are to be fixed. I'd say wait for full release. I believe the game still has the potential to be better (I don't know how yet though). This is by no means a bad game it can be very pretty (especially with its lighting) and building things with people and PvP can be fun and interesting. It just needs to be fixed and tweaked.,Rust

2016-03-25,0,0,266,True,Not Recommended,"So you can see the time I've spent that I've done my fair share of playing Rust. It use to be great but it is no longer worth paying nor playing.Ironic how these Early Access games go. They become decent at first with a crap load of bugs then approves later onward and suddenly goes back to the crap hole. Rust is one of those games.It use to be a struggle when Blueprints first existed fighting to get the prints and praying to god to get that Bolt Action Rifle template or AK 47 template. Requiring one to get a bow and arrow to self defend ones self against other players till you research decent quality weapons. Oh forget to mention it required a decent size amount of resources to create a Research Table (That had value) unless you're a risk taker to research in a nearby monumentum which 9/10 is a battleground between solo's or clans. Wood use to be good (Till Flamethrower became a thing) then again why would you even go wood? You're silly to stick with wood over stone or metal seeing that it takes 1 C4 or a Rocket to destroy the entire structure lol. But now days it's easier to get that AK that Bolt That thompson or any good weapon simply by farming boxes crates and airdrops throughout the Rust valley. Blueprints haven't existed for a while and it's diffirculty has been banished turning into a hand holding playthrough. Even soloing is now easier. What broke the camels back to quitting Rust though is this new update 158. Where one can build twig structures around a nearby base that has an active cupboard around it's radius. Cupboards officially have 0 use. It's defense is gone. Having external walls is now a waste of resources and time. One can easily build upgrade then build around it and conquer the domain easier rather than raiding it the old fashion way that requires X amount of C4's or Rockets. With this new update it makes veterans like me turn away from Rust and say good bye.Lastly of course are the aimbotters but we all know aimbotting doesn't exist due to Rusts ""Anti Cheat System"" Pffft right. This issue has been ongoing since Rust's existence so I won't bother complaining. That complaint is on the bottom of my cry list for every FPS shooter that is MMO have this issue. Move along.If you enjoy hand holding quick to play and conquer games Rust is for you. If you're looking for an actual survival game that has real mechanics a challenge and requires the individual to work at it Rust is not the game I would suggest. I'll miss you Rust but Facepunch can no longer polish your ugliness. The developers have officially ruined your beauty and existence. RIP Jan 2016 5/14/2017.",Rust
2015-10-24,0,0,1470,True,Recommended,So lets go over the positives and negatives to this game. I personally love Rust (if you cant tell by my 900+ hours) and most that play Rust seem to believe it is in a broken state. As for the controversial update that was just released I will skip over that as I believe it gives the game a large disliking at the moment. So pre twig update will be used in this review.Positives Amazing GunplayBase building is funRaiding is funDoing anything in this game can be funLots of stuff to doDecent amount of ammo and weapon attachment customizabilityDifferent playstylesVery balanced (pre twig update remember?)Negatives Zergs are opSolo players are underratedGrinding can be annoying (unless you are a zerg)Components are clunky and need a bit more tweakingGeneral response to a running naked is to shoot at itThe game has great mechanics and gunplay but lacks the appropriate means to keep a player base sustained. I understand that facepunch does look at player feedback but they lacked the appropriate foresight to see what this would do. The twig update for example should have been put in the experimental branch and used as a means to test and see if the general player base liked it. I can understand from their viewpoint that the best way to reach the majority of their audience is to put it right into the main branch but I cannot understand why the experimental branch is not used sometimes this game has a massive amount of work put in and is still in development. So why not have the community help develop the game and test updates before they go into effect.,Rust

2017-04-20,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,"I'm disappointed (and oddly disturbed) by this game. perhaps it's just that I haven't given it enough time and/or something else. but basically you log into a server which loads you into the game with a bunch of strangers who are pretty much just out to kill you and get your meager stuff which most often is just a rock and torch. Upon respawning I often passed by a killing field of bodies with just a rock and torch in their inventory.I started the game died respawned ran around trying to hide and craft things to survive only to get killed numerous times by what seemed like very cruel people. This happened over and over again until I was fortunate enough to craft a nice little safe house nestled up in the mountain in the rocks where I thought I could respawn safely (so I hoped) when I returned the next day. Alsa when I did someone had trashed into my place killed my sleeping body and stolen everything. The Moral of this story is why bother? You basically run around dying stealing and killing. Unless you perservere enough to craft a stone fort which even then doesn't guarantee security this game is more of some cruel nightmare dying and then reborn only to watch yourself die over and over.Once a player asked via chat if someone wanted to collaborate. No one replied. After awhile the player offered again and again no one replied except those who mocked or joked about it. His offers sounded oddly like the bleating of a sheep asking for slaughter and any reply would only bring on the wolves when we met. This gave the game a distinct ""Lord of the Flies"" air. I accepted his offter and he replied back to me but when I asked how we could meet safely he stopped chatting.What is particularly creepy and cruel is that when you are killed you fall to the ground facing up. Your viewpoint is of whatever is around and above you which is most often your killer. The screen says you are wounded and need help. yet most often none comes and you and your killer just stare at each other until you either die or they kill you. Once I could hear my killer stabbing me over and over and over which had a bad psychopathic feeling. I really hope it was just the game sound glitching. The graphics are good the crafting system seems fairly intuitive and the gameplay is decnet. I hope that the game develops into something that I can enjoy playing and not feel like sick about afterwards.",Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Great concept but skeptical considering its an indie developer. Its hard to be invested in this game. I've had my hopes crushed on games with much more progress at this stage of development. I think for its genre its probably one of the better ideas out there. I've never been a big fan of survival games. I was hoping to find one that changes the trend of them. I'm curious if the developers are qualified enough and have the financial backing to make the engine into a stable fully functional game. As of right now? I wouldn't recommend purchasing the game in hopes that you're going to get much more than a shell. IT IS ALPHA. I would purchase the game under the idea that you're supporting the company's path they plan to take. For me personally? I have my own list of concerns granted its engine and the natural problems that come with making persistent world games through it. First and foremost being the onslaught of hackers. That will be what makes or breaks this game if they can manage to figure out their desync problems and stability issues. There needs to be some more features out there because the content isn't there to really sustain a sandbox game long term. I am only recommending this game because I have friends who absolutely love it. If it wasn't for their testimony and their passion for it I would encourage people to stay away. All in all I'm 50/50 at this point. Only time will tell if this game is or isn't a complete waste of money.,Rust

2013-12-18,0,0,140,True,Recommended,Even though I haven't played this game for long I can allready say that this game has real potential! The community is unbelievable nice. I was playing on a server with 60 people and instead of shooting me they give me food show me where I am and help me out as a noob.... and that on an PVP server.The crafting system is ok but needs more content for lategame. Collecting blueprints takes quite a while but it's possible with a group of people and are usually found in the ressource drops. (with the plane)That drops also make fun situations as everyone is searching for it and gives you a hunger games feeling but really less deadly as you would imagine it.With good weapon gameplay and a mature and friendly community this game is going to be a good game and with Garry behind it there's no chance that it will fail!,Rust

2014-01-29,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,I've longed to find an aesthetically pleasing survival based game where it pits man vs. the elements so when I researched this game I was taken in by the allure of the beautiful scenic views in the clips....but that's where the appeal ends. I purchased the game in high anticipation only to be drawn into grave disappointment. This game supports an underculture where the murder and deciet of player characters in a PvP setting flourishes which makes it difficult for new players to dive into the crafting aspects of the game. It's not unusual for a new player to arrive upon a new world only to be sniped down within mere seconds by a high powered rifle before one can learn anything about the controls to the game. If one can survive the first few hours they will begin the arduous journey of scavenging for scarce resources...and I mean scarce. One can search a long time before finding animals to hunt (which I also found to be a joke) or natural materials for crafting which can often lead to frustration. I also found the world to be more a littered junk yard as shacks left behind by other players dot the landscape. Now this does take place in a post apocalyptic setting so the scarcity of resources and to some extent the behavior of the player characters may be in line to what can be expected in such a setting. But this game seems more focused on PvP than world building as keyboard commandos continually scour the landscape gunning down one another and stealing their resources....even victimizing new players as they spawn into the world through coercion or deciet. All this given that wasn't the deal breaker.What really irked me the most was spending hours scavenging resources logging off then returning only to find everything I've worked for missing from my character. I don't mean those kept in inventory stored in boxes on the world....those are always subject to be looted by bandits....no I mean stuff literally kept on the player character itself....food weapons armor medical supplies..... and this happened more than a handful of times. In conclusion the game is big on promise but short on delivery for gamers who look for character and world building and customization....and you won't be guaranteed you'll keep what you work for. PvPers might find it appealing if you can keep from getting ganked long enough to learn anything about the game. No this game is a huge disappointment and not worth the money spent on it.,Rust

2014-02-14,0,0,171,True,Recommended,This game is soo much fuun. If you haven't bought it yet or your debating too buy it just buy it. The base building is pretty addictive and its just soo cool to build something from scratch from foundations and walls. You can do pretty much anything. Also if your playing with friends is just fun for days and can't be beat. I have almost 100 hours on it and it's still just as fun as the day I bought it. Not to mention its an early access so with it not really close to be finished I have high expectations for it sense its this good early on. Plus its made by garry so I don't imagine it being anything but perfect.,Rust
2014-02-14,0,0,174,True,Recommended,I've not been as hooked on a game as I've been with Rust. Even in a pre alpha stage the concept and execution of this game allows for hours of fun in a sandbox environment in servers that host plenty of random friends and foes. Voip in game makes for immersive experiences as you go from calling out to a random on the plains holding up a victim with a furnace made firearm or simply laughing your off with co conspirators with every mishaps and piece of good fortune that presents itself in this FPS/Survival RPG MMO hybrid.,Rust

2014-02-14,0,0,325,True,Recommended,I'm not even sure what to say about this game. It is still in alpha and I believe that it is way to early for a release. Also if you play alone it's extremely difficult and you most likely wont go far in a populated server. The idea for the game surviving on an island is really good but so far limited to getting a house guns and killing each other because you can. The game can further improve if the developers add alot more more goals more area in the map something to give us to do other than trying to get more guns than your neighbor. The community of this game are mostly s and will pretty much kill anybody they see whether you are new or naked. However if you manage to get a group or a clan to play with it becomes more fun trying to conquer the server against other groups which is pretty much all thats left to do. The game has a lot of potential.,Rust
2014-02-14,0,0,88,True,Recommended,I found this game very fun once you find someone to team up with. I really think there should be a craft map option and hoping so as of yet I'm still exploring the vast world and being an animal activist's nightmare.

2014-01-29,0,0,47,True,Recommended,First off let's be clear. I don't like games that do this pre release alpha crap. It's annoying sickening and drives me nutty.Having said that? THIS GAME IS AMAZING. I've been a fan of FPS games (even though I'm no good at them) since the days of Quake and this game solves a major problem I have seen in alot of MMO style FPS games loss.What do you mean you ask? Well if you die in any other game (say PlanetSide 2) you will spawn with a new set of guns full ammo and so on. Here? If you die at best you'll be sent back to your home base holding a rock and your balls worst case is you get flung to some random part of the island with nothing but a rock and your balls.This game is definitely not meant to be played solo however and it's highly recommended you forge an alliance or find a server your friends play on. Teamwork is cruical when everyone else wants to see you dead so they can take your chicken and bullets.There are still a number of bugs that need to be worked out but I believe this game will become something.,Rust

2016-04-23,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,The good It is quite interesting starting with nothing and having to make your way basically from stone age to somewhat modern age (at least speaking of weapons) this was indeed quite intreaging. The grafics are nice and it really gets your heart pumping if you are semi naked and run across some animal.The bad The game is not that stable (specifically if you die an respan you might crash). Animlas seem to cling to rocks and run circles there which kills immersion some.The ugly The Playerbase Well as many reviews before already stated the worst enemy is not hunger or thirst (as stated) but actually other players where 95% try to kill you on sight (even without reason). One example you span and some other player spans next to you on the beach both have nothing exept a torch and a stone. And the first thing happens is that you get hit by the stone. But note there es nothing to gain from a fresh player.Some sever issues regarding bugs/exploits/hacking (i cannot tell for sure what exackly) After a few days i actually managed to build a base and start getting somewhere everything bad previously witnessed seems to just be a begging hardship (ppl still try to kill you even if you have a gun and they are somewhat naked still). So spend some days buildin the base doing research when a group 3 ccome acress and you retreat to you base and assume they are not able to get it (stone walls multiple armored doors). WHat happens ? You get shot throught 2 layers of stone walls don'T even see any enemy and the just hop 2 stores high and loot everything you gathered (and killing you right away if you respan).Maybe this is the game's intention but i wish to warn others about what they may get into if start Rust.,Rust

You will wake up and die you will get back up again and kill you will hunt you will craft you will build you will die you will get toxic because kids killed you and they laugh at you but you know what?

2015-03-12,0,0,47,True,Not Recommended,"Rust is a well done survival game that has you crafting scavenging and protecting yourself. However it is ruined entirely by people and the inability to play alone or with just friends.Gameplay+ Fun survival gameplay+ Nice variety of things to do People No offline/singleplayer mode Hackers I will start off by saying Rust is a well done survival game. You go out collect resources scavenge what you can and simply try to not only survive but thrive. Build weapons ammo medpacks walls doors and basically anything you need to live. Rust does this quite well however what Rust does not do well is people. I cannot say that this will ruin the game for everyone but for me it does. There is no single player. If you enjoy working for hours and hours day after day gathering resources and making your fort only to log on the next day and find yourself dead naked and having to start over then this is the game for you. If you find that fun by all means get Rust but if you are like me then I suggest staying away.Graphics+ Look pretty great+ Well polished in most areas Graphical glitches Some game breaking glitchesThe graphics in Rust have always looked pretty nice if you can run it on the best graphics. However they have always had problem with glitches (as do most survival games) and some can be either game breaking or simply very very irritating.Overall/Quick ReviewUnless you have a group of friends well sized that play quite often and you trust fully you will NOT enjoy this game. It is designed for you to spend your time collecting resources blueprints and making yourself an arsenal and fort to try and protect yourself. You log out and you are ""sleeping in the house"" and other players can see you break in kill you take everything and walk away. You then log in the next time naked with nothing and when you go back to your home it is destroyed.I do not recommend this game it is built around the idea of surviving with people when in reality all it does is promote griefing by people who play 24/7 and those who have friends dedicated to the game.Do NOT buy.",Rust
2015-03-11,0,0,114,True,Not Recommended,Rust is still the same game it was close to 2 years ago with graphical improvements and a few bug fixes. Keep in mind this game sold over 1 000 000 copies at $19.99. How they still haven't ironed out the bugs and completed the game yet is beyond me. There's still rampant cheating and in a game like this there's nothing more frustrating than to watch helplessly as 10+ hours of your work wiped out in seconds by someone using cheats.I wouldn't recommend this game at all and I'll refrain from purchasing future games by Facepunch until they get their priorites straight. The fact that Garry Newman saw the need to make a blog complaining about the criticism levied upon Facepunch for starting MULTIPLE projects while Rust still isn't near finished is repugnant.

2014-01-29,0,0,50,True,Recommended,This game is very similar to DayZ. However the difference is that it's much simpler. View this how you may this game features less in the way of weapons and combat. However unlike DayZ Rust's appeal is centered around the ability to collect resources and make your own base as well as tools armor weapons and supplies. A solid 85% of all items in game can be crafted using resources you collect. However like DayZ there's a threat of bandits. Bandits may raid your home kill you and take your stuff so you have to start over again. However all crafting recipes you learn are saved to your profile on the server so dying won't reset your progress on learning how to craft things.

2017-11-25,0,0,1042,True,Recommended,From collecting skulls to blowing up bases there is a huge amount of fun you can get in this game. But you have to play in a group that's the only way you can really get to end game loot like ak 47's and c4. Unless you're some ballsy masochist. Also there is a large learning curve right now so you should watch some videos on base building raiding etc. But if you have a group you will have a lot more fun. But if you're skilled enough you could probably play this solo and build trap bases like KCMO. look that guy up he's a master at building trap bases. But the developers are constantly updating the game on a biweekly basis. And they are constantly adding new things fixing things and even overhauling entire gameplay mechanics! I play this game with a group of friends and I have a load of fun hopefully you do too.p.s. dont trust anyone you'll probably get stabbed bludgeoned or shot by them.link to kcmo's channel https //www.youtube.com/channel/UCNoMMO5NsdTOUCwVo3xjRPw,Rust

2014-01-29,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,This game needs two ratings. If you play alone then no do not buy this game. The community is pretty picky about who it wants to team up with and unless you know someone that also has the game and is willing to play with you the game will wind up one complete bust. HOWEVER if you play with a group you can build massive bases raid other players for their stuff and have massive PVP battles where death has meaning. My review however will be a thumbs down for now. Its so hard to play alone as if you build a shack then the bigger bandit clans will wipe you clean as you sleep and pick your stuff. If you have friends that will let you group up with them then turn that finger around to a thumbs up. Almost all of the flaws the game has are 'fixed' with a group but not so as a single player. Honestly if there was a better way to search for a group ingame as a solo player the game would be better to. But in both the game's current state and community state dont play this solo.,Rust

2017-11-02,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,"If you enjoy watching pros play this game on Youtube then keep watching it on Youtube. Playing the game itself is a much different experience and I heavily regret dropping 33 bucks into this game. It's NOT READY. Not even close. It has a really long way to go before it's servicable and in its current state 22$ CAD is way too much. This shouldn't be priced anywhere above 10$ because the value just isn't there. People are gonna call you salty if you get mad at this game. You will get mad you will be salty and if you lose too many fights and lose too many bases you're gonna finally be humble enough to walk away from this game like I did. I have some bullet points explaing my issues with this game but I'll be less formal to start. The people on this game aren't ""funny"" like you've seen in youtube videos they don't talk to eachother. They kill eachother. This game is not noob friendly. Everything and everyone is going to try to kill you and take everything you own and burn down what they can't take with them. And they will succeed. You will die a lot. I have no problem with the developers of this game. They've made a decent game that is a little overpriced and visibly unfinished. It is the community that butchers any sense of enjoyment. I thought it was funny at first how toxic it was. But it is too toxic. And yes I am salty.1. Toxic Community (the sALT)Players in Rust are hostile offensive and above all else...SALTY. Some encounters with players can by pleasant but it's mostly people killing eachother over resources (which is a traumatic experience given how hard it is to gather much of anything). Most conversations between players are people blasting music over their mic players swearing and saying some pretty racist things and threats of real life violence. None of this is surprising apart from the racism and swearing since servers claim to have banned this behaviour. If they have then they've done a pretty terrible job so far. 2. PVP combat (slow clunky laggy)The combat looks absolutely stupid. It's looks like gmod character models swinging rubber crowbars while jumping and strafing as best as the engine can handle it. Frame drops and lag issues tend to ruin fights and doesn't pair well with the slow clunky movement controls. Most weapons lack any feeling of impact apart from some guns which actually control and handle pretty well. The issue with that is that guns are SO difficult to come by so you'll be getting shot with them more than you'll actually be holding one. 3. Resources gathering (Minecraft did it better)Gathering wood and stone to make your first house takes RIDICULOUSLY long. Hatchets/Picks foundations/walls/roofs and upgrading them to stone costs a LOT of resources. Actually mining all of it to make a solid base can potentially lead up to 1/2 an hour to a full hour of JUST grinding. For this reason the stakes of fights with other players are just too high. If you lose a fight after grinding enough to build a house then you've lost a half hour at least. And if you couldn't find enough cloth to make a sleeping bag then you'll be respawned on the other side of the map. Good luck there. 4. Raids (offline raids accesible to few)ALL of the the raids I experienced happened offline. Around 2 00Am to 4 00Am was primetime for people to often blow open my front door and chop my body and sleeping bag and clear my house of all loot and furnishings. Raiding other people takes explosives or serious mining tools which let's be honest. Unless you have a clan or a friend or two who are masters at this game and know where to look for the right components you're not making these anytime soon So raiding is only for the rich to grief the less fortunate. 5. No room for nakeds (noob killing no tutorials)This is actually a phenomenon that I don't see in a lot of other games. Sure enough call of duty/battlefield/any multiplayer game makes fun of noobs but usually there are a few people willing to teach someone the ropes. But Rust treats noobs horribly. People often camp the beaches and shoot new players who have just spawned in. There isn't a tutorial or any fellow players to teach nakeds how to even play the game so they're thrust into the game world where they're killed for sport over and over again. I understand the idea of ""earning the right to be good"" through player encounters and getting in fights but that doesn't work when people with guns are shooting you for your rock and torch. If you havent heard of it yet Ark is another survival game. It looks like clans are easier to join and that there is a little less player interaction since a large focus of the game is NPC dinosaurs that you can tame.It too seems overpriced at 80$ Canadian but it has some semblance of finish to it. It has many of the same problems from what I can tell but what I do know is that in terms of survival games Rust still has a long way to go. Don't waste your time or money here there are better games that can offer a much better expierience at a better price. Hopefully in a few years this game is finished but the community isn't going to be changing anytime soon. Stay salty.",Rust

2017-11-25,0,0,422,True,Recommended,Rust is the kinda game you'll probably want to learn about before you start playing to make sure it's worth your time/money. Watch a couple videos read into what the devs are aiming for and if you still want to play after learning about its flaws and frustrations it will probably be one of if not your favorite game like it is mine. Welcome to a survival game that meets Stanford prison experiment. My most helpful tip is to take the time to find a good server. This might mean you get killed on sight on 5 before you find one with friendly enough people to let you live while you make the very basics... and then lose it all once they see you've gathered enough valuable things to waste C4 on you. As I said before people are unforgiving and will make you pay for your mistakes. The feel of the game reminds me of Fallout 4 while the challenge of a mostly relentless playerbase brings back memories of Dark Souls. It's a psychological thriller on top of being the most challenging frustrating yet rewarding game I've ever played. The interactions of this game are completely unique from any other online/co op and is a strange sort of window into the humanity behind our choices. Reputations matter here.Given that I leave the game running while I'm asleep or out because of the ridiculous load in times on this mac I still played an unhealthy amount of hours in my first 2 weeks. Once you load into 1 server it only takes 30 seconds or so to load into any other so get through the initial load and take the time to find a good server. There are bot servers so you can practice aiming non pvp/raid servers for builders and plenty of hidden gems with friendly enough players whose majority will let you live until you become a force of your own.Even playing on a mac with all its flaws this is the game I've been wanting to play. New favorite.,Rust

2016-04-26,0,0,299,True,Not Recommended,I want to like this game.No actually I want to love this game.Rust has the kind of building simulation I've been waiting for since the emergence of the craft your own world genre. Extensive blueprint systems allow players to collect and piece together amazing things from raw materials and there is just enough scavenging to keep things interesting. Graphically Rust is well beyond several games of this type. It combines with an open style sandbox that can be enjoyed by several players which would ideally form a vibrant active always online community.That is it would were it not for the community.I've seen that some players have compared the general game community to cancer and I wouldn't say it's an unfair comparison. That said I think a more accurate description of the Rust community at large would be to say they're like a case of anal herpes. They're nothing if not a consistent incurable pain in the Upon spending more than a few minutes on any given server new players will notice there are mainly two types of player in this game. The first treats the game like Minecraft happily setting about building magnificent structures and some of them are really fantastic. Skilled builders can really show off the best points of the system creating intricate constructions that really show what an open concept and a creative mind can accomplish.These players are the minority.The other type of player in this game treats everything as a low rent Call of Doody whereupon discovering other players sharing a map they proceed to clip through walls (or just shoot through them as though they were nonexistent) and run about happily defecating all over everything. Nine out of nine servers tested has returned positive for this breed of cancerous anal herpes.Sadly this game breeds that kind of player like inbreeding breeds low IQs.If you have the ability to piece together your own dedicated private server by all means grab this game and mess around with your friends. If you're stuck on public servers well.. just don't get stuck on public servers. You're better off playing other games.,Rust

This game feels like a new game completely.Everything feels so fresh and nice.I learned there are biweekly and monthly wipe servers and boy am I glad for that.I finally figured out a lot of things in the game.No game give such a thrill to go out and get stuff and hope you make it home alive as this one.For me a pleb it's an extreme rush and the battles get super intense and scary when you have things to lose.Base building is a lot easier due to balanced map generators now.There are tiers on the map that seperate players from fresh spawns to geared to the teeth.Sure this ""law"" can be broken by geared end game players simply just building bases in fresh spawn areas but it sure helps.And come on if they chose to do so it will be more like before anyways so what's the difference.I completely get that it's gonna be hard in the beginning and embrace it more as it truly feel like a proud accomplishment getting a base set up.The tiered map make the hotspots a lot easier to get to and away from alive!Good!I have only played on a server for 2 days now with this change and we are already unlocking a lot of weapons and items.The game feels a lot better and it feels a lot more fair.Surely there could be a lot of other issues I haven't played enough to encounter and nobody have really explored these changes fully (maby).But I have my hopes up and I see the game in a whole new light.Sure it will beat you up hard and good but you sorta love to hate that in some weird way.OLD REVIEW Where to begin...There are so many things that are thematically and logically flawed with this current design (2017 11 01)This game is by all means an elitist no life mess. Hear me out.So I will tell you about the biggest issue that many don't seem to understand fully.Servers do wipe weekly (or so ish)This is the only survival game I know that does this. And it's super weird.Sure some people get everything they'll ever need in days.But that means you HAVE to play with a group. Solo isn't an option for normal people. Only hardcore elitists will stand a chance really.You don't want to start playing on a server if it's not freshly wiped. So you can try to get a fair chance and not get gunned down every 30 seconds by people with guns when you just go around wielding a rock.And it create the problem with unless it's freshly wiped you sorta don't want to go on a server.Servers (ALL SERVERS) wipe the same dates for some reason.Meaning if you missed out the chance to start on a fresh server you HAVE to wait until they all wipe.They don't do something clever so that servers wipe in cycles meaning there will always be fresh servers for people who give up on one server.This is beyond .Game map is always way too open and you cannot really get resources to do anything.Sometimes you have to chase your off to find even basic stone.The current blueprint system force you to run towards hotspots on the map. Making large portions of the maps useless and it even further shrink the map in size.These hotspots are camped with gunmen and heavly trafficed and you will be very lucky or unhuman to survive enough runs in and out to collect loot and be able to research blueprints or collect scrap.It's all about scrap farming.If there were more double or more of these hotspots everyone would have a more fair chance of getting to them.And since maps are so open it's even more favored to having a gun. Since sneaking up on people is barely possible or outrunning them due to lack of things to disorient them or hide behind.Getting a base started take tremendous amounts of resources for solo/duo people and really isn't a whole lot of fun.There is no steady progression curve as other survivals have or so.Maby this super frequent wiping will vanish when release happen.It's really . Sure they say you get things too fast but that is the problem to me then make it so that you care every second of the time you play on a server.Make it so that you want to join a server regardless of the time it has been up.At the time of typing it is 1 2 days until the server wipe. People on the server don't care about anything and just run around like stupid.People give away their bases and throw guns everywhere.It's ...Why do even people spend huge amount of time building a base nobody can raid... when it will vanish within days.It make no sense at all.Finding guns is also way too ing hard. And it seems only people who pretty much can camp the hotspots for loot get them.I have made MANY runs to hotspots (monuments) to loot all the crates but the only gun I ever found was a revolver pistol which is still bad against assault rifles which all big clans get within hours.Game ofc has so much potential. But it's just a mess overall. I have no idea why people like it so much.It doesn't maky any sense at all.ARK and Conan are sadly way superior as they are balanced smoother and provide a better experience with loot versus progression.You can still have crazy raids and pvp in those games since in ARK you can move between servers so there is always a bigger clan out there to get you no matter what.In Rust you know if someone is the alpha clan and you can't touch them. Unless you bring friends many friends.Raiding is IMPOSSIBLE in this short time span to gather all those resources and craft rockets and satchel charges to be able to raid is IMPOSSIBLE for solo/duo or low population groups of people.Whilst big clans just do it for the of it since they are bored already having everything in the game.It's a flawed system and the little guy can't compete with anyone. Not even do nifty little things and high risk/reward things and take down the big guys.",Rust

Rust is a survival crafting game and one of money coming out now a days. When I bought this after I first joined steam a year ago I was so happy because starting off with 2 games on steam isn't very fun but this game kept me entertained for days. The graphics are beautiful and keep getting changed and improving. The whole crafting system for building houses is very fun especially with friends. And collecting items like food and cloth to stay alive while facing bears wolves and a bunch of naked men running after you with their waving around and a rock who wouldn't want it D?,Rust

2014-04-04,0,0,1523,True,Not Recommended,People joke about naked men and dongers but fail to properly give an opinion on this game. My opinion is not to get rust YET. I believe if the developers (they ARE competent) continue the way they are then the game will be worth it's salt in half a year minimum. This is NOT because of ingame content. In game content is fine BUT The game is PLAGUED by the ABC's of gaming being missing. Hackers are everywhere you go in Rust this is because anti cheat is either non existant or poorly made SO FAR. The other thing is that the engine running the game IS IN AN ALPHA. No server can currently run more than 30 players for 24 hours without experiencing frame tearing no matter how good your machine is you will fall victim to frames skipping and dying because of it. The plot and essence of the game is AWESOME truly BUT The 2 fallouts (Engine lag and No powerful anti cheat) make this not worth $20 right now. My honest opinion with over 400+ hours in Rust.,Rust

2015-01-27,0,0,465,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a game that I have had some of the best times in my gaming career. In the good old days when rust was still a fresh new game it was very new to me the crafting and base building aspect of the game really took me by surprise of how good it was. I really did have alot of fun playing this game for a couple of days... until... the hackers invaded. Hackers and cheaters really did ruin rust for me.. It is really very sad to see a game fall like this and I hope that later projects by Facepunch Studios will be more protected from hackers and cheaters.,Rust
2014-06-16,0,0,261,True,Recommended,It is buggy and sometimes makes me want to punch a wall. However it is still a really fun and (for me at least) challenging.

2015-03-14,0,0,115,True,Not Recommended,I used to enjoy playing the old version of Rust it looked really promising and did well at evoking a range of emotions I'm talking about genuine fear when you hear someone running around outside or seeing someone peaking through the gaps of your wooden hut whilst your hidden in the opposite corner in almost complete darkness.You can still find these aspects in the game but I don't like the ways it's (d)evolved and is a shadow of what it once was. Graphics look good but instantly the game doesn't feel right.Hackers are a real issue meaning your precious in game mats and weapons are never safe it really puts you off.I will come back to this game in the future it may have improved.,Rust

2015-03-18,0,0,292,True,Recommended,Pumped tons of hours into this game and still enjoy it quite a bit. If you do not like a challenge given by other players then this isn't the game for you. You will die and lose everything often. To some that is appealing so if that is your type of game then this game will suit your game library nicely.,Rust
2015-03-18,0,0,68,True,Recommended,Since 2015 and major updates the community certainly has decreased but the game is impressively emmersive as you struggle to survive against the elements and other players. It's fun. But you NEED other friends to play with for help and support so buy this game simultaneously with another friend.,Rust

2014-02-21,0,0,739,True,Recommended,"Early access Alpha and it is already hauntingly immersive &amp addictive! this game has alot of strongpoints n potential that i am certain the developers will tweak &amp add to as the game progresses.. I would like to see the game progress away from the ""Call of Duty"" FPS direction to the ""Stone age"" on the the balls of your &amp need to craft to survive angle. Developers should add seasons &amp weather wider the range of tools &amp raw weaponry make the powerful military equip avail only by finding such in wrecked military quip abandoned bases etc.. not craftable by players!. As the map fills out with development scatter resources so people in the north will need to seek out the south for example for unique elements. For an Alpha game the lighting &amp ambience is already breathtaking.. I have over 40hrs gameplay logged on rust.. Sure there are s that try to bash your head open with a rock lovely prospect but not a big threat.. The bad i seen was new players weilding stockpiles of C4 (somehow?) just blowing up &amp ruining the structures &amp morale of people trying to play this game right &amp start communities in the game. Other guys running around with M4 machine guns in full body armor slaughtering people who are just gathering resources.. Knucklehead kids that think this game is the new COD Black Ops.. This direction must be steered away from by the develpers now before it goes any furthur.. The game will actually be MORE enjoyable without these godlike goofballs causing chaos unchecked.. Add more animals add an in game map &amp regionalize things in the map ect.. But make the big steer now guys lets see this game as a unique addictive &amp enjoyable survival game not Call of Duty..

My first spawn landed me on the front lawn of my soon to be friends they took me in showed me the ropes and gave me some basic gear. My second day none of them were on so i built my own building in their area. No sooner had I put a door on the hinges than a pair of well armed players started knocking on my door and demanding resources my tiny hut obviously did not contain. I was armed with only a revolver and they were toting automatic weapons and grenades. They eventually hacked down my door and shot me up.Yesterday I was being chased by a guy with a shotgun and i made it to my house told him I had something for him and asked him to stay around. I peeked out from my roof and filled his head with 5.56. I've come full circle.Great game can't wait to see where it goes.

2015-11-02,0,0,192,True,Recommended,"(Updated Review 2016)Still a very good game and my original post from below is still accurate. I do enjoy the addition of the helicopter the new weapons and the added skins are a neat addition as well. Unfortunatly one of the new things I really do not care for is the randomised character attatched to my steam account that is unchangable. I looked in the forums and saw pretty poor responses from Gary on the matter. Its a little upsetting to me that since Rust's creator is unable to see why a certain portion of the community wish to ""play as themselves"" that those people will flat out be ignored. To me its a big deal and playing as a white female is immersion breaking to me as thats not what I am nor how I want to be identified as. Ive never been able to enjoy games any games that force me to be something I am not. The most convienient example being tomb raider. I bought one of those games many years ago and have never bought one since. Its not my thing. When I sit down to play a game it is me on the screen in my mind thats how its always been even before character creation became rediculously in depth. Hopefully it changes at some point but Im not holding my breath as Gary seems to find it liberating to becoming a (fill in randomized characteristics here). Still a good game but enjoy it less than last year due to the above. If one doesnt care about it than its a near flawless survival game.(Original Review 2015)Would highly recommend. Excellent game and my favorite in its class. My only complaint as of now...it's too intense for me. It's hard to sleep after a play session and I need about four hours to wind down. )",Rust
2016-04-26,0,0,100,True,Not Recommended,This game is absolute garbage. I orriginally got this game a few years ago when it was released and I hated it due to me logging in every day and finding that I had to start over. After hearing that there had been a 'big update' and the game had changed a lot i thought id try it again I managed to find a nce quiet server and had fun for like 5 min. Then I died due to walking into a bear trap and bleeding out instantly then I died to a bear who came out of the middle of a solid rock then I died to a wolf after the game froze on me and crashed. I logged in to find I had to start all over again I was miles from where I was and had to spend an hour finding it again.This game ran better on a laptop with integrated graphics than a desktop with a dedicated graphics card. in playing the game for about 6 hours in the past 24 hours i've had 8 crashes 4 logins where I can't even wake up due to some bug 3 instances where I've been playing for about an hour and then It just freezes and I cant move numerous instances of rubber banding and animals disapearing or apearing into or out of rocks or cliffs.I'm so glad that I didnt pay for either of the rust keys my household has I would want my money back if I had paid. This game has been in early dev for 2 or 3 years and it can't even hold a stable connection or keep mobs from glitching out. Let alone the fact that there really isnt much to do after you've made the later game stuff.,Rust

2014-02-23,0,0,193,True,Recommended,Of all the early access games I've purchased recently for being only 10% completed Rust is by far the most playable in its current state. I have not experienced a single framerate drop or a second of lag. There are a ton of reviews complaining about PVP and bandits but if you play smart you can mostly avoid them. Of the half a dozen deaths I've had only one was caused by another player. Yes getting raided is a but this is a survival simulation.. and in the real world that is exactly what would happen. Sometimes you lose a little sometimes you lose everything but you dust yourself off and keep on truckin'. There are over 40 pages of servers surely not all of them are filled with jerks. For the $20 price tag I am quite pleased with this game as it stands.,Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,102,True,Recommended,"It's still very early on as stated officially.The resources are easily contested due to a small relevant map but this will undoubtedly change... sometime.I strongly recommend finding someone or two to collaboratively protect what's yours and theirs. You will learn very quickly the purpose of human society although it is possible to live a quiet life in the mountains (at your inconvenience of acquiring stuff). This game is a learning experience but does what people thought was a stupid/terrible idea a decade ago and if you're a GMod Stranded veteran you'll feel very much at home in this much more dramatic setting.If it has problems one which is intrinsic it is the nature of people who obtain guns. Additionally perhaps notably the terrible placeholder clothing meshes/skins. I guess another crappy part is the lack of incentive to stick around on a server after your gets wrecked or you become the ""prime wrecker"" without any comparable competition. What I mean by this last sentiment is that due to a lack of real permanent character progression you'll find yourself wondering about all those greener pastures on other servers until you migrate again.This game has turned into something much bigger and the crew cannot keep up with the myriad of voices. Stick around and something more phenomenal may emerge. (Also Rust is cheaper than 7 Days to Die.)",Rust

2014-02-23,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Extremely frustrating community is full of not so pleasent people and serve admins ban you for killing them. I would not recommend this game at all. Do not buy it unelss you are a gluten for punishment and like getting mauled by bears and or wolves at every spawn. The bears and wolves are everywhere spawn too often and if they don't kill you then a player will. The wolves are especially bad. They clip underneath the level and attack you relentlessy. When they glitch like that you are a dead man. This happens way too often. You will be killed over and over again. If someone else has a gun and there is a bear charging them they will shoot and kill you first then deal with the bear. you can be completely unarmed and you will be shot and killed no questions. People also get jelly that you are mining their rock so that is also a good way to die. This game is a great social exparment. It really reveals how terrible people are to each other. This game has huge potential but is ruined by the community poor mechanics and hackers/glitches. I know it is an alpha so the glitches aren't so much much of a problem to me. Its the people that abuse them that ruins the game.,Rust

The forums are full of it!Edit Well after a week i thought i gave it another try and whad'ya know )It works!And its pretty awesome!

2014-02-23,0,0,54,True,Recommended,I higly recommend this game. Very fun even for a game that is in early development. Very caring developers always fixing any error that might show up. Must buy.,Rust
2014-02-23,0,0,31,True,Recommended,This game consists of naked men running around hitting rocks with a rock with which you can make bigger rocks and then somehow turn those rocks into a fully automatic assault rifle. And for some reason the developers think that you can adequately protect yourself from a pack of 6 wolves all chasing you at once with a medium sized rock. Here I will sum up my experience with the game I spawn on the map. I run over to the convenient pile of logs stacked naturally on the grass. I hit my rock at it until I get wood. I run over to the big rock and hit it until I get stones and metal. I notice I am running low on health so I try to find an animal to kill. I spend 30 minutes looking for a docile animal having died continuously from being bashed across the head with a rock and being chased and eaten by a pack of wolves who will never stop following you until your flesh has been torn off your body and become an afternoon snack. After several attempts at finding an animal to kill I am finally successful in finding one. As I run over to kill the pig and claim my prize after a long awaited finish a pack of wolves chase me away from the pig and eat me after chasing me for 10 consecutive minutes. After that infuriating experience I am just about to give up when I respawn in front of 10 pigs. I happily slaughter every single one of them ripping every resource from their body as I relish the fact that I finally have cloth and food and can start playing this game. Not 2 minutes after I have killed the pigs a pack of wolves chase me off a cliff resulting in my legs being broken. I thought it was over for me again but suddenly a fully clothed man in kevlar with an assault rifle comes to my rescue and kills the wolves. I felt so relieved and thanked him for saving me. He responded by asking me if I had any cloth. I told him yes and 3 seconds later he switched to his shotgun and blew my head off instantly splattering my brains all over the grass. And to top it all off when I respawned I was greeted by a pack of wolves already hungry again.However I still cannot stop playing this game. Its a good concept but needs some work on the wolves. This may sound like I hate this game but I actually enjoy playing it once I am lucky enough to get past all of the bs this early access game has to offer.,Rust
2014-02-23,0,0,50,True,Recommended,"First Impression ""OMFG...WTF...just....wha!?"" Yep those were my first words after having my door broken down and then shot by an M4. All this after building a small hovel near a radioactive town and working to get some cool gear. At least I thought the shotgun was cool not so much anymore. The game is pretty harsh for new players. Almost any server you decide to work on will have already established players. By that I mean those people who started on the server many moons ago and will grief the out of you just because they're bored. Its frustrating and intense having to rush to get another building up and secured before being wiped out for your resources. Or even worse trapped in what was supposed to be your home but has now turned into your grave. I'd recommed Rust to those people with a good deal of patience or a friend or two willing to battle the established griefers. A bit of a heads up though your character does not save learned blueprints between servers and with a wave of the admin's hand the server can be cleared entirely of buildings.",Rust

2015-04-04,0,0,433,True,Recommended,This is a very nice game one of the best survival i've ever seen.Since it's still an Alpha you can't completely judge this game for what it's made of BUT it has a LOT of potential and the thing i like most is that they keep updating the game every week without break since they are really on this work.Pros Very fascinating environment it really makes you a nude caveman without any hope that must survive. Playing with friends make this game really awesome. It makes you feel like you're inside it like you can feel the emotion of your player when they invade you you are really feared to die and lose all your things (most for the loss of items though). Pretty nice graphics and they keep updating them with the User Interface too that it's getting better and better. Get scared because a nude caveman is chasing you with a spear and you don't know what to do.Cons For Low end PCs it can be hard to play this game even on lowest settings For High end PCs you can't go on Fantastic without some fps drop (R9 270X and a 8 core FX 8320) but hey it's still an alpha and they are getting better on optimization Hackers managed to RULE this game but things are getting better here too.

2016-02-07,0,0,1187,True,Recommended,So I originally had a review up for rust talking about how they need to fix AI and some other minor complaints but now they are fixed so now I want to write an updated review and talk about what they have changed from my last review. Rust is a game where people will do anything and everything to get themselves higher in the server status. They will backstab and kill you without hesitation. I have met some very nice people on this game but I have also encountered lots of people who only care about themselves and their own survival. What I have learned out of my 1 100 ish hours in Rust is that if you want to get anywhere the easiest way to do it is to kill everyone that you think you have a chance at killing. Sometimes you have to use your mic and act like you are friendly then when they turn their back *WHAM* they are dead and you have more loot. If you choose NOT to play this way then good luck you are in for a crazy grind. Most of the time in rust you will be looking for supplies and have goals like 1 Get a weapon2 Gather Materials3 Put Down a Base4 Secure the BaseEtc...Rust was probably one of the most intense games I have ever gotten into and I don't regret it at all. If you choose to buy this game watch your back.,Rust

2014-03-10,0,0,1492,True,Recommended,Addicting alpha game that should be amazing when (or if) the devs can finish it. The possibilites are endless in this sandbox survivalist PvP minecraft hybrid. Getting on a good server is key to having a good time. As of 03.10.14 servers (perhaps too many) are rented at cost and then administrated with different rules and conditions. It is possible to get a server where the admin abuses the system (gives themselves mass loot teleports unwilling players etc) or a server where the admin is never on. Look for 'No admin abuse' and 'active admin'. Some servers are more pvp and others are more minecraft. Some have low populations to no players and others are swimming with crazy. Some are riddled with hackers and such. Pick the one that suits your playstyle and don't let the server color your impressions of this game but look at it for what it is now in its early stages and what it could become.The game has gone through continuous change over the past 2017 year as the developers try to find a long term solution for its short comings. Game is still strongly supported and updated weekly. One has not truly games until they've tried to survive in RUST.,Rust

2017-11-22,0,0,453,True,Recommended,One of the few survival games that gets updated weekly. It still has its ups and downs but I still come back to it week after week,Rust
2015-05-29,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,Ok so I have played this game for a long period of time I played the legacy version and the new version and I have to say that I can NOT reccomend this game in it's current form. The idea of rust is a well used one but rust does it well my problem lies in the optimization. In a game that is BUILT arround fighting other people when most people are running at 12fps (thats what I run at) and then come up against someone running at 60fps it is not fair AT ALL to the person running at 12. This would be fine if you could actually use the graphics options to help but those don't even work. If your run the game with the grass quality at 0 it will be SLOWER then if the grass quality is at 100. Those graphics options don't work for Sh*t and it just makes the game not worth playing when you can spend hours beefing up your character just to be smashed to death by a guy with a rock because he has a better computer than you. Also my computer is not one of the best but deffinaitly not one of the worst seeing as though I can run GTA V on medium quality so it falls down to THIS GAME IS NOT OPTOMIZED. When the game can actually run at an acceptible speed I will be coming back to it but untill then I cannot reccomend people buy this laggy POS. However when the game gets fixed I would deffinaitly reccomend it.,Rust

2015-05-28,0,0,259,True,Not Recommended,If WWIII ever happens this game probably contributed a great deal to it. i'm pretty shure GOOGLE/NSA is using it to track and identify the future rotten apples in our society. Think perverts freaks racists and other mentally ill people. srsly this game brings out the worst of the worst in people and also attracts the worst of the worst people. Not even speaking of russian hackers 12y old heroes and other scum. If i had to write a PhD in psychology or sociology i didn't had to look any further. Originally a great game mechanic mostly suffering from recirculating alpha state. good example ladders. instead of introducing new elements in a balanced way ie add anti ladder mechanics at the same time no just throw in a new element and let anarchy decide the outcome. And that is basically what the game mechanism is about exploiting anarchy paranoia false sense of safety correlated to (anti )social behaviour etc... or in 12y old speak Unless you have a group of 20 friends you and your three buddies are screwed before you even start to use that stupid rock. Oh and please please don't try to play this game alone like i tried for a while it is plain mental suicide.I can go on for hours but don't want to spend any more words on it. I deeply hope the developers donate my 20 bucks to mental health chairity or community service because i'm pretty shure the next nazi leader can be found amongst one of those scumbag players. and i think it won't be that funny if one of his friends point a real AK 47 at your head...,Rust

2017-01-21,0,0,230,True,Not Recommended,Rust is one of my favorite games but man it has its issues. This game is so unbalanced that its nearly impossible to play solo on a vanilla server and if you dont start on wipe day you're screwed. You could build a giant base with 20 airlocks to the lootroom but with the twig update a few c4 can completely screw you over. The community is horendous. Its nearly impossible to befriend anyone since the majority of the playerbase are backstabbing 12 year olds. I would recommend this game ONLY if you play on modded servers. With the current state of the game vanilla servers are practiacally unplayable on vanilla.,Rust
2016-08-08,0,0,513,True,Recommended,First off I personally really enjoy this game. Despite the fact of its alpha state it has been one of my most played games on steam for a while now. Whether I'm proud of that fact or not it shows that I came back for more multiple times which is generally a good thing.To anyone who has played this game they know that in terms of gameplay this game can be extremely aggravating. The game always follows the concept of constantly gaining and losing loot over and over again whatever the circumstance may be. There are many moments in the game where you could be ahead one day but then you wake up the next morning to nothin but a raided base or you die again and again by one large group both of which make the game very rage inducing. From my perspective the game is all about decision making when to raid when to move base when to de spawn all of your loot because they are blowing your door down when to make the right move. The game is very unpredictable at times. However with all that said when you are on the upside of things and are raiding and/or on a hunting party or something it can be really fun.The game s graphics are pretty good. Its been in alpha for a while now but has received a lot of updates one every Thursday I believe. I m curious what final product they have in stock for us all who knows what it will be.Some Tips 1. Playing with friends in a group is probably your best bet at getting anywhere going solo can be pretty dang hard.2. Don't trust anyone who is not in your group especially nakeds.3. There are always scheduled wipes for each server usually around 1 2 week(s) where everything gets deleted and you start over and it will probably always be that way.4. With #3 in mind remember it's a video game and solely that don't allow it to overcome your life. That may sound silly but it can be one of those games that make you pull all nighters every night.,Rust

2014-02-08,0,0,138,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game and it is the only game that I cant tear my eyes away from. I still cant believe that it is only around 10% done and it is already in early alpha. Most early alpha games are around 60 to 70% done. I think Rust is one of the only games that gives you a sence of loss but also a sence of true accompishment. There are a few hackers but as long as you have a bed or sleeping bag you can respawn at your base in no time. Some advice I have is to not bring your good stuff to resource valley or anywhere away from your home because there are alot of snipers and bandits. Something I would like to see would be scopes and some way of trasportation a bigger map and more wildlife.Great game but can be a little annoying to get started off in.,Rust

One you build your base up and protect your property you can go out and be the one raiding and giving the demands instead of taking them. Plus the games in Alpha right now so there's plently more to come and everyday they're adding new items and updates. Highly reccomended!,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,883,True,Recommended,I will state what is lacking while other aspects are adequate to great. Multiplayer This game will be great when it achieves MMO status. Meaning there are not thousands of server supporting 50 players each but 50 servers supporting thousands (perhaps hundreds is acceptable too) of players. Combat This is a high stakes game winning fights is very important. For now movement gun battles and melee in PVP feel unnatural. This needs some polish.That is all for now.,Rust

2015-02-21,0,0,36,True,Recommended,Game is awesome hosting 2 servers been playing since first version. Rust experimental screwed it up with the server browser it sucks it looks like a special kid made it. I can't direct connect unless I open the console not everyone knows how. I can't see more than 1 page of servers...so where's the 900 left? Seriously IMO this is an important aspect of the game and should already be fixed.Overall I recommend this game to EVERYONE but the server browser at the moment is just useless and incomplete.PS They asked to tell them why they're bad at their jobs.,Rust
2015-02-21,0,0,122,True,Recommended,Rust is a game where trust is very crucial but not much trust is there. You need to keep your eyes open be aware of what is around you and either hide from it or you use it to your advantage. You also need to beware of the players that may sabotage you like destroy your house and ruin your success. You can never rest in Rust you can never stop relaxing because anything is around you and you cannot miss it. For which is why I like the gameA great game in early development.7/10ConsMeat can be scarce and hard to get and when you can get it. you get murdered...,Rust

2015-02-21,0,0,325,True,Recommended,Played Rust in the early days of its legacy alpha and then and then they came out with experimental. First iffy on the new 2.0 but gave the developers some time to work on it some more and its turned out to be a fantastic game. Theres just something about running around and finding a tribe of naked people with rocks that you just cant find with any other game. Beautiful UI and graphics. Only CON is a slight lag issue and frame drops but its expected and I KNOW the developers will fix it. If you enjoy a sandbox with an amazing building system and player interactions then I would highly reccomend this game to you.

They also cant fix the hackers because the unity four engine is old and easily hacked while unity 5 the latest version is not so much.The only bad reviews towards the expiremental is that its buggy. First of all ITS ALPHA. second of all legacy has just as many bugs and issues like the terrible building system in legacy all beit more satisfying.,Rust

2014-02-10,0,0,78,True,Not Recommended,The name of the game should be changed to GRIEF. The only ones who get ahead are those who run around killing other players and looting everyone else's belongings. Even a single griefer on the server can ruin the game for everyone else. I tried for hours to get a simple shack built only to be repeatedly killed by the same tool with advanced weapons over and over again. There are no safe zones so forget hiding in your shack or running away. You're on a timer to get food or you die quickly. So the only option for casual players is to die by starvation or die by getting a bullet in the head from someone you can't even see. Want to set up a clan or a village? Forget it. If you manage to overcome the massive paranoia this game instills and form an alliance with someone you still have to constantly watch them because hey they get close to you and wait until you have tons of stuff before they shoot you in the back. This isn't just my experience on one server either it's several. TBH the only time this game was any fun was when I was the ONLY ONE ON THE SERVER! Until this game develops some safeguards for friendly players it will be DOA. Sad because it's got potential otherwise.,Rust

2014-02-10,0,0,132,True,Recommended,"Review of GameThis is an amazing game after the first few moments of uncertain spawns frustrating deaths at the hands of either players or aggresive wolves/bears and heckling by more experienced players I really started getting the hang of it.Its an addictive game I played it for 24.7 hours in the last 3 days alone. For anyone looking for a survival simulator its a game you should try.In my opinion it is better than its obvious competitor (DayZ) in scope. You don't just scavenge you farm and hunt. Whereas in DayZ it is purely scavenging with the constant pressure to avoid zombies and other (hostile) players. Most of my time in DayZ I die from wounds or hunger as there simply isn't much to scavenge. In Rust however as the scavenging is but one aspect of the game you will find it easier to survive and progress in the game. As compared to constantly dying. Also you are able to build structures to help defend you and your loot. In DayZ all your loot is on your character when you die you more or less lose it as the spawns can be hours from your point of death. The weapon system however is much more sophisticated in DayZ. Note to Devs The developers should really roll out updates in a higher frequencies as after you reach a point you get bored of the constant farming and hunting and building and scavenging. It becomes a routine. Guide for New Players1. You start off with a rock. Its a slow cumbersome tool. You'll want to chop trees or wood piles for wood (Wood piles give 7 per ""chop"" whereas trees give 1 per chop go for the pile)2. Once you have a sizeable amount of wood go for the rocks to gather stones.3. Build a stone hatchet as soon as you can it will improve your farming abilities drastically. 4. Get more wood build a wooden shelter and a wooden door. Close the door whenever you leave the shelter.5. By this time your hunger should be going up. Hunt animals (Chicken Rabbit Boars and Deer avoid Bears and Wolves) by crouching and sneaking up to them then hitting them with your hatchet. 6. Make a campfire with some wood place it in the middle of your shelter cook meat by ""using"" the campfire and ""opening"" it to place your raw meat in the fire. Check back in approximately a min to retrieve cooked meat. 7. Use cloth another by product of the animals you farmed to make a hunting bow. Collect stones &amp wood to make arrows. This is THE most useful and efficient hunting weapon you will find (for now?) 8. Collect more wood and stones build a couple of wood foundations pillars walls doorways stairs windows and ceilings. Find a good spot preferably near a radiation zone village (for scavenging purposes) but hidden from plain sight. (Around some huge mountainous rocks) 9. Set up main base in your new wooden structure. At this point till further updates are released this is it. You've beaten the survival part of the game. From here on forth your goal is to gather materials weapons and supplies ( latter 2 from the radiation zones) in anticipation of the updates. Hope it helps. Rash",Rust

2014-05-25,0,0,87,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a great game if it was done right now (no longer Alpha) it would still be great. I won't play it anymore because of the hackers on every server. That's right every server. Whenever you are doing well and have built your camp someone comes along with AimBot and destroys you threw a wall and takes all your items. It makes no sense to play because this always will happen. A great (maybe the best) survival game ruined by cheaters.,Rust

2014-06-29,0,0,388,True,Not Recommended,Game is unfinished. I had a lot of fun when I first began playing made a lot of new friends and enemies. The hackers in the game really ruin the immersion and it takes away the whole point of them game which is to survive. In the end you will be shot from 400m in the head through a wall or you will have a person walk through your wall and take your stuff. I'm more into competitive games where everyone is on a fair playing field. If they managed to stop the hackers fix the bugs and and actually throw out some updates every couple of months Id start playing again. They can use all the excuses they want about the updates but I have other games like 7 days to die and they are throwing updates out every week without a problem. One more thing to add I was actually kicked from a server for apparent hacking. This is the excuse the developer gave everyone that this happened to yet there was no permanent ban. It was just a big cover up to his failure. If this game sells for maybe $2 5 you should buy it. Other than that it's not worth the bother and frustration.,Rust

2014-02-11,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,"Love the game. ING CAN'T STAND THE AWFUL PLAYER BASE. This game is completely filled to the brim with pk'ing s! You can't even go on a ""friendly"" server without having some annoying chase you with a hatchet until you get sick of it and sign out. The major thing this game is missing is a reason to cooperate with other players. If some kind of system were to be implemented that gave players certain bonuses for creating a clan/small community within the server this would be a 10/10 game. Until then the most this game has to offer is being chased around by ignorant immature that have already been on the server a few hours longer than you have. Once again if these problems were to be fixed I don't think I would have a single bad thing to say about this game.",Rust
2014-02-11,0,0,555,True,Recommended,First of all let s get it straight rust is a tough game to start out with. But just like all games you need to get used to the game. How to survive is really key in having fun in rust. One of the key of survival is talking to other players. If you don t have a mic when you buy this game you re going to die a lot. It s easier to defend yourself with communication than it is with a rock. I ve met some real nice players and they have become my friends through the whole game. At one time I was a governor of a small town. This game is really great and it s only in alpha. Great job done to the devs. taco kyle,Rust

2014-02-11,0,0,332,True,Recommended,great game. eventhought 90% of the online community is hackers/trollers don't let that get in the way. lately the hackers have gone way down and as for the trollers i would recomend playing on a PVE server first to get the feel. then you can just mow them down with your own guns. im not saying to join them and also just kill anyone on sight but if you watch the chat and their movements it's usually pretty obveous who is and isn't going to kill you. Infact now you die more from people just scared that you're going to kill them than just killing you 'cus they can. all in all this is already a great game but remember this is an ALPHA not even beta so most of what they have planned hasn't been added yet. on their trello (https //trello.com/b/lG8jtz6v/rust) they have had several things finished that aren't in the game yet such as hellecopters and my friend said online a hacker or server owner spawned a fully functioning car so hopefull that isn't far off. i would suggest watching some videos and if you don't like what you see then wait a month of two and check it out again,Rust

2014-03-07,0,0,47,True,Recommended,"Imagine thisYou awake alone in a forest. You are naked and armed only with a rock and basic survival knowledge. In the distance you hear a man singing near some shack. As you wander around you encounter many rundown buildings some with remaining loot. Suddenly you are attacked by a naked man with a rock screaming wildly. You try to give him chance to surrender but he knows that he has nothing to lose. After a deep breath and some applied pressure the naked man is dead. With all his sounds you did not hear the wolf approaching and now you have a hole in your side and a hungry canine chasing you. Further down in a canyon you spot a well managed structure so you run in and block the door. You find some supplies not much but enough for a home of your own. You managed to survive the following weeks by hiding in the mountains only coming down to get supplies. You have built yourself a shack here a tiny hut that by all standards is a piece of crap but hey that is your home. You return one night from a day of hunting and gathering to rest in your little shack and cook up some chicken. Suddenly you hear something quite unusual the sound of rapid construction outside your door. You open it to find a entire room blocking access to the outside world. You try to bust down the walls but they are built to last. You have a shimmer of hope as you hear a singular voice from outside the walls calling to you in a friendly manner... but then they start singing... ""Oh! Mr. Shack Man!!!! I have trapped you and we will be together forever! OH!!! Mr. Shack Man! you will slowely starve and I will wait out here!""... the singing never stops... and for 2 hours the crazed singing man circled the shack... banging on the walls with a rock... taunting you with his freedom... so finally you make a decision... you are not going to let him have his fun... you take one last look around at the shack that had been home so long... and you commit suicide...You awake in the middle of a forest... naked... armed with a rock and basic survival knowledge... in the distance you hear a man sing love songs to a shack... and a wolf closes in for a meal",Rust

Then I wanderd around an a bear ate me. Then I watched a youtube video and learned I needed to make a fort. So I hacked a million clicks at all the trees I could find to get some wood and died of starvation. I finally figured it out and build an amazing fort on top of a mountian made shotguns MP5's and Kevlar. Then the next day when I went to play my house was raided. This time I made a raid proof house 10 storeies tall an aditional 20 stories up for a supply room and it was perfect I never got raided. Then I went out of town for a weekend. When I cam back I woke up 30 floors up with no walls no stairs and no supplies. I fell 300 feet to my death. Without stuff.

While the graphics/textures are acceptable for a small developer game and I can run the game at a high FPS the FPS randomly drops for no reason at all. Lowering the graphics settings did nothing to alleviate this.Beyond the over arching technical issues unless you have some friends that can help you out right from the beginning you'll be in an annoying grind craft explore grind grind die tempo in all your playthroughs. I guess it depends on your pain tolerance do you want to have everything you accomplish get wiped every hour by roving goon squads with automatic weapons?Also I've been in gaming long enough to have no respect for the early access trend this game has followed. Finish the game and maybe I would have found it acceptable to waste $20 on this masochistic experience developers. Two years later and this game is still in ""very early development"".

2017-12-21,0,0,1617,True,Recommended,This game will require a lot of hours in order to be any good at it unless you are just a natural born gamer that can pick any game up. Also one thing with this game is that it will require a fairly high end pc to run it on any amount of good settings. With all the hours I have put into this game I would say that it would be best for starters to begin on modded servers to get a feel for it since this game has a very toxic community that will kill you on sight even if you just spawned in naked.

In my opinion its the best survival game out there people say 7 days 2 die is the best I think not.The in game player community is one of the most interesting and this being my first survival game it was interesting to see how my play style evolved over time. * first I was kiled by all most everyone I saw exept the view kind people i met* then when i became good at the game i was friednly but then people started lieying about being frendly * so then if they were armed and looked suppspisous i kill or avoided them* then i started killing noobs and fresh spawn for funin short i became the thing i hated which just to show over time you become the monsterThis game is amazing Pros * Good sized map* lots of serves with the right amount of players* great building (now with triangles)* lots of was to raid e.g. nads rockets and c4* loting barels and rad town is fun* decent crafting * for the most part good graphics* not many glitchs * combat is intense and fun (there is some much a state espesaly if your the one being raided)* updates that actully add to the game e.g. the most recent one added farming and mining * and signs to draw on* your character looks bads with cloth amour/cloths* Large varity of weapons e.g. blot acction machin gun bow sspear pistal pipe shot guns ect.* various types of ammo for each weapon e.g. HV arrow arrow HV rocket rocket * differing envirenment e.g. snow desert beach and woods* upgrading structures is easyCons *big exploits that need to be patched e.g. you can have 30 sleeping bag and the spawn cool down is only per sleeping bag you can set your spawn out side rad town to travel there with ease (most of these are opsaleat when you play in vanila)* not to many survival aspects the only thing you have to worry about is the cold heat and hunger * not many dangerous A.I* you can't ride horses * you can't through the spear* building black can be used as a trolling tool* not really any tips to help you so you will die a few time before you get the hang of it* you can't modify your weapons like you could in the old engine e.g. silencer laser flash light and red dot scope.over all the game is worth it i payed $25 and have got 250 hour of play time and fun witch $1 pre 10 hours great value for money and you can still play the old engine if you want though I'm sad to say now has more hackers then ever before.,Rust

Poor optimization leading to poor fps on a good pc Graphics are mediocre Game is clunky Over pricedThe game was very solid before in the legacy build which is what I paid $20 for and did not regret.

I went through intensive training jumping over wood and swimming across the ocean. My final test was to stand infront of him and crouch towards his body.'Nuff said. 10/10 would ""train"" again. Seriously though the game is pretty fun. Gathering resources and building a house is satisfying but you will be constantly worrying about guys with ak's who will kill you. It is extremely rough if you're going to play solo gathering resources isn't a problem. Older players or large groups will most likely kill you once you reach the point that you're going to build a house. Just recently I've found a friend whom I could trust and we built a house together that was the longest a base I created had ever survived. Majority of players have to play at low settings to get a decent amount of fps in the game (20 30). Unless you have an expensive PC and want to go in gunfights without your fps dropping to 10 you might want to rethink about buying this game. Overall the only problem about this game are the player's behaviors other than that multiplayer is fun.",Rust

This game is slowly and surely heading in a very good direction. I have gotten more than my money's worth out of it. It has been a worthwhile ride.Be forewarned playing solo is not for the faint of heart. I personally enjoy hiding and avoiding people as long as possible.

It's pure PvP. Where you can progress far only to lose it all. Which I don't mind but it gets boring fast because of it. Monsters aren't difficult at all so there's not much PvE to do. And if you join a 100 server and be prepared to just rock people constantly. Like I said it's fun for a bit but not a game worth its price. Perhaps in future updates the game will have enough content to keep me and all my friends playing BUT just like DayZ and they made the mistake of releasing the game for alpha too early. If they don't have enough hands to build or progress the game quickly then they should have waited to release it when they had more content. And this has already been out 8 months with not much changed. Sorry Rust but by the time you and DayZ fix the game and there will be games already out that we all will leave to. 7 days to Die and H1Z1 already look more promising of the 8 months of rust already being released just for quick money.Now it's not like I played for the first week it was released and complained I actually waited to see if it grew and frankly they are taking too long for 20 bucks.,Rust

2015-06-20,0,0,304,True,Recommended,Rust is both the best and worst game ever all at the same time. It provides you with a capable building platform similar to minecraft and a beautiful world to survive in and a huge community of players. While these things are great they also are the downside to themselves. The building mechanics are decent but not varied enough and limited for building components. There isn't much else to do but build simple structures and craft. While there is huge community of players many of them are not friendly even if they say they are and many of them are going to immediately kill you. That's just how it is. I have also watched players completely quit rust and never play again because of it. You work at your structure for hours and loose everything cause you log off and aren't there to defend it. All of that put aside. I still really really enjoy Rust. Even when I spend 20 hrs mining resources to have someone raid it and take it all away from me. Why would I enjoy this you say? Because that's how life is. You work really hard for things and struggle to make friends and trust people. Even when you do make friends and are all working to gether it can still be hard and you have to work and fight for eveything you have. Then sometimes maybe even several times you will lose a lot. Maybe even everything. But that's how life just works. Then when you log off you have to go to work and school and basically do the exact same thing. And in the end things don't always work out as planned or you have to lose out on some things. Which is why I will never hate Rust even though it can very greatly frustrate me. Because of how it just so very closely mimics the real world. A very blood thirsty and impulsive world. What does all this mean for you as the player looking to buy this reading this review? It means you should really only buy this game if you are ready to struggle tooth and nail for every scrap of material you have and then possible loose it. You can make friends but it will be equally as hard. The best thing to think about when purchasing this is 'Will you be able to make the game enjoyable for yourself if you get it?' Because that's what this game relies upon is how you can make it fun for yourself while struggling against overwhelming odds.Really think about it cause it will be a waste to spend $20 get mad never play again. Alot of people play for ten minutes post a review that says naked hits rocks. 10 10. It's sounds fun and funny and great. Then you play and you realize that it's not all fun in games. You will have to dedicate some time to this when you want to play. When you're not playing you have to realize that everything you have is at jeopardy. When you take a break from the game for any amount of time days weeks etc. You will have to be willing to most likely give up all your work and start over because as the days go by all of your creations are exposed and at risk. People will try and raid them and sometimes they will succeed. The longer you wait to play again the higher the chance of a raid on your stuff.One thing you also really have to realize is this game is not updated very often since he is working on another much larger ip.All that being said. I would totally give this game a 9 10. I really do enjoy it even when it's rough. I would recommend it to anyone who is willing and patient enough to play.,Rust

2014-03-05,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Note first that this is definitely an Early Access game not many features exist in it and what features do exist are clunky and buggy as all of Hell. Plus the devs aren't completely sure which direction they want to go with it.That being said what's here is good. It's a solid Minecraft/DayZ combination that trades off some gunplay for some basic (at the moment) building mechanics. I hope that the devs keep going down that route but we'll see.I recommend this game to those who are willing to pay for an Early Access game very early in development. I absolutely do NOT recommend it to those who want a stable and feature complete game.,Rust

2014-02-13,0,0,86,True,Recommended,Pretty good so far.I'm liking this game so far and i'm eager to see where it goes in the future. MUCH more addicting than i originally thought it would be. if you're looking for criticism then i would say that it's much more fun if you have friends with you alone the game can feel lonely and boring (and frustrating) at times . also personally the game does not have that minecraft feel of forever expanding you house or building random stuff because crafting is limited and you want to keep yourself hidden from other players who might be out raiding. So once your house is complete and you got resources for days theres not much to do unless you want to start raiding. The game isssss still in Alpha so its hard to nitpick when so many things will be changed in the future.I do recommend this game to the people who're looking for a fun survival game that can be played with friends.if i had to rate this game from 1 10 i would give it a solid 7/10.and again it's still in Alpha so expect glitches and bugs and stuff,Rust

2015-12-26,0,0,284,True,Recommended,Rust... where do I even begin? I used to hate this game because I would spawn with a rock run around craft a bow and die by some guy with an AK 47. I see a lot of people get into this situation where they cannot even build a base. However that is almost what this game is about. When one starts to play rust they must know what they are getting into. There are hundreds of whiny 12 year old mic spamers that will make you wish you were deaf. There are random wolves that will eat you when you are almost done with your base. It is a SURVIVAL game. Not survival like DayZ or H1Z1 where you simply have to get lucky and find an OP gun. Rust you have to go about strategically hiding in bushes as a genocidal helicopter flies overhead building a small base that you hope no one sees so that you might make it to the end of the server wipe. All in all Rust is not for the faint of heart. You must be patient wise and do your research. You get out of this game what you put in. If you take it as a die hard survival game that's the sort of experience you will have. If you want to be a high powered clan that dominates the server you have to work for it. If you want to take this game lightly and just to have some fun you will have some of the funniest experiences in gaming ever. But everything considered buy this game. You will not regret it.,Rust

So far I can't see how to report this bug but I'll keep poking around in here. The bug is that I always have to click below and to the right of all clickable items in the game like buttons inventory items etc. So I can work around it but it is pretty annoying. I hope you will expand the *crafting* and *building* aspects of the game. Millions of MineCraft builders should give you a hint that this is much much more important than PVP to a huge segment of customers (including me). Especially I am hoping for the ability to construct *active* elements in the game (like the many kinds of machines one can build in MineCraft).

Got stuck between some rocks had to wait until my hunger and then health went all the way down until I could die and get out took about 20 minutes. The game has a ""Sleeper"" system which basically means that whenever you log off your body falls to the ground asleep and you then get robbed and killed when you are away so if you want to progress you can't log off. Early shelters are easily broken into so all your progress can and will be reset if you aren't willing to sink 4 hours of just farming materials when you start up to get a decent house. Unfortunately even higher quality homes are easily broken into due to the easy availability of C4. Expect to lose everything and have to restart often it's fun for a bit then it just gets old. Game encourages bullying of newer players expect to be shot by more experience players for fun regularly. Players are actively malicious and often attempt to trap you in cells so that you can only get out by starving and wasting 20 minutes of your time. Horrible playerbase poorly thought out mechanics.

In Rust you can pvp against other players/teams that could be a clan war you can raid other people and get all their stuff and destroy their base so your clan can be the best on the server!I think that the community on Rust is awesome there is a lot of kind ppl but theres ofc also some really mean ppl no matter what game your playing there will allways be atleast 1 mean person.New you just startet on a Rust server you wont have that much but then you can go arround break some barrels near the roads so you can find stuff called ''***** Blueprint'' these blueprint items makes you better because you can study them and then you can make them yourself which is freaking awesome!!There is different kind of servers there is the Official servers which is the normal Rust servers where you start completely new there is community servers which mean and there is the modded servers i love the modded servers on the modded servers you will ofc start completely new but on some of the modded servers there can be kits (/kit) which can give you an amazing start all the servers will/can wipe which means they will be resat so every house thats build will dissapear BUT your blueprints wont dissapear!!But ofc there is also a few bugs in Rust but they wont kill you etc just ignore them and you'll be fine!! &lt 3I hope you'll give Rust a chance!Remember this game if funniest with your friends BUT can also be funny alone because you can find ppl ingame and talk to them (you can use mic ingame).

2017-10-14,0,0,83,True,Recommended,Rust is a game that I keep coming back to. The developers are still actively working on the game and changing things mostly for the better. It's interesting to see every week what changes they're bringing to the game. This game is definitely more fun if you have a group of friends to play with but if you get on a less populated server I've definitely had a lot of fun playing solo and trying to survive against the other generally small groups of players. Not every experience is going to be good though if you're unprepared it can be daunting and downright depressing getting killed almost as soon as you spawn but once you get a foothold it can be a lot of fun. I've absolutely gotten my money's worth from this game and enjoyed both the good times and the bad times.,Rust

I rate it a 8/10 its still has some bugs that need to be fixed but otherwize its great.If/when you get this game play on modded server they are better for building better bases and finding your friends.,Rust

2014-03-06,0,0,67,True,Not Recommended,Best way to describe Rust? with guns. I had a choice between Day Z and Rust. I chose rust due to the building concept. I regret my purchase and will be going with Day Z instead. Atleast that game has more polish. Rust is so full of hackers and aim botters the community is complete trash. The building concept is not even that good. The game is sluggish and tiresome as if it's a struggle just to get through the atrociously lag infested drag down on the system and I have a high end rig.Everything you want to find in Rust you can do in Day Z and after watching one Video clip of it it was easy to see where Rust Lacks. Garry should of stuck with just Garrys Mod the graphics and programing of this game is so bad it's beyond a joke. Yeah the trash community will say. Oh it's only early stages. Oh you just died. Dude people die in Day Z all the time but it's a hell of alot better game then even this trash of an excuse for a 'new and upbeat game'.And just for your information this game concept of crafting in a post apocolyptic setting is nothing new Fallen Earth was doing it way better and way before it was even an Idea in Garrys head (plaugerize much Garry?). A offset and mix of Minecraft and Day Z? My Fallen Earth does this WAY better and that game has Dune Buggies. (Now no doubt garry will go look at that game add it's features and go OH new concept! plaugerize.) Disgusted.Stay away from this game it's so sluggish and trashy when it comes to community and game mechanics programming and graphics stick with Day Z for the extra $ there's a reason it's worth more or try Fallen Earth which is free to play. (FA has a few querks but better by truck loads in Graphics and Game depth then this Rust tripe).All in all NOT recommended at all. Even the developer aka Garry has more of a priority in fixing the sky graphics then dealing with aimbotters or hackers and the self made anti hacker hardly works. Did I mention Abusive Admins who abuse their power by banning people who kill them?All'in'allTrash Game Trash Community. Don't make the same mistake I did save your purchase.,Rust

2015-07-07,0,0,173,True,Recommended,rust. rustis a VERY decent survival/multiplayer game. but on most servers there are alot of flaws. for instance on a modded server the player with the most friends wins. hands down. if you play alone and get a decent base with defences. then raids are blood pumping battles which is good but you will fall to the more popular groups. and when you get raided it just makes you lose all hope for playing on that server again.,Rust

It feels more like a survival now instead of getting military grade weapons within a few hours of playing. of course it has its flaws but its still an amazing game and one of my favorite survival games. I recently found rust's trello page and was amazed by every idea they have almos every idea i had and wanted in the game is on there.

2015-07-06,0,0,118,True,Not Recommended,This game is just pure frustration wherever I connect I get raided or shot at for no reason even if I have nothing on me. Me and my friend finally found a decent server and settled in we thought it would be peaceful. We started making our base and looted radtowns for resources and we finally had a nice base that was fully armoured but we left for 5 seconds and came back to see everything looted. We re did everything and again started off from scratch just now we finished off the house and added 3 layers of armoured walls but we left for 2 seconds and we got raided by 5 people (These people had everything so I don't know why the hell they raided us.) they murdered me and my friend but we tried defending it eventhough we didn't have any armour or weapons on us they slaughtered us and this happens on every server. Every single one of them. The game itself is good it's the people that ruin it.,Rust

2017-12-09,0,0,88,True,Recommended,This game is alright but you should not pay the full price of $20. I would rate the game 7/10 because it is a hard time getting started as a noob or a good player. The system that you build and craft is too difficult and requires large amounts of scrap and other materials. I played for a while now and some tip would be not to play on the official servers unless you are good at the game. The people in high population servers kill you on sight even if you have nothing. Great game but needs work and a better community. At this point it is your choice if you want to buy the game just remenber the return policy.,Rust

For example I was building a 1x1 when a clan of 4 come in from N S E W or front right left back all in a effort to kill a person with cloth pants and stone tools.

If you like working for hours to be murdered robbed even when you have logged out then this game is for you.. They took out the zombies which was fun killing and looking out for. Radiation is cool makes you have to hurry. But the Pvp Ruins the Game. Your things and work is worth nothing... the moment you log out do not exspect anything to be there when you log back in.

While this game is still in the early stages it plays and feels like a finished game. I can't wait to see what the dev team has in store.

AND JACK PEOPLE (full looting)... goes both ways tho. I had fun making traps.Guess depends on the server since so many have different rules think fast resource servers are better because you dont have to waste so much time to get started. Too fast is not good tho.I had fun playing it but I dont think many will... you need to get into a group of players. Late night raiders take out bases when their is nooone there to defend. Needs the ability to have party/group colors/names because lots of friendly fire potential. BUT it allows solo players to match colors with the groups to jump them!,Rust

2015-07-10,0,0,288,True,Recommended,You know those games that you talk to your friends about? The ones that strike that extreme addiction level from the get go? The ones where you hastily go and check the dev site for more updates just jonesing for more? One of those games where time just seems to slip through your fingers?This is one of those games.I sunk over 100 hours into this game in maybe 3 weeks. This game will break you and suck away your soul. BUT you will love every minute of it. Don't listen to the players that say the game isn't fun solo. Be creative! Hunt those other sick bastards on your server and steal their belongings. Be a nomad. Playing with a group will ensure some dominance but you have to be careful who you bring in. That should say enough.I've also gotten some major adrenaline rushes from both raids and raid defense. Things get tense. And when things get tense things get awesome. This game nails that on the head.But then you have to tell yourself... It's just a game. Right?

2015-07-10,0,0,626,True,Recommended,I really enjoy the game. There is just one problem The servers are ran by players. Each server is ran by a person that also happens to play on that server.......Every server that I have joined there has been a cheater server admin. It is really quite ridiculous as the premise of the game is to hide and build supplies and a house yet the admin knows excactly where you are at all times and has complete control over you......So there are two options befriend the server admin and become a cheater like him/her or join an empty server and play by yourself. That is it.This does essentially ruin the game BUT....I still think it is worth the asking price as you can still have hours of good times....that is until the admin decides he doesn't like you or you begin to stock items and materials that he wants. They will be taken and your house will be destroyed.,Rust

2016-11-28,0,0,1035,True,Not Recommended,This game used to be amazing ever since the blueprint system got canned and Andre and Maurino started working as Devs at Facepunch everything just started going downhill. It is pointless update week after week.Pros Intense PVPCons Terrible AI Servers filled with children. Pure grind. Can't win without a large group. Updates add useless things instead of fixing bugs. Horrible optimization (Yet the company says get a better computer) HORRIBLE anti cheat (EAC is possibly the worst anti cheat out there.) Cancerous community. Cheaters don't get banned non cheaters do. No game management.All in all I would avoid Rust and try other survival games such as Conan The Forest ARK etc.Note1 EAC has been false banning accounts left and right for profit reasons. (Not just on Rust either)Note2 Gary has a net worth over the billions and he is still too cheap to get REAL unity libraries &amp assets. Instead he keeps using outdated network engines like RakNet then he tells his customers to upgrade their computers or go play another game. Note3 Facepunch has done nothing but make games in alpha then abandon them. I would stay FAR away from any Facepunch development AND Rust!,Rust

After playing RUST for so many hours I would say there are a few things that I believe could be added and removed to make this game more enjoyable for me and others that play it. But overall I believe this game has great potential and I would recommend this game to anyone that is thinking about buying it.,Rust
2014-03-17,0,0,111,True,Recommended,The Rust Alpha is a very interesting experiment in human behavior. Finding friends in the game is a necessity. Being able to gather the resources to become a force of any importance isonly achievable in groups. Whether you join a group or go it alone there are all sorts of ways to play. Roving around the wasteland naked is just one of the possible play styles. Definitely worth a look into if you enjoy games like minecraft Space Engineers or any other survival type game.,Rust

2015-06-14,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Rust is a great survival game that brought the original idea from MineCraft and improved on it 10 fold. Sure some players get extremely aggressive however the point behind Rust is to craft create and survive. For an early access game it has a lot of potential starting with the updates being released every week. The developers know what their doing and their ideas are still being added bit by bit to improve on the game and to please the players by giving them more bang for their buck.Rust is awesome and will be played by players like me for a long time to come.,Rust

2014-02-17,0,0,161,True,Not Recommended,The game needs serious work and I say that knowing and understanding that it is an alpha. In its current state between hackers glitches server crashes and very underthought game mechanics it is unplayable. With the exception of the zombies the only thing to do is grief kill people (dont believe me look at pretty much every youtube video of play posted) and now there are no zombies. So quite literally the only point to the game currently is collect things without getting killed for the things your collecting until you have enough things to kill other people collecting things.,Rust

2015-07-05,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Extremely buggy and laggy game not worth the 20 euros. Even with the lowest graphical settings i experienced heavy lag on my new gaming PC. Not to forget the 'always friendly' community willing to show the harsh reality Rust which goes something like this Yes you did just buy that game. Yes you did waste the money on that. Yes Rust is just another early access pile of excrement on the market released on the market to make the developer some extra money for further development.I do not expect highly of any survival game but with a ludicrous 20 euro price for a early access (which the developers did state was buggy I had hoped that they would atleast focus on enhancing the game and removing unnecessary coding but with the reason trend of survival games I can guess the developers were overwhelmed with the demand for more features just like Independent DayZ which today is still battling with server maintenance and massive lagspikes.My advise? Do not buy atleast until a major patch is done and have fixed most of the lag. Unless you have a super computer in which case go right ahead but Rust really is over the top and I there highly suggest you to go find another survival game with your friends ( or even better find another kind of game! ) play that.

2014-03-18,0,0,387,True,Not Recommended,"Has many great ideas. Garry has said it's 10% done so how can anyone reccomend it? I have built so many different types of forts only to spend most of my time in game getting resources to build a fort for all the things I gather so they can't be stolen. Hackers though are a major problem... I am sure they can still jump high in the air and then use 10 c4 to break into your stuff easily with ESP box location. That is the main problem with this game other than these photos on the main page. Who the has time to build a metal base that big? Do I need to stay on rust 24/7 to build my base then I can go out and hunt people? My group never got the chance to go out and hunt/raid bases very much in the 300 hours I've played because we were stuck gathering to build our defenses. Large spike walls are a joke.. place one camp fire and use med kits to break it down.. useless. There are no building defenses that actually work. You can sit there placing foundation after foundation but all someone needs to do is find the right spot and build next to your foundation and up up up. How many noobs must waste their mortal life to learn these harsh lessons? Now what about player customization? This game everyone looks the same so in a pvp fight it's hard to tell friend from foe in the heat of the action. No female models so it's all the time is Garry gay or something? People say ""All the females died in the world of Rust"" but that is the most stupid thing I've ever read or heard. Who would live in a world with out females? JUST . sounds pretty gay.Now if that wasn't bad enough the world is so big yet so empty. You can climb to the top of any mountain just for your fingers to hurt realizing theres no resources around or npcs to hunt. One of the worst aspects of this game is joining a server only for people to be hogging resources. The whole map can be explored but it takes forever and who the hell wants to run for 20 minutes to the middle of no where.I think the last thing I want to talk about is the combat system. The shooting feels really weird the bullets drop unreaslitcally and some how a pistol has a larger range than an mp5. Not to mention you have useless trash like the revolver pump shot gun etc.. These weapons are great if they were gearing for a fall out game but instead they provide military grade weapons that spoil the experience. How much more fun would it be if bandits were raiding you with bats and ghetto guns vs m4/kevlar/shotgun/grenades/c4. I just don't think unmodern items (like the rock too wtf?) have a place in this game that's trying so hard to be modern. Save your money if you read my review it's not worh it right now.",Rust

2014-03-18,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,In its current state I'd recommend the game if someone is interested in exploring a cool survival themed game but with the full realization its very unbalanced atm. However for most casual players there are lots of hacking and its really easy to have all of your items lost when you log out for the night. I made most of the basic starting items you can make found some blueprints etc and can see the game has lots of *potential*.

2014-03-18,0,0,50,True,Recommended,"This game is very fun in all the ways that I love. I have a few suggestions for the editors though I was thinking it would be better if when you unlock a weapon with a blueprint you not only unlock the gun but the ammunition as well. also I think it would be a good improvement to add vehicles to the game as well. so like if you wanted a car you would have to craft the engine wheels hull and car controls. It would be better to keep the resources expensive though to give the gamer something to look forward to and collect for a while and plus you would have to craft a key for it and must have it with you at all times if you wish to travel by car. it would also be really cool to add the ability to climb trees if you had rope that you could craft using a workbench. Then you could climb up the tree to escape predators or players with melee weapons or you could place a ""tree house platform"" on it and make a tree house. Also while on the topic you guys should add a sniper rifle to snipe while in trees or on top of mountains or at long distances and if you wanted to upgrade you sight you would have to find a blueprint for it so you could start with it having a x2 scope then you can craft a x3 and x4 scope but then you have to find blueprints for any other scopes with higher magnification. and last but but not least I think it would be more realistic if there was a thirst bar and there would be ponds scattered across the map for you to drink but you could also craft a flask for carrying water and you would craft it with a certain amount of cloth. I would really appreciate if you considered these suggestions and I think it would be awesome if you added some of them.",Rust

2014-01-09,0,0,13,True,Recommended,If you are looking for a (literal no clothes) naked survival game look no further. This is a hard core survival simulator on a desolate island. I will say though that even though the multiplayer is thriving the map is so huge that its hard to find people. The island population consists of radiation contaminated bears wolves and fields upon field of abandoned player built houses which is a bit concerning. Though lacking in content this title is being updated constantly and efficiently. I do reccomend a beefy computer though aswell because it can be very laggy. I know facepunch will do a great job and i cant wait to see the finished project but for now i give it 3.2/5 Papayas,Rust

2015-05-21,0,0,360,True,Recommended,Pros Graphics are pretty nice runs fairly well on my upper medium rig Building a base with some friends gathering resources and getting blueprints for weapons is very satisfying You can occasionally meet someone who won't shoot you on sight then maybe you'll have a laugh together The paintable signs are a great idea and add some much needed personal touch to the worldCons The community is toxic 9/10 people will kill you instantly on sight even if you are a fresh spawn but whats worse is half of them sound like spoiled 10 yr olds over voip which is extremely annoying Logging in and seeing your base and all your stuff completely gone just cos you couldn't play for a day is pretty disheartening so unless you want to be a 24/7 rusthead then don't bother all you'll get is frustration time and again. Makes you hate the community turning you into another kill on sight cos you're sick of getting shot for no reason hence the community breeds it's own demise. Hackers (not to name names but cough *russians* cough)Basically if you want to have a game that you have to dedicate 4 hours a day to AT LEAST then you might enjoy rust but for me its just a bunch of sitting in their towers shooting everyone they see only going outside to shoot more people on sight.Having said that you might want to be one of those people and it can be really good fun don't get me wrong. I just want you to be a little more knowledgeable about what you're getting with rust which is what a review should be.Edit This is the most complete early access game I've ever witnessed. While the gameplay isnt my cup of tea anymore I do recommend playing this if you have friends to play with.,Rust

You make new tools/materials in order to survive.The community is serious btw.You WILL get raided I don't give a crap you will and you will hate it afterwardsYou then regret playing this game but you will fix those mistakes and start again.It is part of the game and hopefully you go raiding one day and kill homeless people.Rust has a very deep crafting system and there is always something new you can do.The scenery and your curiosity to explore is epic.I think that is why it's worth playing because there is a sense of discovery.Hope this kinda helps.,Rust
2015-12-07,0,0,78,True,Recommended,This game is very fun and addicting. The quest for better loot will go on for ever. I spent the first hour of the game exploring.

2014-06-07,0,0,45,True,Recommended,this game is exttremely unique when it comes to the context of survival. It is one of the good survival games that has an intense social interation. When it comes to this game it is not nature you should be worried about but the people who live in it.When it comes to rust you have two choices to live with your comrades and to try and dominate the civilisation which is extremely dangerous or you can live in the shadows and forage for food and go scavaging for resouces by yourself and a friend this choice is quite safe. Also the map on the island is difficult to navigate at first but you will find a way to navigate using the main road. Also be carefull where you build your house if you build it near towns or roads you are vulnerable for raids but if you build it in the wilderness travelling and navigating will be hard.P.S dying in this game is a troll ),Rust

2017-10-17,0,0,575,True,Recommended,Overall I think Rust is great game if you're willing/interested in playing a lot and like survival/crafting/fps type games. If you like Minecraft AND PUBG there's a good chance you'll like this.It's good to see regular updates on a consistent schedule. And they are usually impactful major updates so you get the sense that there's progress towards the finished product. There are always good and bad things with each update but there is an overall positive trend and looking at their roadmap of disclosed goals for the game I'm confident the end product will be something I'm happy with.That said Rust is not a game for someone who wants to play for 30 minutes here and there. It really takes hours of play between wipes to make significant progress. This is both a positive and negative. It's positive in the sense that I can easily lose track of time and lose myself in this world experiencing the emotional journey of gaining resources over time and then losing them when I inevitably get raided. Obviously it's bad for anyone who doesn't have the time or who doesn't want to invest the time into making progress in this game.,Rust
2013-12-13,0,0,80,True,Not Recommended,Joke of a dev team. Usually I try not to buy early access games with caution that you may get such a trash dev team like this game has. I brought this back when it first came out and sunk MASSIVE hours into it the original idea and the basis of starting out as a naked dude and making your way through the ages as almost a caveman to a kevlar wearing gun blazing bad was just awesome and felt rewarding. I followed the websites dev blog updates each week and each week we got a sweet jack released. A few months past and Garry (the owner) releases an update saying they didn't expect their game to be so popular and it's been to stressful so his going on holidays for 2 weeks. Comes back more updates followed along the lines of 'don't expect so much from us guys we just wanted to take our time with this project we are only like a 4 man team so stfu and stop asking for updates'. After months of really just concept ideas some genius thought it would be crack to totally scrap the old engine of the game and start fresh and that's basically the point they lost their entire playerbase. I feel like a got my monies worth in the end so it was whatever only $30 but it is such a shame to see a great idea that just got screwed. Garry said himself they sold way more then expected so instead of INVESTING and hiring more then a f*cking 4 man team he decides a holiday is a more wise choice basically taking our money and running with it. Don't buy the game it's now not even worth 10 bucks,Rust

2014-03-19,0,0,40,True,Recommended,Amazing game with alot of potential. This game is already good in Alpha I can't even imagine by the time its released. The pvp is a bit clunky but I like it the idea of rad zones and better items within them is great! I can't wait till they replace zombies with something even more awesome and when they add more loot and improve pvp this game will beat all others. The idea of crafting you gear has really set this apart from DayZ and i dont know why anyone would compare it with that. Great game you really should get it. Though its a bit more for intense gamers than casual ones because when you log out you can still be killed.P.S. I really think military would fit what we have now and make this game amazing. This would still set us apart because in most games you are the military but in this you are against the military and it would not even be the most important part of the game. I can see them as a better way to get blueprints and it would not be overpowered if they dropped weak guns or none at all,Rust

2014-03-19,0,0,114,True,Recommended,Rust is honestly a very very fun survival game. Of course there are no zombies in the game which i had heard they took out before i ever purchased the game. Which is just fine by me because there is honestly no other survival game like this one. I was so intrigued when i read about running around hardly dressed with just a rock and a torch to weild. So i have experienced it for myself finally. There is A LOT of PVP which im more of a PVE type of gamer besides there are plenty of No PVP servers just as well. So the game contributes to both type of gamers who love to grief and others that play solo or just want to help others and build survive etc. I have come acrossed more friendly players than i have trolls/griefers to be honest. My first pvp experience was not willingly and i was bludgened to death with a stone hatchet twice over. So i stick to no pvp servers. Plus i like this game so much i purchased my own rental server for 3 months! Its fun to be an admin too. Anyways if pure survival running around half naked sounds good to you... you got to check out RUST!,Rust

I've had a great time overall. The developers just added a new progression system that I think is really fun. The biggest problem in the game right now in my opinion is the toxic playerbase. You are gonna get killed even if you have nothing on you but just maybe you'll find some friendly nakeds to team up with and build a shack. Definitely worth $20!,Rust

""Getting Shot on Sight""... get used to the idea. It ain't a picknick game.

Maybe consider buying it when it's out of alpha and they've added more features. I would recommend dayz over this garbage I really wish I wouldnt have bought it. Not a very good game and horrible community on it.,Rust

2017-10-18,0,0,839,True,Recommended,this game is hard challenging in every way imaginable! when i first bought this game a year ago and began playing i couldn't get more then 5 minutes into a new server without being brutally murdered every 30 seconds. it was hard and frustrating and i set the game down for awhile without giving this game any more thought or consideration. several months ago i came back and gave it a fresh start. i immediatly ran into the same toxic community and the same brutal skill curve as before but this time i was persistent i tried other options i made friends i battled hard and i found my niche into this wonderful game. now i can't set this game down and just when i consider taking a break or stepping away the amazing team at facepunch waterfalls tons of new content updates bug fixes and optimizes the game on a whole new level that i have never seen with any other early access game out there! this studio and this game deserve much needed love! they bust to provide a kick game and i feel they deliver on many levels! this game is tough and it is hard but it is so worth it!welcome to rust!,Rust

2017-10-18,0,0,1720,True,Recommended,Been playing this game since early Legacy and have nearly 1000 hours on it. Played mostly solo or with one friend. The game is a gem it's incredibly fun and challenging. The devs are very motivated and updates and new features fly out by the week. The amount of variety there is in how you can play this game is immense. Playing in massive groups of 10+ people and building castles versus playing solo or even playing on a wide variety of different servers with mods and different rules that change how the game plays. I love this game but it isn't perfect. Que the love rant about the current state of the game There is still a lot that must be done especially about player interactions and how the game has turned into a glorified pubg with crafting and building. Look to other hardcore survival games and you will see very quickly why this is an issue. We need weapons especially high tier weapons and ammo to feel extremely valuable and rare. At the moment you struggle for an hour or so and then you start creating an armory inside of your base as if its WW3 and roll around with the sole purpose to just kill and raid that's all. There's zero danger from the environment animals radiation etc. Running through the radiated towns is easy and getting loot is as well. We've moved in a good direction with the BP update recently but we need to go full on back to the survival game roots. I don't want to just have the goal of the game to not be raided survive player interactions and raid other people. The game gets boring fast as it would be more worth my time playing CS GO or pubg if I want to role around shooting at as many people as I can. We need sickness dangerous animals and weather conditions rare weapons and ammo bounty systems for the server variation in injuries struggle for food and water. Terminus servers are doing something right and thats by making the game difficult and posing you with more varied and difficult decisions to make. DayZ is a truer survival game than Rust has ever been (for a lot of the reasons I've already stated) but lacks its polish and dedicated staff. I have faith that the game will eventually end up where it needs to be the devs need to just ignore the crying little children who want a CoD esk game experience from this. The dev team is amazing the quality of the game and how it plays and looks is superb we have everything we could want but hardcore progression incentivized and varied player interactions hardcore survival mechanics etc. All in all this game has been beyond worth the initial 20$ I spent a long time ago and has continued make that purchase way beyond worth it. I just hope that the devs heed the words their long term player base and aren't afraid to make drastic survival based changes to the game. If they do this Rust will become the single best survival game ever created (it's already very close to that title even with so much more improvement to be had).,Rust

2014-03-21,0,0,1244,True,Recommended,I love this game i have a alot of time into this game but from experience this game is a survival game based on team work and communication. If u wanna have fun u should probably start off making friends then find u a good server. The servers have alot to do with ur experience on the game. Some servers really suck others are great just ask and read about the server and u will find a good one. For noobs or beginners a server with about 10 20 people would be a good start cause servers with like 5 usually die down really fast. Also make sure and watch others and how they play u learn alot i started off trying to use a furnace and not knowing how to to being able to get full kev and m4s in 1 day just gotta have practice u learn alot. Oh also DONT TRUST NAKEDS they like to pull shotguns out of there and shoot u so becareful and have fun playing.,Rust

2014-03-22,0,0,122,True,Recommended,fun and addictive this is amazing for an alpha and funny moments all the time... my only issue is that its PVP ONLY (unless you disable events) and when your on a friendly server and people KillOnSight it is extremly annoying and ruins the game for everyone especially if youve spent hours farming/collecting resources and some kid unloads a full clip into your head i suggest if your not a fan of PVP to steer away from this game but if you can hack it and build a secure base to store your stuff this game is an 8 our of 10 ),Rust

You can be a lone ranger (Someone who isnt really into teaming up). If you pick to be a lone ranger Go on smaller servers. You can team up and have a clan.(You all will work together and share a base) I Recomend you team up. You can be a raider and/or defender for your team. Rust has so much to offer!

2014-02-06,0,0,348,True,Recommended,Rust combines the crafting and survival elements of Minecraft into a zombie survival game with a twist. You are on a server with other people and you have to be wary of others. You're not sure if they are hostile or are friendly so every encounter with another player is more dangerous than an encounter with NPC's. It's a very fun and rewarding game when you can stake your own piece of the country side and forage and survive. Defending yourself and your area becomes an instinct as you're wary of other players. At times any chance of having friends breaks down and it's a kill on sight game where nobody trusts anyone. It's very fun and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival type games.,Rust

The minimum system requirements make it look like anything can run this game you can.. on 12FPS... on the lowest ugliest settings. You would be better off getting a game like Reign Of Kings or even f**king Minecraft _,Rust

2017-10-20,0,0,547,True,Recommended,Really a fantastic game. It's brutal unforgiving and has a high learning curve. You will die lose your loot get your base demolished and be trash talked while it's happening. What you do after that will determine if you will like rust or not Rage quit? OrGet revenge? It's all up to you.,Rust
2017-10-20,0,0,120,True,Recommended,Rust is rather difficult if you play solo especially with the recent updates. It can also be very frusterating at times when you loose your stuff. However that's just the nature of the game. That being said the devs seem hard at work developing the game and do listen to the community. If you have some friends to play with I'd definetly recommend giving it a shot. It's imporant to keep in mind that Rust is still in alpha and being actively developed. It's not perfect by any means but for what it is I'd give it a thumbs up.,Rust

2014-03-23,0,0,38,True,Recommended,I love this game to death. If you ever get the chance to buy it go ahead. It can take some getting used to as many s roam the game killing on site but the occasional friendly always turns out well. I can honestly say that the whole survival aspect is based off of community. The more people you band up with the better. I reccomend playing with friends but I've had equally enough fun finding new ones in game. Nothing feels better than finding someone who has a mutual enemy as you and taking them out together to split the spoils. The whole hunting/gathering aspect is great too as it keeps you on your toes. You can't hide forever in a base or you'll starve. It requires constant exploring and fighting. It's never a boring game as something/someone is always chasing you or you'll be chasing them. Overall this is a kickass game.,Rust

2016-06-22,0,0,20,True,Recommended,I have currently been playing this game for the past few days and love it. Some of the issues people have stated in other reviews have been fixed or they are simply oppinions for example one review said it is too quiet but I personally like the lack of music and its simple all natural sound pallet. Also the community is not all trash. I met a player last night who practically built a base for me and we are friends now. PvP is a feature in the game so if you don't like constantly getting shot by people in 4 story bases consider running away immediately or looking through the server lists and finding a procedurely generated server with say 3 4 people in it and seclude yourself. The game itself is a work in progress but as far as I'm concerned the only the thing that needs nerffed are the F***ing bears and the only thing that needs work is the graphics (it has fairly poor resolution). If you enjoy survival games with no limits on your gameplay rust is going to be the game for you.,Rust

2014-08-29,0,0,46,True,Not Recommended,"Quick breakdown of my summary Hacking (My only real issue with this game)Customer ServiceOverall gameplayI am really surprised to see how many ""helpful"" reviews were positive. Even though this game might be in Alpha and I have to wonder if this game is in forever Alpha. 3 weeks ago I bought this game thinking ""looks good!"" at first the game was fun I even built a house with a metal door to safe guard my stuff (I was wrong). Although I don't mind my door being blown up by C4 and my place raided I do however mind the rampant hacking in the game. It isn't even the flying or the speed hacking people are doing it is the flat out clipping through walls which makes it pointless to even build anything. I watched a player do it to me I've seen dozens of players fly through the air and well even the trusty Aimbot is used howelse does someone shoot you in the middle of the night pitch black from a distance?Just do a google for the hacks and you will find them are they detected NO and there will not be a ban either. The one good thing you can count on is the hacking is no secret they will admit it and even do it right in front of you! Why? Well that is a good question... because no one will ban them. Look at the companies stance on it look at what it takes to report this issue. They literally put the responsibility off on Steam to do something which isn't there problem it is the company who produces this kind of bad programming with no server side checks.Make your own decision but remember you have been warned!! P.S. The same hack that has been getting used for along time. You can follow in on a forum and nothing has been done to stop it. Due to rules and guidelines I cannot link you it or I would I will not name it because I want this post to be seen.",Rust

2014-08-29,0,0,81,True,Recommended,"The first hour and a half of my game time was spent hunting and gathering food and resources. I struggled every night to stay alive since I had not built a house yet. Eventually I found someone else's house which had a furnace and workbench. I was able to equip myself with clothes bow and arrows and a shotgun. I thought I was invincible until I saw a naked man holding a rock... I thought I was superior so I threatened him telling him to get away from my newly claimed land. He responded with ""alright alright I'm leaving. I felt like I owned the world at that very second. As I was running back to my home I found a deer and decided to kill it with my shotgun. I ran to loot my game but I was killed by the same naked man who I thought I had ran off with my shotgun. His name was FapsPerSecond.As I was dying the last thing I heard was ""There can only be one Fap."" 10/10",Rust

2014-08-30,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,First things first this game is online only using servers that apparently have no admins. You can play on pvp or non pvp servers but pvp is where the most fun is and consequently the most frustration is. The problem is that you are usually at the mercy of some individuals who have been playing this game forever and can ruin your enjoyment within a few moments. Hacking is extremely common you're first base will probably be destroyed by someone who's cheated some C4 into the game. The pvp servers are rampant with sexually frustrated teenagers who are most likely autistic to some level as they simply want to steal you're stuff and get you to quit. Oh and if you don't continue playing within 36 hours you're base will begin to fall apart.In short Buy it if you have a lot of time to waste and want to play every day despite the number of people who are going to ruin it for you. Or wait until the game comes out of Alpha and gets some mods,Rust

All the things I would have liked in DayZ are what make Rust. Playing this game is like a second life you actually know the people around you the allys and the enemies. The addition of making a house and crafting adds progression to the game in DayZ if you die 9 times out of 10 thats it back to the beginning. But in this its never over untill you want it to be and thats what makes this such a good game.,Rust

2014-03-31,0,0,25,True,Recommended,It's a fantastically difficult game and your own drive for progress is what keeps you enthralled. This is however the most difficult first person survival shooter I have ever played (at the start). You learn rather quickly that the challenge in the game comes not from the risk of starvation the wild animals or the difficulty of finding resources. No you learn quickly that your fellow players are the most intense threat you face. There is no other game that makes your heart pump like it does when you see another human player in Rust. Even hearing distant footsteps while sitting in the safety of your ramshackle home makes your palms sweat and will make even the most devout atheist pray to a higher power that the person doesn't raid your home. There is no game that makes you rage quit harder upon death (not even you Dark Souls) and certainly no game that makes you cheer in ecstasy at a successful in game day. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's fantastic. I do have one problem with it The community is full of morons. You will absolutely find some wonderful people in game and you can join a clan of hardcore survivalists who will help you on the way but first you have to wade through a sea of innappropriate jokes and high pitched voices bragging about banging your mother. It's well worth the struggle.,Rust

2016-06-26,0,0,740,True,Recommended,I really like this game and feel it is of good quality even though it s still in alpha. The developers are doing a good job every week on the updates. It s been a long time since any game has got me hooked like Rust. I hope there will be more development in the PVE part of the game further on and more things to build.,Rust
2016-06-26,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,I would classify this game as an a hole simulator. When there are no rules mostly underage humans behave like complete a holes as this ever incomplete game so accurately portrays. After being in development for 3 years it's still a piece of unoptimized garbage and if you don't have a high end PC don't bother wasting your time on this crap. And if you do i'll briefly tell you what to expect. You'll be running around naked and still have inventory to put things in. You're gonna have to bash trees with a rock to get wood bash round rocks with your rock to get stones. Then you'll meet s who play this game and there's no point in running away they'll hunt you down and kill you because why the hell not? If you're into a hole simulators then have fun otherwise stay away.Cons people shoot you on sight and often hit you miraculously in the head while running (doesn't matter that you're still naked with only a rock in your hands) stupid animals who run in circles somehow climbing vertical cliffs falling down (without any damage) and going up again Ordinary graphics with extraordinarily low fps Extremely long loading times,Rust

2014-10-05,0,0,30,True,Not Recommended,Waste of $30. Besides the cheating hacking terrible community and general poor state of the game the new version works maybe 20% of the time. The rest consists of being randomly disconnected from the servers having your PC go haywire (and i have a pretty high end one) and generally fighting the game just for it to allow you to play it. For months it has been like this nothing gets fixed. Also forget about using a controller even with Xpadder the game literally refuses for it to work and disables it on your pc if you try. Stay awy.,Rust

2014-10-01,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,this game is very easy to hack so people ruin the game and do it. you would waist your money on this game. non pvp servers are the worst. not namming anyone (major rob ford) but they ruin the servers with constend raiding and greefing. a few problems besides the hackers are the fact that once you place a wall or anything else you cant pick it back up forcing you to blast it off. or just build a new house. the game is horredly unrealistic and has extreme lag spikes. you are alot better getting minecraft or other games like it.,Rust
2014-09-25,0,0,115,True,Recommended,i think this game is great in many ways so i cant tell you them all and it is NOT a minecraft wanna be game like i thoughtit would be when i first saw it. there are a few bad things that i dont like though which is the following people can see through trees you can stack ramps ontop of eachother and spawn in them (i dont mind how you can stack them just the fact that you can spawn in them bothers me) and has hackers now and then.

2014-03-29,0,0,99,True,Recommended,I find it so frustrating that ALL of the Non PVP servers are going down!!!! I would rather work together with other players instead of being wailed on right when I get into the game and have no chance of having a decent game (this has happened to me at least three or four different times). US Central 2 will not load for me and the North American 2 server went down last week and still hasn't come back up. There should be MORE non PVP servers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will not recomend this game until there more non PVP servers. Not everyone likes getting the crap beat out of them or doing the same to another player. I would rather steal from other players not kill every new player I get my hands on. Also on the community servers it would be extremely helpful if they type of server (PVP/non PVP) was manditory in every name or description.,Rust

2014-03-29,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,"Its hard to give this game a ""no""...let me explain why.Its a great game in theory. Start from scratch gather resources craft new items craft a home kill animals cook food meet friends start a colony work together. YAY!It's too bad it doesn't happen that way...what ends up happening is you are spawn killed for the first hour or so. Eventually you learn to stick far from the road and only go out at night. The first thing you will probably end up asking is how to craft. You will get the normal answers ""alt+f4"" ""console quit"" etc.. To be expected it is an online game deployed via steam afterall. You might and I mean MIGHT find a kind soul who will guide you in creating a fire cooking meat and not dieing from starvation. This battle continues with almost any question you have in the game.So lets say you've got the basics down. You got 100 wood in your pocket a shed set up with a wooden door and some cooked meat. Hey you even just got enough cloth to craft a bow and arrow! How awesome! Guess what? You are going to get killed. I garauntee it. Some clown with kevlar and a shotgun will find you taunt you and then kill you. This doesnt sound so bad really...I mean in games with PvP involved its bound to happen right? Did I mention you lose all your items? Yes thats correct you lose everything. The last 3 hours your spent crafting your cloth armor bow and arrow mining resources? Wasted. Some assclown just shot you in the head and took it all. You have to start ALL over agian. If you do not find the 1/10 people who are not noobkillers you are going to want your money back. It seems the only way to play this game is to beg to join someones colony/group and pray they dont decide to go HAM on you. This game would be infinitely fun with some sort of career mode or being able to turn off your PvP elegibility. That would be awesome...",Rust

That was the original review with the version of the game that was released first. Over 1(?) year later my review is now this. I lost my faith in Facepunch. They had a great thing going with legacy and now it just simply isn't fun. Making the maps way too large and making landmarks impossible to find is just some of the issues. Playing as a solo player is extremely brutal now. You will be hunted down and raided to the end of the earth. The ""new and improved"" graphics and engine don't feel better to play in at all. Melee combat still feels terrible ESPECIALLY with the wildlife. Oh how I wish the new Rust was half as exciting or engaging as Legacy.Unfortunately many of the positive reviews for this game talk of grand adventures and hilarious events but most likely these reviews are outdated and are for legacy rust.But honestly and simply this game is not fun anymore. I would love to play it but it just is too huge of a time sink for too litte of a reward. Legacy was not perfect but it was a whole lot better than whatever this game is.",Rust

2014-02-26,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"First experience with this game I log in and get sniped after moving a few feet. Not a huge problem. Second spawn some guy comes up to me attacking me with his rock while shouting racial slurs at me in voice. Everything about this game encourages griefer behavior and so that is exactly the type of players you will encounter in this game. I was originally lured in by the description which describes this game as a ""man vs nature"" survival game and while it does have those elements in it they are severly downplayed by the primary focus of ""player vs player"". Most deaths you will encounter will come from other players and VERY few from actually failing to ""survive"" the environment. The landscape is bleak and boring and the interactions with the enviroment are few. There are only 2 ""types"" of resource nodes (wood and rock) to gather every single resource you will ever craft with. Sadly I didn't even get to craft anything due to the violent nature of other players so I can't attest to it's robustness. All in all the game feels more like a first person shooter that tries (poorly) to jump on the popularity of the survival genre. They even had zombies in the game for a time being and then removed them when the zombie theme became over saturated. Ultimately I feel this game suffers from either a poorly worded description or a development team who has strayed from the genre they want their game to be.",Rust

2014-02-26,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,"Unless your playing with a few friends this game is terrible. Even on the ""noob"" servers people just roam around in big groups to kill everyone. Then they build giant sniper towers around the resource heavy areas and snipe anyone that goes to gather.Built a base to store all the stuff you've worked so hard to acquire? People just blow it up and steal your stuff. There is no way to defend yourself against players that are in groups and have already gathered guns/explosives.Game is way too unbalanced.",Rust

2014-02-27,0,0,107,True,Recommended,Fun game with a different concept.,Rust
2014-02-27,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,"My recommendation comes at a heavy price so for now it's technically positive but will show as negative until things are updated.Firstly understand that at the time of this review the game is still in early release and is considered in Alpha status (as made evident by the permanent stamp in the upper right upon loading the game). So there's no doubt there will be changes made and plenty of things added in there.With that said Rust has amazing potential to be a good game. The environment although repetitious in many ways doesn't fail to be scenic. My fondest memory so far was during my first 2 hours of play. I had been constantly dying due to the many dangers of the wild and finally got to a point where I had a stone hatchet to mine more efficiently. It was exhausting and nerve wracking trying to avoid wolves and bears and radiated zones just to get a solid foundation. Night fell and I built up a campfire roasted up a chicken breast (the only meat featured so far) and took a moment to look around. The campfire light was flickering against the stone wall behind me and illuminated the immediate area around. I looked up at the starry night as the virtual moon crawled overhead. It looked just like the rural country skies where you could lay in the grass and stare carefree. It was a beautiful 15 minutes (average nighttime) and I recommend you find your own nature moment in Rust.HOWEVER I have played this game for what must be close to 5 hours and have YET to be safe. Here's problem number one when you log out your body is there open for anyone to see. And should they see you they can kill you and loot your body. Should you forget to craft a sleeping bag and place it somewhere you will now be randomly spawned somewhere on the map. Problem number two the only way to make yourself safe from pvp'ers murdering your body is building a house with a metal door.Not so bad? Consider how much resources you need for safety here.. Hitting trees give you 10 wood each. That 10 wood 1 wooden plank. A foundation requires 8 wood planks walls cost 4 wood planks pillars cost 2 wood planks a ceiling costs 6 wood planks and you'll want a metal door or else smart pvp'ers can break down wooden doors with little effort. Let's do the math real quick here... 8+(4*3sides)+(2*4pillars)+6 34 wood planks or 340 wood pieces or 34 trees straight chopped down. That doesn't sound too bad right? Now you need a metal door. Wuh oh how you get that? Well you need metal pieces from boulders/ore stones which are currently only found in one of maybe 4 specific areas on the map randomly spawned and randomly drops Metal Ore. Each Metal Ore generates 3 8 fragments and you need 200 metal fragments to craft a metal door meaning you would potentially need at most 67 metal ore to provide enough fragments. However in order to produce metal fragments you need a furnace to smelt the ore. AHA! Now you need 15 Stones 20 Wood and 10 Low Grade Fuel (made from Animal Fat + Cloth). Wtf? And even then there's apparently a chance that smelting too much at one time may cause a loss in product from the ore used. Okay if that isn't frustrating yet here's another component to the equation in order to smelt something you need Wood pieces....really? So you're telling me I need 20 wood for the furnace 340 wood for the house and about 67 120 wood for smelting a process that might not yield enough metal fragments?Okaaay so you have the time to devote to this resource grind. Let's assume you're *not* in a PVP server and let's assume you already know where to get all this and you have yet to be attacked by ""Surprise Bear"" or ""Gangrape Wolf"". Congratulations you're winning.I can't recommend this game yet. I just can't. Maybe I had a bad server experience but I purposely joined a non pvp server because I can't stand going through any amount of hard earned resource gathering just to lose it all to some d bag with a gun. And yet my downfall was not just the animals it wasn't just the resources it was the fact that the pillars have a weird placement system which makes the house building wonky if you have a 2x1 foundation now my ""house"" had no room for doorways even if I had them.So after 5 hours of learning the damn game and 1 hour of actual building I decided to pack my sleeping bag and find a spot where I hopefully won't be found. But guess what if I get attacked and lose all my stuff I just won't care.I just won't care. Please keep this game updating because it has potential. Pleeeease make it easier to survive in some fashion. I don't care if you have to make the boulders more populated/easily accessible or if you make the formulae less strict. But whatever you do don't make it...as one humorous gentleman who helped us newbies out put it...a wood chopping simulator.",Rust

2015-07-19,0,0,720,True,Recommended,This game is worth the money you pay as it is one of the few early acces games to be updated regulary. This is a hardcore pvp game. Meaning that the only player you can really count on is yourself. That being said being a part of a group is fun as long as the group stays together. If your good enough going solo can be challenging but fun also. If you are just starting out in rust go to a noob friendly comunity or modded server first. Make some friends learn how to play then go to the official servers and try your luck. There is a grind to farm the materials that you need but you can always raid a base for materials. Always knowing that you probably get raided sooner or later yourself. So don't become to attached to your stuff and always have a backup base just in case.,Rust

2014-02-23,0,0,68,True,Recommended,"Ive been playing rust for a while now and after id played a while I found many pros and cons of rust and things that just make the game downright unplayable. First off ill start with the pros 1. The game is highly addicting id say personally me ive very rarly ran across a game like this that i just feel the need that i have to play more.2. I love the building system its so much fun the first time you build your own house you just feel so proud of your accomplishment. 3. The atmosphere at night times. Ive never played a game where i actually feared the noises outside. You never know what can happen night time is the time most people do the raiding so every noise you hear youll think someones coming for you.4. The crafting system could use tiny touch ups but other than that is pretty good i never found myself not knowing how to make something.5. A true survival experience. Compared to a lot of other games it goes above and beyond you will feel like your actually surviving in this game. Youll have to make a shelter hunt for food make effective weapons to hunt collect resources important to your survival and make life and death decisions when it comes to other players on the game.Now for the cons 1. Hackers are one of the biggest problems in the game. They have taken steps to try and stop hackers but most the time it doesnt work. Now the problem with the hackers is they like to use a hack that kills everyone in a huge radius around them so if you just started and your sitting in your little shack praying no one attacks you BAM! death comes from a mile away. Also some people use speed hacks and auto aim hacks but those arent used as much as the area of effect instant death hacks.2. The community. Now understand sometimes you'll find some alright people you can team up with or just in general are nice(rarely) but most the time you will run into people who will shoot first ask questions later. Now I accept this and i can appreciate the fact that this is part of the ""survival"" aspect of the game. So when im in a area with people and i get gunned down there is no reason for me to get upset and i dont most the time. thats a risk you take walking outside be it day or night. Now the reason this is in the cons however is the fact that lets say you buy the game start it up select your server and you get in the game for the first time you look around to see whats around and BOOM shot in the face. Most players in the game even if its obvious you have nothing of value to them or youve done nothing will still shoot you on sight.3. Unless you have a lot of people on a team its a slower process to do stuff meaning if you want to get resources (which people like to make houses around) you have to go out and harvest trees stone or wood piles. Which leaves you open to peoples attacks which will happen more times than you will be able to count. Which brings me to point 4.4. While playing the game i found places that might have 1 or 2 of a resourcce in the area then theres areas where theres tons of resources and animals to hunt the perfect place right? Wrong there will be people that have made massive houses nearby that are all armored up with fully auto guns and a itchy trigger finger that are just waiting for you to take ""their"" resources and i say their because to them that entire part of the map is their property even though others live there.With the pros and the cons done theres only one more thing that makes the game at times unplayable and frankly irritating as hell ROLLBACKS. Now if you dont know what happens in a roll back basiclly a roll back takes everything you've done anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 hours and sometimes even longer and undos all of it and most the time youll have no clue when its gonna happen. So lets say you build yourself this nice secure house with metal doors metal walls youve just made it look really nice......ROLLBACK.......all of thats gone basically like youve been standing around doing nothing the whole time.Ill give you a example that happened to me. I got up early because i wanted to see if my house was still secure (it was) so then i started to build expansions on it to make it even safer so to do that i had to harvest a massive amount of metal ore (for metal doors) and wood (for the structures) now if i wasnt in the area i was in it would have taken much longer luckly i found a area with nice people with big guns that lives nearby (that is extremely rare) which was also a risk cause if they wanted they could have messed me up and took everything but they didnt. So after about 2 hours of this out of no where there was a roll back so i wasted all my time. But despite that even though i was angry i let it go and started again this time harvesting wasnt so easy beacuse random people wandering around the map decided that this was a good place to make their home to which was fine with me i was showed kindness who was i to turn them away. Well they kept trying to attack me and kept trying to break into my house (which they couldnt) which made me take a lot longer to get resources. After about 3 hours of this i was about half way done and guess what happened. Ill wait...................If you guessed a random individual gave me everything i need and more out of the kindness of his heart......you were wrong but if you guessed another rollback you were 100% right. So everything was gone once again at that point id had enough.So to conclude Rust is a very fun game highly addictive and can be a great time alone or with friends. I highly recommend it.......AFTER the alpha AFTER the hackers are gone AFTER the rollbacks and once the community in it calms down. So as of right now i Highly recommend you wait till all the issues are sorted out",Rust

2014-02-07,0,0,275,True,Recommended,"240 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY My ""don't recommend it"" review is below this one. I have changed my stance surrounding the game a bit. It can be fun if you manage to get a couple of walls and a metal door up. Don't hoard stuff it's just going to end up in some other guy's crates anyway! Live in the now don't save stuff for later.As I play alone I tend to have a harder time than most. No one to cover me defend our base or help gathering resources. I have learned your best bet at survival in this case is to be friendly to anyone you meet.See guys in armour with guns? Give them some ammo for a gun you don't even have.See a guy being chased by animals? Shoot them lend him some food and go on.Just by doing this and never ever shooting them I became friends with an entire server. No one raided me no one shot me (on purpose) they gave me stuff for being a good sport if I get killed they give me my stuff back etc...The game is brutal survival is hard with all the hostile people. But perserverance and patience WILL get you along the dangerous roads of the world of Rust. 30 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY I've been playing Rust for 30 hours now and all I can say is that it's anything but entertaining. Not because of the game. But because of the community.Do you plan to play this game without friends? Don't. You will get robbed raided shot clubbed and mauled by everything. Do not think of making friends inside the game the people you share a fire with will kill you as soon as they can. do not think someone who says he's friendly will be friendly. He'll be that until you turn your back to him. When you finaly manage to build a house of your own know that the next day it WILL be raided of everything of value. They wait until you leave so they can take your belongings unopposed. But that doesn't matter because they all have modern weapons they can always recraft against your flimsy bow or medieval rifle.Do you plan to play this game with friends? Good luck it will take an hour before everyone is at the same place and alive! After that your main problem will be food and shelter. But because you are in a big group of people this will not be difficult. After that all that's left to be done is craft guns and rob people really. The next problem will be keeping your base defended. Big group of people big base large treasure chest for other people. Be prepared to do the same thing each night all over again unless you have someone who can stay online 24/7.I must say not everyone's corrupted but those people are new to the game and havent yet seen the devastating lack of morality this game radiates. You think the community of LoL is bad? Or that of Call of Duty? Try Rust.Let's talk about the game itself now shall we? The game looks nice astounding even for the Unity Engine it's built on. It doesn't shun adult nudity. Oh and the concept is wonderfull. But that's probably it the animals have only one sound effect per type they run stuttery from location to location. Wolves and bears do NOT stop chasing you even if they can't see nor hear nor smell you. Your only choice is to face them or let them kill you. And then there are the zombies who populate the irradiated places. Or rather used to populate.At first the zombies were dangerous yet manageable for even a freshly spawned person albeit a bit of finesse and skill was needed. Facepunch has chosen to replace them with something else because ""they didn't want Rust to be a DayZ clone"". Now we have regular wolves and bears. And red painted wolves and bears! So the exact same annoying creature you can't even kill meleewise unless you are loaded on medkits or it lags to one spot. Just got copy pasted and painted red. The zombies made sense this however...Before I end this review I'd like to say I did not make this out of pettyness like most of the other negative reviews. I played the game for a good enough amount of time and experienced it all. For as much I could at least. I did not enjoy myself for the most part. The only times I did was when I managed to take over a house no one lived in. I have yet to kill another human in this game mostly because I didn't want too. I regret my decision of never killing others as well as buying this game.TL DR don't buy it unless you plan to play with friends and expect hours of work for a bit of fun.",Rust

2014-04-09,0,0,185,True,Recommended,I cannot recommend this game enough. It combines the unlimited player interactions and tense pvp of DayZ and the crafting and survival element of Minecraft to make the ultimate survival game. The main problem I have with it is it is hard to set up unless you have friends to help as getting ganged up on by other players is hard to survive even if you are well equiped. But with friends this game is a blast. It is infitely fun to gather up your buddies and build a sky high tower and terrorize everyone that comes near. 10/10,Rust

2014-04-09,0,0,4,True,Recommended,A survival crafting game with some passing similarities to both Minecraft and DAYZ this game is nothing without other players. Played on a very low population server the game is far too easy to beat played on a high population server where everyone is fighting for limited resources you start to see the true genius. As a new player you will get ganked a huge number of times. During my very first playthrough I got chased halfway across the map by two players (who I managed to lose by hiding in some rocks near another newbie who then got killed in my stead) and spent my first night in the hills trying to hide my camp fire so I could cook what litte food I had managed to gather without poisoning myself. Spent the days hiding and the nights creeping around without a torch trying desperately to scrape together enough stuff to actually stand a chance....Brilliant game.,Rust
2014-04-09,0,0,50,True,Recommended,When I first downloaded Rust me and buddy sat down and played it for hours. It was fun and is a fun game. The crafting in the game works well and offers and experience a bit different to how would normally craft in other games.The map is good with decent town placements and (stuff). In fact this might be the first game other than Day Z that soley relies on other peoples psyche it's nice when a game put in a sort of real life fiction scenario.However one thing has got to me I don't find that fun anymore in fact I find it boring. sure meeting new people is a change but even that can get frustrating dependent on the person you meet. I just can't find the effort and spirit to play this any more nothing seems to excite me in the game anymore. Overall though the game is good but because it is an early access game you will find at times that the content in the game might not be enough at this current date.

However I think that if you introduced a skill tree system it would make the game more fun .

2014-04-10,0,0,75,True,Recommended,This game is great for people who love survival. It's a perfect mix of survival and imagination. It's also a game that can test even the best friendships trust me I'd know. Overall this is a great game and it's still in developement! So I can't wait until the game is finished this is just my opinion though. If you don't believe me then see for yourself.,Rust
2014-04-10,0,0,1342,True,Recommended,This is an awesome game. It's really fun and addictive especially because some servers can be modded and changed to battlefiled servers where it's like a shooting game. The game is super fun in survival because you can build up your house store your things in your house and keep your things safe. Then you can get C4 and raid other people's houses and get loot. Overall this is a great game and I HIGHLY recommend getting this game. IT will probably be your most played game ever. D,Rust

2014-04-03,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,This game starts out great but fails to deliver on so many levels. I realize it is still in alpha and under developement but the core of the game itself is flawed and boring. You end up farming forever just to get a gun and kill other people. The building aspect of the game is interesting but nowhere near as enjoyable as Minecrafts construction system. It forces you to connect objects perfectly thus removing creative buildings and forcing everything to look like an old western movie with crappy plywood sheds everywhere. Buildings take exorbitant amounts of time to build and offer little protection from someone who has a rock and wants to get in. Don't waste your 20$ on this game.,Rust

2014-02-28,0,0,110,True,Not Recommended,i bought this game about one month ago as soon as i started the game up and clicked a server when i clicked this server nothing happened so i selected another server. after trying about 10 servers from diffrent catagories of server and having none of them work i decided to look up solutions to my problem. i got many results such as lowering or raising the quality reinstalling the game direct connecting with the ip and not playing on fullscreen none of these functioned. it has been a while since then and i have still being trying every now and again yet it still will not function i am very dissapointed and i am writing this in hopes that someone will assist me or i will at least get some sort of compansation for the not funtioning game i purchased,Rust
2014-02-28,0,0,298,True,Recommended,"I've been playing since Alpha Extremely fun but challenging game. This is the first game I bought on STEAM and I haven't gotten tired of it. It's an instant classic for survival games honestly in a league of it's own. I've also had the fortune to meet some amazing online friends to play with. But as in any game I have also had the misfortune to meet some less than reputable people. This game is only in it's beginning stages but it is not for the faint of heart. You will die you will get set back but eventually after spending enough time learning to play and investing yourself in the game. You will begin to find your nitch and that moment is when this game really becomes enjoyable. The world map looks small but it couldn't be any bigger with day and night cycles you will actually measure distance in ""Days"" and begin to say things like ""It will take me (x amount) of days"" to get to there"" or ""We will head out in the morning"". I would suggest this game to anyone and everyone who likes survival games and a challenge. I don't want to use a rating scale because everyone is promised to have a different experience. My personal one I'm hooked and I wouldn't have it any other way. It is an individualistic experience that can't be explained in words. It is worth the money you pay for it even through your frustration of dying or being ""robbed"" you will still want to play.",Rust

None the less it is a amazing game and the best i'll ever play. I definitly reccommend this game. So worth 20$ also another complaint decaying i mean if this is realistic i didnt know wooden walls after three days just disapear this is rly annoying same with you sleeping when your not playing its just a way to just get us to play more and thats annoying. 9.5/10,Rust

2015-07-29,0,0,54,True,Not Recommended,I absolutely loved this game when it was first released. I spent half of my time trying to find the location of my friends and then trying to survive with my friends. I feel as if the game has gotten too complicated and too overrun by cheaters. Hopefully those things will be fixed and we can get back to the Rust we knew and loved. I missed my badass fort that no one could penetrate except the hackers now it takes entirely too long to get set up with new players. I use to recommend it to friends until they couldn't figure out what was going on and got killed every few minutes.,Rust

2016-07-13,0,0,194,True,Recommended,Best $20 bucks in a game. Been through the long haul and has seen it reincarnated over several times. Think of it as a social simulator. Different servers different mentalities. On one it can be a battle royale where the strong survive over the naked bodies of freshly spawned fodder. On another the players can set aside their competition and build structures to fight the helicopters and acheive larger goals. Each server is influenced by the players. Adventure is found in your imagination. Totally worth playing as long as you don't use cheats to ruin the experience for everyone.,Rust

2014-04-11,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Overall rust is a pretty great game. Really fun to mess around with other players when you have friends about. The Minecraft esque crafting is fluent and easy to use for the most part but could use a little work. The only problem I have the game is that getting M4's or other extremely valuable resources can be a problem. Players decked out in Kevlar armed with M4's will run around collecting airdrops and then raiding other people's homes. Also if anyone spots you in this game there's a 99% chance they'll be attempting to kill you in the next 5 seconds. All this aside Rust is a great game when with friends and has a lot of potential. I'd recommend getting it.,Rust
2014-04-11,0,0,118,True,Recommended,this game is so good,Rust
2014-04-11,0,0,80,True,Not Recommended,I liked this game at first but it's waaaaaay too unfinished and frustrating.It's a very big time sink and you will have to spend hours and hours grinding mindlessly and it's super boring just getting decent items and gear and when you finally get decent gear you'll probably just be so sick of how bad everything is about the game you'll just lose interest and move onto something else.The community is also really bad probably the worst I've seen in a video game in a long time. People constantly hack and grief just to be jerks and everyone abuses the game as well. It kinda ruins the experience since it's a multiplayer only title and you're just gonna get on immediately when you join a server (even if the server just wiped as well those people on there are so dedicated).It's basically Minecraft except the building and crafting part takes even more grinding and it's full of an even worse community really.BUT THE WORST PART OF ALL IS everything you do will probably get wiped in a week and since it's all bound by which server you join you'll lose any and all progress you make. The only way to succeed is probably by somehow finding a big group to join or trick your friends into buying this game to help you (make sure it's people who have too much money and are really annoying though they'll probably like this one).I guess it has potential really there are some really cool parts about it and it is an intense experience but I'm just sick of it completely right now and really frustrated with it.,Rust

2017-10-12,0,0,158,True,Recommended,Rust is a very interesting game that is still evolving at the time I am writing this review. With what time I have played I can say that the more survival elements of the game are very fun things like gathering supplies and building. My only problems with the game so far are that I play alone and the general mentality in the game is PvP or else. Most people try to kill me on sight and I have found myself slipping into this mentality too. With all that said it will be interesting to see where this game goes in the future.,Rust
2017-10-12,0,0,787,True,Recommended,As of october 2017 great game. Many people are because the game progression system has been reworked. Yes it is much slower but it makes servers last way longer and it gives people a second chance to restart if they lose everything. This is better for the greater portion of players who would rather play casually and not get oblirated on the first day.,Rust
2017-10-12,0,0,1061,True,Recommended,Very complete survival game Weekly updates (devs are doing a lot of effort they make mistakes sometimes but that's the only way to get the great progress they are archieving) Intense PvP Awesome housing and raiding Gives you a feeling of progresion Awesome combat system (bullets and arrows feel realistic not simple instant straight lines) Nice grafics Suports modded servers Nice Roadmap (development plans) Suitable for lone wolfs (freaking hard but viable if you are clever enough) Salty (it wouln't be the same without somebodys tears...)

2014-03-03,0,0,146,True,Not Recommended,This game is very poor even for an Alpha.

I have a decent computer and manage to only get 14fps. This makes it impossible to play.If you're wondering whether to get Rust or Dayz defininitely buy Dayz instead.

Then you are going to get some cool stuff...and die. until you get a team of people to help you you are again (you guessed it) GOING TO DIE. Truly a piece of work so far even if you get and pillaged by enemy players. So what they have satchel charges you have a rock!! Warning do not play this game without friends to help you... at least find an ally and team up against raiders. Also keep in mind that this game is still currently in Alpha. Honestly its great on its own but it would be amazing to see this game further develop. All in all great game 9/10 fro the PVE and 8/10 for the PVP.

I have been playing this game for nearly 3 years now and this is my overall review for this game so here it goes.This game is only multiplayer which is a shame so for people who dont have much internet dont bother getting this game.The graphics are quite good but can be painfull to run on my computer every known then.The nudity in this game is really disgusting which thank god you can censor the nudity.Every update that comes out for this game makes the game even better.The crafting is unlimited and takes time.Modded servers are awesome.F**k you hackers.Totally worth raiding other players.This game has many possibilities i give it 7.5/10,Rust
2016-01-21,0,0,114,True,Recommended,The best Life Simulator ever. You spend a few (in game) days on building a home for yourself and when it's finally ready some hooligans f*cking blow it up. Not that this happens a lot in real life but basically it's the same whatever you do in your life none of it matters and someone else wants and will ruin it. In the end you wake up naked in the forest with only a stone and a torch with you and you're sad and hate your life. You're broke and need to start it all over again. You have no family and you're still virgin even though you're 28.Pros and cons + Naked men. No achievements there is basically nothing to aim to. No offline or training mode. It would be a noob friendly option.,Rust

2014-03-05,0,0,3,True,Recommended,This game is fun and has great potential but there are some problems with it. PvP gets dull as new players get killed very easily and players with guns tend not to attack others with guns Building weapons takes less time and effort than it should and takes a lot of threat away from enemies and people alike Late gameplay boils down to finding food building an absurdly big house and making more weaponsI'm sure this game will be better later into development but for now it's merely acceptable.6/10,Rust

2014-03-06,0,0,716,True,Recommended,Its a game in development and has deserted the zombie idea. I don't see it taking a drastic turn anytime in the near future so it's probably best to get it now and watch it improve. Dont trust many people until you see how they are around others. It takes a while to get some legit weapons. My suggestion is to get on the modded servers they offer so the game can run a little quicker. I personally never play on the game the way it is. (only reason is really the crafting time)Its worth a play with friends over alone. but hey you can still have fun alone so go for it.Review 2 The game has came allot further in the many months. It is a great game. some of the cons though are consisting of very glitchy animals and close combat I have a spear that kills in three hits of a naked person. yet this dude with a rock hit me at the spears distance and somehow took no damage. It will you off really easy at that point. but its still worth a try. increased gathering on modded servers are still the way to go to get a good feel for the game quickly.,Rust

I occasionally venture out to try other games in the genre that my stream friends are playing but I always come back to Rust.

It's also one that will make you an insomniac. The game itself is all right it's the various multiplayer servers that are either hit or miss. You might end up on a poorly run server teeming with griefers or you could be on a server that has active admins and a sense of (some) honor about player killing.,Rust

2015-07-25,0,0,1002,True,Not Recommended,This game is currently on its second version (first rewrite).Its primary issue is that it's plagued by relentless hackers of all kinds walls aim clipping etc.It's been in Early Access for a very long time and the developers are still using that to their advantage. Essentially they claim support for three platforms collect money from users on all three and then publicly announce their discontent for 2/3 of these platforms. They chose to list them and sell the game to those platforms. They also choose not to support them whatsoever. As a result the game is unplayable on them.Additionally the game's performance is terrible frame rates are bad and network code provides lovely 10 second lockups.Wait until this game leaves Early Access to purchase at a bare minimum. It has been years since it originally released as an EA title and very likley has at few more to go before they're ready to actually support the decisions they made at release.,Rust

Now before all of you start screaming ""this is an Alpha"" please keep in mind how supporting an Alpha is supposed to work. An Alpha is presented to a group of players if players feel that it the game has potential they invest their money so that the developers can make advancements and improvements by hiring new staff discussing bugs with the Alpha community and incorporating game play recommendations into later builds (think Oculus Rift before FB acquisition). Garry and Facepunch cashed in on this desire to support a VERY promising game but have not hired new personnel rolled out consistent updates or cared to seriously consider the input of their backers and supporters. Facepunch also recently disabled comments on the Rust Alpha blog which says to me that they truly do not care what the community thinks (they could have hired a few interns to screen comments).

This game should be free to play just like DOTA 2 I believe within a year it will be so popular as DOTA 2. You still can earn money by providing server advertising certain things just like android does and etc. If you charge people for $20 I don't think this survival game will survive.,Rust

2014-03-07,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,The game is practically empty right now.The world is filled with mostly placeholders and it really feels like a pre Alpha Dayz with some minecraft crafting added in for good measure.It seems to have potential but the game is basically at 10 15% complete right now so defintely not worth 20 euros.Go buy Project Zomboid for a lot less for the survival thrill.,Rust

2014-03-07,0,0,58,True,Recommended,"This is a game that was introduced to me by a friend (the same person who introduced me to Steam as a matter of fact). And after seeing the footage and being a huge Minecraft guy I was pretty excited about the concept of this game. It looked really fun and intense! Not to mention another game that I can get together and play with some of my college buds from time to time.Like Minecraft you just spawn randomly in this large woodland area full of wildlife and you are given a rock a torch and some bandages (not to heal only to stop you from bleeding. Get used to that happening a lot). My first objective find my friends. After about an hour of aimlessly jogging through the woods and getting killed by animals I managed to find one of my buddies. I was so exicted and after about a night (In game of course) of searching for my friend number 2 we finally found him and could get started on the objective of the game Survive.Next thing you know we hear gunfire. A man in a white t shirt and a black mask comes in after the three of us. We weren't even the least bit prepared but since my buddies and I are regular team members across multiple games we spread out and thought of a plan. One of my friends managed to make hatchets for all of us along the way before he found me. So we all were armed with these homemade stone hatchets. Unfortunately the masked man got the best of us and killed us all.It's not like we had any weapons and the guy didn't even bother to address anything of the sort. He just walked up to us and opened fire on us 'Call of Duty' style.I respawned now distraught over having to re search for my friends over miles of hostile territory full of bears and wolves. Not to mention the local players of the somewhat crowded server we were on.I stumbled across another tower seemingly empty. I walked up to it and called out ""Hello?""CRACKSuddenly I turn around to find some guy trying to beat me over the head with a rock. He's fully clothed and wears a white mask. Then a voice from nearby says ""And in this corner we have *So and so* and in the other corner we have 'Costa Rica' ""It was another dude with a gun and in a black mask. I didn't recall volunteering for a brawl with rocks for some other dudes entertainment. So I tried to run but was gunned down quickly. Even after I quickly tried to explain that I was just passing through seeking my friends. Again no reason really to kill me. Nothing other than to watch me brawl with some player for his amusement.I respawn yet again.This time along my search for my buds I come across a guy asleep on the ground. He was in a poorly built structure with a foundation and some walls. I told my friends over Skype that I had found someone and they quickly told me to kill him.I didn't really want to but so far within mere hours of owning this game I have been defenseless and gunned down twice. For no real reason other than for one's own amusement most likely. So I did what needed to be done.In the world of Rust it is a cruel existance and only the strong survive. I managed to get some decent items from this sleeping man but nothing that would defend me from the gun weilding fort keepers. So I continued on.I passed through some of the mountain rocks when I came across a fortress. I didn't know if anyone was home but I was just trying to pass through to find a road.Someone was home and he was holding a shotgun in his hands. Aimed right at me.I stopped and went to tell him I was unarmed and friendly.BLAM!Dead.Not even a word from the other guy. Just opened fire because I got near his fort.Cool.Long story short my friends and I moved to a quieter server and managed to find a good spot with some good weapons. Recently however our fort was ransacked of some things and then again when we accidentally left our gate open. This dude waited for one of us to get back and shot us dead took our and left. Great.Not to mention today we finally met our not so friendly neighbors. We managed to make a truce but for how long only time will tell. As myself and my friends are planning on getting our and getting out of that area quickly.Conclusion I didn't really come here to complain and tell my story of how the whole KOS thing is amongst players. Because really this game is fun. If you are like me and are coming from a background in Minecraft then you will already be familiar with how most of this game works. Lots of crafting and building things.All of this is just a cautionary tale for those who were like me looking to find the same kind of peace Minecraft mainains. Or maybe just simply excited for this game because you saw a popular ""Let's Play er"" play it on YouTube.I don't recommend playing this game without some friends. As it is far too difficult to trust those who inhabit the deep bear infested woods. Not to mention the hundreds of inhabited forts filled with trigger happy trolls waiting to shoot you just because they can.Otherwise you are bound to grow very familiar with the respawn screen and the long nights alone with no resources and nobody to trust.Beware.TL DR This game is ing Minecraft on crack. Just add some guns radiation poisioning bears deer pigs and wolves. Not to mention tens of thousands of other players sharing the same map that you do with resources worlds better that are willing to shoot you just because they can. I DO NOT recommend playing this without a tusted friend. Because no matter what unarmed or not there are going to be people who want to kill you just because they want your Beware.",Rust

2015-07-28,0,0,327,True,Recommended,I play on the Seattle FacePunch Community server since i first started playing a few days ago. This game has a lot of potential if they can prevent some of the hackers from teleporting through walls and running like Carl Lewis on meth. Parties in game would be a good idea as well so you can see where other people in your group are on the map. Everything right now seems to be pretty early still even though the game was released a year and a half ago.I just hope this doesn't end up being one of those early access games that yet again never even makes it to beta.,Rust

2014-11-10,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,Possibly the worst game community I have ever witnessed. Everyone just wants to kill your character even with nothing on you but stones and wood. This game could have so much more potential if new players were given a period to build up some form of shelter and clothing.,Rust
2014-11-10,0,0,116,True,Not Recommended,"Now I don't usually review things but this one really deserved a great ing review. Rust used to be great actually. Until these problems arose. HackersThis is a big problem in Rust. You join a server get wood and supplies. Build a nice crap hut. Boom. A hacker flies right into your hard earned base steals your precious items and flies right back out. Have you ever gotten a head shot with a pistol from 1000 meters? Well the hackers sure have! It doesnt even matter if you are inside a base or not you still get shot! Hackers are ruining the game and when they dont want to get caught the blame falls on you. Reporting a hacker is horrible! You can't get any thing from reporting a hacker They still go on server and turn them into GlitchesA problem in every early access game is glitches. The glitches arent major but there are a few that people take to advantages. Rock glitching. Here's a great idea lets place a sleeping bag inside a rock and build our base there! This is so annoying. Lets say you get raided the people take your loot either suicide into the rock or just set home. All your loot is now impossible to get back because you cant go into a rock. Those things are invincible! you can sleeping bag glitch like they did. But only to find that you have been banned ServersServers in Rust arent the best. Everytime you log on search for a new server to start on you find hundreds of empty servers flaoting around hiding all the good ones. Also most admins are careless. Banning innocent players letting hackers stay on. ""Let me turn on invisible and stalk the hackers!"" News flash they can still see you! Its called ESP. IM sure every player has heard of it. The reason why hackers are still on is because once the ""see"" the invisible admin they turn their hacks off and still continue shooting down players. Pretending that the admins arent there. Sometimes They may shoot or kill the admin. Still the admin doesnt want to ban them and continues to ban you because the hackers friends have newly joined and start blaming you for hacking. Its 7 against 1. Of course the admins will believe the hackers. So you get banned. This is a horrible proble in rust. Also the official servers have no admins. Ever. i had a ""good"" hacker fly up to me and say ""Hackers own this game and this server"" That is incredibly true The CommunityThe Rust community sucks. Most of the players are total jerks and dont care what they do. You join a server you have your wood and But you look behind you and see are fully geared players. Youre naked he is full kevlar. You beg with him not to kill you. He pulls out his M4 and shoots you . The worst part is. He doesnt take your items. He leaves it to degenerate. What was the point in killing the new player if you werent going to takr his stuff? I liked this game. Now i dont 4/10",Rust

2014-11-11,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,The games ideas are very good but is plauged with bad servers and a shed load of bugs and hackers are having a field day. the maps are often wiped so you lose all your hard work and if or more likley when you die its a nightmare to find your old hut/cabin as the maps are so big just a map would be good on the other hand it is a survival game and is good at that. Some good amount of time spent by the developers to solve the bugs within the game would be well received for an early release im not seeing as much development as i have with the likes of other early releases like space engineers so i am hoping that more time is spent because this has the foundations of being a very good game but for now i would leave the game for a few months until buying to see if the game is actually going to get these fixes.,Rust

2017-10-08,0,0,1016,True,Not Recommended,I've played Rust for almost 2 years and I've had a blast with all the fun and great moments but I can't recommend the game in it's current state. The recent component blueprint update is fantastic and the mechanics are being patched up well but that's pointless if you can't even run the damn game. I never had problems running Rust in the past up until March 2017. Some weird update came along and is causing ridiculously bad performance. Many say it's a memory leak and I think so too because my fps slowly drops from 70 to 15 over the span of 1 hour. It's definitely playable but very unenjoyable to have to constantly restart the client every hour. I've tried every trick in the book and nothing fixes the problem. It's not my problem it's Facepunch's. Not everyone experiences this but many still do. If you turn out to be one of the unlucky people to suffer from the memory leak you'll understand how frustrating it is. This is the reason why I am quitting Rust. Until this bug is finally fixed I'll change my review to positive and start playing again.,Rust

2015-09-07,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"It took a good 5 minutes to finally join a server due to the long loading time. The bad optimisation was obvious from the start I had to tune down the graphics to almost minimum to get a somewhat playable game even though I'm able to run most AAA games on medium/high at least but yeh yeh it's Early Access so it was expected nevermind.As soon as I got that right two teenagers ran up to me with a heavily irritating voice. They asked me if I have a mic I didn't even know which one is the push to talk button at that point so i shaked my camera and they understood. Not a moment too soon someone killed me from behind while I was distracted. The three guys just stood there on my corpse and said ""lol"" out loud multiple times while the screen slowly turned to black. I also met a guy who's only aim in life was to kill every newly spawned played fully geared with body armor and a Thompson machine gun. I discovered half the community of this game under 20 minutes just by these random encounters idiotic teenagers and trolls. Also note that literally 90% of the people will try to kill you if they have the upper hand even if it's pointless because you have no real loot on you. ""Just for the lolz.""Lacking friends to play with I realised that's probablly all I'm going to get in the first hours of the game so I kindly asked for a refund. Did not regret it.To sum it all up graphics are ok but requires way better hardware to run it smoothly than it should but this hopefully gets taken care of before release game occasionally stops for a second character movement and actions can be laggy sometimes need more spawn variety to prevent constant spawncamping/piling up on each other to the point it becomes a naked man free for all community is mixed you'll meet a bunch of and trolls early on get into a clan or make friends as fast as possible but... don't trust anyone most people would do anything to get your stuff that includes ganging up on you with their friends PLAY THIS GAME WITH YOUR FRIENDS seriously don't go solo it will considerably reduce your playing experience.",Rust
2015-09-07,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Giving Rust a thumbs down here. I understand its early access.&gt Graphics Not that great. A lot of clipping and tearing. Animations were horrid. Looked nothing like the pictures. A lot more cartoony.&gt World Other than the landscape littered with half destroyed structures it was empty and it felt that way. Hardly any wildlife roaming around to farm for useful stuff and when I did find them they slid away from out of sight in a half run half skating motion.&gt Gameplay lit my torch at night making me a beacon for other players. Was quickly killed because of it. Respawned and harvested materials for about a half hour. Was promptly killed again at first sight of another player.Overall I found the community to be horrid. The game itself lacks any depth or complexity of gameplay. Basically a naked version of hunger games with more sausage flying around than a farmers market.

2014-04-25,0,0,78,True,Not Recommended,Such a horrible game you can thank the majority of the players in the game for ruining the experience. It's like yay I got a bunch of stuff to help me out and survive etc. And then someone comes up and acts like they are friendly and boom! Kill you and take all your stuff. Not recommended unless you like getting off a lot.,Rust
2014-04-25,0,0,37,True,Recommended,This game is one of the best survival games out there. The game is beautiful and extremely fun even when you meet a couple of non friendly players that only want to kill you. The graphics are great for an Alpha state game some textures could use a little tweaking like the trees and mutated animals. The sound effects are great everything has sound effects even when you equip armor you hear how your character zips up. One of the coolest features is that once you place something it stay there forever but it is also a problem since a misplaced pillar can ruin your house. This forces you to build carefully something most games can't acomplish. Overall this game is really great and can only get better. One more thing beware the community some will help but others will stab you in the back.,Rust

2014-04-24,0,0,274,True,Recommended,If you don't want to deal with the bandits in Dayz come try Rust. In this game you'll have alot of fun. Stake your claim and rule the land. Build a house to the heavens gather recources so you can build and discover new technologies. Make friends and try not to make enemies along the way. For the people of Rust are a new breed of bandits. They'll take your pants put you in a hut. They'll say that they will protect you and keep you safe. But you will remain pantless and afraid. So stay away from others and grab a couple close friends to help you out on your journy in the land of Rust. Also beware of flying bears and the band of marry men known as the N.P.B. other wise known as the No Pants Bandits. They will find you and they will take your pants.,Rust

2014-04-25,0,0,20,True,Recommended,An oddly realistic reimagining of the survival elements of Minecraft on a server. Currently you are victim more to the whims of other players than those of the game itself but despite infinite resources the joy of creating a home for yourself and getting together all you need to protect yourself is very satisfying. I'm looking forward to it being finished.As a side note the community servers are wonderful. As a new player asking for advice and information will get you advice and information and I've even had people friendly enough to adopt me into their little groups.Great players great game.

2014-03-11,0,0,42,True,Recommended,I'm of two minds whether to actually recommend this or not. It's a grand social experiment and a well done and very playable game already (reviewing alpha early access). But the results of the experiment for the short term seems to reward the worst sort of people. And so the d bags seem to stay and the sorts who would make it a more interesting game seem to be passing on it at least for now. tl dr for early access If it's worth $20 to spend a weekend exploring a unique game experience and aren't easily frustrated and won't feel badly discovering it's not for you then buy it. I'm glad I did but I don't expect to play much unless the community evolves a little.As an eve online player I actually got happy the first few times I died in unfortunate circumstances. The learning curve is steep and the rules unforgiving and I generally enjoy that sort of gameplay.In its present form the game's biggest turnoff arguably is its vulnerability to hackers and exploiters. Until holes are patched expect to encounter players who can outrun you can walk through walls or can cause you to disconnect on contact. If I understand bans on official servers are batched and performed every few weeks but bans on community servers only apply to that specific server rather than to the account and admins may not be around when needed.The second turnoff is the present state of the community and the fact that the game mechanics seem to deter the evolution of true settlements and teamwork. If you have a semi safe building to stash things in it seems the most effective way to increase your supply is to kill every player you come across and take what they have. Even if they're just a naked player with a rock they're likely to have a small pile of wood and stone or cloth and there's no repurcussions for just shooting them and taking it. This is made a little worse by the fact that you cannot see another player's name over long distances. By the time you can identify an individual you're too close for safety or more likely already dead.Now all this wouldn't be terrible if there were more in the game that facilitated the ability for a law abiding society to rise from the anarchy which I would think should be the natural evolution for this game. One an individual level however there is no way to mark territory or claim land other than patroling with guns and teaching everyone the hard way to give your home a wider berth. On a commuity level again there is no way of telling at an appropriate range who is a member vs an 'outlaw' so even attempts to build a safe community seem to fail especially with a relatively small player base per server coming and going throughout the day.And yet there's fun and there are strategies I've learned in just a few days playing that help mitigate a lot of the shortcomings. You learn to hide things and never all of anything in one place. You learn not to carry what you cant afford to lose. You learn the map and the landmarks. You learn efficient ways to re equip as a freshspawn. And I learned to remember it's in alpha and not to rage over its shortcomings.,Rust

2014-04-18,0,0,71,True,Recommended,It's a great game and a great experience although you can only fully enjoy the game if you're in a group or with friends. For me I was lucky as I made friends pretty quickly. I had nothing I was constantly dying due to hunger and I could never get enough wood to build a home as everytime I would get the right amount some random guy would kill me and take everything. In the end (about a few hours into playing) I start talking on the chat asking if anyone wanted to team up. It wasn't long before a nice guy said that he would be my friend and shortly after that someone else asked if he could be my friend. The two guys I met knew the map well however I didn't. I added them both and the next day I set off trying to find them and this I what I hate about Rust the most. The navigation is impossible and everything looks the same to a newbie which means that finding people takes hours. I understand it's all about survival and in real life situations there wouldn't be maps but surely adding in a compass you can craft wouldn't hurt anyone? After eventually finding my friends and moving into their house I finally began to enjoy the game so much more. We could go out on hunts and meet new people without the constant fear of hunger and loneliness. I guess the fact that so many people kill on sight adds to the problems of getting started on the game especially since the game has been out for a while. My downfall is that I'm too nice and I always try to make friends and never kill anyone which usually ends up with them killing me instead. My best advice is just to talk to people on chat and try to make friends but I know from my own experiences how difficult that can be...,Rust
2014-04-21,0,0,43,True,Not Recommended,"I will be fairly honest. This game is just Ok at the moment It does take alot of time to start up as there are plenty of people running around with guns killing fresh spawns.In addition The characters teleport everywhere due to bad integration with servers maybe due to 150 people having different pings but its still no excuse as the ""stone age"" or start up weapons are almost useless such as arrows and stone hatchet as it is nearly impossible to hit them. but Once you get to stage with Pistol It becomes Ok. Its like there are no object and feels bland when you are playing the gameYes I do understand its a Survival game and still in Alpha stage. but its been the same for awhile and I am slowly getting tired of the gameplay as it just don't have anything else other than kill people and eat and live.In terms of the Alpha stage people's been getting Chicken breasts since the release of the game and its still the same It literally feels like that there is no progress of development at all as a player. It feels like the community is more involved than the Developer themselves as community made their own maps for sakes and named the location themselves. This game would potentially be dead without the community's support. The devs says they do have a plan and to trust them but I am slowly losing the trust. and most of the updates were utterly useless. and it feels awful as a player in the game.",Rust

2014-04-29,0,0,39,True,Recommended,You get to beat feeble minded survivors with rocks then harvest their loot. You can then upgrade from a rock to a rock on a stick which is may I say great for domestically abusing pooh bear or Wile E Coyote. Which you can then harvest their delicious chicken breasts to keep you fed and their skin to wear as a nice onesie to show off to your friends. (you will be the talk of the wasteland)10/10 would buy only 14.99 a great deal considering there is so many inventive ways for killing not only humans but animal s as well and maybe a zombie or two.See you out there and remember if you like your the way it is kill anyone and everything as if you dont they will you and steal your chicken breasts!!!!!.,Rust

2015-08-19,0,0,83,True,Recommended,"So far the game is really good. It has its cons however which i shall list first!CONS Many players in certain servers are too ""far ahead"" and very unforgiving on naked unequipped players (Even when you shout friendly down the mic) I found it really difficult initially to kill any animals they are so fast when you only have a melee weapon I recommend crafting a BOW ASAP!! Not sure if its just me or my setup but each time I left click my character moves forward which can be a pain!! I found the map quite hard to figure out initially. In nearly all servers I've played on the rocks I harvest do not seem to regenerate at all. 9 hours i played on one server on and off night and day with a fixed base etc and the rocks around me never respawned? Not sure if this is supposed to be that way or not but barrels and collectibles did random respawn! Cant think of any more Cons. Will be setting up a server tomorrow and most likely be using some Oxide mods to see what kind of fun i can have for server address please just ask I will be tailoring it to what players want!!!",Rust

The hackers have been very minimized for a while now. I don't remember the last time runnning into one. If you choose official servers try the rustafied branches they are official servers that still have admins. This game is really beginning to take off in the right direction.

Although it is not a bad game the slow development speed makes it not worth buying it so early perhaps wait until the full release.

2014-10-29,0,0,175,True,Not Recommended,The game is fun a lot of fun but only for a very short time. When I first bought it and played with friends it was a blast and we played it all the time but now I cannot ever get an urge to crank it back up. The development time of new content has been poor and it's sad because it's the dev's from GMOD. The development of the game was halted when they abruptly decided to completely rebuild the game. This is a big issue with most early access games. The dev's keep showing you hints and glimpses at new content but it's never released. If it hadn't been so long for the development team to push out a more functional and better working game than I would gladly be placing it as a recommended game. DON'T GET ME WRONG the game is fun with friends if you wanna joke around and raid but it loses it's spark quickly. This is a very stale game to play alone. PROS Fun with friendsHumor is rich in a very indirect wayCONS The world is dull and bland with really no environmentThe weapons in the game take away from it being a survival game to a grind as many resources as fast as possible to kill the people annoying you game.UI is still poorly done even after the game being avilalbe for so longThe map is HUGE but only 1/7 of it is actually playable. Not fun to play aloneNo PvE (personal opinion PvE should be in this game)Overall the game isn't bad despite me giving it so many cons. It is an average game that has SO MUCH potential but isn't being used. Final PERSONAL Verdict 6/10 It is an average game with base building simulation and raiding. A lot of fun with friends.The only reason I would not recommend this game is solely because of the lack of content after how long it's been out and for those that look to play alone may not enjoy being raiding by 6 or 7 guys right after spending a few hours building and gathering.,Rust

BUT they then reported me to the admin for hacking. I talked to the admin and he let me be.Found my friend two hours in and started building a house. THEN was aproched by a person who told us not to build where we had or we will start something we cant finish.SO....... in conclusion. this game is great.......... the community are toxic.,Rust

I play on the servers that have the lowest ping so I don't have lag but all of those are full of trolls hackers and s that don't let you atleast try to get more than a few supplies. I can't play on empty servers because the ping is way too high and it lags way too much to put up with.

2014-03-16,0,0,267,True,Recommended,This game is very worth buying for only $20 in fact it is the best Alpha i have played in a long time ) the only down side of this game is that there are a stupid amount of hackers who will just take away hours days even weeks of work. If you look on my rust photos that ive been bothered taking you'll see what im talking about!!! &gt ( But a good way to deal with this is to join a friend that knows if there are hackers on their server or a better way join a youtuber's server becasue they are the ones that really care.

Hours wasted. Repeat.I know that that's part of the appeal for some people but I personally really hate it. I've lost everything about ten times now. I'm tired of starting over again and again and again. I feel like I can't move forward in the game because I'm constantly losing everything to the s in game.

2014-04-24,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,"Rust does right for the people who enjoy it.Rust gives the players who get into it the rush they crave such as spotting someone in the distance approaching your base and feeling a twange of apprehension. By using other players as the wall between you and progress it gives a level of competition that isn't present in most games. For the people who enjoy this game it is a rare gem of difficulty in a field of games that have gone soft.... I'm not one of those players and I suspect most people arent.I remember sometime ago when I was a bit younger a friend of mine showed me an idea he had for a game. After looking through it a couple of times I told him ""this game would only allow a small handful of people to win at any given time"". I told him no one in their right mind would make such a game because it wouldn't be much of a money maker. Funny thing is Rust is exactly that type of game. The limited nature of resources and the superiority of having the best equipment ensures that a small handful of people will do well on any given server at any given time... to everyone else's detriment.I found myself drawn into Rust for the promise of being able to build up my own ideas for forts and defend them against other players but quickly found that if I didn't team up with others I stood little chance of survival. And that's fine. I usually solo but I can play in groups if the need arises. I siddled up with a small group of players trying to make it in the world. I understand that this probably meant that my ideas would go unused as I'm not really the leader type. I was more then willing to tolerate that but it turns out it didn't really matter. Whenever we got anything remotely resemble progress we were quickly targeted by the top players of the server who had plenty of means to break through our meager doorways and rob us blind. Even limiting our base building and trying to look impoverised didn't help much. It seems the best players have ways of telling who's faking it. I tried to stick with it and ended up to be the only person not to rage quit but that essentially left me alone and at square one.It probably a good thing that Rust doesn't offer a demo period because I wouldn't have bought the game otherwise. I hear the game was snapped up by a lot of people when it first opened up.And the thing is I want to play this game. I've had ideas for tricky buildings that would target the raiders specifically sending them to their doom. Hell I'm not opposed to playing to other people's detriment. But my position as a soloist/non leader type means I either play solo and never get anywhere significant or join a team and have a small chance at helping other people achieve their ideas... but probably not. Difficulty is one thing. But making other players the chief obsticle really means only small amounts of players will be able to get the full benefit of this game at any given time. Hey if your good and your lucky you'll be one of them. Well maybe. If your a leader type personallity then you will occasionally do well in Rust. Probably. You'll have a better chance then me at any rate. But for anyone coming into this hoping to build your own designs to fight off other players well think twice. Okay? I'm not saying you won't do well. I'm not telling you not to get this game. Just think twice. The odds are against it but for the most determined of players that's the best kind of game. I just saying that if your looking for a high wall that's surmountable with enough effort play Dark Souls instead. Some games are always surmountable with enough effort. Whether Rust is surmountable depends on the other players. And they're not that kind.All that being said you know Rust is 20 bucks. That's not that much. If you fancy yourself a hardcore competive player by all means. It's definatelly one of those love it or hate it type games.",Rust

You start off with a stone rock (as a tool or weapon) medi kit and a torch.

2014-05-07,0,0,166,True,Recommended,I am finding this game to be an accurate depiction of human communities in a survivalistic world. The complaints I hear about player killing can easily be avoided with smarter gameplay. I rate this game well because although unfinished and buggy here and there this game shows promise. I spend hours planning and strategically building my resources and houses. This game made me feel like a survivor and amazed me with the range of people.Only points that it could improve better moderation control better player behaviour moderation clicking for every item quantity you want to craft (it is only a problem if you want over 100 of something)This game was very good and deserves praise. Being a tester I am happy to say I could lose myelf in this game for days if I had time. D,Rust

2015-08-13,0,0,24,True,Recommended,I have to retract my earlier review. This game takes some tweaking but its Great for building and survival. Climates effects Resources Items are very well thought of and really not hard to find. The Survival part takes Thought and skills as well If you hear gun shots go in the oppisite direction. As a matter of fact stay alert for footsteps of any kind..dont fight animals unless your well equipt. Its a game of dodge anyone until your inventory is stocked. The graphics are good but require tweaking on a low end system. Be ready to flight or fight. I cant wait to see what the developers come up with next. Yes its worth the money. Very promising.,Rust

First they tried a graphics redo which makes it looks awesome but there was no content really to play on except for just random land spaces and no threat aside from a few random animals and mostly other human players.I still recommend the game but at the same time would recomment buying it during a sale or something at this time or until they have a more defined plan for the game itself.,Rust
2014-03-06,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,"ATM I cannot recomend this game. If you enjoy ripping apart peoples hard work and running around completely ruining other peoples gameplay then this is for you. It's truly sad actually. This game has so much potential but ""people"" completely ruin the experiance in every aspect. They do not care if you only have 1 wall built with only pants on they will just kill you and then tear down the one little wall you started. Then they will come find you and keep killing you. There is actually a lot to do in this game you can even build entire towns if people werent complete s. It actually sucks games like this are going to be dead because the trolls and childish actions cause people like me to set the game aside and hope that maybe one day it will change but I doubt that. Unless the Devs come up with a way for people who are just out right mean and are truly trying to destroy your gameplay get penalized I don't see myself going back to this. Like others say being killed by a naked guy with a rock screaming beans and potatoes is funny but this will hapen to you over and over and over. not only that just when you manage to get where you want to be..you will be raided robbed killed maybe even trapped just waiting to die while a group stands there telling you how much shiiit you are and basically trying to get you to kill yourself. So. this game rocks the community blows!",Rust

2015-08-10,0,0,65,True,Recommended,"Rust10/10 Still play over and over...What can I say? I've played the early alpha the new version early alpha and have been keeping up on most of the work (gaming wise) as much as I can. I'm really enthused about this release and have gone quite far with it not as much as some although. The game play is amazing the weapons feel realistic and the crafting system is starting to get fine tuned. The graphics are excellent I play on beautiful. Every night has its moments a few pants and some mental mind boggling happens. ""Was that a bear or a deer?"" With the maps available online for the server you're playing on one can get their bearings as well as create their own map in game. The loot on the ground makes it much easier for casual players to not get and rage quit when someone comes along kills you... over and over and over... rinse and repeat. Get used to it or find a nice server or some nice friends to play with. I'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Have a nice stay or at least enjoy that thrill you used to get when playing a really good game. The agile development of the game I bet is allowing us the customer to join them along the creation of something great and help along the way. I don't follow release notes or complain on forums I enjoy the game they made for me. Props to the whole Rust team at Facepunch and thanks for making a super game!

2015-09-04,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,I check back in on this game every few months. Unfortunately while new content is getting added (which is great!) the same problems that have always plagued the game continue to do so. The official servers are full of hackers and plagued by lag which makes the game near unplayable (that one lag spike in pvp means all that nice gear is now gone). Gameplay is good and if you go onto the private servers the problems that plague the game are near none existant however your then basically playing a single player game due to low numbers of people so what's the point? The game showed such potential but if such a basic concept of fixing the lag hasn't been fixed since it's release then my faith in this project is all but lost. If I could get a refund I would.,Rust

2014-05-11,0,0,68,True,Not Recommended,DO NOT SPEND $20 ON THIS GAME....I am aware that this game is in Alpha however The game is virtually unplayable thanks to the huge amount of hackers on every server.From aimbot to superspeed they are unavoidable and constant regardless the server or time of day you play.Admins are suppose to be present to inhibit such behavior and ban the most agressive offenders Good luck. IF an admin is on there is far too much cheating occur at any moment that they cannot actively manage the server or they simply dont care. Admin Abuse itself is even rampant!Graphics and terrain is simple and cartoon like. Character Models are a trainwreck. Animations are choppy and delayed. To actually hit someone you must watch their glitching charachter and attempt to guess where they will be when your bullet/arrow lands.The guns lack physics or a bullet drop. So you can snipe anyone w/o skill as long as you have line of sight. I mean the combat it just horrible. To watch 3 or four people run around in a scrum with hatchets as they all glitch and clip around eachother unable to make contact with one another is painful to watch.The sandbox style resource gathering and base building is the highlight of this game but is unfortunately broken by the reasons mentioned above. Please don't waste your money on this game Dayz is a similar Alpha stage title that is far better has great combat high risk high reward playstyle that I would reccomend well before you venture into Rust.,Rust

2015-09-04,0,0,102,True,Recommended,"3 hours in...I finally had the foundations down for my house. It was a little off the beaten path but not too far from those precious resources. The new procedurally generated map offered a much better experience than my previous involvement in rust a year ago. More varied less predictable establishments. Except for the big clan bases. Those guys plant right in the center of large fields. My home was a little out of view of the largest base. I was out collecting wood one day when some naked man came up behind me with a torch. He beat me with it. And stole all I had. Including the key to my lock. Luckily he didnt know where my place actually was. I had to build a second establishment close by. Unfortantly it was a little in view. 5 hours in...I never play with fire at night. Too dangerous. Too foolish. So I was chilling in my shack avoiding the cold. i could only scrape enough cloth together for some pants to hide my shame. But it was enough. I had food shelter and clothing. The only thing I lacked was friends. In the pitch black of the night was the worst for raiders. They went to high ground looking for fires and unsuspecting victims. Really thos people deserved it. Better them than me rigth? Unfortuitiously a man happened to come down the hill precisely where i had hid the shack. I heard the foot steps and shuddered. I could hear him traversing the remains of my previous base where I had hid the entrance to the new one. It was a quick job but it had befuddled others. I figured he would assume it was empty and move on as there was no door in view at a glance. He decided to look further however. I didnt have time to shut my door. I huddled to the corner beside the door clutching my bone blade I had made not but an hour before. He came into view. Head to toe in full armor and AK47 in hand. He didnt see me as my storage chest were directly across from the door. He went for it and I went for him. Stab Stab Stab i floundered in the dark. I heard a clunk as my blade bounced off his helmet. $#!t he turned to me with the AK and opened up. I tell you this! I did not expect the shoddiness of my construction to safe me. His bullets destroyed my base. I fell two floors down. I heard a scream of agony. ""What the heck?"" The sun was starting to come up. I could kindof see. I made my way back upstairs... Silence. My house was in shambles. Only two walls remained. One section of floor. Where did he go? Surely he wanted my loot. The it hit me. The cliff beside my home the scream. I rushed down to inspect and sure enough. All his nights loot armor warm clothes weapons. A gold mine. Six hours it would have taken for me to gain whart I had just won by chance. I grabbed all I could and ran. He would be back. ASAPI scurried away up the hill to start a new base. One the was secret. Another tricky cliff dive I think. And someplace far away from... him... and vengeanceWhat a good game this is turning out to be. Im glad they redid everything. I had to turn down the graphics for my meager rig. But once I did it was great fun. Sucked a whole day away. And I feel like playing so much more. Well worth the money I think. Just take your time. Ask for advice. And dont mind the trolls.",Rust

Keep in mind that this game is still in the alpha stage so glitches (and glitch cheaters) will happen and it is constantly changing. I did not like the previouse version so when 2.0 came out I was very pleased with what they have accomplished so far. Again this current version is a alpha very early stage test release. But so far very much fun to play (if you can stand the raiders and cheaters or same thing).,Rust

2014-05-11,0,0,30,True,Not Recommended,"_The game Rust has made me only play for a few hours. It has gotten boring and the reason why it is boring in my opinion is because there isnt much to do except build and kill._What I mean is what is given is a large variety of servers and as you get on the server you have to run like a bat out of hell when you first spawn. Because many players like to camp there and kill you and chat is filled with many people accusing others of ""hacking"" when really they are just pro when it comes to shooting. (Most players treat this game like COD or any other shooting game out there) _You have the corupt/abusive staff on most servers who join in on a group chat bullying a noob and calling names or just not helping anyone at all. _I do love the concept of the game but it also needs lots and LOTS of work... I mean really it shouldnt have even been released. And I dont think anyone will update it any time soon. _The game is very buggy and it starts to get on my nerves which is why I dont want to play it anymore. _The building in this game sucks. I can only make a square house if I do build it doesnt come out right and placing things to build the house can cause it to have a space you cannot fill in. Basically you have a gap in your house wall and someone can walk into your home and there is no way of filling it up. Most servers you cant break down something you built. _I dont reccomend this game YET. I say give it a year and maybe just maybe the game will be better then what it is today.",Rust
2014-05-11,0,0,233,True,Recommended,Rust...what can i say about a fun enjoyable game like rust.let's see...oh COMPLETLY AWSOMEyou spawn with a rock 2 bandages and a torch your only goal is to survive.i only got the game because my friend said it was fun i realy didnt enjoy but thats because i didnt understand itthis game is so amazing when my friend finaly got on our big trouble was trying to find eachother but we finaly did we did so many amazing things we decided to hide in the mountain's since its more peacefule there untill we could get a gun we noticed that there are these rad zones filled with radiation if your rads go over 500 your dead but the rad areas are full of research kits if you cant craft something you can use these research kits so when you die you can craft it again but me and my friend (jeseipi) decided to wait untill were more radiation resistant come to find out we find this guy's house full of epic loot he had a 9mm pistol along with 9mm ammo i took that when i saw it and found these things called rad pills that take off radiation so after i gathered those i thought we should set camp for the night it began as two little shaks and a campfire outside the a little later after gathering enough materials we had a little tiny fort then we set up this thing called a foundatio wich was wood block used for walls or something so after a little bit more we had this room that noone could raid unless they had c4's (very rare in the game) then i decided to finaly use the rad pill's and go get some epic loot i heard about in the rad zones i brought my gun with me because there are radiated animals and are deadly so after picking off the animals i entered the zone and found lots of things like research kits and rad armor while jeseipi was gathering resources i thought while he gather's resources ill just help us advance in technology and we got to the point where jeseipi had made us this nice sized fort and i had gotten us from 1 pistol to m4's and silencer's so we decided to go to the rad zone together (we had gathered alot more rad pills) and we would work on getting research kits so we can learn how to craft things we dont know how to craft (when you start you can craft the basic stuff under the crafting list you use this research kit to add to the list so you can craft it) and then we had to go for the day so when i got back on i found that a noob had taken his time to break one of my walls and steal all of my things this included m4 two 9mm pistol's and three p250's all my good armor and bunches of important mateial's. so that leaves with me having to recraft everything i did eventualy gt everything (jeseipi was offline and i decided to check on our base while he was away and when you disconnect your character's body will lay there till you log on again leaving you 100% vulnerable unless ur behind a metal door) and the rest of the story will continue tommorow 5/11/2014 at 5 00pm.i highly recommend this game it is extremly fun everyone needs to know this game it is so realistic as well i love the ambience as well there are even Some servers where people have built large villages me and jeseipi went on an empty server so we wouldnt get raided right away.,Rust

2014-02-16,0,0,1981,True,Recommended,"Chapter 1 BeginningsSomething about the mountains distant goliaths towering in perpetual gloom pulled me towards them. Newly awake on the sunlit beach sand still clinging to my bare head and body where they had pressed upon the earth in my slumber I knew that I must travel north to seek these giants. Though I failed to understand the perils and the journey required to reach them I understood that I must live upon them in humble awe of their presence.It was as I contemplated this that I first heard footsteps. New to this world a humble babe drinking in his surroundings I turned to greet whatever traveler called these lands home. My first neighbor perhaps? Alas a brief glimpse of flesh the swing of an axe and my brains spattered across the pristine sands. My body fell back to the ground as if returning to the rest it had so recently awakened from.Chapter 2 And So We LearnRising again from the sands of Newman Beach I once again stared off towards the far distant mountains this time wiser for my traumatic end. I immediately set out running not sure of my path but ultimately sure of my destination. Heading vaguely towards the Mother of Mountains towering above the other peaks like a stern mother gazing over her brood I stopped along the way to gather the supplies that I knew I would need for my journey and new home.Wood for the fires that would warm and the shelter that would protect. Stone for the tools that would shape and the foundations that would support. Metal ore for the blades that would rend. Sulfer ore for the powders that would propel. Flesh for the hunger that would consume.These things I gathered through means both true and unsavory. Wood from young saplings that would grow no more. Ore from ancient boulders that had witnessed the birth and death of my ancestors for time uncountable. Flesh from the bones wildlife who fell prey to my hammer. Once starving and bleeding faced with an undeniable need to consume or to die I slew a wary traveler and ate of his corpse. Calming and coaxing him to join me in resource gathering I struck him down from behind while he chopped at a tree. While this deed haunts me I must admit I enjoyed the savor of his flesh.Thus after countless hours spent gathering foraging and killing I felt prepared to complete my journey up the ever closer mountains so that I might settle a small shack live in austerity and contemplate on the deeds I had committed in reaching my goal. Alas as I turned north once again to face my Gods I heard the fateful patter of food steps. More wise yes much more wise I spun to greet them hammer in hand prepared to maul any who would threaten my sojourn.I was greeted by the flare of a muzzle and the roar of a shotgun blast that took me squarely in the chest ripping me open the contents of my inventory and body both spilling on the loamy forest floor. From the Island do we rise and from the Island do we return.Chapter 3 The Spinning of the WheelI awoke on the beach sand wet cold and hard beneath my body. I was sore. How long had I laid there clicking the ""Click here to wake up"" button? Groggily I stood tense and afraid of what felt like the already approaching bearer of death. But no no footsteps. Slowly then intensely the anger set in. My loss. My efforts. My struggle. My crimes.All for naught.In rage I shouted at the world ""NICE ING KILL WAY TO KILL AN UNARMED NOOB! DO YOU FEEL TOUGH NOW HEAD?!?""My nerves ragged my head pounding my keyboard pounded I began to run towards the mountains at full speed. Their call was as strong as ever and with deadly determination I set out to meet them. As I ran in the distance to the left I saw something move. Yes there was definitely something there. Stopping I could only barely make out another naked man running chopping at trees in the night. My desire to feast on his flesh was surprising and overpowering as was my murderous rage at a world filled with thieves and villians. I would join them. I would become the murderer. I ran towards him with abandon rock swinging up and down in front of me as I anticipated caving in his head and watching the fountain of blood spurt high into the air. As I drew near my victim must have heard those fateful footsteps for he turned towards me hammer held high. Unfortunately for him my aim was true and my strike was well timed. Down he went in a rumple of flesh. Checking his inventory I liberated wood cloth and meat. I then gleefully began pounding his corpse with my rock bashing his bones while cackling to the sound of stone on sinew. Rushing away from this victim in a euphoria I found others. Others would know my stone and my axe that day. Bodies littered the earth and my inventory filled with skulls. I would build a house of skulls upon the mountains and live in my misery and violence. I also miraculously began to have quite the collection of resources thanks to my string of murders. It appeared that I would in fact be able to journey to the mountains once again.And so once again I directed myself northwardly with bones meat and resources in tow. I began to see the mountains in a new light as I approached them dark and full of hatred. Gods of violence death betrayal. These were the dark Gods and their rule was a harsh one. I would greet them in kind. Almost on cue I saw my last victim. Off to the right running around and clearly unaware of me I savored my final act of violence before going up the mountains which I had finally reached the foot of. So close and yet I understood that this final death would ready me for my life of solitude above. Additionally the lure of yet more resources was intoxicating.It was time to kill again.And so I sprinted towards the lone naked figure. As I approached I saw that he held only a crude hatchet made of stone. An easy kill for my War Hammer of the Dark Gods. I pulled my hammer back to deliver my initial blow and was surprised to find that this figure was no mere mortal man but a Lagger with the incredible talent to shift locations unnaturally and instantaneously. He shifted to the side and then behind me with two blinks delivering a nasty blow to my head with his hatchet. Dazed on his strange unpredictably movements the pain of the blow and the blood now obscuring my vision I began to swing my hammer wildly hoping to connect to this demonic foe at random so that I might survive this encounter. Swing after swing I made running in wild circles yet he alluded me with ease taunting me all the while in Russian and showering hatchet blows down upon me like harsh winter rains.Finally in my despair I understood what was to be. I had come to the only end that there could have been. This was always the way it was going to be. My health low and dropping with my loss of blood I stood still eyes lifted towards the mountains that now stood so close yet looked colder and more distant than ever. I heard the crunch of snow as my other worldly adversary closed in and then the final thwack of hatchet on flesh. My body crashed to the earth my vision flying askew and then fading all to the demonic chatter of my Russian foe. The world growing dark the sound of a hatchet pounding away at my corpse all of my work and my sin spilled to the earth for enemy to collect. I died with the faint impression that the mountains mocked me laughing in their deep ancient tongue.Chapter 4 This AgainI woke up on a beach and started all over. Again and again and again and again. Those blasted beautiful magical mountains still haunt and call me but I have not yet set foot upon their mythical slopes.10/10 Would ing try again.",Rust

2015-01-04,0,0,50,True,Not Recommended,After playing this game for 20 hours I found it really immersive and entertaining. Nevertheless there are too many bugs players can get inside your base even if you use code locks and cupboard protections. Even if you make 3 floor base the can get to each floor (even if you have code locks). If you build a base and go to sleep the next day your base and all off your stuff will be gone.

2017-11-24,0,0,234,True,Recommended,"I assume that you know the vary baisics of Rust or at least what is going on in the game.This is a preety neat game gets updated every friday (only late when there are big updates).Its a ""survival game"" but most of the time its just trying to survivr from the other players then the enviorment (i will get back on the players). The game is quite chalanging gatehering food and water isnt hard but it is hard to progress espacily when you have to deffend yourself from other players trying to take your loot because they need it to progress are envious or have a gruge against you.The base building is ok not too good and not too bad nothing special.The optimization is ok not the best but the devs are working on it almost every update last year i could bearly run Rust now i get to play at 40 60fps at medium settings (i have a outdated PC and need to upgrade it).The players can be a bit toxic that is if you consider little children and grown men spew out rascist sexsist and complete utter bulshit. And lets not froget the many many nazi swatstikas everywhere painted on banners and sighns (yes you can pain in Rust).A huge problem can be if you play solo or with a small group (3 5) and run in to a Zerg.Zergs are large groups that use numbers over brains and tactics (like the zerglings in Starcraft hence the name).New chalanges are being implemented there was a heli from a long time ago now we got Bradly (a APC/Tank) and soon we should get scientist searching the radiated rad towns and monuments (they are armed ofcourse).Be warned you will get killed on sight a lot of times but sometimes you can find a friendy person who you can become friends with start a group go raiding and make some neat memories together.From me it gets a 7.5/10(Sorry if my english was bad in this review)",Rust

2014-07-06,0,0,158,True,Recommended,Other players will see and be 'amazed' by your house that they will likely try to break in and steal all your belongings. Why not go further by destroying your house! Very probable you will encounter this on your first run and many more. If you can last a day successfully don't think you can just remain inside forever you need food and other resources so it is mandatory to head out to collect these...all while looking over your shoulder for any stalkers. Hey you could get lucky and be riddled with bullets! At death good luck finding your way back home if it is still intact. You will have to watch out since others will be jealous of a new spawn they will hunt you down. Some may earn your trust and then kill you when you are not expecting it. Others will pretend to go the other way when your paths cross only to follow you. A select few may give you supplies and be friendly leading to teamwork and happiness. Alas because of an update to remove zombies Rust was uninstalled. There were no challenges at all and building can only go so far. If a worthwhile update should release in the future I'll likely return. As of this writing I have read they are doing a complete reboot of Rust. How long must I wait? Am I in for a pleasant surprise? I don't know but for now I know I can wait by keeping busy with other better games.,Rust

2014-03-12,0,0,99,True,Recommended,Hi this is a great sandbox game crafting is straight forward you can do a lot with basic resources.Early on I would reccomend you kill an animal or two not just for food but also for cloth to make a bow which makes hunting much easier. At the moment there is a bug that does not let you put a foundation down so i hope they fix that soon. I also have to restart the game quite often to enable me to collect resources and kill stuff. it means I have found out that i am invisible in this state but can still die. Trust no one they will kill you I found the best way to try to be friendly is use voice chat people naturally think you are going to kill them so are defensive all the time so speaking to them before they get close can help with that. (I don t at the moment use voice though just a prefernce). If the DEVS read this please FIX THE FOUNDATION BUG. (I have win xP with an ATI card and not a fast comp) which could be part of the problem.,Rust

Join dozens of other players in building a giant town and harbor new players and residents of the server or play as a lone bandit who moves from area to area in shacks raiding major bases for supplies. This is an amazing game and a steal for it's price. I give this a 9/10 as is still in development therefore features aren't fully implemented such as textures and mechanics.,Rust

Your squad moves out in the middle of the night and heads towards an enemy compound. ""Let's split up our c4 evenly guys so that we don't lose it all if I die"". The presious C4 you saved up and worked so hard for. You build a staircase along the side of the hostile tower. Everyone rushes up. ""I hope they won't hear our foot steps"". Building appears dark and quiet. Looks like there is nobody in. You find a wall to breach. ""Seems like this is their storage room! Look at all the boxes!"". 2 distinct C4 explosions break the silence of the night. It's a motherload! ""Grab all you can guys! Don't forget to check that hidden stash!"". Your rush back to your base. There is an unfamiliar structure by your front door. ""Did somebody leave the door open?"" ""NO! We've been raided!"" You hear multiple footsteps around your base. Shots fired! ""I'm hit!"" The inside of your bases lights up with tracers. Laser sights scan across your rooms. Loud pop. ""I'm dead"" ""I can't respawn! They destroyed my sleeping bag!"" ""They got me too!"" ""I'm dead!""

2014-05-19,0,0,188,True,Recommended,This is a great game to play with friends make a house cook some food scavenge for mats to make weapons and ammo and have a blast doing it. However there a lot of flaws as all early access games have buggy combat sometimes people do little teleports making melee combat hard (not sure if it just the server or the game itself doing it but which ever i hope it is fixed). The gun plays really nice IMO sometimes can be a bit annoying but other wise good gun play even with all the bugs. However i would prefer to see guns be crafted not found like all the guns have the unique flare and the pipe shotty and even the hand cannon even though its not very effective still cool concept in its own right. I havent played rust in sometime because the updates have been..absent for sometime but im sure it's for a good reason and they will have a really big one soon a lot of the content in there dev blogs looks really nice. 20 dollars is really nice price for early access game it helps support the games progress. I would wait thought till it updates which i feel is soon before giving it a shot it's still very fun with friends alone its kinda hard and also gets boring a lot quicker but lone wolfing has it's perks sometimes. all and all fun game to play i would say 8/10 at its current stage i expect great things to come.,Rust

2017-11-21,0,0,211,True,Not Recommended,"Generally a great game. Graphics are good. Aiming mechanics needs more work. It's a beautiful game. Servers are filled with trolls the game allows everyone to act like Neanderthals. Essentially it's a big sandbox for anyone to pay for the game to get killed over and over again and get called ""salty"" when you call them out. Or vice versa. Things hit a dead end with nothing to do other than chop more trees or mine more ores. Or hunt more players. Whichever is your cup of tea.So far there is no clear direction where the game is going other than letting players kill each other and raid each other. Or create a non hostile community and move your life into Rust. Also if you are a bully an $$hole can't play nice hates everyone in your life have no life and/or likes contributing toxicity and negativity into an otherwise neutral environment this game is definitely for you.So by all means save your cash if you want to raid bases there's Starcraft 2. It's free now. If you want to shoot other players there's CSGO or the COD series or Destiny 2 or any other fps games. Until the game gets better please love yourself and your wallet.

It's got some fun player interaction you don't really get in other PVP games.I feel the gun mechanics could be a little more polished but it's still a beta.

2014-06-18,0,0,48,True,Recommended,Rust uses the Minecraft formula perfectly. You don't know what you're doing but you know that you can't stop doing it. The only difference? The main enemy in Rust is your fellow man. PvP follows DayZ's shoot on sight technique so be careful! Crafting is exactly like the console versions of Minecraft meaning you don't have to place materials in a pattern to craft them. Building structures however is more indicitive of The Forest where you have walls and campfires etc. that can be placed based on their specifications. Your main experience in Rust will be building a house or series of houses while fending off hordes of naked men with axes resulting in a sort of beautiful chaos unseen in any game before it. Rust is in short an incredible game.,Rust

2017-11-25,0,0,485,True,Recommended,About 98% of the time spent in this game you'll spend farming resources and building your base (if you're playing on a low pop server like me) and the other 2% you'll spend fighting other players you come across in the open world. Now what I enjoy with this game is mostly the social aspect the trash talking in the server chat while you farm the jokes some random player told you about his in game neighbor or the drama that arises when you blame someone else for having mugged some poor soul in the forest.The best part however is the thrill you feel when fighting other players as you risk losing the stuff you've spent hours of hard work to acquire if you die. Or you could win big and get their stuff. I now understand why some people find gambling so addictive as it is the closest feeling I can use to describe this game.11/10 would blame their neighbor again for mugging the sqeaker of the server.,Rust

2014-06-19,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Really fun game. While it can be frustrating that you loose all of your stuff every time you die it adds to the difficulty level. For an alpha this game is already great and I can't wait to see what the devs do with it in the future. Something I wish they would add is the ability to play in the same area as a friend that isn't through LAN because even if you go on an empty server with just yourself and a buddy you spawn randomly and it's almost impossible to find them. Again though this adds to the difficulty level because you can't just go on with a group of friends that all defend eachother you have to try to team up with the people who happen to be around you which makes it more realistic. Anyway awesome game definitely reccomend it to anoyone who likes survival games ),Rust

2014-06-19,0,0,68,True,Recommended,25 hours spent playing after 6 days of owning the game. It's taken me this long to really get the basics down. Rust is great fun and maybe the most frustrating game I've ever played. In my experience not playing on an official server and especially finding one with a low population is key for noob survival . Today I was finally able to really get a nice little fort built up with a good little weapons cache only to have become too comfortable. I was killed with my door open by a couple of jerk raiders. When I come back they'll have looted all my belongings and either destroyed what took me hours to build or taken it over as their own. As I said very frustrating. But I'm already looking forward to going back in re starting from scratch and hopefully remembering this time to not get comfortable enough that I'm on my roof at night crafting when I should be inside hiding from the awful people this game attracts. There have been several friendlies in various servers I've been on who have been very helpful but by and large this game seems to attract psychopaths who might kill you irl as well.

2014-04-04,0,0,205,True,Recommended,Great game great fun great experiences. I've been playing this for quite a while now and it's entertaining to play with friends. You can always make friends in the world of Rust however most people do prefer to just shoot you on sight for no apparent reason. This game will be one of the greatest when it's finished.,Rust

2014-04-03,0,0,2006,True,Recommended,the game is great fun and addictive. the community of the game is what ruins it. you cant get far enough or collect enough resources without getting killed. each server has a superpower whom doesnt let anyone get their roots in the ground to fend off others. the game and idea is wonderful similar to minecraft and fallout almost. but the massive online community ruins it all in the end.,Rust

2014-04-03,0,0,63,True,Recommended,This Game is one of the best Survival/Crafting games i have ever played! This game is very unique i love the way it is set out the crafting the building the hunting you must do whatever it takes to survive in this game and thats what i love about it. Would be cool if they added character customization but that doesnt matter! the game is in alpha and thre are a few minor bugs but its hard to beleive the game is in alpha its already an amazing game! 10/10 must buy!,Rust
2014-06-20,0,0,2,True,Recommended,I recommend buying this game to play with friends. Its more fun to play with friends.,Rust
2014-06-20,0,0,195,True,Recommended,First of all The game in the current state of development is great. There is a lot to do in this game like building your home gathering resourses making friends and enemies going for airdrops griefing other players and others. But at some point when you see all of the game it begins to be boring. The problem is that there is not much of a content to be found in the game. The second important thing is that there are not much an updates going on. The devolpers have blog where they public stuff that they will put in the game but belive me you will not see them in the game. Yes the devolpers put two branches (the base game and a branch where you can try the new stuff) but in the dev branch they do not put all they made. The point is that you buy the game you will have A LOT OF FUN but do not expect new content.P.S The game is better with a friend.,Rust
2014-06-20,0,0,77,True,Recommended,Though it may be early access with a lot of work ahead I still have enjoyed my time playing. It has some minecraft esque qualities that I really enjoy. The constant fear of losing everything and starting over really keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you don't like PvP I would shy away from RUST because at the heart of the game that is where the fun truly lies.,Rust

2014-02-19,0,0,90,True,Recommended,One of the few games that's been making me want to smack someone with a salty fish. And also one of the games thats actually made me feel like a bandit. All of the resource spawns are constantly hoarded by pizz mongering anal bandits that will cease at nothing to prevent you from getting anywhere near a rock with their fancy new bolt action rifles however do not let that discourage you because you too are a pizz mongering anal bandit.,Rust

2014-05-22,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Great Game! I've only been able to play it a little while but I cannot wait to see what the future brings for this game! If anyone is looking for a gauge of how far forward it is in the process of being made it contains more than EA would put in a game lets put it that way. There are of course some hackers and cheaters as there are with any online game and some things are buggy as but it is an early alpha so don't be too hard on the game. There is some reallly funny stuff you can do in the game and what's more its a huge ton more fun with friends lone wolfing it though does too have its benefits. Overall I love this game it has a few minor bug flaws but these will get ironed out real soon and so I see no reason not to buy it!,Rust

2017-11-23,0,0,118,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. Probably the best ""survival"" game within it's genre as of this review. In rust you start with hardly any knowledge of the weapons clothing trinkets and building materials within the game. You learn over time by finding blueprints or tinkering with items to create blueprints. On a vanilla server you will slowly over the course of days find yourself progressing be it with your base growing or you getting better and better gear by crafting finding or stealing. I think rust really shines on modded servers with ease of access plugins and the ability to up the rate at which you progress within the game. Definitely a good game if you don't mind grinding and are looking for a game to progress on over time and especially with friends.8.5/10",Rust

2014-07-15,0,0,52,True,Recommended,Game is fun if u get into a good server with admins but there are hackers who can get into metal doors very easily so beware of hackers but all in all as an alpha it is good the game may feel limited at times due to limited things being able to be created but if Rust devs continue to make this game as it is now with secure servers it will be good maybe the experimental version will be better but for $20 it is a cheaper alternative to minecraft where creation is limited yet still entertaingin due to better weapons and airdrops and raids.,Rust

2014-07-10,0,0,241,True,Recommended,I love this game. Have been playing it for about a week and have put in around 100 hours. So first thing first this is not the game for you if you get mad about dying. You die ALOT! Players will kill animals will kill you you die of starvation you will die from about everything that is generated. You will start gathering your mats to make a dwelling and some is going to kill you and take it all however that is the point of a survival game. To learn how to survive. There is so much risk in this game you have to adapt. If you are looking for a game to just jump into and shoot everyone on sight this game isn't for you. If you are looking for a game that you have to claw your way to the top while enduring attacks from enemies and counterattacking building a base and breaching others. Then you will enjoy this game. I feel like it is a good mix of Minecraft meets Resident Evil meets Call of Duty. You start with a rock and build your empire. Sometimes it seems like the world is collasping around you and everyone is just using you as the proverbial toliet paper of the world however once you set up and start to climb there is no better feeling. So in conclusion I think this is an amazing game for anyone that desires a SURVIVAL game due to the rags to riches build up and the high risk system. ENJOY and let the odds be ever in your favor.,Rust
2014-07-10,0,0,58,True,Recommended,For an Alpha game it is surprisingly fun to play either with friends or by yourself Rust is a great survival game its not one of those games where you just look around and survive You can also build cool towers or fortress of your own creation!

2014-06-21,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I logged in and was immediately murdered 3 times in 10 mins only had time to hit a tree with a rock. This was on one of the official servers. IF the community is going to be dog then this game needs a sinlge player where people can actually learn how to play the damn game!,Rust
2014-06-21,0,0,148,True,Recommended,This game really makes you think about human interactions. Take a group of friends tell them to survive and they will eventually have enough supplies to outlast time. Give one of them a gun however and we'll see how loyal they really are.I'm not saying I'm a saint in this game but it seems that when I or others try to be nice in this game the thanks we get is a shotgun blast to the face. Unfortunately this game came out in a time where everyone has the Call of Duty mentality. I have a gun guns are for killing i should kill. This isn't the only game with this problem but it seems like the perpertraters are being rewarded particularily in this game. At least in GTA V they have a sanity system that encourages good behaviour. But altogether I have really found this game enjoyable. If you manage to find a decent server like I have and can figure out the subtle hints between friend and murderous psychopath then you will honestly enjoy this. Just make sure you play with a friend you'll need the backup.I love this game and can't wait to see it grow.,Rust

2014-06-21,0,0,857,True,Recommended,AMAZING game! i really love it but its really lacking updates on the stable branch. i really think if maybe they added a weapon every so often and some stupid little things this game would be as good as new and just repopulate!,Rust
2014-06-21,0,0,30,True,Not Recommended,At this stage of development Rust only offers a few hours of enjoyment before things get stale and repeatitive. Once you build your home gather food and resources there really isn't much more to do except listen to people whine and curse eachother out over the chat on how unfair it is that they got raided/killed. I've played on multiple servers and overall I find that people take this game way too seriously. Perhaps if there was an option to hide the chat the experience may be a bit more enjoyable. In short I would not recommend putting down $20 for this game this early in its development. Maybe down the road the developers will improve the game to be a much more fulfilling experience but for now I'm sorry to say it just seems like a glorified Minecraft.,Rust
2014-06-21,0,0,1250,True,Recommended,I am Drawn Between Yes And No but it is a great game and there is still lots to be done. I have played it for 100 hours and basicly when you first get it you cannot stop playing it for hours. You spawn in and get to work. I would not reccommend going on vannila servers from the start of the game becasue you get raided pretty much every night. lots of diferent server stuff such as they have the battle field servers that are full on PVP and there are the vannila servers where everything is normal. Servers with hunger games and modded servers,Rust

2014-07-22,0,0,163,True,Recommended,"I LOVE this game the mechanics can be a bit tedious and the learning curve isnt all too steep but the interactions between you and the other players is really what youre paying for. the constant paranoia and overall tension between you your fellow ""nakeds' and the other players that kill on sight add an unexoected goal to the game. that being protect your friends and survive. like most survival games this one requires HOURS of play its definitely not a game you can play for 5 mins and log off. if you wanna make ANY progress it takes some serious devotion. which isnt exactly a bad thing. like with any Building esque game youll run into greafers but with the right team put together its really enjoyable. the game mechanics forces you to seek assistance from the other players and the majority that ive met a pretty noob friendly. all in all i would highly reccomend this game. WARNING FOR WINDOWS XP USERS. this game is not currently stable on XP playable but you gat whats called player ghosting after about 5 mins of play which forces you to disconnect and reconnect again. this can be frustrating and game breaking. with the new experimental rust servers coming out im not sure if this might change unless youre running a 64 bit OS this game might not be for you.

2014-07-22,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,"Brilliant game! Don t get me wrong. The idea and execution are brilliant. It delivers exactly what it s supposed to. The survival and crafting elements are fun. Gathering materials is a labour of love.However the cons massively outway the pros for me In order to get the most out of this game it forces you to play with friends or join other players groups (if you re lucky enough to be accepted). This may be in the pro column for some people but for me it s proving very difficult to get started. I can spend hours and hours gathering mats stash them in my store box inside my base only to log out for the night and find that an entire day s exploits have been stolen by another player when I log back in.So it would appear that in order to get started you either need to sink a few sleepless days into gathering the mats for a metal door (instead of the wooden one which can easily be broken down by other players) or join a group and beg things off them completely defeating the object of the game in my opinion.I WANT to go out and pass time by gathering materials to get the sense of achievement when I build structures. I WANT to work for my creations and belongings. But to have an entire day of gathering mats wasted makes me never want to play this game again despite enjoying most of it s content.I spend time creating a home and spawnpoint only to find I do not spawn there when I choose ""spawn at camp"".I log out and find I'm not where I was when I logged out making it pointless playing this game in the long term (why spend time gathering mats and building a home if it takes me 2 hours to find it again (and every time I log back in))So I decide to join in with stealing from other players. I hack at a wooden door for what seems like for EVER steal his belongings (which were better than mine!) only to be shot and looted...I just find it all a complete waste of time ..",Rust

2013-12-15,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,"The only way to get rocks in this game is to find a super Rare ""rock deposit"" or... you can kill all the new defenseless people in the game so straight from the get go there is no reason to keep the poor (NAKED!) noob alive and then if you live past the spawn there normally 2 main groups (Gangs) that form will tell you to join or else and if you join one the other will hunt you down and kill you. but in the off chance you make it to you groups base they will reward you with a hatchet and tell you cut down trees or go wander the wilderness till you starve or find food for the group (or do some other demeaning task). so if I could give some advice for the game they should increase resources so noobs dont have a huge target on the heads or make it necessary for them to team up like more wolves or need 2 or more to build certain things so as is not worth $15 sorry. great idea tho",Rust

I sent the desktop computer back to cyberpower industries and finally got it back after waiting 6 weeks. Each week I asked my dad if it was coming back or not and he always said no until about the 5th week when he told me they were sending it back and it would be here during thanksgiving break. Now the game runs perfectly fine and I really enjoy it now. I would like components to be removed and blueprints to be brought back in but that won't happen for a while. I would also like the older maps and older view models and item bar models for guns and other weapons to be brought back as well.

2016-07-12,0,0,3002,True,Recommended,Review update. October Rust curently announced that the xp system is being gutted out. They are bringing back radiation to the rad towns. It is too early to say what the new system will look like but I find it great that the developers listened to the comunity and are hard at work to make the game great again. Right now all the bp are unlocked on the prerelease beta just as a place holder untill the new system is in place. I find a lot of the tweeks they did are beutiful. The flame torents are something many people wanted for a while. The iron sights are fixed and the new cave system seams great. This game is going to be great again. August I have about 3000 hours on this game. Been playing since legacy. Since they added the Xp system they destroyed the game. makes it so that there is no other way to play that hit on a tree all day. It is boring and it makes it imposible for a new player to come in mid wipe. You basically have to join in every 1st thursday of every month and just never get off. It is a race on who can mine the most now and not a skill based game anymore. With the new system if you raid someone and get their stuff they are the ones that get exp when you craft with them. Same when you kill them. It's some sort of socialistic t that makes it that everyone gets rewarded even if they are not good at the game. Last I checked Rust was pvp. I really doubt the Assult rile is in the game to hunt bears. Not only that now you have to be ompletly end game to raid. That is dumb some of the best raids I ever had was as a noob with only bows pipe shotguns and revolvers c4ing a bas of deffenders in fulll armor. It makes it more exciting because you never know who you are messing with. Even if someone is half naked they might have some boom boom in their 2x2. Also as soon as a big clan makes the other 1 or 2 big clans from the server rage quit. New ones that jump on will have no chance to contest them mid wipe. You can't even make a bow till lvl 6. I am actually a veterane of a large 30 person clan and we don't play with the new system because there is no challenge. We just have one person give the tools to everyone and then they can get to c4 in the fist day then there is no challenge you just spend the rest of the wipe kos all the new guys and dumping their inventory so no one catches up. Don't waste your money on this game at this point. If you want a good xp survival go play Ark if you want PVE go play Minecraft if you want rust.... well you are ed because they ruined it.,Rust

This game should be classified as a Documentary.Stone Age Watch as tribes of people armed with spears and rocks discover fire gather meager possesions and poke opposing tribes with pointy sticks!Feudal Age Watch as said tribes discover smelting and forgery building massive castles and fortresses and arrowing/swording enemy Feudal clans!Industrial Age Watch as said Feudal civilization discovers forgery smelting and gunpowder. Watch as they engineer rifles and proceed to erect a metric ton of factories and engage in brutal gunfights with enemy Industrialists!Early Modern Age Watch as said Industrial civilization hits the skill cap and proceeds to either gun down or enslave everyone else in the former ages! World Wars happen in this era!Chances are you're going to die well before reaching any of the aformentioned advances in technology. Over and over and over.That's alright though Human ingenuity is a helluva thing. Those who are unwaivered by this Dark Souls esque pounding that this game delivers you'll make it through the ranks before you become The One True Raider.Will you kill?

2017-02-24,0,0,695,True,Recommended,I do recommend this game to new players. Content is always coming out nowadays and you can accept fully that this game has turned from a game with depth to pretty much a kill on sight kind of community. This is due to the new system in place that completely cuts out blue prints. Now everyone will always be the same on what they can craft. This can be both good and bad.About this system Good You start off like anyone else in the server who just died.Possibly allows better access to newer items.Bad Community is more for killing you and taking what you have than being your firend for the sake of crafting them something they do not have.Does not inspire one to stay in a server after being raided since your only worth is your buildings and inventory. This game is not bad. But it was hard for me to give this a positive review with what the game has become.If you like a mainly pvp based game then this is for you but if you rage over getting your taken away after hours of game play then stay away. Personally for me this game was better before June 2016 when the blueprints were still around Much more addicting. I hope newer players can enjoy it much more than I can now.,Rust

2015-04-08,0,0,279,True,Recommended,Editing my review since there have been a lot of updates.Still love the game think it's awesome for people who can find the right server for them. A lot of servers nowadays are very specialized so don't expect to go into a 50 man server and be chummy with everyone or join an established building server and wreck havoc.Playing this game solo in my opinion is extremely boring I relate it more closely to the Minecraft experience than anything. The feeling of progression with friends is very tangible in Rust and I really think the blueprint overhaul helped with that feeling. The moment I get the Lantern blueprint I know my lakehouse is going to look badass and everyone has that one thing that they love getting *Cough*C4*Cough*Progress is definately slow but very steady and generally quality. Fall damage is rational the controls feel *JUST* clunky enough to be fun. Think ARMA but still responsive enough to enjoy how it handles. (God I hate ARMA's controls.)If I have one complaint it would be building honestly. The one problem I have with building the only thing I wish was better stairs. Corner stair specifically corner and spiral stairs. I get this isn't minecraft or building simulator 2069 but as someone who would highly prefer building to PVP I feel like most projects would look nicer with even the old 1/2 block stairs glitchy or not.All in all solid 8/10 from me. It's definately still in development and it will probably be for a long time but that's fine for something like Rust which needs constant updates.Would buy friends reccomended.,Rust

2016-01-04,0,0,160,True,Not Recommended,Other people have said it and it's true Rust in its current Alpha state is no fun for beginners (maybe not even for the more seasoned players). Here's why in a nutshell Starting out with just a rock and a torch is hard. Duh! But that's all fine and good if you can build something from that and start to make something of your naked self. So you start out and you get killed (A LOT) before you can build anything up. Ok ok you'll say I might be dying and losing everything but it still seems like so much FUN and I think I can establish myself so I'll keep trying!So you keep trying. Eventually you are able to survive long enough to build a house! Wahooo! You add a door you add a lock you start to store things you upgrade your twig hut to wood and now you're thinking hey! I've finally established a small little foothold here! I got some clothes! I got food! I even found some way cooler weapons! I'm on a roll!!Then you log out to you know live your real life.You return. You end up naked on a beach. You go back to your former home to discover that not only did someone break in and kill you but they stole your house and changed the lock too! You must once again live in the cold dark world trying desperately to survive.Over and over again the same thing happens. It's the inability to make a real foothold in this game for longer than a few hours that makes it so frustrating and in my opinion not really an enjoyable game to play.The game is beautiful and it has a lot of really positive traits the ability to build your own house raid for items hunting even running away from the bad guys and the bears can be exhilirating. What it really needs though in order to appeal to the masses is a chance for people to actually establish themselves. Otherwise who really cares? You'll just end up naked on a beach again anyway.,Rust

2016-01-04,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,So disappointed. This was not what I expected for a survival game. Their definition of survival must be different from mine and a lot of others.I'm hoping that as the game progresses that it will eventually come out of alpha mode and hopefully be playable well thought out game.I had managed to find a server that no one was on at the time thought this was a good sign and then I logged in. My first few minutes of the game were upsetting because nothing looked like the promo trailers they have advertising it.No trees no wood to pick up to create tools with just naked with only a unlit torch and a rock which seems weird until you learn that you can't craft anything without blueprints and you can only get them through destroying man made trash cans randomly generated on the world....There is no intro to this game. You literally start the game somewhere on land or in my case water and are suppose to know what to do right off the bat.I was punching buttons for minutes to try and figure out the controls all while trying to play the game.No health/condition/hunger stats were available that I could find and when I did manage to kill something it's health bar went right back up to where it was before I killed it! That's just not right can't even go hunt properly....Your rock is not an indestructible rock. And after you use it to its full potential it breaks in a few pieces and that's that. I had picked up over 1 000 rocks and couldn't use even just 1 of them to replace my starter rock when it broke!No starter rock no mining. No mining no blueprint shards and no shardes no more progression in the game. This game is extremely frustrating for new players just starting out no tutorial no opening story mode... Nothing.I hope that after a few months I will be able to get back on here and reevaluate this review I have of the game and hopefully have a better outcome playing the game then I did when I first downloaded it.Why does there have to be blue prints? Why can I make ammo before I can make a base or even a basic tool? I will attempt to play again... And hopes that my new game will have a better outcome.Until then I highly do NOT recommend this game.,Rust

2013-12-18,0,0,35,True,Recommended,First and foremost the graphics for this game are pretty insane. (yes. a good Far Cry 3 insane) Im playing on a 2002 build of XP service pack 3 i just meet the minimum requirements for this game and it looks amazing. However all is not just well and dandy as nothing seems to stops a random from player walking up and murdering you for no reason thus ending potentially hours of progress (*ahem* DayZ anyone?) the tedious resource gathering is a bit annoying like where the HELL are all the bloody rocks!? i understand the survival aspect but going from naked caveman wielding a rock that ccuts trees to building M4's and hosing into zombies (or whatever they are) and Bears? A bit over the top. But still delightful in some respects.PROS Great graphics In depth crafting system beautiful open world design possibility to make towns and communitiesCONS too much PvP gathering materials is a bit too tedious at first BIG step from a cave man to Spec ops grunt why is radiation a thing?(Note* this based off of roughly just two hours of repetitive spawning and dying player kills and general gameplay)EDITIn the 3 months ive owned and played this game they've added weapon/item degrading and removed zombies. thats it. oh and of course the normal bug fixes. but not much to this game. at all. I dont underrstand the thrill like first it seemed cool and promising now it feels deserted and empty. Rust doesnt know what Rust is anymore. and people keep buying it.,Rust

2013-12-18,0,0,37,True,Recommended,Before I state anything else I would suggest that those who are new to start out on a No PvP server to avoid immediate frustration of having to deal with the awful communities on normal PvP servers. They show no quarter there as they shouldn't but it is just not worth the frustration while trying to learn the basics. Wait till you have a good grasp on how to play before attempting rolling on one.Aside from the awful community on most servers the game is fantastic if you enjoy the survival genre. A bit simplified in its current state but it's an Alpha currently so I hope to see that change and a lot more features get fleshed out. Due to a lack of any real help from the game itself expect to ask a fair share of questions in chat as the way some things work (specifically what buttons to press / hold) or how to operate certain structures. Once you get the hang of it it gets enjoyable.The potential is incredible and I can't wait to see how the game evolves throughout the development.,Rust

2013-12-18,0,0,595,True,Recommended,I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves survival games. It is an alpha so it is gonna be clunky it mite run slow sometimes and it is gonna lag but you have too look past all of that and look at the game and where it is as an alpha. It has a working gathering/crafting system sounds are fairly decent(except for bears) map is massive and packed with mountains different biomes wildlife urban environments and much more. As far as the community goes I have not ran into any people that have just shot me on sight I have had one incedent where a player approached my home with me and my friend inside and we were able to kill him. That is it. Other than that I have had several different players(most who I have now added on steam) approach me and ask if I needed help with food or they have given me weapons and ammo and armor. At an alpha state I would give this game a solid 7/10. I would deduct some from the rating because the servers have been down all day today despite the fact of valve working on a patch as I am typing this I would also deduct some from the rating because the game can be quite laggy on the official servers whether it is a stress test server or not and there is also a lot of rubber banding and I often find my self quickly sinking into the ground and rising up every 10 seconds on some servers and the last thing I would deduct some of the rating would be for the sloppy sounds I mean the gun sounds are good footsteps and fire noises are excellent but the wildlife just sounds flat out . Bears sounds like my German Shepard and the Wild Boars sounds like little tiny farm piglets whining for their mother milk.,Rust

2014-03-30,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,"Spent about 15 ours playing. Then the server I was on decided they were going to wipe everything. Yeah no. I for one dont have time to waste building a secure base and gathering supplies to build weapons and armor just to have it go poof because someone running the server thought a wipe would be good. Now I do believe that server based characters is good in the sense that its fixes server hopping like in DayZ. But servers having the ability to just resest everything is not cool.Also just like in DayZ everyone just Kills on sight. I did have one group of 2 people tell me to stop I said no thanks ill be on my way then get an arrow in the back. When confronted in chat he claimed it was a ""warning shot"" Not a very good one considering it killed....Most people don't seem to grasp the wise old proverb "" Don't where you eat"". If you build a base within 200 feet of anyone else they spend the whole time harassing you and raiding your base..... Instead of grouping up and forming a neighborhood/alliance.

2017-02-27,0,0,230,True,Recommended,I haven't yet played this game for a time long enough to give at a completely accurate review however Rust is an excellent game from my experience. The only things that I dislike about it don't come from the game but from the devs themselves.The devs of Rust are oddballs. They will add a cool feature like the experience system and all of a sudden remove it in the next patch. They also add unecessary items like vending machines and so on (I guess it's cool for players to be able to make their own shops). If you are looking for realistic combat and firefights this isn't a very good game for that. Though the weapon sounds are pretty cool and sound quite realistic combat is a little bit odd for a survival game. IBullet drop is extremely exaggerated and unrealistic and players can heal generally quickly through the use of syringes and medkits. I don't have many complaints besides those (it's annoying to lose a firefight however because someone pulled out a syringe faster than you). The game can also get pretty intense when helicopters controlled by NPCs come hovering around your base looking for trouble or when a plane brings in an airdrop and you can hear the massive amount of gunshots which are being fired by the people fighting to the death to see who can claim the rewards of the drop.The firearm crafting doesn't make much sense either you need to find certain 'bodies' of a weapon (as of win.1172.69) and then you just need pieces of metal springs and pipes. In reality you would need not just a 'body' but a reciever (I guess the weapon's body could include the reciever) an action a stock a barrel and all sorts of screws other parts to hold the gun together. Firearm bodies can only be found in certain places for some reason you can't make them but you can made a working codelock with some metal scraps and wood.This game is generally good but only truly fun to play with a group. I would recommend it if you could find a group to play it with.,Rust

2014-04-20,0,0,10,True,Recommended,"This game is pretty fun. It takes some of my favorite aspects of Minecraft and applies it to a nice realistic open world. The controls are decent although perhaps a tad clunky at times. THe graphics are pretty nice.Depending on what server you play on your experiences will vary significantly. Sometimes its really hard to find food and supplies and sometimes the people are complete s who kill and raid regularly which takes away a lot of the fun for me personally. But perhaps thats appealing to some people. Me? I like this game as a nice survival game in which I can explore and build nice communities with my friends and thrive in the nice open world. Im not really interested in the whole raiding/being a aspect.Overall I recommend. Its fun but theres no doubt that there is improvement to be made. Perhaps more building construction options. Maybe some more ways to ""live off the land"" like drinking spring water from a river eating greenery making potions transportation (horses or something).It would be much more fun for me with the ability to make your own server.

2013-12-23,0,0,6,True,Recommended,It's Rust. It's what you expected when you heard about it long ago. It's a game where you're thrown in to a huge world with just a rock and you have to survive. Essentially it's a game where you're a naked caveman trying to live and avoiding and/or killing other naked cavemen. That being said do NOT go into this solo as it is not meant to be played as such. The possibilities of things you can do and things you can craft are near endless until some asshat shoots you and you die and lose all your stuff. Be sure to bring a buddy and help each other survive but don't kill each other. Death holds a lot of meaning in this game so if you don't like that steer clear of Rust. It's still in alpha which means it has a lot of room for improvement and it has a ton of potential. It's a really great game if you're into surviving and killing other people to dominate their stuff. That being said don't be the asshat who picks a fight he/she can't win. Because then everyone will hate you. Overall this is a game that is definitely worth trying. Might as well get it in alpha because you don't know if the price may go up when it goes into beta or releases. It's worth the 20 bucks just make sure you take precautions to ensure your survival. Oh yeah servers may be a little laggy or slow depending on your computer but it'll get better as the game develops. Definitely well hyped another great gem by Garry. 8.5/10 (Alpha Ver.),Rust
2013-12-23,0,0,499,True,Recommended,After waiting a long time for Dayz to be released I stumbled upon Rust. Dayz was a tad expensive for an alpha so after reading numerous good reviews I purchased Rust. I've only played for a small amount but so far I feel ripped off. I expected issues from an alpha but this game is just disappointing. If I wasn't murdered over and over again or I could actually find rocks I may have enjoyed it more.Pros There appears to be a lot of potential here in the minecraft/dayz crossBeing able to build the world is awesomeVoice chat is a good ideaCons Everything feels like a choreEven hitting something with a rock lagsThe menu is unusableThe members are AWFUL.,Rust

2014-04-02,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,This game is worth You can't do anything for more then 10 minutes before you are either killed by another player eaten by a bear/wolf or dies of starvation. It's too diffecult to find food and if you find something the game either lags or somebody else kills you while hunting.So if you think it's okay. You can play for 5 minutes and come back paying tomorrow you are wrong becourse even when you are offline other players can kill you if you haven't build a house. And you die of starvation (or get's killed) before it is build.Surely this is an alpha game right now. But you lose your money if you buy it. So keep away from this game unless Valve ban players for killing new players and players asleep.I would rather eat wood then play this anymore!,Rust

After numerous attempt I accepted the fate that there's no way to jump back where I came from I glanced over at the lonely dangling platform beside me almost too far to reach. I've made up my mind I'll do it I'll do the leap of faith it's either I go back base a rich man or I die in this radiated hollow dome I held my breath wanting to take a step back before launching myself forward onto the safe land almost tripped over I did a small step and jumped all my might I jumped as far as I could as hard as my thin legs could launch me. It was far from close it was almost too far to even grab hold onto the platform I fell I fell and fell the fall feels like an eternity I close my eyes bracing myself from what is coming a cold lonely death. Everything I did in my life as a naked flashed in front of my very eyes I prayed to whoever's listening how I wish god our holy admin is here to save me but luck was sadly not on my side I reached the bottom the cracking of my bones crushed my dreams my very dreams of becoming a rich man in this deserted island. I failed I lied there as blood rushed and blurred my vision I let out an agony cry no one was there to help the bare metal feels colder than usual against my hazmat suit. I closed my eyes as I was greeted by doom ""you've died from falling"" I held my breath and looked up I asked god why? Why me? Why today? I couldn't help it as tears rolled down my rosy cheeks the salty defeat landed on my waterproof keyboard ""at least my keyboard ain't gonna let me down"" I thought I sighed and hit the respawn button. I was brought back to this cruel world the familiar sight of the bed room I built in the castle I built. A place where I call home. Funny how with all these dominations and big base it feels empty today. Guess it's true money can't buy you happiness.

You are going to rage but never quit this game is tons of fun if you really put time into it.EDIT I can not reccomend this game in the state it is in the developers don't care about what the community wants anymore there is clear favor to large groups and playing solo is harder than freezing hell over.

2014-07-05,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,This game has a lot of appeal and hype. But after running around naked and beating things with a rock it gets boring really fast. Once you get some equipment and build a home there's really not much else to do besides griefing other players. If you don't grief other players they will do it to you. Imagine going to sleep in what you think is a safe place only to wake up with all of your items gone and your home destroyed. That's what this game is about. If you enjoy griefing other people you'll probably enjoy it but otherwise I can't recommend this game at all.,Rust

You get a lot of people who just run around and kill dont even RP on mic they just kill to kill. I learned fast how to make things its easy on what you need to make certain things. The game looks and runs good for me. Ive ran into people who give me items and ran into people who just kill. I actually had a guy give me a loaded gun if you can believe that.

2016-04-15,0,0,1774,True,Recommended,"At about 600 hours into Rust I feel the need to express how much fun it has been. Starting out confused naked and near starving an ending up with an enourmous base advanced gear + weapons and a couple new friends is all you can ask from a game like this. Although not perfect the building and crafting aspects are easy to grasp yet take long enough to really get into as to supply at least a dozen extra hours of gameplay before even reaching ""endgame"". The community is pretty bad to be quite honest but I've managed to find tons of worthwhile people to play with. Having a small solid group of people to experience the game with makes it feel like you and your group v.s. the rest of the server which I find enjoyable. Teamwork pays off in Rust and even players like myself who prefer solo experinces will come to appreciate the feeling of cooperating with others in this game.

2014-04-26,0,0,71,True,Recommended,It's a great Zombie Survival game that i think has whatmost people desire. However since this is under development there are a lot of things that need to be improved. Dont get me wrong your work so far has ben amazing I would just like to point out some things that i think would improve the game and attract more people to play it. here we go 1. Character customization. it feels as running aroung looking the same way isnt a step forward. plus it is always fun to make your a little more unique. add genders. another option would be to implement skins like monecraft but more advanced and a clint where you can make and upload skins to the workshop. 2. More roads a larger map and more radtowns. this is pretty important if you want a larger community and makes the game a little more challenging. also add Mines and lumber mills where you can go to harvest stone and wood. note that these to would be covered in radiation and thus making it harder(and more fun) for people to get these resources. if the map would be larger you could implement transportation however this is not something that is nescessary and something for the future 3. Map. make it possible to craft a map so you dont get lost all the time. navigation is pretty important for a survival game and i think it would make it easier to find your friends. this is all i can come up with at the moment. i know this game can go so much further and i really hope you implement more things into the gamefor a game in alpha i give the rating 8/10. seeing as when you have all the gear there's really not much to do.,Rust

In the past two days I have logged more than six hours which is more than I can say for the majority of the games I own. This game has so much potential which the developers are working to unlock. The possibilities for this game are seemingly endless and that fills me with excitement I have not felt since the early days of Minecraft.Rust will surely bring you huge satisfaction in your success and great frustration in your failure both of which are inevitable for every player due to the nature of your game. The emotional response to this game is such that I've nothing to really compare it to. Creating allies with players in this game creates a stronger bond than I've seen in most other games as well as that I can honestly say I've never felt such hatred for my enemies in a game before.I expect great things from this game and as it is now I would rate it 8/10.

There is a disclaimer though This game is very hardcore the community is unforgiving and you can lose hours of gameplay in a single second. That being said Rust may not be for everyone. All of this adds to a truly fun and rewarding game where your accomplishments feel greatly satisfying. Building your first base will make you feel like you have conquered all odds and are finally safe. Until someone exploits it and gets inside or someone raids your base and blows down your walls with C4. This will teach you to value NOTHING but friendship in this harsh world. All of these horrible experiences will force you to start over but you will get better and better at it. Eventually you will build a raid proof exploit proof base and will know all the ins and outs of Rust.One thing I highely recommend is to play Rust with friends or try to make friends. Trying to make friends can be a tough experience but it will pay off if you actually find a good person to shack up with. Two people or three or four etc will make it much easier to face all the odds that are stacked against you in your attempts at survival.Rust is in very early stages of development and the updates are coming kind of slowely at the moment. But the devs do have some very cool ideas that they are working on and they always make sure everything is rock solid before implementing it into the game. They seem like good people. They have plenty of money to work with but just need time to get their ideas and their staff in order. Overall get Rust! Even if you don't get addicted straight away and don't like where the game is at the moment it will change it will evolve and it will become a better game in time. I find it extremely fun as it is though.,Rust

He was effectively dictator of Nazi Germany and was at the centre of World War II in Europe and the Holocaust.Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the precursor of the NSDAP the German Workers' Party in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923 he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment during which time he dictated his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (""My Struggle""). After his release in 1924 Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan Germanism anti Semitism and anti communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest elected party in the German Reichstag leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany a single party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans actions which gave him significant popular support.Hitler sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941 Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war during the Battle of Berlin in 1945 Hitler married his long time lover Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945 less than two days later the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army and their corpses were burned.Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (""sub humans"") and socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history.",Rust

2014-04-06,0,0,4091,True,Recommended,The thoughts and ideas for this game are awesome. They draw you in. The game is highly addictive in my opinion. It is crazy how well the game is put together for an open Alpha. When they have this game fully polished watch out! There are a few bugs and some things that I would love to see changed. A more active valve based reporting system for hackers for one. I was googline stuff about this and found many sites advertising the hacks they sell this realy needs addressing. Active nodes instead of what the game has now get rid of military grade craftables C4 should be air drop only and they should only allow crafting of very crude weapons. The game also needs a better melee/skinning system. I'm hoping they expand the map in the next two updates or set like 3 different maps to play on and have them auto load so its not always the same thing.I am super excited to see some of the changes I have read about and some of the things players have recomended in the forums.Well worth 20 bucks Enjoy!,Rust

2013-12-28,0,0,26,True,Recommended,If you've got $20 bucks laying around then get this game if you're looking for game of the year material then don't. As of now it's a rinse and repeat process. If you have other friends on the same server as you it's near impossible to find eachother. There's no map system implemented so your forced to communicate out of game. If you manage to find your friends you have to start gathering materials. There's three different types as of now wood stone and ore. They spawn randomly in locations around the world. The entire map is huge but not the entire thing is used. If you ever played the Arma 2 DayZ mod it's the same as debug land. It's nothing just trees and low quality textures. The game becomes grindy when you begin constructing a base. It takes a TON of wood for building a good base. The gun system is alright but it's RNG based if you find the plan to make the good ones. You have to camp the rad bases to get them. The way that raiding/griefing works at the moment is awful. When you log off the game your character stays in the place that you logged off. Often people will raid your base while you're offline and you will log and and lose all previous progress. Short term gain short term fun.Overall I've enjoyed the game and there are some features that make a great game but there is a lot of work to be done.,Rust

Some servers can be more friendly than others but in most cases every person you see has hostile intentions.Some suggestions to make this game even better (FIXED) Lights inside buildings if you light a fire use a furnace or use a lamp everyone else outside can see the light even if you have no windows We should be able to use fists to punch people (Company is called FacePunch.... and we can't Punch someone in the face D ) more soon",Rust
2015-09-27,0,0,118,True,Not Recommended,Okay lets just sum up this game really ing quick.Rust is an any on any clan based PvP talking simulator disguised as an incredibly grindy survival game.So if dear reader you wish to get a survival game about actually surviving perhaps solo? Don't get this game. Rust I feel at present is heavily geared towards those people who actually have the time and schedules to hop onto the game every single day.No not many adults can manage this schedule.That's why there's so many kids in Rust.Give it a miss if you're not into a seriously competitive experience and I don't mean in terms of content over price or something like that. I mean CS GO competitive. The real I can't stress this enough. If you haven't got at least half a dozen buddies willing to take the $20 plunge with you don't waste your money or your time.Rust no longer has any room for anything non PvP.,Rust

Which on top of the rest of my files are reading as corrupt and missing files. But steams verfication says its perfectly fine. So in turn I give you STEAM and extreamly bad rating as well. For this because YOUR ALLOWING it. Yes this might be an alpha. But Rust is still SELLING a product and accepting consumers money for a product that is faulty and has been for some time now and has not been or even attempted to be corrected yet according to the reviews and forums that i read on Rust threw steam. The developers of RUST are very aware of this problem as well. So no I dont recommend this game unless you like to give away your money for no reason and if that is the case you can just give it to me. Untill this problem is fixed OR I get a refund Which i dont see ethier happening I wont be purchesing any more alpha's or beta's. How about stop being so lazy and greedy and finishing something for once before you try to collect LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD.",Rust

Right now the game is absolutely UNPLAYABLE because of an ongoing DDoS.

People who are ""friendly"" will work with you for some time until they want to steal from you and kill you while you sleep.I understand this is all part of the game. it is one of the features that drew me to rust. the problem is lack of content the npc are pointless and the ai sucks.This leads to tons of people just killed for the lols.

Its sad but in my first 10 hours of Rust I was killed after looting a town by two guys. I was very ed as I was hoarding my supplies and good weapons. I typed furiously in chat how much of a ing those guys were and asked why they killed me for no reason. The one guy pointlessly boasts his hours played and other random crap but the thing that stuck to me was when he said ""Well welcome to Rust. What did you expect?"" At that moment it clicked and I was no longer mad at the guys for ing me over my stuff. I spawned back at camp and went about my way. Point being you will be killed for no real reason you will lose hours worth of collecting in minutes and you will be betrayed. Its a game based on survival so don't expect everyone to be friendly or even leave you alone. I love the game and have 70+ hours clocked and atleast 80% has been for nothing (raided killed etc.)What you need to ask yourself is wether you are ok will losing everything spawning back with a rock in one hand a torch in the other a couple bandages in your pocket and doing it all over again.",Rust

2014-07-10,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Unless you enjoy being killed by hackers do not even bother with this game. I have been to i believe 8 different servers and every one of them had hackers. In my most recent and very last encounter me and 3 friends had spent over 12 hours in one server. We had finally got a fortress and all that fun stuff only to be destroyed by a hacker with moonjump and a hack that he could instakill you with the second he saw you. There are NO servers that hackers won't find. Also even IF there ACTUALLY is an admin on they can't ban the hackers They are un bannable! Honestly if it wasn't for the hackers this game would be my dream game. Unfortunately that isn't the case.,Rust
2014-07-10,0,0,1271,True,Not Recommended,"I have only had about 5 sessions of this game me and 3 of my buddies. Rust has several features that I absolutely love about it. For example #1 It's a great survival/crafting/MMO #2 Crafting system is pretty realistic and customizable #3 Graphics and engine are ""alright"" for alpha #4 Extremely fun to play with friends.. and probably a few more reasons that I just can't think of right now.. But unfortuneatly it's the bad features about this game that pushed me to the point of uninstalling it... Just hear me out before you spend money on this. There are these ""wonderful"" people called hackers and they are not fun at all.. You spend hours upon hours upon days building your fort or house preparing hunting and gathering and then all of the sudden your dead for no reason. Why? Lag? Maybe the server crashed. Or it was a rare glitch? NOPE! There's a ""hacker"" who's invisble invincible and can teleport to the inside of your base. (Which you have spent days fortifying it and making it nearly impenetrable by a ""normal"" player) Checking your inventory inside your comfy and secure base next thing ya know DEAD!! I guess from the hacker's point of view it would probably be really funny to kill someone repeatedly and steal all of their things. Your just spawning over and over hoping to get away while the admin of the server can't even ban them to help you due to another hack! It's frustrating! This has happened to me and my buddies on 4 out of the 5 servers that we have played on.. So please!! Please!! Save yourself the hours of work time and stress (and possibly actual physical pain as well depending on how long you've been sitting in your computer chair) and wait for this to be fixed. The game is still in Alpha so I'm praying that there will be an update down the road that fixes the hacks.. Like I said this game is great!! One of the best survival crafters that I've played. I hate uninstalling it but it's not worth the trouble I'm putting myself through. I would have no problem recommending this game to everyone I know if it wasn't for all of the ridiculous hacking going on. So until this problem is fixed I won't play it and I'm not going to recommend it.

Especially on large servers the wars and skirmishes that can take place are astonishing. several days ago i dropped into a random server of about 25 30 people. I was immediately assigned a team and TP'ed to the teams base where I meant everyone suited up given a job room to sleep (their base was built like a medevial castle existing in the south) and participated for several hours in a massive 25 v. 25 war between the teams on the server. there we several battles day and night but we ended up winning. after that it was rebuilding for a day and back to it. Such exemplifies the broad spectrum of possibilities in this game. I recommend this game to any and everyone who likes games like Skyrim DayZ 7 Days to Die and Minecraft.,Rust

You should have levels/ranks in a game like this so it isnt so much of a ""Lets go kill all the newbies"" kind of game. I hope in the future though that they make it so you can get even more civilized in the game Cars Cement Buildings More Armor/Clothes More Weapon Attachments Better Houses and Factions.

2014-01-01,0,0,85,True,Recommended,Rust is a post apocalyptic multiplayer survival game in which you can t trust anyone. The game is good at making you paranoid and I love it. You start with nothing but a rock a torch and two bandages which you have to use to survive the zombies wolves bears and other survivors. You have to make a house to live in but this house can be taken over by others if you don t look after it. You have to gather resources but these can be stolen from both your corpse and your house. You have to set a spawn point by making a sleeping bag but this can also be destroyed. You can even be killed while you're offline so you're never safe!One of the great things about this game is that it doesn t have a minimap. You can't just look at a map in the corner of your screen and see where everything is you have to memorize the environment. This might seem really harsh and it sort of is but after playing it for a couple of hours I knew where I could find everything. Just follow the road my friends told me and they were right. By following the road and memorizing its surroundings you know where everything is and it really adds to the experience.I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who doesn't care for a story and just wants to have fun. It's more fun with friends but even on your own you can accomplish a whole lot. The game is still in alpha so there are a lot of small things that don't seem quite right and bugs are found everywhere too. Servers keep going down lately because of hackers but this is not the game's fault. I'm sure the game itself will be a lot better when it's finished but even now I can recommend this game.,Rust

2016-02-18,0,0,1648,True,Recommended,Well what can I see I've played this game from day one. It's a total gem of a game. Everything you need from a survival sandbox. The build system however is in constant flux. They get it just right then change it and ruin it. Then they fix it and get it right only to repeat the process over again and again. Only negative I have about the game as such. Naturally it's kill or be killed so if you are a wimp pass on this game PvP is a key part of it. You do get chat trolls. Just troll them back lol. Worst thing gameplayers wise are clans. They are all bad shots however numbers always put them in the lead. But other than that. BUY THIS game! Awesome is the only word to describe it,Rust

2016-02-18,0,0,492,True,Recommended,Great pick up on sale. Took about 5 hours and a lot of deaths to get used to the basics and what is available to use but tons of fun now to go exploring in lower populated servers and interacting in the larger ones. Well worth the money and very impressed with the continued development and constant work.,Rust
2016-02-18,0,0,45,True,Recommended,I was absolutely obsessed with this game back in 2014 I loved the feeling of constant anxeity of hearing another player (or radioactive wolves and bears) coming up behind you whilst you gathered resources or waited out the night in you rickety little wooden shack. Then for some reason I just stopped playing.Last night was my first play through since then and I was absolutely amazed by how things changed.I LOVE the inventory system it's so simplistic and a lot easier to manageAnd the building system is another feature that has taken the simplistic road making it a lot less of a headache and a lot easier to build quickly under pressure of other players in the area.Also the maps a beautiful filled with colour and sound the only thing is (maybe it was just the server I was on) I struggled to find any deer or boars (but that's not a fault of the game and was just possibly the server I was on)I would definately re recommend this to previous Rust enthusiasts I'm glad after months of debating whether to get back into it or not that I did. So much work has been done (as opposed to other early access games I've been playing) and you can tell developers are moulding this into a top contender of the mulitplayer survival genre,Rust

2016-03-06,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,The idea of this game is a great one and this game could be so much more then what it is I do not recommend this game to anyone that dose not want to waste money and time. I put over 5 hours straight into this game just to be killed by a unfair match up with someone that had amour and a automatic weapon against me and all i had was a stick and a rock. the high rank players of this game have gotten board and now just hunt the new players that can not defend themselves for what to see this game fail due to no new players. if you are going to have this game run this way then the servers need to be divided so new players have a chance to learn the game and raise there own skills.,Rust
2016-03-06,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,Loved this game when i got the chance to play it. You must have pretty tough skin when playing this game. Lots of folks cry about the grind. If you are tired of dying either learn to defend yourself or stop building until you find a bunch of like minded individual to play with you.I'm NOT RECOMMENDING this game because the anti cheat (EAC) software for rust hates windows 10 (or just something on my computer that i'm blaming on windows 10). Every night when i try to play i'm given a launcher error. after fiddling around with it for a few hours SOMETIMES i'm able to get back into it. Tonight i've been trying to get in for 3 hours. I can't deal with this crap anymore.I'LL BE BACK to see what changes have been done to the game if/when they ever make EAC more compatible with Windows 10 or they pick up a more popular anti cheat program.,Rust

2014-05-12,0,0,48,True,Recommended,A good game but if you are going to buy this game you should know that the game is not fully done being made. The game now being $20 is a little over priced for this game. Yet I have heard that by the time the game is fully done being made that is might cost up to $60 (Not sure if true). You could say this game is like minecraft but more hardcore. If you do not know who made the game it was made by Facepunch Studios that company is the maker of Garrys Mod. I would give this game a 7.5/10 now but when the game is fully done I think it can be a 9/10 at the most.,Rust
2014-05-12,0,0,43,True,Recommended,Be warned Rust not for casual players. Because of other commitments I'm only able to get a couple of hours in once a week and because stuff items progress whatever degrade if they go untouched for a period of time I frequently find myself right back at the beginning. This oviously means that I no longer want to play much.However it really is a great game nice graphics easy to get to grips with but plenty of depth. Also while there is plenty of noob murdering scumbags out there there's also some pretty friendly players out there. Would be fantastic fun if you had a few on line friends to play with which I unfortunately don't.,Rust

2014-01-03,0,0,14,True,Recommended,It's good. It's also very early in testing. Rust needs a lot more to it so it doesn't become boring quickly. I think they should program random map generators that include abandoned cites risk of hoards (since zombies exist but you only ever see them separated). More updates come out weekly so I do anticipates many many changes and addons. These are my ideas for now.,Rust

2014-01-03,0,0,131,True,Recommended,This game is absolute gold. I like DayZ and played it a good bit but DayZ is so buggy and I feel that in DayZ you can more easily die get lost and its way harder to find your friends. In Rust I have found 0 bugs so far and minor lag in servers. Now understand that both of these games are both not in full version and its hard to judge which is better. In Rust you can type in the chat which is linked to everyone in the whole server unlike DayZ in which you can chat to only people in your vicinity. But in Rust like DayZ you can only voice chat to your vicinity.But enough about DayZ.In Rust Its kind of easier to find your friends. There is one road in the whole entire game ( see the map on my profile ) and the road goes in kinda a figure 8 shape without crossing in the middle. The game also kinda has a Minecraft feel to it. When you start in the game you start with 2 Medkits a torch (for night) and a rock. This rock you can use to beat people zombies bears deer pigs and mine rocks and trees. You can craft in this game but dont think its anything like Minecraft for a second. This game isn't blocky like minecraft which is the mistake i made when my friend told me that this game was like minecraft and DayZ mixed. Also theres radiation in this game and its resembles a lot like Falllout. Radiation kills you and they can be found in these little towns thats you find if you continue on the road. Your radiation levels are in the bottom right hand of the screen and you hear a ticking noise (like in fallout) when your in radiation. Now why do they have radiation in this game you ask? Well they put radiation in these towns because in these towns there is good loot that respawns everys 5 10 minutes. It would be ashame if someone camped in the town and took the loot. Its exciting to loot the towns because you find some great things like Guns Ammo blueprints (talk about this in a second) pickaxes armor. The PvP is fun too finding people while you have a loaded gun is better. Also in this game you can craft anything that is in the game but you wont be able to just craft a gun straight from the start. When you loot towns you can find blueprints which unlock the capability to craft more advanced stuff. Also there are airdrops where a giant plane flys over and drops boxes of loots. Its kinda like the Hunger Games with the Cornocopia and how everyone at the same time rushes to get to the loot lol. Also you can build pretty cool houses (its not like minecraft building) and when you put a door on your house only you can open that door so if you manage to keep your door closed when your not there people cant get in... Actually i lied they can. If you have a wooden door people can hit down your door with a Rock Pickaxe Stoneaxe or the hatchet. It actually takes a while but if you have good stuff in your house its worth their while. You can craft metal doors that people CANT break down unless they have explosives which are pretty hard to find. One last thing When you log off the game your charecter does not just disapear and you are no longer in the game. No no. When you log off the game Your character just falls down and goes to sleep and you are still able to be killed. So make sure your somewhere safeOverall like I said this game is gold. And i totally recommend anyone to purchase it.9/10,Rust
2014-01-03,0,0,83,True,Recommended,"Absolutely can not get enough of this game. It has the suspense of survival down pat and its only in an early alpha state. Survival building similar to minecraft Zombie ai and radiactive loot caches Wildlife to hunt Players!!! Best part of the game.. most are super ""dbags"" according to chat but seriously... in a post apocalyptic world with minimal ai at this point there are hardly any reasons to not kill someone on sight and soo many reasons to kill someone food suupplies safety knowing they wont cut you down and steal your when you turn your back on them. Really makes it hard and enjoyable to have to earn trust of players but when you all finally build something great together its just awesome to look at it and exciting to defend it from others.",Rust

2014-01-03,0,0,84,True,Recommended,"All i need to say about this game is that if you are willing to play hours and hours of it then make sure you prepare for some strong ""Feels"" and moments that make you want to throw you computer out the window. That being said this game is quite great for a Alpha due to the fact that in my time i only managed to see on bug and that is one were a player dies and there body twerks as if they were taken over by Miley Cyrus. Now lets get into what the game is really about Rust is a surviaval game mixed with many features like base building and crafting . While playing Rust i got a huge vibe that this game was made by the shadows of Minecraft and Dayz which is a good thing because both are popular and have a huge fan base. Another feature are the many guns that the game has that are all craftable with blueprints that are found in many places such as boxes and zombies. Due to the fact that there are guns you should asume that there will be players shooting other players and there is no better immersion than someone with the best gear shooting at you with all of you and with all of yoiur loot you want to get to safety but at the same time bring a sad ending to you hunters life and taking there loot. One side not is that the game is very easy to learn the curves and if you ever run into someone you still have the chance to shoot them due to the fact that guns behave like no other game and it is imposible to have 100% accuracy but i would tell you to say friendly but it is your choice ). Now lets get to the pros and cons.Pros Immersion Base Building Addicting Gameplay The felling of ""Just one more Hour""Cons Some bugs (points not taken away due to Alpha) No way to protect new spawns because they have a rock and others have assult rifles Score 85/100 (can't wait to see what this game brings)",Rust
2014-01-03,0,0,106,True,Recommended,good game i got around 60 hours on it and i like it what they want for the game seems to be like dayZ but looks like gmod xD maybe not a look a like of gmod but kind of the same in my eyes get it if you like building games and dayz its the best of a few games the pvp it ok loads of naked men with rocks runing around if you like that get it! if not then get DayZ alot more better but both are in early access so wait for a while befor making your mind on what one you want if you can get both i like both but i have played more rust then dayz becasue in rust you need 2 3 friends to play with in dayz you can go solo but its not fun. so if u have 2 3 friends and some cash all get rust and play it it can be fun if not then get dayz because you can play solo! hope my review helped u make ur mind up &lt 3 rust,Rust

It's really fun to play with your friends.

2014-08-10,0,0,475,True,Recommended,Dozens fight to survive the wilderness starvation and each other... nude. You start off with a rock torch and some bandages. This game is unforgiving in itself and the player base only adds to the paranoia that is Rust. This game is a PvP'ers haven.Resource gathering can be deadly if you don't watch your back. I found myself developing twitch reactions to any and every sound. You heart will pound once you amass enough to care about losing and lose you will.If you're looking for a fun intelligent and challenging game that will not hold your hand... then you have found Rust.,Rust

2016-09-08,0,0,1165,True,Recommended,This game is brutally unforgiving but it is so addictive. It is still an early access game so there are a lot of things still changing. Those changes are probably the cause of the recent mixed reviews. However the developers are constantly listening to the player base and updating the game. Even if you don't like the vanilla version of the game there is fun to be had in modded servers. I would only suggest this game if you understand that it is still very much a work in progress. It changes often and there will be plenty more changes before it is done. I would also suggest starting on a small population server as they are more forgiving.,Rust

2014-08-15,0,0,25,True,Recommended,Rust is still in a very early stage of development but is still loads of fun to play. It feels like a mixture of Minecraft and Fallout. There are bugs and glitches that need to be heavily worked on but what do you expect in an aplha. Overall I really enjoy this game and would recommend to anyone who like the building/survival type games. On a side note what could be better than running around naked with a rock in your hand trying to kill other naked guys LOL.,Rust
2014-08-16,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Ok so I think ive played enough of this to give it a reveiw this game is better with a friend or two. So where to start. The gun play and really good along with the weapons you get just enough reciol but not too much. The base building is easy to use and it just flows. The crafting system is fluid and is really easy to use and pick up. Hunting for food feels really hard if you don't find a road and this is where players come in and kill you. Riot zones (towns) there is a massive risk with the players but if you get out alive the equipment is really good in there. Supply drops can give you extremley good equipment so if any drop near you try to get them before everyone else. ALWAYS shoot randoms if they shoot at you first this is risky but you don't want to make enemys. Also prep your base for any form of attakc you WILL get raided and must be prepard. To sum things up this game is amazing for an alpha and I give an Alpha review of 9/10.,Rust

2014-01-05,0,0,19,True,Recommended,This game is exceptionally good as the community in game is very helpful and not full of idiots killing for nothing... Its more of a finished product compared to day Z or 7 Days and multiplayer with friends is very good and fun you can learn the basics quite easily and is also a blast playing solo as well. It does have its faults though as the AI is a bit dumb and crafting is a bit buggy too. Overall I would give this a (7.3/10) as it has a lot of re playability value and is very fun both co op with friends and solo.,Rust
2014-01-05,0,0,804,True,Recommended,Rust. A great game with a lot of fun activites. this game will get you addicted and is deffinitly worth the buy i have so much fun gathering and building homes communitys i have even built a Village. This game is a good game to play by yourself and a amazing game with friends. Wether you are Raiding other player houses killing zombies or people you will most likely have fun with it. The player interaction is pretty good. Those are the positives. For the negatives The game can be a bit skippy and it takes a bit of a better computer to run it at the better of the settings. The hackers are annoying every server there is hackers they ruin your fun and they steal your stuff and kill you and it takes them a couple hours to get banned then again it is in alpha so they will most likely get fixed very soon. Other than that the game is amazing probably up there for my top 3 and i would highly recommend this game.,Rust

2014-01-05,0,0,203,True,Not Recommended,"Things I've learned while playing Rust 1) As they very clearly warn you it's an alpha game. At the time of writing (Dec 31st release of the Alpha) the Developers seem to be more focused on the environment and mechanics of the sandbox and less focused on content. There's not much to do once you've built your base up and raided every other home except pick another server and do it all again. I did this on three different servers before I got bored. That said the game itself seems relatively free of major bugs. There are plenty of minor bugs to be found but they don't really have any effect on the outcome or possible enjoyment of the game.2) There are far too many hackers. It takes way too much effort to build up a supposedly ""safe"" base only to have it griefed and/or ruined by no clippers and wall hack thieves. I expect people to do legitimate raids (I know I do) but you are powerless against hackers. It takes several hours of play time to acquire enough resources to build a secure home and hackers can undo all your work in a matter of seconds. If you're lucky they will only kill your sleeping body and steal your stuff. If you're not they'll wall off access to your base and you won't be able to use it again. You can't adjust parts of your base without obnoxious amounts of explosives...3) As with all open PvP games ""there's safety in numbers"" in this world as well. If you have more friends to play with you it's likely that you will have a good time raiding other people's homes and wreaking havok until you get bored. If you're solo you had better be a good negotiator a really good shot really sneaky or some reasonable combination.In short it is a novel idea but it is not fleshed out enough at this time. Maybe check it out in a few months.",Rust

2014-06-25,0,0,94,True,Recommended,"You spawn in a new server wanting to start fresh. You picked one of the more populated servers thinking ""I can handle other players!""So with your trusty rock in hand you begin to hack away at the resource piles in front of you. As you gather your stone you hear footprints from in front of you. You stop hacking at the rock and peek around ever so slowly to see a man in full kevlar staring at you with a dangerous object resembling a gun pointed straight at your head. He says to you ""Go away. Stay away from my base or I will kill you.""So you run and you run and you run some more. Then BAM an M4 shot sounds and you hear a bullet ping off the ground from next to you. You turn around at the last second to see the same person shoot you in the face.You respawn in a peacefull valley next to a concrete bunker. You decide to explore. As you happily run up to a weapon crate you hear footsteps from behind you ""probably just a deer"" you say to yourself. You open the box to see an MP5A4! You are so happ tp get your first gun but then a voice comes from behind you ""Thats mine B***H!""You turn around to see a man slam the blunt surface of a rock into your skull and you lose your first gun.TIPS!! if you are new join a rather unpopulated server.

Your base WILL be stolen from you by some hat with hacks.Now for the review It's fun enough with friends but the community is utter trash. Everyone just abuses each other in the chat. Never have I seen so many biggots together in one place than on a Rust server. Everyone will just grief everyone else so nobody ever gets anything done. Grind for hours (if your lucky) and lose it all to some guy who just throws it on the ground to despawn anyways. If you don't have friends to play with already or you're some kind of weirdo who likes heartache go for it. Otherwise don't bother.Also it crashes a lot lately and takes a year to load intop the game and another year to load into a server.,Rust
2017-03-31,0,0,688,True,Recommended,I would relly recommend this game i have a lot of hours on this game and enjoyed every second the only problem would be the amount of harvesting that is needed to get a good base up.,Rust
2016-09-01,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Even though ive only just started playing rust this week i can honestly say im addicted! ( this is during the time of a new expansion in world of warcraft...... that i havent played in a few days... says alot lol) I love this game! maybe that will change after i max level and do some raids but i dont think so. What other game can you find a house that has no locks on it walk in and steal someones stuff while they lay on the floor asleep? seriously i did this twice to someone(same person with no locks) and each time i took all his good stuff i eneded up leaving him nothing but mushrooms the first time and the second time a bunch of corn that i took from his crops lol LOVE THIS GAME9/10 would ruin someones few hours of prep again!,Rust
2016-09-01,0,0,393,True,Recommended,In this game you will Die as soon as you spawn get called every cuss word in the book die to bears get tricked and killed but over all this game is amazing I love sandbox games and this is definetly my favorite of them all.,Rust
2014-06-20,0,0,805,True,Recommended,Bottom line if you like hardcore competitive sutvival games this is for you. The only downside is the amount of scumbags using hacks which will hopefully be resolved with the new release. Don't buy this game if you are looking for nice people though...it is a grief fest. There are tons of servers though with different mods so odds are you can find a server that you will like. Best $20 I have spent in a long time.,Rust

2014-06-20,0,0,131,True,Recommended,Fun game plenty of different servers depending on what you want to do build PvP or simply survive. Can get frustrating and seems mostly fun to play along with your friends so you can get a good thing going. ),Rust

2016-03-15,0,0,155,True,Recommended,Great game but barely works on mac glad im getting a new PC soon /,Rust
2016-03-15,0,0,249,True,Recommended,Great game. You kinda start to feel like your in mincraft when you start to build and like a combination of Farcry and Battlefield when u get in a firefight.When you raid it can be very interesting do to your position and your opponents position as well as your skills compared to their skills. The most fun part of it though is when you get in the hard to survive times that make it feel like your in Day Z but of course without the zombies until a posible unknown date because they were talking in the forums about adding zombies to rust. Needless to say i am in full support of all those who wish to buy rust its a great game just buy the game and have fun.,Rust

2014-01-07,0,0,58,True,Recommended,"Total BUY!!! I have it in it's Alpha form but its potential for The GAME that revolutionizes Survival RPG FPS will be ""Rust"" Their are several outstanding ways they can go and either way it's gonna be a Blast!. Hands Down a Game to Purchase if your into the surviving zombies wilderness creatures everything is of a craft/importance.... Like games ""Minecraft"" or ""Don't Starve"" games that apeal to your liking but don't fit your mature status.. well RUST WILL D make alliences or swore enemies with RL players try to survive anyway you can?! ya.... you bet I will choose to post a Review . I need to build some capital. I want to take over the Map. Gain it all...... help and be helped. Or Die and Do something else..... Isolate and eliminate. either way I will be doing it in ""Rust.""

2015-12-24,0,0,690,True,Recommended,The base building and gathering aspect is fun although eventually gets boring. I got a couple hundred hours out of this game and pretty much experienced everything it had to offer. You really need to find a server that fits your play style though. Being a constant PVP game you will find lots of immature kids or large clans bent on dominating everybody. For the price I'd recommend trying it but you have to give it time. I would also recommend starting on modded servers as the official ones more challenging for newer players.,Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,83,True,Not Recommended,DisasterThe game is good but every server including the official ones are plagued with hackers.The game is in development I understand but to completely brush off hackers and barely doing anything to pin down these people is just demoralising. Can you imagine sacrificing 2 days of your time to let a hacker walk pass all your walls and take all your items?If this does not deter you from buying this game I know that when you experience it yourself you will know what I meant.There is absolutely NO server that has NO hackers. There will be hackers everywhere and they are spoiling the game.,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,112,True,Recommended,No way to many hackers and they are only growing in number. Good game bad community and you have to take both cant take just one.I had this as a negative review but after the new updates and the hackers seeming to be in the minority the game is now a thumbs up.,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,60,True,Recommended,This game is still early access but couldn't be stabler. It's a great representation of a survival game it's probably the best one I've played in years. I've played 31 hours and haven't even notice because I've been so impersed in the game. It keeps you thinking and stays on your mind especially when your building a mansion on it. Though there are a lot of people that are off just beacasue the dedicated server files haven't been release publicly..though com'on guys it's still early alpha/beta. I love that there are already modded servers giving us access to find our cords shared door access to friends make leather out of cloth etc. This game is a great gift for ages 12 and up. well worth my money...even though I paid for it twice im not mad.,Rust
2014-01-08,0,0,30,True,Recommended,A great game although not without a few faults. The main problem at the moment is that raiders have the ability to break in and steal your gear without any real defence against it at least while you're offline. Besides that a very enjoyable game sofar and considering it's still in alpha it will be interesting to see what improvements the developers make in the future. This game gets a thumbs up from me although be prepared to deal with a heavy dose of raiders and griefers...,Rust
