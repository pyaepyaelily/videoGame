2017-12-29,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,This game is a big waste of time And not in the good way. I wouldn't recommend playing this game unless you play with a group of friends if you don't then don't bother they have to be active players. The game can't seem to put a cap on power consumption either pretty terribly optiumized even if you crank all the settings to the lowest there is only a drop of 1 2C in temps from Ultra settings to Low. So this game runs hot regardless of if you pick potato settings or not.,Rust

2015-06-25,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Super fun game if you have friends. I would not recommend if your going to play by yourself because you will most likely get killed by everyone you meet.

Anyways if you are a 10 year old who goes to your mommy for everything dont buy this game.,Rust
2017-12-24,0,0,254,True,Recommended,The best hardcore survival game I've ever played. Full of drama often the good kind. Probably best to play with 2+ people as it can get really frustrating solo. Not that solo isn't super fun but starting with a group is the nicest way to learn the game. The game has official servers and community ones official ones are all well maintained and great. Game is still being updated like crazy too with big features every other patch. If you like longterm world persistence this game isn't for you (in its current state). 99% of servers completely wipe once a week or once a month to keep the server from being overrun with houses/max geared characters. The game is also very skill based so if you like RPG style/level based gameplay then Rust probably won't be your cup of tea.Other than that if you can accept a medium to high learning curve and hardcore experience this game is quite awesome! And if you have friends to play with already the game can be great even if your a more casual player as it has a lot of different activities (gathering building sorting scouting/exploring manipulating/befriending your neighbors) that aren't PVP based. Good luck and if you happen across me in a server... visit my shop! D,Rust

2016-12-25,0,0,1209,True,Recommended,Some of the best survival game I'v played yet.Good investion and almost endless fun hours of gameplay in my oppinion. Sry for bad english! (,Rust
2014-02-23,0,0,214,True,Recommended,I have been on this game for a little while and i have enjoyed it so far been killed a few times and the people who do it have some of the best gear in the game. The killing is understandable dont get me wrong its annoying but understandable when you start playing there is quite a lot to do but once you have all the blueprints and awesome gear you just want to go kill people until new items are added and challengin npc's are put it for people to encounter. I personally thing if you are going to update the pve aspect of the game try adding some for of mutant monster thing which is hard to kill by yourself but easier with other people because i think this might decrease the whole people killing people for no reason vibe and increase the team work vibe. All of that said i am enjoying it so far D,Rust

2015-11-05,0,0,2304,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a game about human nature. If you aren't fully convinced that humans are evil (or naturally inclined to be mean/awful/rude/selfish towards other humans) then you will be after playing this game. This video game encourages others to murder steal and then brag about it. The community (or lack thereof) in this game is toxic and will eventually be the downfall of this awful game. I enjoyed the minecraft aspect of the game and the graphics but the players ruined it for me. Everyone kills you on sight and takes all of your stuff back to square one. This is a common problem in survival/pvp/sandbox games. Why is that? Why is this a common problem? Because humans are evil and they dispaly their cruel evil nature when let loose on video games on the internet. Dare to mention anyone's profane and immoral speech or behavior (for which they would either be institutionalized or imprisoned in real life) and you will be ridiculed mocked etc. There are very few mature adults or people with a conscience playing this game. As western society abandons its Judeo Christian history a subjective view of morality rises to the forefront. What's right for you is right for you and what's right for me is right for me? Sounds good doesn't it? What if my right tells me its ok to murder you and take what you have worked for? Is it right then? No it's wrong and will always be wrong. And whether you are doing it in real life your mind or a video game it is still wrong. The developers of this game have gone out of their way to make the death experience as realistic as possible the sounds of a human screaming for his life and bleeding out are trutly reprehensible and blurrs the lines between fantasy and reality. The people who made this game should be ashamed of themselves. The truly scary part?This is what life would really be like without laws prisons courts civil authorities etc. The human is by nature evil and must be restrained. This is an awful game and if you care at all about your soul you should avoid it.UPDATE So I've sank another what...6 months into this game? Yeah something kept drawing me back although I knew better. I'm leaving Rust for good. Jesus said it best The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy I have come that they may have life and have it to the full. (John 10 11)Rust is a game about thieving murdering and destroying. It glorifies sin and I am ashamed I have sank so many hours into this worthless game.,Rust
2017-12-14,0,0,785,True,Recommended,Rust is really fun to play with friends. And if you like games that you need to gather resources then this game is for you. And you can raid people and steal there stuff. And soon it will be cars and boat. Its already a chopper and a tank. And you can play solo if you want.,Rust

2017-07-05,0,0,28,True,Not Recommended,RUSTDo I have a lot to say for this game. Lets begin with a summary of what my review is going to include I will be covering 5 aspects of this game and ratting them on a scale of 0 5. Closer to the end of my review I will include my personal opinion what made me buy this game and what I dislike about it and what I want in the game to be added.GRAPHICS 4/5The graphics of this game are quite georgous. From the reflections of the water to most of the textures this game is with no question one of the best looking games I played. Now some people will say I am over exadurating but I'm really not. The look of this game will appeal to most people who have played First Person games before. Using a 1050ti I was able to put this game on the highest settings and run it at around 60 fps most of the time.Here are my specs I5 6600k 3.5 GHzMSI GTX 1050 TI16 Gigabytes Of DDR4SERVERS 5/5 This all depends on where you live but I had no trouble what so ever finding a server. I never experienced any server lag while playing on this game. But do take this with a grain of salt because not all servers are official servers and it will always depend on your Internet connection. There are many different types of servers to choose from there are free for all servers where you can spawn in with a few weapons and instantly jump into a fight. These can get quite chaotic but some people will enjoy this madness. There are also servers that split people into 2 teams sending them to fight each other until either team is killed. And there are tons of regular rust servers you spawn in gather supplies build a base and etc. But to sum it up for most people there is always something to do.GAMEPLAY 2/5Gun shots everywhere arrows flying explosions roaring. This is what you might imagine Rust to be like and so did I. But most of the time I ended up being killed by someone hitting me to death with a rock or just being killed with a spier. This might not be the case for everyone if you have maybe ten friends or more you can build a base in a few hours and there are no worries if you die because you can just run back and pickup some extra loot that you have stored. When your ready to fight or your friends are you would search for a base near you and raid the loot thats left in hope of getting something good. But when you and your friends wake up the next morning and jump on Rust to find that your base has been raided it's not a pleasant experience. But playing this game alone is painfuly hard there will always be people who will troll you trick you or just try hard in general. And most of the time I spent in this game was looking at the beach where I spawned.COMMUNITY 2/5Piggybacking off of my last aspect this one is almost as equally bad. Now don't get offended for reading this because it's not you that I'm talking about it's the people who have given me this experience. One word can sum up the people I have met TOXIC. I have only been able to properly talk and maybe friend one person while playing this game (hats off to you.) Everyone that I have attempted to befriend try to talk to or get to know has back stabbed me or trolled me. There are a lot of games that I have started to play and enjoy just because of how friendly people were. But whenever I was in a server and needed help with controls or basics of the game someone would either say KYS or laugh. Only %10 of the time I got a legit response which is quite sad because some of you need to grow up. Maybe if more people tried to be inviting to new players or at least nice I would have enjoyed the game a little more. DEVELOPMENT 3.75/5I would have given a higher score but there is one thing that bothers me the most Early Access. I can not explain to you enough how long this game has not been officially published. And don't get me started on the amount of glitches this game has it's mind blowing really. I see a few patches coming out here and there every once in a while which I'm fine with and I support beIause it shows that the developers did not completely run off with my money and still support the game. So why did I buy this game in the first place? A few reasons actually I was about to build my PC and move on from my laptop so I wanted something to play when I finished so I picked this up and GTA V. But what really made me want to get the game were the insane youtube videos of people building huge hotels mansions and bases. The insane and intensive raids and also the funny moments. It looked fun until I got the game and realised the amount of grinding I needed to do to achieve that. And the toxicty brought me to the last straw making me write this review. So don't think you will be able to achieve all of that maybe with some help of friends you will be able to do it. But if you do decide on achieving these things good luck getting sleep. What I would have liked to be added into this game is a single player mode with more enemies maybe NPCs that would try to go after you and kill you. Maybe something thats a less pain in the My final score for this game is 12.75/20 giving it a %63.75 percent.But the final question should you buy this game? Do you love being a ? Are you up to face the grindiest game of them all? Then this game is for you. But on a serious note if you think you might enjoy this game pick it up on sale for $10. You might enjoy it more than I did.Thanks for reading!,Rust

2017-03-10,0,0,907,True,Recommended,An early access game with beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay. I've invested plenty of time into this game to say that it is well worth the money. The fun of learning the game and building your first base and getting a few buddies together and attempting a raid are what it's all about. Solo play is intense and competitive. It's all about survival the day you wake up and all of your things are gone is the day you realize the improvements you could've made. Don't get discouraged rebuild and improve!,Rust

2017-12-27,0,0,15,True,Recommended,I feel like this game is more enjoyable when I am with friends and not playing solo especially when raids are performed. The spawn system is very fair. There are still some lobby issues e.g trying to join through friends. I play on low ping servers yet I regularly get lag and desync when im running. Also when i wake up and left click to start playing it takes a while sometimes to start.Since i have not played this game that much i will rate this up and hope for changes to take place with the issues the game has had.,Rust

2018-01-12,0,0,155,True,Recommended,"Altogether Rust is a very nice game. 9/10You start with almost nothing and have to work your way up which can be very difficult for new players / solo players.Best thing you can do is play with friends who have rust or look for people. ( there's a discord server for finding mates )There are official community and modded server. I personally preffer pure vanilla without any mods but servers with mods can be pretty funny too ! The game can tilt you fast people will try to kill you raid your base you spend hours build but you will keep your ""blueprints"" ( once you learned something you can craft it ) so it's not such a big deal to get raided.You shoulnd't take this game too serious otherwise it will makes you rage a lot..

2017-12-27,0,0,778,True,Recommended,Rust is a good game many people have come and gone in and out of the community but I have chose to go on. I joined Rust in its early experimental stages when it had just left legacy this was the prime moments of the game since it had just stepped into a new era. Since then the developers have constantly been adding fresh game changing updates that really make the game fun and enjoyable some people have left for these changes since they may have felt it was to drastic of a change. I ask that you keep in mind that this game isn't for everyone but if you keep an open mind and are ready to get raided and lose everything more than once you will learn to love it like I do.,Rust

2017-12-27,0,0,265,True,Recommended,Absolutely my favorite games on Steam and one of the best games to experience the social experiment called life of course through a digital medium. Start with a rock naked and fearless. Eventually you will be leading the slums with a rifle or two. Build a base get rekt. Build another base get rekt. Find someone else s base while they are in it decide to raid and reck them. Find a couple of nakeds band together and do some wrecking. Travel north and if your server has a clan call The North they won t give you warmth! By far a superb game even though it s still in alpha never know what the next patch is gonna bring!,Rust

2014-01-24,0,0,58,True,Recommended,It is a very nice game but in this condition it is not well a lot of pvp players in servers that are not pvp. I worked a 4 5 hours to build a house but some bandit killed me. It's very disappointing that in servers with no pvp bandits killing us.antoher thing is the night I cant do anything at night and its like 10 20 boring minutes. also I cant see anything when it evening but in the night I can see cleary and a few minutes I can't see nothing. Some of the rocks in the night looks red like its morning already But it doesnt.This concept is very good but the game need some massive changes and bug fixes to be an awsome game. If you like the concept and you want to buy the full game I recommend to buy this game now to help the developers to Improves,Rust
2014-01-24,0,0,108,True,Recommended,This is by far the best buy I have made to date. I was a bit iffy in the beginning but after only a few days of playing there are some real tight knit communities within the game. Some servers even go as far as creating towns that engage in special activities to earn hard to find or impossible to find rewards. If your into survival games with zombies then you will get a real satisfying kick out of this game. Now stop reading and go buy it already!!,Rust

2016-10-15,0,0,1339,True,Not Recommended,I have to sadly say this game is going the wrong way....When i first bought the game way back in bp days i was loving it then they switched to the god awful xp system BTW was god awful. After a while of constant negative reviews they did components which i was loving but then they changed it AGAIN for no reason. now you cant even start off the wipe doing anything because you are forced to find scrap and just to make a ing work bench to get a waterpipe but thats not even near all of it. you then have the ass tiers to the work benches that cost an insane amount of scrap to make like for real 1500 scrap for a ing tier 3 bench and then 75 per research??? thats complete bull you cant even build a proper base because now literally ing everything is a blueprint like for real the ing hoodie is a bp and so is the god damn pants. Also might i mention that now it just seems that the game is only supporting clans because of the amount of work it takes for everything and as soon as the wipe starts clans already have a monster base when you are sitting there in a 2x2. last but not least even once you have finally crafted the damn bp you then need to get the components to make it.SO IN ALL this game is turning for the worst. it will always have a place in my heart because the few good things i can say about it is that it is something that used to not get boring ( i saw used to because now the game is a pile of the old pvp experiences and the raiding and having to learn the hard way through things and getting better through you mistakes is one hell of a ride and was very fun. if theres one final thing i can ask for is bring back the old rust or normal components.PLZ DONT BUY UNTIL THEY FIX THE GAME NEW COMERS WILL HATE IT!!!,Rust
2016-07-19,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,"THIS GAME IS JUST POINTLESSAlright how I should start?Why this game is so pointless?EVERYTIME when you build a base someone will raid it.To have your base last a little bit longer you need metal to build door and secure it and a lot of at least rocks to build decent walls.But that doesn't stop anyone. If you have got a rocky house that almost every player will know that you MUST have some sulfur so yeah they will raid you anyway cuz c4 is made mostly of sulfur.Metal fragments are really hard to get you need to hunt some animals to get fuel to craft forge.Metal ores are smelting REALLY slow.After some time without this game I decided to come back to it.I was disapointed.I built a house with wooden door (I had no forge and I was building this house couple of hours) and rock walls. Someone destroyed door and changed my sleeping bad name from ""naked noob"" to &amp quot quot .2nd time with way less enthusiasm I repaired my house. After playing for about 1 5 hour I leaved game.Next day?2 walls have been destroyed and again whole useful stuff was gone.Yeah this whole time I was playing solo don't do mistake like me.YOU NEED AT LEAST 3 PPL TO DO SOMETHING IN THIS GAME.About community It's not THAT sh*t as everyone writes but in MOST cases ppl wanted to kill me even when I was naked.I asked one guy why he did waste ammo on naked guy he answered ""f*ck you"" and then he shoot me to death.I met friendly guy 2 times.Once he leaved his really good base and while he was naked he gave me iron pickaxe.2nd time some russian fully armored mature guys friendly asked me whatI'm doing and asked me ""have you seen 2 guys out here""?They even said ""have a nice day"".But mostly.This community is full of 13yokidos or 18yotilters.",Rust

Helk one of the Devs stopped listening to the loyal players that have been around since the beginning and started going on Reddit to find out what the ""True"" Rust players want. In 2016 or even early 2017 if i recall correctly the game was at it's best. The game was BIG everything about it. Wasn't so grindy like it is now the raids were bigger back then the game looked gorgeous (Even more so than it does now) and maybe its just the nostalgia on this part but the game always felt good. It was always fun always had something to do. Check out a youtuber from back in the day if you havn't done so look up Phaedo 82. You can see what rust was back in the good old days.

2017-04-25,0,0,550,True,Recommended,ING DELICOUS,Rust
2017-04-25,0,0,700,True,Recommended,"Rust is basically if Minecraft and Fallout ed and this was their offspring.If you are looking at this game you have probably already seen some of the countless gameplay videos the YouTubers who have essentially made their career off of playing this game and if you are interested in the survival genre you have probably seen at least one or two other games compared to Rust. I think it has earned its place as the standard for a survival game. I started playing Rust in December of 2015 and boy has this game gone through changes. Not every patch has knocked it out of the park. The leveling system was an interesting take but definitely not a winner as it really made things more difficult for solo players just starting out. Here's the important take away that I learned from this blunder though they realized it didn't work and fixed it. This is a development team that absolutely wants to deliver the best product they can and they really do actively listen to their community. Although it is early access this game is entirely playable and has been for quite some time.So let's dig into it shall we?The Good This game looks sounds and even SMELLS beautiful. Don't ask how I know that I can just tell ok? I've definitely caught myself sitting on a mountain looking out to a stunning sunset on a few occasions. The Dev team as someone who has been burned by early access a few times I really do trust this dev team. They really do seem to care about this game and they want to do it right. I really think they could release the game right now and still beat out a lot of major releases but no they want to really get this one right. The gameplay is solid couple hiccups here and there sure. But for the most part the gameplay feels complete and whole. From epic gun battles that can go on for literally days in game loud cracks and booms can be heard from miles throughout the map and really gives you a sense that the island you are on is alive. The crafting I don't think any other game has done it as well as this game has. One of the reasons I didn't care for Hurtworld was that the crafting was entirely linear. It felt like you basically had to just go through the motions of crafting your needed gear. This is not the case in Rust there are so many things you can make in Rust and each has their own purpose that I find myself changing the order of what I craft changing often. It really comes down to what you need immediately in Rust. Some of the crafting in Rust is almost done for ease or comfort not even survival. It really allows for you to see the difference between when you were surviving and when you are thriving it's almost 2 games in one. The time when you crawl from the beach with just your trusty rock sure you fought your way through the masses you dodged arrows and gunfire to be where you finally are your own base maybe even your own store that you built with your own hands. Creating anything in this game just feels like it means so much more to you.The Bad The game is not finished. As I mentioned there are little hiccups you will find throughout the game but the dev team is making the list of bugs shorter and shorter just about every month. My next point is extremely subjective about what you may or may not consider to be a negative. This game is extremely EXTREMELY punishing. It's not unheard of for your base to get raided and you have literally 30 hours of work completely undone. As I said this is subjective. Personally I never thought I would enjoy something that punishing but Rust has a weird way of inviting you back in to try again. There's a constant sense of ""Ok this time I will do it right."" That's how anyone gets good at Rust by having their kicked over and over and learning how people exploit your mistakes. Stick with it and you may find yourself being the exploiter soon!And that's kind of where I want to end this review on. Who should buy this game? Look there's no getting around it Rust is not for everyone. If you find that you get easily frustrated with a game then this is NOT for you. If you like a really great challenge that you can bring your friends along for the ride. If you like this new emerging survival genre then I don't think there is a single game that does it better. Considering how often this game goes on sale (I grabbed it for $10) and you have found yourself staring at this store page do yourself a favor and check it out.",Rust

Where this game shines is in the player to player contact it brings out what most people will call the animal from someone. If you don't like games that have a slow start and a sharp learning curve then this game isn't for you. I had multiple friends who got this game and didn't like it because of the unforgiving gameplay. What I figured out is that people who group together have an advantage over the solo players. I went through most of my hours playing solo but what I found out is that playing in a group is alot better. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves survival games. If you're just getting started in this growing genre then I would recommend you to stay away from this one till you can handle losing everything and I mean everything on the first night.Oh yeah and this game is real time and no singleplayer option. You could build an ""unraidable base"" to wake up the next morning to see it completely destroyed. But hey that's the fun part about it.",Rust

2017-05-11,0,0,807,True,Recommended,For all the newcomers out there just wait a solid 4 weeks until things change. Right now after the scrap update the game went to scrap and you can now build twig structures in claimed areas which to me is nonsense. Back when the XP system was out after the blueprint system that to me was when you needed to devote your life to playing rust 24/7 because you had to farm to get better things. After the component update everything (for me) was excellent and I got back into the game after about 3 months. But recently scrap to get components?....Really? I get into a game I put around 50 bucks into because well I get into a game I buy skins for it and sell after I'm done. Well I'm done with this for a solid month or so let a few updates come out and I think you and I can get back into Rust. Just to clear everything up just one word Wait. For now Im going to keep this negative. Update Still going to wait but now they have added an up keep for your base so if its wood/stone the walls degenerate in I believe 2 3 hours for wood and 5 6 for stone. I switched it to positive because why the hell not it is still a great game.,Rust

And I can't do anything about it. ..Why can't I be a girl at least c this was a downer to the game.. Don't buy it if you want to be able to decide what you want to be. No character customization whatsoever. cUntill I at least can change gender I wont recommend it. Sorry!,Rust

2017-12-31,0,0,107,True,Not Recommended,I used to recommend this game. It used to be quite fun and all especially playing with friends. Even though I don't join big servers because I do enjoy understanding building and the stuff Rust has to offer which still having a little risk not much just a little. Never mind I digressed. The problem is that since the beginning I had trouble connecting to the game I had to update this and that loading was a pain and there were crashes here and there. Nonetheless it worked out.However this time I returned there are even more problems that before. The lags. The bugs. The loading that takes ages literally. The crashes. And with all hopes of connecting and playing this wonderful game I found myself fixing over several problems only to face more. I have an i7 850 8GBram some might say it's my fault whatever it used to work perfectly on beautiful quality display. Now there's only more and more things to fix. It's sadden to see this. The DEVs aren't really replying either. The community are helping each other out which is great but I had hope the game would run smoother and smoother not having more problems.Sorry no go. I do not recommend this game as of now.,Rust

2017-12-31,0,0,186,True,Recommended,This game like similar games suffers from a really toxic community think Rocket League or CSGO times a hundred. Most of that is because PVE is so underdeveloped which leads me to my only real criticism of the game it needs more PVE elements. If this game had a real threat in PVE or even some challenges besides the Tank and Helicopter that will blow you up if you're armed it'd be a much better game and the community would be more balanced. Regardless the mechanics stand on their own. The fighting and crafting are fairly stable and let's face it who doesn't want to run around naked all the time? Hell I'm naked writing this review!As for the artwork it's been improved over the time I've played and the animation glitches seem less common. Though I highly doubt this game will ever get out of Early Access overall it's still a great game and you'll easily get your money's worth of entertainment out of it.,Rust

2017-12-09,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,This game is a lot of bull. You have to play every day for several hours to achieve anything at all. If you play alone and moderately the only thing you will get out of this is getting shot with an automatic rifle while you are running around naked with a stick picking up mushrooms. Even if you manage to build a house and get some basic clothes and weapons the next day you will still be shot like a dog behind a barn because you have not played while everyone else did. You loose everything when you die. Progress is reset periodically (1 4 weeks depending on the server).,Rust

2018-01-01,0,0,2,True,Recommended,Rust looks like an amazing game sadly my computer doesn t really support it well I guess it was my fault for thinking that this beautiful game could run on a surface pro. I still did get some good gameplay out of it though even though I was getting 3 frames per second. The graphics are amazing and the online mechanics a well thought through and very interesting. It is unique and brings something new to the survival sandbox types of games. With the ability to play online and communicate it doesn t always have to be guns blazing all out war (Most of the time it is). Sometimes you can trust or rely on other players which adds another layer to the game another tool you can use. I definitely recommend this (if your computer can handle it) if you like multiplayer survival and things like that you will love this game and will be interested and want to explore the world and opportunities that rust has to offer.,Rust

Learn to not judge everyone has an opinion or are we living in a new world order on here?Advantages Graphics are fair Decent options Decent map but would of prefered more /Disadvantages I love survival games don't get me wrong. Rust is a decent game but certain characteristics are ret***ed. The feel of the game can be unpleasant hard to put my finger on it. Maps get wiped after hard hours of work. D**ks online although d**ks on every game online... Reminds me of MineCraft.... but worse Mine Craft was decent but can be boring at times but at least it was more fair to the player. Spend hours on end collecting gear and building bases only to be destroyed by other players and your back to square one?I honestly can see why people ask for a refund on this game it is a decent game although it's not fun and can be boring and just grinding hours just for a little pleasure only to be wiped later on.,Rust

If you are an aggresive person who can deal with a toxic community then please buy this game it can be so rewarding. But if you like teamwork and are a person who thinks ""I was just standing still and was shot with an ak from 600ft away."" please DONT buy this game tbh youre not missing out on much.Overall I'd say that Rust %99 of the people in the game that are toxic the perfect game.

Just to give you a bit of helpful info you do start the game in your ""Birthday suit."" I was not aware of this when I bought the game(4pack) on a whim and gifted the other 3 to a few of my friends. I am glad my wife was in the room when I started it up for the first time she was just as surprised by it as I was and it spared me the awkwardness of having to go and say ""Hey Babe ""So I bought this new game thinking it will be fun for me and my friends to play and after sending it to them I discovered ""that you have to spend the first thirty minutes of the game looking for clothes.(if you survive that long)After a day of ownership and shame I found out that you can go to ""Settings&gt Options and at the bottom under ""Censorship"" you can censor the nudity. This will pixelate the areas were clothes should be both one your character and all other characters from your point of view. There is also a live chat that can be filled with other players who go beyond ""Salty"" and can be down right vulgar. You can also disable this under Setting&gt Options and Show Chat. From here the game does a pretty good job putting you in survival mode. I honest felt after playing the first five minutes that I was in the TV show ""Naked and Afraid "" only nobody seem to care about what I had to say PThe Crafting is my favorite part.

2018-01-20,0,0,348,True,Not Recommended,Rust has a great concept with potential but the gameplay itself is incredibly imbalanced time consuming (don't expect to accomplish anything unless you play 5 10 hours a day) full of hackers and has by far the most toxic community out of any game you will ever play.

2018-01-20,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,Have got odd bits of enjoyment in this game but generally a waste of time. At first the game will seem funny and you don't really care how well you're doing but as soon as you want to progress a little and build a little base and such it's utterly impossible. The reason....the complete crapbag of players this game has. You will get killed and attacked every single time someone seees you and they will more often than not have guns which will make out of your bow and arrow making advancement impossible. If you try to ask or complain a little in the chat everyone will tell you to stop being such a player which is irrelevent because even a great player will need a bit of time to get up and running but you will simply not get it. I can see this game being great for players that put a lot of time into it and have been playing it for a long while but if you're a noob and want to get into it just don't bother it will just leave you off,Rust

2017-11-24,0,0,744,True,Recommended,My honest review of rust... what could i say about the infamous Rust. For starters the most rage inducing game you will ever play. Losing hours of work to a zerg and constantly dying as soon as you spawn. For all the countless losses you gain skill. With that you will learn to be quick and agile becoming the one to defend from zergs or killing the person that camps. Not only is PvP a major need but so is thought. The way a base is built will determine if it will be raided or kept safe. The game is about survival do what you must to survive. In the end it all comes down to kill... or be killed.,Rust

Epic firefights will ensue as you try to defend your goodies your base and your territory.The survival market is saturated but Rust was one of the original and continues to be one of the best if not the best of the genre.9/10,Rust

2015-06-07,0,0,447,True,Recommended,Rust is still a game in progress but it definitely has come far in the last couple of years. I played the original version and have recently started the new version now that it has more content. I would definitely recommend. The devs do an excellent job of keeping players informed on what they are doing and what is coming up in the world of Rust. A lot of people complain about KOS and constant raiding but really if you find the right server and can find some people to play with it is a lot of fun. Rust is all about adaptation and starting anew. If you get too attached to the things you have built up then this may not be the game for you.,Rust

2015-01-30,0,0,2105,True,Not Recommended,Its time to change my review again. Still it will be negative ofcourse. This game is an alpha for 2 years and few months. Creators is focusing on money and new stuff in game instead of betterperformance. They even made buyable skins for items in game to get more money but its just an alpha game... maybe thats a reason they need money to create game forward. They are releasing new stuff to make peoples atracted to this game even if you have to play with 10fps in firefights or much builded places. This game requiress very powerfull computer to enjoy it playing. I love this game because its cool but I hate rust because its impossible to play without hadeaches and rage while you are killed in reason of low fps. Wipes every month that makes this game a loop. After wipe 1st sometimes 2nd week is playable but latter you can go rest untill next wipe. Reason too much abandoned buildings which makes your game very laggy and gives you low FPS. I hope a real company gonna buy this game and will finish it because right now it seems creators dont know how to balance this game performance. AMD FX8350 8 cores 4GHZ 16GB DDR3 1866 of ram AMD radeon R9 290 4GB DDR5 512bit. I heard that this game works better with intel setup but it doesnt worth to buy new PC only for this game. I can play new games on best graphics without problems but this crappy game... just crap.,Rust

2017-11-12,0,0,186,True,Not Recommended,The concept of the game is wonderful. The graphics are beautiful. It is a survival game through and through. But the community is trash. Literally is a safe haven for the bottom trash dwellers of the world. Honestly if nazis and the kkk supported games this would get the gold star from them. Also if you like to hack youll fit in with the community as well. Every server has them and the only ones that ban them are community. The developers are too focused on putting hair on genitals to do anything about hackers ruining the official servers. Dddos attacls. aimbots fly hacks esp and everything in between can be seen daily. One day it may be fixed and i hope it does. Right now though the game is broken.,Rust
2017-07-01,0,0,438,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Ok so I got this game when the component system was in the game. When one of my friends got it for me it looked really fun and it was. I played pve at first but I eventually learned the basics and went into a pvp server. I only played modded though because I don't have the time for vanilla. Now I had some top notch fun for the longest time. One of the most fun games I've ever played even though it stressed me out so much. Then.... they added the blueprint system again and all the fun gone. Instead of the fun game I once knew it was this restricted boring collecting simulator. So for as long as the blueprint system is in the game I wouldn't waste any moneyif I were you but if they add the component system back it's totally worth it.,Rust

2017-11-12,0,0,250,True,Recommended,"Let me tell you my story I was alone wondering around fending for my own life and battling the constant danger of starvation until....out of the corner of my eye I see a man. He looks at me with the eyes of a killer and I knew ""this is it"" but he had bigger plans for me. He decided that this was not the day I would die but instead...would begin to prosper. He began to help me find my base the one that I had been searching for more than 2 hours. Once we found my overly tall twig mess of a fort he walked up to me with a smile and said ""THIS IS ING HILARIOUS!"" and then he proceeded to blow it up... I began to hold back my tears as my whole 4 hours in rust had come to this moment. I thought it was all over that I would never play this insane game of life and death ever again until he looked at me once more and said ""I've got a better base for you."" I looked back with pure puzzlement and found out that we were going to his magnificent castle of epic proportions. As qe traveled we encountered many obstacles such as naked men with rocks. We treked through mountains and valleys and streams just to get to my new home and just when I thought that we would never make it I saw it....just over the peek of the mountain was the gorgeous castle for me to call home. I did it I finally did it I was....home. we got settled in and I was given a room and weapons and clothing and a friend. But then this mentally insane burgaler breaks in and kills my friend but I would not allow this treacherous murder to get away with his evil dead so I swoop in to take revenge only to be killed at the same time as I killed him...i was quickly brought back to life upstairs in my new room with my new shotgun by my side and then my friend came home again. Then I had to leave for work and once i cam back I was stuck in a dark room with nothing but a singular piece of paper taht said ""I have killed all your friends and stollen all there stuff and your future you are my slave now.""11/10 would cry again",Rust

There's no research everythings already there for you.Please do yourself a favor if you're going to buy this and stay away from experimental you'll probably never find your friends on that map anyways. If anyone developping rust reads the reviews they should realize that most of us want old rust back and it was a huge mistake to drop it for whatever ""experimental"" is.It's good that they're still updating the game it's still alive but PLEASE drop experimental.Would not recommend anymore since the only version worth playing is dead",Rust

2017-06-04,0,0,1155,True,Recommended,well from my 790.8 hours forever a growing number of gameplay i now have trust issues (also known as rust issues in the IRL world) Starting off If you would like to wake up naked and look at other fellow nakeds then I would highly recommend this game. If you hate the sheer sight of massive the below lady area or boobies this game certainly isn't for you. Base building If you love mining metal ore and harvesting wood for hours on end to build yourself a base only for it to be destroyed within minutes of logging out because of one little flaw in the design then this game is for you! PvP If you enjoy killing humans and eating their cooked flesh and harvesting skulls then this game suits you. But you should probably see a psychiatrist if that is the case... Overall Overall i would highly recommend this game and i hope this review helped you with your choice to buy the game then good. I luck forward to harvesting your skulls and eating your flesh.,Rust

2017-01-31,0,0,63,True,Recommended,My name is Jsn1981 and I'm... Wait this isn't a meeting.. It's a review... Here we go So.. After some time spent on Rust I have developed an opinion. Not about Rust but about survival games in general.If it is a multiplayer survival game then the community is often salty and/or toxic. That's not as bad as most people seem to think. It adds rivalry and bitterness towards other players which games of this nature were designed to nurture.You have nothing to do but become the best. And everyone else is in your way.Rust is an excellent game with a terrible community. It's fantastic.Rust has excellent graphics with arguably even beter graphical glitches. Every time I kill a bear it's head spins around like it was the stunt double for Linda Blair in The Excorcist. My bandaids looks like agave plants.. Water sometimes does not render...even with the graphics all the way up. None of this bothers me at all.Rust has excellent gameplay. Wether you like to solo it or group up. Farm or kill other players. There is something there for you to excell at. Hell even if you like to just randomly surprise friends with a bout of gunfire for no reason you can excel at that.I would sell milk forever in order to make sure every pc gamer in the world has a chance to own this game.If you don't agree with this review I don't care.This is not satire. This is how I honestly feel about this game. Thank you.,Rust

2017-09-02,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,The game is a great idea but the main issue is that everyone tries to kill you. I got killed about 5 times by the same person with a gun while I was trying to defend myself with a rock. It's not a very easy game to get started in and every other person trying to kill you makes it a lot worse.,Rust
2017-09-02,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,This game looks good on Youtube videos but the reality is Rust has been Alpha since 2013 It takes about 10 minutes to connect to a server It is not optimised at all even a computer with 16gb ram cant handle it on normal settings,Rust
2017-09-02,0,0,102,True,Not Recommended,Don't bother buying this game unless you have a group of friends. You'll just end up frustrated with the amount of times you die to wild animals other players and starvation. The community is toxic. Players with better gear will kil you just for a laugh even if you're just passing by them. And when you respawn you start again with just a rock and a wooden torch. You lose everything else. So unless you're A) a hardcore gamer B) lucky or C) have friends who already play the game you will more than likely feel just like me. Frustrated at your deaths and frustrated that you parted with 15 for a game you can't even enjoy because other people won't let you enjoy it.,Rust
2017-09-02,0,0,1452,True,Recommended,This game has been in alpha for years but I really love how it gets updated every so often and changes gameplay on a regular basis. Would really enjoy if there was a major update like zombies or mutated animals to fight against to add some PVE aspect since there seems to be not too many people playing this game as there used to be. Still worth the money though if you are able to find a good group to play with.,Rust
2017-09-02,0,0,157,True,Recommended,Pretty good. Always getting better. Be nice to see some more game modes rather than just modded servers. Community is pretty good for the most part but finding a clan can be very tricky. Everyone suspects everyone of being a spy and lots of clans are not new player friendly at all most requiring over 1000+ hours of game play before applying. Spent many hours enjoying this game. If you like a good survival/base builder then this game is for you.,Rust
2017-09-02,0,0,648,True,Recommended,almost over 500 hours in this game and my view of it has changed many times but there is always something that makes me come back and play it over and over again great game a lot of salt is involved but thats just one of the great things about rust.

2018-01-13,0,0,371,True,Recommended,The concept and visuals are truly amazing. The gameplay while somewhat repetative is engaging as you attempt to assemble that next item or create a new addition to your home. The problem? The other players. The game seems to be populated by 12 year old monkeys who couldn't work together to climb a ladder and collect a banana without smearing their feces all over themselves each other the walls and the banana.If you want to experience all it has to offer without having to constantly deal with disruptive children I suggest you look beyond the official servers.,Rust
2018-01-13,0,0,941,True,Recommended,The game is incredibly well done for still being in an Early Access status. When I first started playing I realized right away that the info for this game is spot on. Everything wants you dead but it is truly an open world filled with people who will either make or break you. I met a dude with an AK thrusted in my face saying give me your wood of course I did lol. Another didn't propose the question he just shot me in the face with a crossbow. Another dropped me some weapons and resources and we banded up and made one hell of a base. Frankly now that I understand the game much betterm I preffer to solo even though it is TOUGH to make it on your own. The graphics look awesome the gameplay and fighting aren't bad either. The animal AI is beyond dumb but they have said they will fix it. MY only complaint being server uptime and this complaint isn't with the creators it's the that DDOS the server and shut it down for everyone. Trust me when your in knee deep with this game and some idiot jacks with server it is the most aggravating thing. I do reccomend this game even with not 1 but 2 servers I spent a ton of time in both shut down on me I'm headed to play on another. Point is the game dynamic focuses on the server due to acquired blueprints and wealth acquired but I still go back to square one because I love the game.,Rust

Do you want to know how to receive a free Domino's one topping pizza from Domino's Pizzeria and Restaurant?Well sit down let me tell you. Step 1 Telephone a Domino's Pizza Eatery and Restaurant and order a large one topping pizza and the guy will say ""What topping would you like?"" And you say ""I'd like my topping to be another steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza."" So the guy asks ""What topping would you like on your Domino's one topping pizza topping?"" And then you say ""Go ahead and make my second Domino's one topping pizza topping a Domino's one topping pizza."" And then the guy will ask ""Ok sir what topping would you like on your Domino's one topping pizza topping one topping pizza?"" And you respond with ""A Domino's one topping pizza."" And continue to order Domino's one topping pizza toppings until you are at a pizza topped with 71 Domino's one topping pizzas and then the pizza guy will say ""Wait one moment sir. We don't have any pizza boxes that will fit this 71 Domino's one topping pizza topping pizza."" So you say ""Hold on "" And quickly run to Home Depot and purchase a Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3 399 US dollars and when it comes time to pay for the Maytag refrigerator you offer to pay Home Depot not with cash but with 70 piping hot Domino's one topping pizzas and they of course accept so you buy the fridge and you take it back to the Domino's Pizzeria Restaurant you give the pizza guy a Maytag refrigerator box and put the 71 topped Domino's Pizza one topping pizza into that and then you pay Domino's using a brand new Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3 399 US dollars so then you take the Maytag refrigerator box filled with a 71 topped Domino's one topping pizza back to Home Depot and you give it to the cashier there as payment for your brand new Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3 399 US dollars and when the cashier turns his back to get your receipt you snatch the 71st Domino's one topping pizza off the top of your Domino's one topping pizza stack and you put it in your pocket and there you have yourself a completely free steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza!",Rust

( BUG ) You learn from your mistakes so you gather many food and resources make a base with 2 floors strenghten the walls with stone make a metal door put code lock to it. You are very tired but feel the pleasure of beeing safe so log off Next day get in to the server see that you were killed by other players your house's front is blown off but you notice something annoying they put a new door in front of your house that is secured with code lock all your stuff that you put hours gathering together are now theirs and there is nothing you can do about it while you stand there........naked.WITH FRIENDS Its fun to play it with friends10/10 would play it over and over again( sorry for the english ),Rust

2017-09-10,0,0,349,True,Recommended,Never wrote a review on steam... and to think this game brought me to that means a lot to me anyway.i don't have a great deal of hours into this game and yet here's my 2 cent this game offers you Everything and nothing.you can have it all own your game own the server.. or you can be the one being owned.i suppose dying in Rust is not something you should be ashamed of since every time i died every time someone stole 5 hours of work (and even a lot more than that) was paid back with game experience.Rust is a Thrill i didn't feel for a very very long time (since the days of WoW as much as they are on different catagories).the Graphics is amazing (to me anyway playing with Asus ROG Strix 1080 Ti 11GB makes this game looks like its the best Graphics Engine there is and i played a ton of Triple A Games through the course or my life).the game play is catchable. it takes a bit of practice and muscle memory to start clicking fast / quick when situation presents itself (as any game i guess)you might not agree but i can compare Rust's Early stages of the game to the same Principle of Starcraft you join a server you decide you wanna stick to this one and start surviving.you have to gather wood stone cloth and as fast as you can so you can establish your first house and this is just the beginning.creating a house doesn't just ends up with having a Foundation walls roof and a door.it requires a lock which without metal its a lock that requires a key a key that can be stolen upon dying and everything you gather in the past 2 hours (each and his own experience and therefor progress can be faster and can be slower alone or with groups of friends / allies)and basically the faster you acquire the materials you need to defend yourself along side with arming yourself with your first bow (to hunt animals ..or.. humans.. i guess) the faster you get to the point where you might be able to protect yourself from the Zerg coming to you (sooner or later they will come).just like Starcraft. the longer you delay your defenses the higher the possibility you'll get zergged without being able to defend.since i am not sure how well is my review (certainly not a professional but indeed a review that comes from the heart of a gamer who never knew how hungry he was for a Survival game such as Rust) i will end this review by saying this.i bought this game about 2 3 months ago (maybe even more).this game was lying in my Library all that time without playing this game for 1 single hour.this last Thursday i logged into Rust starting my adventure without realizing i am about to play this game from Thursday night till saturday (or should i say Sunday early morning) at 4 30 AM (2 hours and i gotta get up for work).i played almost 35 37 hours of Rust Basically with almost no downtime other than sleep shower eat. (wife and kids were on vacation).i am a father for 2 33 years old... and i feel like 16 again.if anyone actually have read this review all the way to the end and was able to get the sensation of how i felt during this crazy weekend (how much of a Nerd can i possibly be..) that you'll turn back the moment you see this because i am giving you a warm warning...THIS GAME IS FRIGGING ADDICTING AS .Thank you for reading.p.sfor a more professional review i suppose the Tube and the subreddits could supply with a better angle.See you in hel... uhh i mean in game!!!,Rust

2017-07-21,0,0,151,True,Recommended,First thing is first DO NOT expect this to be an easy game to play this is not for the casual or light hearted gamers... Do not try to play this game solo playing as a solo player will likely not work with the many 5 man clans raiding bases constantly and gets boring quickly... Having one friend is enough to enjoy the game however if you want a FULL experience of what this game has to offer you should form a group of 3 4 people. There are certain servers that limit group sizes but it still isn't as fun.I have successfully played as a solo player ONLY because of #1 I have absolutely no life and spent 10 hours collecting resources to make a base that would not be raided over night (this was on a server that had a 3x resource collection rate).. #2 I made my base on the edge of the map in snow where I was less likely to be found before my base was finished. And lastly #3 I was able to become friends with my neighbors who was a group of 3 players our bases were in view of eachother and we helped protect eachother.Overall this game is fun and I would recommend it to anyone you get your moneys worth and it is always VERY comforting to know that the Dev team that works on this game is extremely active giving you updates almost every week.,Rust

2015-05-09,0,0,1038,True,Recommended,Original rust was one of the best games I've ever played (the one with the zombies). Then they took the zombies out and replaced them with red animals?. Anyhow no one in their whole development team was smart enough to work on their own game so they decided to take the same concept and make a brand new game. At first it was horrible goofy but hey that's alpha right? So I just started playing a couple weeks ago and the new game looks freaking amazing. As far as graphics go you couldn't ask for anything better (except framerate).

2017-07-15,0,0,123,True,Recommended,Rust is honestly one of the best survival games out and much like other survival games out there it takes time to understand the basics of resource griding and crafting. Rust in my honest opinion is best played with a group of people if you're going solo try pick a smaller pop server until you get some experience. The basis of rust is 1. Resource Grind2. Crafting your base3. Survival 4. PVP / Raiding other basesYou're going to find out very quickly that in most servers shoot on sight is going to be standard don't expect to go into a server and expect your first encounter is going to be friendly it most likely won't be. People want your resources especially in the early grind.Servers will reset depending on the admin allowing everyone to restart new. This can vary between a week or a month. The game from my short time of play time has shown me the dev's are continiously developing the game which is good a few veteran's of rust have said over the last few months alot of updates have been happening and the player count is impressive.Beware though as like every other survival game out there hackers can be a problem.Also servers sometimes have a tendency to have memory leaks which can cause mass lag but other then that it runs well for the most of the time. Also regarding servers check when the restart of a server will happen there is nothing quite like spending a whole day upgrading a base and then finding out the server resets the next day. With a GTX 1080 I can have this game with most of the high settings although crop in can be a pain at times with my FPS dropping from 100 to 10 in a matter of seconds regarding loading.In anycase a sold game and worth the asking price. Hopefully the game will continue to develop and expand whilst fixing the issues.,Rust

I played for 700 minutes straight leaving with only few quick breaks to go to the toilet with the fear our base was gonna get raided.

It is a problem and until its addressed its very hard to get into with such spiteful players.EDIT 2 I've found a small friendly server filled with lovely people I will update the review after spending more time with the actual mechanics rather than respawning every few minsEDIT 3 If you can put up with the hostile players give it a shot but other than that it induces too much stress and disapointment in the players around me. Giving it a reccomend because its not the Dev's fault.,Rust

The community has already started shaping this game and suprisingly a high number of people are friendly to noobs so it's pretty easy to get started. This overall is a great experience as I said before for a game that is in it's Alpha stage and if they keep working at it it will become an instant favorite amongst gamers.,Rust

Crafting/building and the progression system are extremely well implemented. The learning curve is steep but oh so good. I haven't followed an early access title for a couple of years they usually never go anywhere but this one is basically constantly being updated. Since I've been playing for a few weeks here I've already seen a few features implemented (hair on characters nail gun) and I'm seriously excited for the roadmap on the Rust website.,Rust

2017-02-06,0,0,15,True,Recommended,To start out I have owned this game for a long time and seen it go through its phases of being created but I have only played it for close to 10 hours. Recently I started playing Rust and believe me I was so exited after the few new updates to make the game more solid that I played for 3+ hours straight one day. In that 3 hours I literally got nothing accomplished because everyone in the game kills on sight. I spawn in and within 30 seconds I die from people camping the spawn. Once you actually make a base it begins to be fun but oh wait you have a whole team of 5 guys camping you with guns and armor when you started and only have stone tools. It is such a good concept of a game but not having a singleplayer mode to play is very rage enducing when you try and play the game peacefully and get killed every time you see a player. Either way its still very fun to play the game if you do get far enough to built something or play with a friend and I do highly reccomend the game.,Rust

2017-09-20,0,0,706,True,Recommended,Rust is not for everyone.Its not a fair game. Its not a balanced game. It's mostly about thuggery and surviving a PVP environment. Most gamers if not experienced with PVP open world builders will have a hard time. Its just not a friendly game in anyway. But all of these things is why i love it. Its harsh dark and extremely changing solo.Yes. You can lose stuff in game and your totally open to being Griefed on bothered. Slandered. All your stuff can be taken and you're player base destroyed or under new ownership. Its a fact of life in this game.Most players are rude and just out to make your experience as horrible as they can. Its a very young and toxic group of players.But you can find a way to survive even solo and nothing more rewarding than revenge. You end up getting friends in compelling ways.There are issues with the game right now. The servers must be wiped every month because of a technical issues.Its a very demanding game on your system. Needing a high end computer to enjoy the experience.Its been in beta for like five years now and changed directions in what they want to do with game as many times.Yet there is something magical about this game in many ways.If you're a hard core pvper and love open world builders you must play this game.If your a care bear type and just want to build farm and have a relating experience. This game is not for you. try portal knights.,Rust

2017-09-20,0,0,664,True,Recommended,OK first things first Rust is amazing. I gladly give it two thumbs up and hours of my life. And I encourage you to check it out and decide for yourself.Now with that out of the way I want to expand a little. I heard about Rust in an article about all the salty lads crying about not being able to pick the race or gender of their character. I was intrigued by these game creators not caring about off their own players and even though First Person Shooter has never been a game genre I've been interested in I decided to give Rust a try.Mind you this was on a slow laptop averaging about 15 frames per second. Somehow I managed to get about 500 hours in on that potatoe. I love the sandbox feel of the ever changing maps. The dev team puts time and love into trying things out. Discarding and adapting sometimes for the better and other times not so much. But it's a wild ride that will constantly challenge your skills and faith in humanity in general.Thank you Rust. You taught me the true meaning of salty and I love you for it.PS I've recently upgraded my computer and now play Fanastic at 80 100 frames per second. OMG! #SoMuchPretty!!!,Rust

2017-07-27,0,0,1350,True,Recommended,If you are looking for a somewhat challenging game to play where you can free roam Rust is for you. Now keep in mind depending on which servers in rust you join they will be difficult. It's somewhat difficult starting out especially if it's vanilla. If you don't intend on putting in a couple hours and time into this game then don't bother. This game is still being worked on. If you don't like the enjoyment of looking for people or resources and then dying and loosing some of your stuff and you get butt hurt over PvP Rust likely isn't for you. When you buy Rust know that most people are use to the agressive population rust has and will most likely kill on sight. The game is kill or be killed. If you raid then expect to get raided. Like I said before you if get butt hurt easily the game likely isn't for you.,Rust

2017-02-19,0,0,26,True,Recommended,On the suggestion from a friend I chose to venture into the EU District Rust server. The game while beautifully aesthetc still has a long way to go many things being currently non interactive however keep in mind it's still in Alpha release. That being said what is there reminds me much of Minecraft with guns and technological items.You start out with only a rock and torch from there you must find/hunt for food and build with what you find/gather. The tricky part and for that matter unbalanced part of the game is even with regular wipes it's very much the game of who gets in first. When you're starting you have no firearms you have no traps mines etc *however* anyone who has started before you has had the ability to get that technology and more. There don't appear to be any safe zones so you're just as likely to be sniped on spawn as to have your newly built house repeatedly ransacked and destroyed making it nigh impossible to build up reinforcements etc a horrible situation for a new player to be faced with. However with most deaths comes a lesson whether it be don't go near bears or watch for the helicopter that will destroy both you and your house in one pass. Deaths are corpse runs or lose your gear.Ultimately gameplay and asthetics are one thing community is another. If EU District Rust is a good guide on community give it a miss unless you like being griefed or can find a haven safe from griefers. Without the griefers it has a lot of promise.I am hoping beyond hope that the early access community is no indication on what it will be like on release.Graphics 8/10Gameplay 8/10Community 3/10,Rust

After watching a few youtubers I decided to give the game a try and in three hours I wasn't really able to build or craft anything playing on official servers btw (tried west cost 1 2 &amp 3). With in 3 min of nearly every single spawn I was straight up murdered by another player no pretext to PVP no way of knowing what was going on or that there was anyone else there just dead over and over and over and over again. The few times I managed to live longer than 5 min. I owed largely to a ""helping hand"" from another player with resource gathering and defense that is until our inventories where full then they would murder you outside thier base for everything just farmed.Seriously this game is for psychopaths and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. Survival yeah no. Game for those who apprently enjoy murdering everything that moves and sometimes co op.",Rust
2014-04-04,0,0,448,True,Recommended,How much can you trust someone other than yourself? This game will show you ways to survive in the wild in the middle of the island inhabited by strangers. The game is replete with various kinds of components that will help you go from caveman to HomoSapiens armed with modern weapons. You will have to evolve by the collection processing and combination of the resources around you creating more complex and useful items. Among the useful and necessary for the survival of elements you can find wood stone metal sulphur blueprints of new items and much more. The most essential resource however is trust. Trust is fragile and shaky but also the most important part in this game. This item will allow you to more quickly and safely reach your goals. Security in terms of survival always makes a priority of the extraction of raw materials and choosing a place to build a shelter. But even if the original area in which you chose to settle was relatively safe things can change quickly with new neighbours. Do not forget that you are not alone. This is a land inhabited not only by peaceful gatherers trying to survive but there are those for whom the easiest way to survive at the expense of others killing and looting their own kind for their own benefit. Any of the inhabitants of the island seemingly innocent and initially friendly to you may be useful companion. Later you can be killed by your new friend for profit in the most unexpected moment. So you decide which path to choose the path of peaceful but thrifty settler or the path of the bloody Head hunter. Whether to trust someone and join together in groups or be a loner to build great towers to your power or your own little slice of shattered Edem.,Rust
2018-04-21,0,0,241,False,Recommended,Really fun game but comunity can be a bit toxic(Not everyone). If you are the type of person that likes risk and is fine with farming and ALOT of deaths then you'll like it. Perseonally I dont play it anymore because I don't like it when everytime I spawn I'm killed by a fully geared guy for and giggles but thats part of the game and the devs cant change that without comprimising the the game itself.Devs are VERY active(Regular updates listens to comunity and knows how to make a proper game) so thats a plus.Game is balanced but if you dont like farming or having to start from scratch everytime you die and don't have a base you should probibly go on a comunity server with kits multiplier etc...Then some people say that cheating is the biggest problem in the game and that it's game breaking the devs don't care etc. but the truth is it is really not that bad. Yes there are cheaters a whole bunch but there are not enough so it is accually a bad game or makes it impossable to play. And the devs do care and are trying to fix it as much as they can.Conclusion this is not my type of game BUT it is a VERY good game with a good team behind it.

2016-07-07,0,0,445,True,Recommended,Nice graphics nice game overall. Here's my full review.Needed to run this game I'd suggest a 750ti and atleast a 2.5Ghz processor.Depending Nice people depending on server. Really fast and easy to run game depending on hardware.Cons Most of the time unless you get on a server just before a wipe it will be packed to the brim full of people that will hunt any naked they can. Defence is really underpowered unless you have a really good location where no rockets can hit. C4 is hard to get but when someone has the blueprints and materials to make it... Prepare for all out server war. Base building takes AGES if you are solo playing. Making a wood base doesn't take much effort but oh my hell it's hard to solo making a stone base and it's near IMPOSSIBLE to make a pure metal base.Pros Under $20.00. I haven't team played but I can imagine that using some strategies team / clan playing is amazingly easy. SOOOOOO MANY SERVERSI'd give this game a 7/10.,Rust

As if the environment and PvE for noobs wasn't hard enough for noobs you then have the toxic cancer that is PvP in Rust. As Obi Wan Kenobi said when describing Official Rust servers 'You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy'. Honestly I recommend if you get this game find a low pop or empty community server this is the easiest way to learn the game and if you want to get straight into PvP because you're an absolute madman there are servers like CosaNostra and CombatTag where you can skip all the farming and go straight to running round naked with an AK hell might aswell call this game 'Congo Child Soldier Simulator'. The new in game tips should help you get the basic necessities and a base down if you dont get killed by a zerg with AKs two days into wipe Further understanding the game In game tips won't help you too much after your first couple days of playing when you are ready to start gathering components and heading into rad towns you have no idea what to do when you start taking 140 rads and get confused as to whether or not you are playing Fallout 4 now. There also isn't much help to be found online as most of it is just videos titled RAIDING SALTY CHINESE HACKER ZERG BASE ... sigh . The best way to learn is by talking to other players (it really helps to have a mic in this game but the in game chat should work fine too) which brings us onto the next part. Making friends Making friends is very important in Rust as on high pop servers you will almost exclusively see groups ranging from 3 20 people living under the same roof. I recommend making friends on low pop servers where everybody knows eachother somewhat this way you are more likely to be friendly with eachother and thus friendship is spawned yayyyy you later log on to find your new 'friend' has changed you base codes and killed you leaving you back at square one . Trust and Toxicity An old relic that is rarely seen nowadays in Rust is Trust back in the olden days of Rust you could often walk past another player both of you with guns in your holsters but instead of a bloodbath you would usually see today the encounter would usually end with a 'see you later' after a friendly 2 minute chat. Now though whew thats a whole different story my advice to you is if you see someone with a gun and you arent up for the fight stay well away. Toxicity in this game has reached a maximum especially on Official servers not even the nakeds are safe from the clutches of the 20 man AK roaming zergs. DON'T PLAY OFFICIAL SERVERS I cannot sweat this enough Official servers right now are in utter chaos these servers are unregulated and hackers run amok ESPs and Aimbots everywhere this is because the servers don't have thier own admins they instead rely on bans direct from FacePunch which can take days this is one of the largest underlying issues in Rust right now and until it fixed stay well away. Community servers are regulated by the admins that own the servers and you willl rarely see hackers. Finding the right server This is actually pretty simple you will find yourself moving to lots of different servers because no two servers are the same from the community to the wipe cycles you're best bet is to use a Rust server website such as RustServers.net which allows you to search for your perfect Rust server.Overall I think once you have a good understanding of the everything the game has to offer it can be one of the most rewarding pieces of gameplay playing a 4 week long round of farming building and PvPing in a real time environment is one of the most unique pieces of gameplay you can get until you get offline raided and have to restart. Like I said you'll learn from your mistakes.,Rust

Check out if you have anyone on your friend list who would be willing to join you into this new adventure filled with good funny and bad memories(the more the merrier meme basically) I'm not saying that you can't play alone but think about this.. your chances of survival are higher together than alone!2. Don't trust strangers blindlessly they could just be nice to you because they want to gain your trust and later offline raid you(the possibility is high)3. Want proper and sturdy base buildings? have no more fear! Youtube has tutorials from beginner to advanced video designs(worth checking out if you have the patience)4. If you are struggling with PvP find a server only meant for PvP and pratice the different weapons there until you get the hang of it! and yes it sucks in the beginning when you can't PvP properly it is stressing the fact that you are the first one to fall down every fight.. feels horrible However if you keep trying and never give up.. lets just say that ""there will be a light at the end of the tunnel"" Lastly thank you for taking some of your time to read this.",Rust

2017-12-08,0,0,528,True,Recommended,Hello fellow user! Here is my review on rust. Rust is a fun open world game with lots of servers to choose from with diffrent level of players. I would only reccomend this game to users with a good computer though it gets really fusterating when your GTX or AMD is too slow. I would reccomend a GTX 1060 or 1050.,Rust

2016-02-10,0,0,37,True,Recommended,"Just looking at the reviews people are clearly upset about what this game has become. I never played rust when it was 'good' so I cannot really compare my experiences to anything but the overall message I am getting from the community is ""Rust sucks now!"".When I first started playing rust not that long ago I was completely fixated on it. I had no idea what to expect when I started it up in all honesty I assumed it would be just another minecraft clone. This game actually made me more nervous or happy or scared than any other game I played. Some of the most tense moments of the game were when I was crouching behind a rock in the dark and the pouring rain naked and clutching a stone listening to the sounds of gunfire and screams. I can still experience this feeling whenever I play it. The fact that there are huge powerful clans who could kill you on sight makes the experience even more haunting and really ramps up the whole 'Post apocalyptic' feel that the game is aiming for. Even making friends ingame is like some sort of TV drama you never know if you will be the back stabber or the 'back stabbee' (Hopefully that makes some sort of grammatical sense).I can see where people might be coming from with the negative reviews and you could say that I don't have enough experience with the game to make a valid point Fair doo's either way. But I still kinda like the game regardless of it's flaws.In conclusion It gets a 8/10 from me go get it when it s on offer or something.",Rust

I had given it a negative review because no matter how many times I would install it it would crash.However that seemed to stop happening as I got it working again a few months ago and forgot about my negative review.Now that I got to play it again with some friends I understand why so many people enjoy the game.If you have not given rust a try yet I defintely recommend it.If you have friends to play with your experience will surely be better.I'm just glad I got it working again.

2017-04-29,0,0,683,True,Recommended,1. How easy is the game to understand? +They have a starter guide implemented.2. Achievements They are in progress with this.3. Graphics +Not bad and it is getting better and better so.... 4. Gameplay +They have make a lot of improvements and the gameplay is one of them! Forced wipes are now every month instead of every week so that's a big improvement and they are also adding a lot of new stuff and things every update so yeah!5. Singleplayer Got none maybe if you play in a empty server......6. Multiplayer +A lot of fun if you play with a team. If you play alone then it's not worth all the time.7. The story No story in here.8. Unique things +They are making new items every 1/2 months (On the moment) but i think the Workshop helps here a LOT. (Skins)9. Time +We are back with the Blueprint System good to back if you ask me but you still need scrap to learn stuff and the drop rates of scrap is not that big so they need to change that or they need to lower the cost for some items. Personally i like the idea but it need more balance.10. Bugs/Glitches +Most of the big Bugs and Glitches are fixed so the develop team did a great job out there! But there will always be some glitches in Rust as long they update.11. Early Acces/Alpha/Beta/Development Stuck in Development forever it is nice that they are creating some new stuff but some people (like me) wanna play a stable good version of the game and not a game that got changes and nerfs and forced wipes like every month.12. Mods No mods in this game but the skins are fun to create.13. Genre +It is a decent game in his genre the concept is good but the game can be better make a stable version and more people will like it i think....8/13 for me..... I still play it (Like and hour) because i hope that there will be a stable game someday. On the moment it's fun to try but i don't recommend it if you play solo. Maybe (I hope) it will change in the future. We will see ),Rust

Hackers zergs community server admin abuse etc can ruin your game but the servers wipe completely sooner or later anyway as each wipe cycle is usually about 2 weeks.So those negative things are hard for devs to fix without changing the nature of the game.Well that being said it's been fun playing Rust with friends and hopefully it will be in the future as well.,Rust

2017-12-09,0,0,77,True,Not Recommended,When this game gave me what I wanted for it I was definitely enjoying it. The building system lets you make some fun stuff when you have the resources in the right servers contact with other players can be fun. But frequent updates that wipe your buildings and inventories and tons of bugs that never get fixed (bears clipping through everything in order to kill you) make this game impossible to recommend investing time into.,Rust

2016-09-05,0,0,101,True,Recommended,PREFACE I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST BUYING THIS GAME WITH THE INTENTION OF PLAYING ALONE. PLAYING THIS GAME ALONE AND WITH FRIENDS ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES.That being said I have enjoyed my experience with the game and I think it was well worth the money I paid. While the game is in early access it's one of the better cases I've seen. Everything that needs to work does and the game is perfectly playable in its current state. You're going to have a few cheap deaths especially early on but nothing game breaking.As far as technical concerns go I have a decent setup (Nvidia GTX 980) and I can power through poorly optimized games. Maybe once a day my display driver crashes and I have to restart the game but that's it.This is a survival game and if you've played other multiplayer survival games before you probably have a good idea of how you need to go about things. 95% of your experience with this game will revolve around other players. If you jump into a populated official server alone you're going to have a bad time. If you get set up with a few friends on a decently populated community server like me you'll probably have a great time.A lot of the recent negative reviews come from the XP system from my understanding. I think the system helps encourage players to focus on themselves and setting up in the early game to make for better late game PVP. You can't craft your own guns for awhile but there are places to loot them if you're inclined.TL DR This doesn't feel like another early access hell project. You can play it you can enjoy it BUT DECIDE CAREFULLY IF YOU'RE GOING IN ALONE. Survival early game base raiding and defense late game.,Rust

2017-11-23,0,0,2687,True,Recommended,At the this point i can't recommend this game anymore. It's still in Alpha after 5 years of development the community may be the most toxicated ever Youtuber influencing the game to much (getting people banned trolling and toxic behavior got way worse cause of theire uploads disclosing every trick in basebuilding raiding and PVP) Hackers are still a big problem (maybe always will be) the devs really do good and hard work but it seems they still don't know what they want this game to become You are going to be frutrated most of the time since it takes hours grinding ressources just to loose everything in a couple minutes or cause you needed some sleep. There is a good reason why this game has been sold over 5 million times but only has a daily peek about 50k.So if you still interested in buying this game go ahead since basicly it is a lot of fun if you don't care about the bad things i just listed.Some adwise 1. If you do not have much time you should look up modded servers with 2x/5x/10x etc gathering to speed things up2. don't store to many loot/ressources since you will be raided and lose everything 3. get used to beeing killed even if it is not worth killing you4. if you are easily frustrated play on low pop servers5. make friends and team up even if it's hard...the guy who killed you constantly for 2 days may become your best mate6. don't stream and whine cause ppl know your baselayout or streamsnipe you thats the price you have to pay for beeing a wannabe celeb,Rust

2017-11-24,0,0,424,True,Recommended,Now people say the community is toxic af. I can agree but without that type of community the game would be boring. If everyone was friendly there would be no conflict.Rust is probably my favourite game atm. There are many different ways to build bases many different play styles and every wipe feels different. One wipe you might have a base in the desert deprived of cloth the next you may be in the snow having to wear snow jacets the whole time. It varies. You make friends eventually betray them and make enemies which will probably end up killing you more than you kill them.But probably the best thing about this game. The weekly updates. Every friday thursday for someother timezones I wake up and check the devblog to see what they've changed/added. Sometimes its very little. Sometimes its a lot. The constant changes to the game is what keeps people intrested. I have to go with a 10/10 would install again. (legit its very little space),Rust

2015-02-17,0,0,175,True,Recommended,This is only my 2nd review ive done on a game so cut me a little slack Ive spent 90 hours playing this game in about every aspect i can see.This review will be a review on general game play and a small overall rating chart at the end on a 0 to 10 scale.So to start we will begin with the building aspect of the game. This game has several different walls and upgrades that can be made to your player made and designed home/fort/base. It does keep a very 'Caveman' age feel to the game. When it comes to doors no doors are as strong as a wall this i understand it is basically like the developers want you to raid someones base threw the door rather than tearing all there work apart. I do feel doors made of metal should be slightly stronger but this is just my opinion. As far as windows and the bars you can place inside the window wall piece the window bars need to have the option to upgrade to metal. The reason for is noone wants to put windows on the first floor if window bars are only 300 strong and people can destroy them then jump in threw the window. Having the option to upgrade to metal and make the window bars stronger would be a big defense plus to the building structures. The stability aspect of building which basically determens how tall your building can be is Fantastic. If you add pillers before placing walls (support beams) then this will increase your overall stability and you will have the option to build a much taller building. Next we will talk about overall survival aspect of the game. At this time there isnt too much the few animals in the game are very hard to catch because they seems to 'teloport' when they walk so its hard to catch them let alone hit them with a bow&amp arrow. I understand this is a known problem but should be moved to a priority fix if it isnt. There are 2 different 'Aggressive' animals in the game you have the wolf and the bear. These violent creatures are hard to escape from and harder to fight. this goes back to the 'teloporting' mentioned above. As far as overall tools and craftable items there is a large selection of tools and items to create. locks code locks furnace fireplace crates chest guns ammo and etc are all crafted. blue prints are needed to unlock the ability to craft each item. This makes it a team aspect game in my opinion each person finding different blue prints to complete a task. As far as finding loot and looking for blue prints the only real options are smashing barrels and checking rad town crates for them but they are very rare and hard to come across. Loot can also be given out in airdrops which at this time is the only game event inside rust.When it comes to guns it seems the devs havent made it too much of a priority. There are only a few guns in the game a starter pistol a revolver a shotgun a pump shotgun a ak assault rifle a thompson and a bolt action. The main weapon of choice is the Ak47 assault rifle. Happens to be the best gun in the game. Biggest problem with the assualt rifle is it zooms more than the bolt action and you would think the bolt action would zoom more because it is the 'sniper rifle' of the game. hopefully they will soon add a make shift scope you can add to the bolt action or even add a sniper rifle with a scope so there will be something that compensates for the assault rifle.When it comes to what the main point of Rust is in my words. You gather supplies find blue prints craft items build a base save up some gear hit some air drops and rad towns THEN RAID AND KILL EVERYONE ELSE.The goal is to be the biggest baddest and most dagerous crew on the server. take over the Rust world you have chosen to be apart of build up and take out the other groups around. Steal there supplies by blowing there front door open with c4. Rush into combat with gun blazing action packed pvp and hope to survive and be the last man standing to take home the prize.Overal Game Ratings rated 0 to 10 (10 being best)Game Graphics 6 for todays age you would exspect alot more detail in a game like this Map 5 map is kinda plain and dull not much as far as landmarks to help you get around they did just add roads though Guns 6 Need more guns and deffinatly some adjustment to the assault rifle and the bolt action General Game Play 8 game runs smooth even in a high pop server such as 100 250 players Building aspect 8 Great building aspect just need more... keep up the great work Devs Survival aspect 6 the animals need greatly adjusted and tweaked aswell as more aggresive animals such as a wolf pack PvP 7 it is what it is for the game being the way it is now no different than most FPS Overall Game Rating 8 Possibly one of the best Build/Raid games out there at this time .,Rust

2018-02-20,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,To the Devs. The control of the game graphics music and voice setup is awesome for your game. the only problem i have is the fact of no grace period from dying to dying again from the trolls that call themselves players in your game or the ability to report spawn campers. mostly because that is not cheating but its ridiculous for those of us who are just trying to start out.,Rust
2015-02-26,0,0,545,True,Recommended,The old rust was good and I still like it the game was a bit ruined by removing the zombies cuz of the looks that the game already had it was about survival not being able to see in the dark with zombies on every corner was all the game about.It was interesting and all now the old rust is about building gathering and killing nakeds.Now for the new rust.I try to like it every time I turn on the game I try to force myself into playing it but I simply can't reason? You don't listen to the community that own potatos (I am talking about the /grass.on false command being added because the grass IS the main source where the lack of fps was coming from. You keep saying it's the trees no it isn't why doesn't my fps drop when I am in middle od desert with trees or in the forest where the grass is not there but instead my fps goes down in plain wide field where the grass is. Why don't you add a texture on the ground (like it is on legacy (green and yellow mushed grass should I say) so when you turn off the grass you won't be seeing black ground nor green (depends on the biome))Another changes that should be made as the community asks are Make map smaller because such a big map requires too many players for good enough action. (Or just convert the old map as you said you will instead of adding roads to this one and stuff near them. Make more blueprints available from the start similar to legacy (pistol+ammo bow+arrow etc.) Modify loot at rad towns more like Legacy + remove stupid stuff like Torches as a possibility to spawn like who cares about those Possibly cut crafting time in half And since there are now explosives make guns and melee weapons not being able to take down walls. (at least to a certain point for example if the wall is wooden or made out of stone it should be able to be taken down with the weapons named above if it is metal or something else that I don't know of then just explosives)To be honest about the new building system I am against it I'd rather use the old one from the old rust just remodel some textures cuz building is really really great on the old rust. Darker look (as it was when the game was in pre alpha alpha alpha lol) Add the zombies in the near futureI haven't played the new rust that much because of these reasons that I've talked about above... especially the grass one my fps drops from 30 35 to 10 15 or less.As I said I haven't played the new rust that much there could be more stuff wrong that I haven't said in my post.I love this game as it WAS the new one would be great if things would've stayed the same or changed but saddly rarely the community has a voice.Thank you for understanding potato out.,Rust

2016-09-12,0,0,2102,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Can't recommend this game anymore (for anyone that has a job). The current progression system is unplayable. I really tried to like it.Servers are overpopulated immediately after wipe then the first people that get set up ruin the experience for everyone else. If you can't get on within a few hours of wipe prepare to be hunted when you make your peasant scrap runs. A few hours after wipe the servers dwindle down to 10 20 people.If you have endless free time and don't mind your life revolving around rust's wipe system go ahead and give this game a try. Otherwise avoid like the plague.,Rust

2017-10-18,0,0,453,True,Recommended,I started my Rust experience in early 2016 and have been playing on and off since then. I have seen the game evolve from the Blueprint system to XP to Componets (favourite) and back to the Blueprint/Component system we have today. Rust has seen many changes through its development and overall despite the communities complaints they are for the better. Since day one I saw a lot of potential in the game my only concern was that it was on the Unity engine and I feared its limitations. But my fears have been laid to rest because of the developer dedication with weekly updates of fixes and quality new content every few weeks. About the game though if your looking for a survival game for solo or cooperative play in a competative setting I say look no further because this is the best out there imo of course.,Rust

2017-10-19,0,0,2963,True,Recommended,Having played Rust for a few years now I'm still very much enjoying the game. I have taken a break while an expansion dropped on another game but I think a lot of us do that from time to time.The Rust developers at Facepunch Studios are still in my opinion the best in the industry. I run the server Vanilla Fudge (which was also on break for a while) and the communication between server owners players and Facepunch is outstanding. Facepunch listens to feedback and makes adjustments as needed without compromising their core vision of the game. They have had weekly updates with said communication since day one I believe adding most of the time good (meat and potatoes) content while doing so.I have invested time into other EA games that simply did not or still have yet to deliver what the promoted hype was all about (uh hem dayz). I say time because the $20 I paid for the game was miniscule compared to the amount of entertainment I received in return. Heck you can't hardly buy a case of brewskies for that anymore and back in the day I'd have that drank in a weekend with a couple of buddies.Keep up the great work Facepunch and thanks for the great memories thus far!Veeblefetzer Rust serverVanilla Fudge,Rust

2017-10-19,0,0,375,True,Recommended,One of the best games i have ever played.Rust is such a unique game there truly is nothing like it. The PVP is amazing and it feels truly rewarding to gun someone down with a full inventory of loot. But it can feel absolutely devastating if you're the one dying in that situation. But thats honestly what makes it such a wonderful experience. It has quite a learning curve and you will get dominated for you first few 100 hours but it will all be worth it.The game has been going through a rough time lately but the devs especially Helk is working very hard on improving the game and they are without a doubt going in the right direction,Rust
2017-10-19,0,0,923,True,Recommended,This game is not perfect but it has many opportunities that can be exploited and I believe face punch will exploit the heck out of these future opportunities making it the best survival game possible. If your a salty fat kid that thinks he gets killed by a hacker every time he dies then this game is not for you otherwise go for it survive!,Rust
2017-10-19,0,0,620,True,Recommended,"Rust is a great game. I don't do reviews really so this may not be the best.I will start with the bad first.This game is still in its infancy trying to find itself. I am not sure what the ""endgame"" is going to be for the title but I can't wait to find out. Currently its an FPS overlay stuck in a sandbox building game. It's not a survival game its a Newman vs Newman deathmatch to entertain some evil observers.The player base is trash. In the old day's people used to joke and screw about while killing each other now they talk and spew hate while killing each other. They shitcan the review of the game while playing 90 hours in two weeks. Any change despite the game being in alpha is meet with a level of REEEEEEEE that even Reddit can not contain it. If you play on an official server you are going to have a time. They are dominated by ego zergs large groups of players who on the whole are terrible that succeed by banding together. Something that sounds perfectly reasonable that soon becomes tedious when you have to endure the rantings of a gaggle of pre pubescent manlings as they wipe every player off the server. The alternative is community servers which are better but have a half life measured in minutes. The server that you wait to get into one day will have a population of 10 in three days. I don't understand it but it is what it is.Lastly... Cheaters. It's a thing. Any popular competitive game is going to have them. Where there is a market for cheats someone will provide them and some will buy them and make the game suck for other people. Rust is no different. Community servers where admins put in stipulations like minimum steam account life and no vac bans help. There is none of that on official they are hacktastic. Now for the good stuff. It's fun legitimately. The game is visually pleasing I actually have just a screenshot of this game at night that I use for a background sometimes. The resource gathering/building system is solid. The POI's are all very well done and great places to get into fights in. The weapon mechanics are rewarding with good feedback and the level of detail with skins and options is top notch.Seriously play Rust. Its fun aesthetically pleasing stable as hell. I don't know where the game is going but even in its current state its solid and fun to play. Regardless of where it ends up I am on for the ride.",Rust

2017-10-19,0,0,1937,True,Recommended,I've been playing Rust for over a year and accumulated almost 2 000 hours ingame. How many other $20 games can you say that about? There has been a lot of negative reviews about the game recently due to a large update that changed how the fundamental systems of the game work so I figured I would leave my 2 cents and show that the large outcry of negative feedback is really only a vocal minority. (disclaimer this review only accounts for the most recent state of the game the developers are changing core aspects on a fairly frequent basis so I will try to keep my opinion broad instead of getting into specific things.) Let me break down my likes/dislikes of the game Likes Game mechanics are very crisp and clean. There are some issues and bugs with the game but compared to most other giant games with this sort of scope it is very minimal. When you shoot a rocket at a door or ceiling it does what you expect it to when you fire a round out of a weapon it (usually) does what you expect it to. There is very little desync or sluggish reactions from weapons.There is a fairly large skill gap. This point could be argued until the end of time about how much skill is or isn't required to be good at this game but I firmly believe that there is a decently large skill gap in the current form of Rust. What I mean is that when you come up against a person(s) who are significantly less experienced than you are you will defeat them most of the time. Yes luck does play into fights or raiding but you can almost always count on the better player coming out ahead in the end. Base building and PvP are the core aspects of the game and they both have very large skill ceilings which I personally really enjoy.The game feels like an organic experience. Rust is what you make of it a choose your own adventure in a giant sandbox. You can be a villian hero merchant farmer trap layer or passive bystander. Most games these days take great care to craft every second of gameplay to what they want you to experience. There's nothing wrong with that but it can sometimes feel like you're not having your own experience but someone elses. You can have the most interesting and intense interaction with other players or stay in and around your base and mind your own business the choice is up to you.The developers are trying to make this the best game possible. Facepunch is the most active development team i've ever seen. There are patches weekly that introduce new and interesting things to the game. There are larger patches sometimes but there has always been some sort of update every thursday. The developers try their best to listen to the critcisms and concerns by the player base and adjust the game to make them happy. They work on gameplay and how you progress through the game in ways that they believe will make the game more interesting and fun. This is one of the best games to play with friends. Whether you're starting out just learning how to build your first base and defend your home with bows and arrows or running around shooting every threat in your area with rifles it's a blast with a few close friends. Rust is also a game that you can play by yourself although you have to change your frame of mind a little bit and adjust to the different dynamic of being solo. Dislikes Large groups of players will always have a slight advantage. Due to how the game functions there will almost always be an advantage to playing with more and more and more people. This makes you feel like you have to play with other players and some people don't like that. There are downsides to groups that can be taken advantage of if you're a good player so don't feel like i'm saying it's hopeless for solo players and people with 3 or less in their group. What i'm saying is that if a group of 6 are to come up against a group of 3 and they have similar gear and similar experience in the game the group of 6 will win the majority of the time. Unless the developers introduce some sort of mechanic that affects large groups but not smaller ones this will always be the case. There is very little feeling of achievement in the long term. This is something that has kind of changed with the newest patch introducing blueprints back into the game. Now there is something that will tie you to a specific server in that if you want to swap servers you have to start over with no blueprints. These are short term solutions to me I still dont feel like putting a large amount of time into the game has that much of a reward over the long term. I am a fan of grinding in games and I appreciate having something at the end of it. With rust the only real reward of putting time into the game is saying that you are better at the game. At the end of the week or month or sometimes 3 days that severs stay active you have your base and guns to look at and then it's gone wiped away to a clean slate to restart from scratch. The blueprints give you some feeling of accomplishment so that you don't have to start over completely but it still feels like in the long term we're not really rewarded for our time and efforts. This isn't a big gripe or something that would stop me from playing it's something that i've accepted about this game. I play the game because I have fun and that's all that matters. This game doesn't feel like a survival game. As of late this game feels more like a PvP call of duty type game with a small base building aspect in it. People start a small base with a storage box to hold their things and immediately go out and try to kill everyone they can. Guns and ammo are very easy to get and based on the amount of time it takes to stockpile resources there's no reason to go outside without a pile of ammo and meds to sustain you for hours. There's nothing wrong with this play style one thing i've learned over my time playing Rust is realizing that there are several very different ways to play the game and none of them are wrong. What i'm saying is that I personally would like the game to be more of a survival challenge with aspects of PvP and risk versus reward sprinkled in here and there. Weapons should be fairly rare and ammo should feel scarce and like a privelage. You should have to make a concious choice about whether you want to shoot someone based on the possible return of what they have on them. Right now there's no reason not to shoot every single person you come across just because you can easily do it. Summary Rust is a great game. Thank you to the developers who have put so much time and effort into the game it really shows when you play it. I've had as much fun playing Rust as anything else i've played. I recommend this to anyone who likes FPS with resource gathering and base building. Rust is definitely a game that is easy to learn but difficult to master.,Rust

2016-05-06,0,0,9,True,Recommended,The game is lagging even in reccomended system requirements and in minimum graphics (Like WTF). Servers are full with every kind of that shoot you on sight or steal your stuff. Servers are also lagging and it's hard to connect for some reason. If there was singleplayer (There are thousands of forums and discussions that want singleplayer for Rust) I would reccomend this game. But with no singleplayer and servers filled with s I do not reccomend this game. Update (5 October 2017). The servers are better now I got a new pc which runs the game smooth with some stuttering idk why. But there is no singleplayer. So still a negative.UPDATE GOT A BETTER PC SERVERS HAVE IMPROVED OVER THE YEARS I RECCOMMEND THE GAME,Rust

2017-01-11,0,0,991,True,Recommended,I love this game... Disregard the other negative reviews and what they say about Rust...Rust is a great game which even after 700+ hours played in it I still thoroughly enjoy. Getting killed and losing all of your stuff is just part of the game. Getting angry is part of the game as well. Yes the community is toxic as but that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this game.If you get Rust you will enjoy your time depending on what genre you like. Survival shooter are my favourite genre's both of which are part of this game.Love you Garry,Rust
2017-10-20,0,0,1095,True,Recommended,Rust is the most brutal and unforgiving 'survival' game there is. This is not due to any PVE element altough this is subject to change in the future but rather because you have to survive on an island filled with bloodthirsty murderers aka your fellow survivors. The result is that its less of a traditional survival game and more of a heavily PVP orientated FPS game with resource gathering crafting and building.It answers the age old question of what would happen if you isolate a large group of naked people on an island with the ability to make weapons and build what they want with no rules? The answer to this is that they'll form small groups or clans and attempt to dominate the island from their heavily fortified bases killing looting and raiding anyone they come across to fill their own armories. And those with big balls do it solo.There is a ton of buggy broken and incomplete early access games out there that will probably never reach their full potential. Rust is NOT one of those. Never again will the world see such a dedicated and hands on early access development team as the Rust team at Facepunch Studios. You can expect a major update every second week like clock work and a smaller update every other week. They are always in touch with the community and they strive to make the game awesome for everyone even though it's nearly impossible to keep everyone happy all the time especially if you are dealing with a community of toxic savages that hates change. But if something does not work or contribute to the end vision of the game they try something else or add something new. So expect changes because this game is still being shaped and improved continuously.If one buys a mainstream big title game and get a couple of hundred hours of gametime out of it it feels like money well spent. But Rust is the type of game that you'll always come back to when you are tired of other games and rack up thousands of game hours. And it only costs a mere $20.This game requires a fair amount of dedication but if like me you dont have nearly enough time for that always you will still be a part of the Rust family and in touch with how the game is evolving with tons of very entertaining Youtube content daily that will always have you feel like a Rust player even if you havent played for a month or two. The minute you log in though you'll feel right back at home.Rust might not be everyone's cup of tea but in my opinion if you don't own this game your Steam Library is missing the best part.,Rust

After been skeptical about paying the initial $20 i have to say it is the most worthwhile steam purchase made. I have clocked over 2000 hours. Note It is a sandbox make it what you want. PVP build farm hell even role play if you are that way inclined. It is best played in a small group with comms (discord). Even when taking a break from the game i still monitored progress via reddit and devblogs. Rust comes with incredible updates from the devs. You will both love and hate it. As the game keeps changing so it is forever fresh. They provide weekly updates that are record on their twitter website and in game community update.The community is both great with Youtube videos that tell a story to the inverse of a screaming 12 year old that you wish would stop voicing his opinion on reddit. Points to beware Hackers. You will have all your gear taken at some point while your offline. The learning curve will be very hard but if you push through you will understand its popularity. Time. And lots of it. Solo sucks but is a nice challenge ever now and again. Never trust a rust player...........i warned you.Highly recommend playing,Rust

The continued monthly updates provide a consistent flow of changes and refreshments that pull me back into the game thursday after thursday to get the jump on my friends right after the wipe.

Just looking at YouTube makes one puke. Toxic kids everywhere.. And the youtuber personalities are all praising it with their ""raiding nazi"" videos and their ""rust slavery"" videos. They really want as much toxic content on their videos as possible. And that's what they get..

2017-10-21,0,0,1560,True,Recommended,I fully recommend this game to any patient survivalist or strategist. Rust is about spawning in with nothing and through hard work and stress getting up a base and defending it as long as you can whilst destroying other peoples bases. It can be a fun game if that type of environment is fun to you. Other than that this is ridicuously challenging game for any solo player especially if they lack FPS experience as the shooting and PvP are the #1 most encountered activity in the game outside of farming materials. The thing that constantly keeps me coming back to this game is the building mechanics. It is so complicated from a strategy level. You can always improve your bases hitting new levels of base security from game knowledge rather than just farming materials. You can have the biggest base in the game and if you lacked the knowledge to keep it secure I as a raider to your base can have great success in finding and taking your loot. Whereas If I know how to build very secure bases I can keep my loot safer. There are creative servers you can use to practice base building or 3rd party programs like Fortify. I do not recommend Fortify on its own though as it does represent the game of Rust at all despite the effort of the creators of it. The biggest downside to the game is how much time you have to pour into it to get anywhere how toxic the community is when it comes to kill or be killed how complex it can be from a building perspective and how long it takes to really graps all the mechanics of building in order to build top tier bases and lastly the ever constant major updates that sometimes take the game in a completely different direction when you are very comfortable with the previous settings. Even so this is still my favorite game and I foresee myself playing it for many more years.,Rust

2015-03-17,0,0,403,True,Not Recommended,Facepunch Studios and their ilk are really sabotaging the early access model. Buyer beware if you decide to buy this game I recommend considering hard whether the price they ask could be spent on something else. Only buy this game if you have the $20 to burn (or wait for a sale like I did. Lessens the blow.) The game as it currently is can and almost certainly will change dramatically before it is ever released. And that is IF it ever leaves early access. 1.6 million copies sold $40+ million in revenue and the game is arguably worse shape than it was a year ago.,Rust

Avoid Rust until then. 2/11/2017 updateRust has been fixed and a ton of cool new stuff has been implemented.

2016-09-07,0,0,85,True,Recommended,Recently got this game and I can say it's pretty fun! The one thing you gotta learn though is that your death will be inevitable.Gameplay wise I'd like to say that most elements in this game are already pretty balanced. Guns like the AK are powerful but have quite a bit of recoil so you'll have to pull down if you're planning on spraying. Base building is very easy but requires much more resources if you plan on upgrading it to withstand the raiders that may come and attempt to break in. Raiding is also very easy. C4 and rockets are mainly used to break into stronger bases with sheet metal/armoured walls. Another popular was to raid is to build a tower to climb over to the top of the base to raid it.You're only really able to experience the best of Rust if you have others to clan up with as other groups can easily wipe out lone wolves and raiding by yourself won't work out very well.,Rust

Besides the toxic community this game is the best survival game you will find out there. And i am sure of that.All those negative comments are just talking about how bad the community is. Well here is a word that may help you understand something.SURVIVALSo you can tell me that if a naked man is running across your shelter acting weird and you have a rifle locked and loaded your NOT gonna shoot him?Now i know a lot of people are probably saying ""You have played for not even 2 hours you know nothing about the game.""Thats true. But what i DO know is that this is a SURVIVAL game if you get killed you have to accept it. If you get murdered by a clan of 30 people you have to accept it. If some 8 year old squeeker blows your base up and leaves signs of everywhere after raiding it You have to accept it.From playing this game for only an HOUR SO FAR i can tell this will be one of my favorite games. don't let those raging kids writing negative reviews about the bad community change your thinking there is nothing wrong with this game.",Rust

2016-05-31,0,0,746,True,Not Recommended,Rust...It was my first survival game in my whole life.I really enjoyed the game on the alpha with really comic graphic and fps style.I had 700hours on this version and so much memories.However when they started to deploy new version and when they deleted the old one i was so dissapointed.The new version is completely . Cant shoot correctly as in a FPS.I just appreciate the graphic. But the gameplay is completely .Rust was just a game to buy during the first release.,Rust
2016-05-31,0,0,324,True,Recommended,Rust is an interesting Minecraft like game with relatively advanced graphics Game mechanics makes it feel realistic at least at first. Hunger thirst and health levels need to be monitored after respawn. Strunggling for staying alive is definitely enjoyable for those short periods of time. Large reserves of food and water possible to consume prevent this aspect drom being irritating later on. The next intriguing thing is that the character respawns with not even a part of colting which need to be crafted each time. After a few minutes of uninterrupted game player is able to buidl a simple shack and lay a sleeping bag there to have a constant point of respawn and hopefully a safe storage. This is where the real fun part begins in my opinion. Developing a dwelling requires a combination of material gathering blueprint hunting and securing obtained items. All three aspects are well balanced so the game remains interesting until hitting the technology / space / server lifespan limit.There are some aspects that could be corrected by now even though the game is currently in alpha version. The most troubling defects are items falling through the ground (like some weapons tools granades) shooting melee mechanics large client server traffic and missing terrain textures. Even considering these errors I find the game most interesting and I'll certainly be watching it develop.,Rust

It s your life play Rust however you want to play it.""... A+ Rust is fantastic. Read on for my reasons why... When I first heard of Rust I was playing some other survival/multiplayer games and really getting into the genre. After watching a few hours of Rust content on Youtube I bought the game and I am so freakin glad that I did. First of all It s diverse you do plenty of farming gathering loot engaging in PVP there's base building hiding loot stealing other people's loot base raiding intense battles It really does have it all. The interactions with other players ranges from visceral and violent to obscure and hilarious and plenty in between. For me Rust evokes the most wide range of emotions joy fear anxiety anger relief just to name a few. And to top it off there s scores of different servers you can play on from unmodded (vanilla Rust) to modded servers with zombies to mini game servers to strictly PVP battle servers. For you role players there s even medieval servers and a few PVE servers. The community in Rust is as diverse as the game itself. You ll hear things like Rust is toxic Rust has the worst community .. Honestly that s b.s. It s what YOU bring to the game. If you re salty and rageful you will attract salt and rage. If you re friendly and just playing Rust to have a good time you ll really enjoy the game. I ve made a lot of Rust friends this year and have built my own community within Rust. To be fair you should know that you will get killed. A LOT. Likely within the first 10 minutes of waking up on the beach someone will run up to you and either A) scream REEEEEEEEEE and kill you with a rock or B) befriend you gain your trust then betray you and kill you. LOL seriously tho it does happen. You will die. Don t give up. Some tips Watch some **recent** vids on youtube to help flatten the learning curve practice gathering resources and building/securing a base on a low population server then once you got that down take your knowledge to higher population servers and show em what you re made of. LOL. You'll eventually come across people who will unapologetically troll and grief but in the 1000+ hours i've played this game they're far outnumbered. Rust is currently early access. The positives are that you get weekly updates that keep the game feeling fresh and sometimes they are significant and game changing. The game is always improving/evolving. The devs at Facepunch play the game read the comments talk to the Rust community and take that to the table when they decide how to improve the game. This really is one of the best games on Steam. I love it. You should buy it. Buy it and be friendly. OR buy it and kill nakeds. It s your life play Rust however you want to play it.",Rust

2015-12-16,0,0,5989,True,Recommended,"I have been playing Rust for 2 weeks now and despite my first few hours of continuously being killed I absolutly love this game. First and foremost Rust is a PVP game but come on give a guy a break especially a noob. I decided that in order to ""learn"" how to play Rust I needed to find a server with little to no population. Next adjust my game settings to make it look good. Once done the game looked a whole lot better. Finding an empty server was easy as well. Now I was ready to learn the lay of the land craft some items and begin my Rust experience.I woke up naked on the beach and started exploring the area around me. I learned to harvest wood and stone to create some basic tools which made the bolder I started with obsolete. I absolutly love the hemp ""pot"" plants that grow all over. Too bad it's only usable as cloth. (Note to the devs maybe you can ad another use for it)The first thing I did was make some clothes as it was raining and I was cold. I made a bow &amp some arrows and got a few wild pigs for food and leather (and cloth) . I came across a dusty road that led be to an airfield. It was then I noticed there was someone else in the world besides me. Luckily he was friendly and agreed to show me the ropes.With his help I quicly learned the basics of building and crafting better items. By now I had the Rust bug.Fast forward a couple of weeks and I was starting to build a small compound of my own. Again on a relatively empty server. I discovered lots of blueprints built a large furnace and began mining and smelting metal and sulfer. I has a nice stash of goods I had collected over the past couple of days and was feeling pretty good. Then the unthinkable happened I was raided. My doors and walls blown up all my hard earned loot and supplies stolen. The perpetrator left a message on my sign HI was all it said. With that I rebuilt added locks and the next day robbed again they blew up the box. The last straw they blew my doors off and killed me in my sleep. I know it's a pvp world out there but killing someone while they are asleep?? That's just mean. Now it's time to plot my revenge as it told me whole killed me while I slept.I still enjoy playing it's a blast. And having an enemy beside that damn helicopter makes it more personal. I now know I need to rebuild in a more secluded area. I'll be waiting for you ...To the Devs if you are open to suggestions and/or ideas I have plenty. I'll save that for a diferent post. I like this game and I'll keep playing. I say get it it is fun especially if you like killing and crafting. Happy hunting!Mudbugger",Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,413,True,Recommended,One of my favourite games of all time.I have never really been able to fully understand why either...This game has made me rage quit countless times it has also been the most rewarding at other times. The sheer ruthlessness of this game hooks you as you struggle to make it on any given server and establish yourself.Big respect to the devs they have been making some huge strides recently to get this game out of early access and the changes have brought me out of my early Rust retirement. Love the changes and plans ahead.Praise to Helk Gary and the whole Facepunch team.10/10,Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,89,True,Recommended,Played a good few survival games in my day. While Rust isnt the most hardcore game to find food or water they make up for it with savage PvP. I've had this game in my steam library for ages but finally got around to trying it 5 days ago.Since then I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Constantly on reddit and planning/theorycrafting with my friends who are mostly new to the game aswell. My base got raided and I lost a ton of stuff. Luckily with the recent reintroduction of the blueprints system my friends and I were able to get back on our feet.This game is WELL worth the price. The developers are constantly updating it for both balancing and QoL improvements. Legitimately 10/10. Expect to die while getting your footings. This game is not easy. If you like a challenge you will like this game.,Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,211,True,Recommended,A game with a lot of potential. The problem atm is no longeivity (constant updates/wipes/no real feeling of reward/etc) Plenty of fun when played with other people. Solo can also be fun (I once survived in a bush for a week on a higher pop server...ty RNG Gods). Nice open world thing.. There should be NPCs. For example being able to hire a clerk to man your shop...or a gardener/lumberjack/hunter...who cares...I would have a ton a fun hunting down npcs also. Yes they should be able to shoot back (or at least use their shovel/axe/bow hah). I originally purchased it on sale while running steam on Linux (worked better than most SteamOS and ARCH). I really liked the idea of Valve having their own free OS. Office/whatever would just be another entry in your library! Anyway I ran Linux as my main for years Rust didn't let me down (nor did any of Valve's games). THANK YOU!,Rust
2017-10-13,0,0,584,True,Recommended,Luego de casi 500 hrs de juego de las cuales pasé más de la mitad jugando con amigos he visto varios altibajos en cuanto a la calidad de juego durante un tiempo solía ser un juego divertido para jugar tanto sólo como con amigos (ya que se hace más fácil) pero después empezaron a concentrarse en hacer el juego algo que jugando sólo se te hace muy difícil sobrevivir. Su sistema de crafteo no es muy amplio a mi parecer.En cuanto a rendimiento creo que nunca estuvo del todo mal optimizado si que con una gtx950 un i7 4790k y 8GB de RAM había que jugarlo en medios altos o medios para conseguir fps estables.Conclusión recomiendo comprar este juego si tenes amigos con quien jugar y un poco de tiempo para disponerle ya que si te haces una pequeña choza es probable que comiences de cero la próxima vez que entres,Rust

I leaves the game wide open for the thought that you have a shot once you've made it past the blind dumb and naked point. But when you wake up and the people you trusted have stolen everything because ""It was protecting your things"" you wonder why they did this. So you keep playing. You spend the next couple weeks playing it trying to find a place and it keeps happening as ""A Joke"" so you keep trying to play. This game is more of a Batman self destroying will power game vs. a game that you can have fun and build allies with. It's trying to be WoW with pvp all the time but comes down being pvp all the time where your have a stone and the sociopath teen next to you ruins the point of any mmo game. From hackers to teens an a scene being ruined by them. Pass this game. Not worth the $20 plus hackers children and lack of admin support (glitching in rocks)*I wrote that 2 years ago the devs have changed everything.

2015-11-27,0,0,101,True,Recommended,This is personally one of the better early access open world crafting games on here. This game is very much PVP oriented so be aware if you are not a fan of PVP this game is more fun with friends and played as a PVP style game. They are making a lot of additions that drive a more PVE experience but at this time I would say if you like open world crafting survival games with PVP this is a great game to play. The developers make regular weekly updates and this game has progressed a lot since it first launched in 2013. The original game had zombies and was a bit of the same as all others nothing really unique and a bit of a grind to play. Still fun. The current version of the game is very fun when played as a PVP with friends. The focues is currently around base building to resist being raided end game blueprints to be able to raid. Base raiding is done in two ways offline and online. The player/s base you are raiding they are either offline or online. Online raiding is the funnest but most difficult. Offline raiding is easy but really only rewards you with loot and resource. I find online to be more rewarding as it is a challenge. Base designing is really fun also. I look forward to the new PVE aspects such as NPC's they are adding dungeons they have discussed adding and the changes to the water exploration of the game. I play both this and ark. I feel this game is more fun and better optimized. I like ark but more as a PVE style of survival game. They both have thier pros and cons. I do enjoy both equally. TLDR Highly recommend if you like survival crafting open world PVP focused games.,Rust

2016-12-27,0,0,598,True,Recommended,Oh man. This game really has its ups and downs. The community is trash and you always get killed on sight. Very few people are actually friendly outright and most are constantly skeptical. But something about the constant bickering is endearing. This game has a lot of heart and has certainly come a long way since a year ago. The dev team for this game are easily the most dedicated Early Access devs I've ever seen. Bi weekly content updates listening to the community about bugs/greivances and solid game design. This is the holy trinity and they nail it. My only critique would be the lack of PvE elements trying to kill you. Sure the thudding of a bear can be terrifying if you aren't prepared to fight it but its not enough. Players need something to be scared of other than each other so that more focus can go to the environment. Lastly removing visibility during the night was an interesting move but it makes half the time spent in game almost useless without using a light source. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it would be nice if we could have night vision goggles as a super rare drop/craft. Might be asking for too much but it would certainly help.Anyway excellent game. 9/10. Definitely worth the money.,Rust

Fellow Players have been about all I have to complain about. I've survived weeks in RUST solo and that in itself is an accomplishment. You either enjoy RUST or you don't. I thoroughly DO.

The developers know about it and don't care. They actually came out and told players who were giving back negative feedback to stop playing the game if its that bad of a problem. ""You've had your $20 worth so stop playing"" Garry with your logic here anyone who has a problem with YOUR game should stop playing. How more asinine and stuck up can you be Garry? This just further proves all Rust is and always will be an Early Access bandwagon cash grab to you and your team. Want more proof? Rust's Community Market. They make it where some items you have to BUY IN THE MARKET in order to use. Garry keep up that mindset of yours and Rust will be dead in the next 3 years.

Easily use to spend a good 60 hours a week when I first started played I absolutely loved the game. Then came the XP system... and it ed us in the The devs talked about fairness... What fairness??? When you have these massive clans who come on as soon as wipe and are carrying aks while you're still stuck with a bow? Forget about it... It use to be good when you could just go to radtowns and just think about finding something good I loved it because it was based on luck now... its ing stupid.As you'll see I spent all these hours before the xp system... When the xp system came about I spent about a good 8 hours trying to maintain myself to it. I couldn't stand it. I hated it! Modded servers don't even work well with this... You'll be spending most of your week just gathering trying to level up literally this will become your full time / part time job. And for people that work when I use to play this in my clan we had older guys who worked real life jobs and could only spare a couple of hours now and then. Well sad to say they quit as did I. If you have a full time job infact regardless if you do or not if you're not willing to spend hours upon hours a day grinding and gathering to try and level then this game isn't for you. You'll just end up rage quitting.Don't get me wrong I use to love farming and building my base! That was before the xp system because I could go to radtowns and at some point find a broken AK which then I would repair and get blueprints to make it. Now you're out of luck.Thanks for nothing Devs.You did what most selfish companies do you became greedy and forgot about your community. Ask anyone most of the verterns hate this they hate it so much even for the ones who were legacy won't be coming back.

I don't recommend learning how to play on a high pop public server. You can go play those when you want to throw yourself into the meatgrinder. The game is updated literally every week. Always new stuff.,Rust

It has great graphics is well optimized has a lot for you to do and does not really have any bugs. Warning you should team up with friends or some other people if you plan on playing on a large PVP server.It's one of the good Early Access games not like 7 Days.I absoloutely recommend Rust one of my favourite games!,Rust

2013-12-11,0,0,756,True,Not Recommended,I have decided to update my review to reflect the most recent update At this time I can not reccomend the game in its current state. I will update this again if the items that are causing this are addressed and fixed.The main reason for me not reccomending the game is because of the newest update which brought blueprints back into the game. This is a system that has been attempted to be added before and was not successful and then removed. It should have stayed that way. The blueprint system at this time is completely and totally broken. In my opinion it is just forced progession. It just makes the game grindy and annoying to play. After playing the new update for 8 hours it just isn't fun.,Rust

2016-09-15,0,0,1947,True,Recommended,This game is my all time favorite game. I have loved the developement team and may even be sad when this game is finished. The thing I love about early access games is constant content is being added and changed creating a new fresh fun experience. If you enjoy survival games and like a challenge this is the game for you. For those of you saying this game is unplayable solo. Take it from a guy whos played over 300 hours solo been in a clan and been in a small group. This game is 100% playable but it is only playable for the solo player who lies low the first day and sets up his base. I solo played on rustafied and had a blast recently. The game all in all is most fun with a small group though. In then end if you get triggered easily and you cant handle the heat then this is not a game for you.,Rust

2016-08-20,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,This game is almost impossible to play if you don't have a group of friends playing with you. You can spend hours grinding to level up build a base collecting resources but that can all be taken away in an instant when someone who has no lifed their way to the top of the food chain raids you. The community is incredibly hostile with most people willing to kill other players on sight even if they pose no threat. Probably the least newbie friendly game I have ever played.

2018-01-19,0,0,540,True,Recommended,Easily one of the greater (if not the best) multiplayer survival game out there right now. The game is notoriously brutal expect to die. A LOT. There is a nice progression system in place to keep you focused on getting better equipment and weapons wildlife to hunt and players to either befriend or to take their stuff. The gameplay is really what you make it. As a warning a lot of players in the game are incredibly toxic (you will see racial slurs and swastikas in front of bases) but not everyone is like that. This game is definitely best played with your friends. The developers are very active through social media and post updates weekly. The game is slated to leave early access in February 2018. I can say this is easily the most enjoyment out of a game I've gotten for $20.,Rust

2017-01-15,0,0,43,True,Not Recommended,Graphics are glitchy as are mechanics and animals. Bears glitch through walls and kill you and if that wasn't enough experienced players camp new spawns with machine guns. This makes it borderline impossible for a solo player to start anywhere. 2/10 Would not reccomend. Unbelieveably hostile and elitist player base.,Rust

2015-12-08,0,0,332,True,Recommended,I have had this game for around a week now and i have barely came off it. Great game with lots to do. Building Crafting Looting PVP PVE. You name it its got it all. I have played other games like this DayZ H1Z1 and yet this game has grabed my attention the most. I first heard of this game when it was Rust 1.0v and i had heard that there was quite a few bugs and that it would get boring quickly. But now Rust 2.0v modern aesthically pleasing and frequently updated. This game has been great for me and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves openworld survival games!!Also lots of servers so its easy to find one that you like and will play on!!,Rust

2016-08-29,0,0,585,True,Recommended,Used To love the game 1 year back played it for days people were frendly not eaven joking you see a guy you compliment eachother and rocks next thing you know your gathering wood together and 30 minuts afret it your making a base on a rock its night your crauching around the fire and talking how your ex was a or some 5 minuts later a wild naked apears he says your is nice and you invite him in your base you talk over the night and continue your adventure in the morning.In this latest versions of rust you will spawn on a beach after haring a gang bang of five 12 yo hiting eachother w rocks and talking about their mums u decide to run in other direction you are hiting barels and gathering wood your rady to build your base ... sudenly a group of 4 guys rols down the hill whit semi pistols crosbows hoodies and armour they kill you one loots you whils others sing around you in a circle whild you ask them to get you up caus you have been gathering for 1 houer they left you bleedin on the floor and run back home whils scriming LALALALALAA like tribe members your on the beach once again around 20 dead bodies on your left and right honestly if you have friends and get on the server around 1 2 houers after of its full wipe you will have a nice time feeling the adrenaline on pvp your heart pumping and the fear of losing your stuff is actuly whils stressing pretty amazing any other scenario is you coming and having a huge lvl disadvantage this is the most anoying thing ever not that you lose a lot of stuff its that just because some no life spends 15+ he literaly makes it imposible for you to have fun and eaven get started by adding the nex exp system they culd and shuld add a punisment for randoming and kos ing a like along the lines of if you kill someone newer than 5 min whit less than 2 deaths on the sever whithout him atacking you first your lever shuld deplite to 0%(still the same lvl just lose the progress to the next ono) or you shuld lose some green xp honestly if you dont have more than 6 h daily to play and 2 frieends to play it whit i defnetivly wuld not recomend but if you do and because the devs are wery good to us the fans you shuld give it a try myby some kos punisments will be made anywayws like i said i had a lot of fun and i belive the devs will work on the currend problems so i recomend the game.,Rust

It's very strategic and a lot more complicated than H1Z1Overall I do enjoy building bases and raiding others.It's a lot more realistic when it comes to survival and the guns/recoil.The texture and the sounds of this game is 10/10.I dislike the fact that there are still some bugs in this game that are huge when it comes to gameplay.For 20$ ehh...

2016-07-04,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,This is an amazing game. I love almost everything about the game. I can only think of one thing that is needed and that is character customization. This probably makes you wonder why I dont recommend it right? Well thats because of the community. The game is amazing but what ruins it is the majority of the players. People will kill you when you dont even have anything worth taking or do not pose any threat. You will spawn in and soon as you wake someone waste their bullets just to kill you and gain literally nothing but a rock and a torch. The people make this game annoying and a pain to play. You will spend hours building up a base just for someone to walk by blow it up take nothing from it kill you then destroy your spawn and leave. This game has no rules to counter that and it really sucks. I didnt listen to the people warning me about this games community and I was so wrong not to. Please DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THINGS ARE FIXED WITH THE COMMUNITY.,Rust
2016-06-09,0,0,615,True,Recommended,Good game when you find people up for it. The community is the worst I've ever seen. You should definitely buy it it is worth it. I have 320+ hours and there is still something new to do each time I log in.,Rust

2018-04-09,0,0,1674,False,Not Recommended,Used to be good. Really good but now its complete BP was the best XP system more or less components was still playable but when they mixed BP's with it that's when everything went from going down a hill to down a cliff.There was always a grind in rust but in the end of the day once you grinded your base your XP your BPS or components but now it's a never ending grind upkeep cost (if you are solo and you want to have a decent base with honeycombing prepare for a huge upkeep cost) scrap components and if you are lucky you won't get zerged down in the monuments and get your rather quick but not to worry as this is only temporary you will probably get raided in the next few days and to think your bp's will stay only for a few months before you gotta start grinding for them again. But this time the whole server will be trying to get them.Player communication has completely disappeared the rust community is more toxic then ever it was always but now everyone just wants components and for you to build far away so you do not take any potential resource from them.i made allot of great friends and memories from old rust but now you can't do im 100% confident that on some servers people build sniper towers next to beach just so they could kill fresh spawns fast and they won't have to go out to check if they have loot since they just spawned.If you have no life and sit at home all day and got absolutely nothing else to do and if you got a group of at least 4 5 people who are also playing rust 20/7 then you might as well as by the game you might enjoy it but if you are looking for a game to just chill meet new people and have a laugh and only to spend a few hours now and then (until it will gradually consume you and rust becomes your life) If you have no life and sit at home all day and got absolutly nothing else to do and if you got a group of atleast 4 5 people who are also playing rust 20/7 then you might as well as by the game you might enjoy enjoy it but if you are looking for a game to just chill meet new people and have a laugh and only to spend a few hours every now and then (until it will gradually consume you and rust becomes your life),Rust

2017-08-12,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,"An unfinished game that will more than likely stay unfinished because it has to dominate the ""testers"" market like ark and every other crafting game.

No game has ever quite made me feel like I've been wasting my time as much as this one. More than likely I will get the usual replier ""This game just isn't for you it's too hardcore"" from I've gathered about the devs yes the game is too hardcore for me to keep track of the outrageous updates they have buffing and nerfing applying seemingly nonsensical mechanics to the game.

I say near perfect because of the cheaters and tons of glitches like bagging yourself into a rock etc. Legacys map was amazing and I still remember running down the road to splittown (or smallrad).

However established players tend to camp out at spawn points and just kill all new players as they respawn which prevents you from being able to get anywhere with the game. They seem to think that killing unarmed people makes them tough or something? I don't know I think a psychologist would have a field day with the type of people this game attracts.The game itself seems fairly well done but the community makes it unplayable.

2017-11-22,0,0,1435,True,Recommended,I heard about rust more than a year ago and my curiosity was piqued. I read reviews that were very mixed after the twigs update. I've now logged more than a hundred hours after buying the game a month ago and I have to say I love it. I do play with my two brothers and we generally grind together for at least 15 30 hours a week working towards the same goals and guarding each other. This game is very difficult to play solo and you can expect to get killed for no reason a whole . You're always playing against whoever is on the server at the time so sometimes the things you need to progress just aren't available and that can be very frustrating. The only options are to find a less populated server (most likely a community server not an official server) or play with a group. Hit up discord or by a few copies for some friends. I freaking love this game and it has a ton of potential.,Rust

2016-08-09,0,0,391,True,Recommended,This is a game that I used to play a ton of. This is basically a game of factions wars and alliances. In the beginning you are given a rock and a torch (On Most Servers) and have to start by hitting trees and other rocks with your rock. You start to build up gear and a base. When all of this is happening you are also trying to avoid other people or make alliances with them. Once you have a stable econemy going in your area whether it's with your friends by yourself or other people you just met you can start raiding. You raid other peoples bases to either scare them out of your area or for the loot. Raiding can be expensive. Overall this game is pretty fun and enjoyable to play. But after a while it got really repetitive. I would still recommend it.,Rust

2016-08-09,0,0,14,True,Recommended,"Ok so I'm a newish player so this is from my perspective. First off the game runs well and looks good. With a 1070 / 6600k I can run the game on ultra settings at around 100fps + as long as I'm not using dx 12 version which is experimental anyways. The gameplay feels very polished and all the inventory management is very well done. It's also nice that custom servers are allowed to speed up game progress as many people don't like the slow pace of the default game. Sound design is also good nothing flashy about it as I guess it should be. It's also easy to play with friends and so far easy to learn. The only gripe I have is the XP system. It restricts the ability to build certain things until you get ""experience"" by doing stuff like crafting. I kind of like it because of the sense of achievement and the fact that it eases new players into things but I can see how experienced players would have gripes with it. Overall the game feels good and satisfying to play and if you are looking for a multiplayer survival game to mess around in with friends it should do the job.",Rust

One thing to note is that with this game your experince will be drastically different deopending on if you have friends who play or even depending on what your friends are like. There is no set goal you make it as you go. Playing by yourself can be painful at times yet also really rewarding. Playing with a friend or in a group really shows how team work and communication can be vital to ""success"". You can have quirky encounters with people and there are really funny moments. There is a dark side too though this game generally rewards you for playing as a ""bad guy"". (Not always as you may be rewarded by helping others yet it depends on their personal choices.)The adrenaline I have felt playing this game cannot be matched by anything else in the digital world anyways.

2016-12-16,0,0,324,True,Recommended,It is unfortunate how many players whom appear veterans on its servers are bashing this game. A lot of people whine on the comunity and in a way i can see that but in another way i find it ridiculous. When i started playing rust I landen on a random server evaluated the comunity there and if i didn't like it i moved on to a new server. There is always going to be 12 year old who are bullied in gradschool taking it out on strangers on the internet by virtually murdering them in their sleep or killing them when they are naked this is how people work when it comes to survival games.For me i eventually found a good server there was offline raiders as on the other servers but there where also people who did not not raid but lived peacefully people who helped noobs and people who took upon them self to target and fight the raiders. For me this was a great experience and i would reccomend it to anyone who can take the fact that everyone gets raided at some point. TL DR The greatest survival game around constantly becoming even better but make sure you get with a good server that fits your way of playing.,Rust

2016-12-16,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,Buried within Rust is a good concept and an average game. Don't get me wrong the game play is well done with a solid foundation but it always leaves you wanting more and doesn't really 'deliver' on that.Additionally starting out in Rust is a nightmare. The Rust community has a few helpful groups to aid you in this and even some helpful servers for it but for the most part you're going to encounter trolling. Since Rust as a concept depends on its over all community and the feelings that it gives off this is a big knock against the project.So first and foremost Rust is not meant to be played alone. I had some good times with some friends but over all my experience was negative even when playing with a group. The most interesting experience I had in the entire game was when two players attacked me and mine and we were all at a fairly similar equipment level I lost that battle but had a blast over all since it was at least an actual fight. That was fun as well as engaging and I can honestly say it was the high point of my entire rust experience save for when I found a private server that was willing to help my group learn how to play. Unfortunently by then the game had soured.You see the rest of the game save for that one battle and the private server always had me running around desperate for equipment and getting shot at by higher geared players with nothing better to do. Resources were impossible to get meeting up with friends was a pain in the and over all this drug what would have otherwise been an exciting style of game down quickly. Even when I found my stride in Rust and thought I was making good progress the game blindsided me. Me and my limited number of weapons could do nothing against a helicopter. So with me seeing no real room for advancement I recognized that my fun with Rust was clearly at an end. There's only so much you can do in a community oriented game that has a very negative over all sentiment and with a difficulty level that fits the 'brick wall' description aptly. The fun ultimately could not survive that.That's the key point. If you think you will enjoy the head bashing style of game then maybe this is for you. It doesn't have the depth of Dark Souls and doesn't have the equity of DayZ and doesn't have a positive community over all.For me it's not to be but if you can over come those issues as I said you will find an average game. The developer recently asked players if he felt they got their 20 dollars worth of entertainment. I did not and would not recommend buying the game at full price.Keep in mine the game is still in development as of the time of this review and communities can evolve. Perhaps one day Rust will come through and become the game I wish it could be.,Rust
2016-12-16,0,0,136,True,Recommended,"SummaryOverall this IS a good game. The devs are constantly working on the title. Controls Sound Visuals are all good. It is a world I want to be in. Love the building hunting side of the game. The procedural maps are now a nice touch too so can visit a server with a unique map to explore. It s a game that s best played with friends. Having said that there is always aspects that could be improved upon to address a few key complaints from people. Which would also add a new dimension to the game. I really want to see this game reach its full potential. Suggested ImprovementsAI FactionThe game itself is 90% PvP. There are a few animals to kill etc and some exploring to do but there is little PvE content such as an AI faction to fight against. This is something I feel would be a big plus for those players that prefer the PvE side of games and want to co op to beat an ""Island Boss"" in his gang s fortress. This would probably be the greatest programmatical challenge but would be a big plus for PvE ers.Gangs/ClansNow of course some people have pure PvE servers where PvP has been disabled. Which is good for some that ONLY want the PvE side of things. What's needed is a game mechanic such as ""Gangs"" (Guilds Clans Corps whatever you wish to call it) So people in the same gang can't hurt each other. That would build in some safety into the game for those that enjoy working in part of a team to achieve goals in construction farming mining etc. This could be a server option. This would help address some of the ""toxic"" community issues and bring some PvPvE feel a bit more. Spawn protectionThis could be another server option. Make a new spawning player invulnerability for say x number of seconds after every spawn. At least giving them time to NOT be spawn murdered. There would be mechanics that would stop this being abused so for example while spawn invulnerable you cannot go near non gang buildings.PvE player modeThis again can be a server setting. If enabled a player can choose to be in ""PvE Mode"" only. Meaning they cannot be harmed by other players or indeed harm others. Of course this must also come with mechanisms that stop this being abused. Such as again these players cannot damage or go anywhere near other player s structures. This would suit people that just want to be part of a local community doing things such as hunting mining construction etc. for their gang but get no enjoyment from the PvP side of things.These players would have a marker above their heads to show this status so other PvPers dont waste time trying to kill them. This setting would need a protection timer so you can t just switch it on and of every 5 seconds. And perhaps only apply the setting at login.",Rust
2017-12-22,0,0,1777,True,Recommended,Rust...Lemme tell you a thing or two this game is awesome. As much as it makes me want to rip off all of my limbs in rage I love it. It's my favorite game i never do reviews or participate in this kind of stuff but this game makes me want to. As much as i love it I just really hope that they optimize it more often. As i can barely run it and end up freezing in the middle of gun fights and unfreezing to a guy standing over me wounded calling me bad. Every update its just adding more and more stuff which slowly shaves off some of the very little fps i get anyway. Overall 9.5/10 love this hardcore crap where u lose everything or take everything it generates SO much salt and thats my favorite part about it. Rust will always be the best hardcore survival title out there and there's no arguing that.,Rust

2014-06-13,0,0,84,True,Recommended,"Me and two of my friends went into no mans land to look for a safe place to build a base. We met three naked men. One of them put out a campfire and we had a nice little chat. Another naked man came to us and begged us not to kill him. One of us started playing ""everybody dance now"" and a party commenced. I ate a raw chicken and puked on an italian dude.10/10 would puke againEdit I have after two days of intense playing come to the realisation that this game is filled to the brim with s and s. Some very few people don't kill you at sight they might even give you basic stuff. But the other 90 percents will uncalm your so badly. This game is the first one ever to have me properly rage quit and call it a day. As an example We moved our base to this nice neighbourhood with a lot of loot rescources and rad animals. Everything was great. Then two people showed up and started killing us for no apparent reason. We tried to take revenge resulting in them stealing all our weapons too. The only reason they could was because of them having less ping than us as we had the better equipment. I wish it was possible to put this game in the greysone because some times it's the greatest ever while other times it's ing t all the way.

2016-12-18,0,0,261,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch Studios. Inspired by games like DayZ Minecraft and Stalker Rust aims to create a hostile environment in which emergent gameplay can flourish. The aim of the game is to survive. To do this the player should gather resources. Hitting a tree with a rock will give you wood hitting a rock with a rock will give you rock and ore. You can then craft a hatchet from the wood and rock allowing you to gather faster. You can go out and hunt a variety of wildlife such as boars chickens rabbits bears wolves and deer. Once you have killed an animal you can butcher it to gather its meat and skin. You can craft a fire using wood and cook the meat inside the fire. Then you can eat. You face two major dangers in game. Rust is a multiplayer game so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust s world is harsh so you might need to make friends to survive. The environment is not kind. Bears and wolves will chase and kill you. Falling from a height will kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starving will kill you. Being cold will kill you.,Rust

There are so much things to do Like rading bases building house's creating teams parties and making friends. I have created my own server so that makes rust 1000 times doubled funnier and nicer. When i started to play it I didn't knew much about it but a few hours and I've got really addicted. I recommend this game for everyone even if you're pessimist or just don't look at games so much surprised. When i first saw rust I've just thought that it's like a minecraft copy but now I understand that is really much better and you can do so much in it. I give 10/10 to this game because it completes all requirements for my ideal game ) I'm really recommending this game for you guys but be careful it's very adictive D Also what i want to say there are so much friendly and unfriendly people so be careful and don't try to be friendly with everyone because they will use you and then leave you without loot or anything.

The community is ing toxic as you can be fully geared and be killed instantly by a noob with a stupid rock because ""balance"". the servers will only start to lag when I come accross another player and this usually results in me ing dying. Raiding is garbage as a noob can build a unraidable base in 15 minuets. Official servers are litteral every server is usually controlled by this one giant zerg clan that always has at least 8 people on equipped with m249's and enough explosive ammo to level your base 35 times over. People will quite literally camp their 300 foot tall base with a bolty all day long until you get offline and they raid you.Black guys can have small in this game.Its a meh",Rust

I'll just pop 7 xan's and kill 30 people around the drop. Thing is tho this game is very realistic and I like how the trees fall through the floor when getting chopped. I also like how when I get killed by a clan of 6 on a trio server the admin doesnt care. Overall though you will like this game especially when 10 year olds are chasing you with a rock and screaming. This game has amazing combat overall I would compare this game to cs go because it has the same kids in it. Finally this game is amazing would reccomend to anyone. Have fun lads!,Rust

2014-01-10,0,0,7,True,Recommended,This is one of the Greatest games I have ever purchased and i was only $20! This game rewards hard work with satisfaction I started my second day of play with nothing more than a stone hatchet and a bow. Two hours later with the help of some friends I became our camp guard and I found myself armed to the teeth on the rocks and cliffs around our camp. Nothing is as exciting as taking out other players that venture to close to our camp when you approach you know that at any second the player could pull a gun and kill you it's this suspense that s makes the game so exciting. After some play time and plenty of kills later I can say that I would definitely recommend this game!,Rust
2016-07-17,0,0,105,True,Recommended,I got a guitar from an airdrop. I followed my friend around for half an hour butt naked playing those mistuned notes. We met 3 players who usually kill everyone on sight. We announced ourself in the chat so we were spared. After couple minutes of fun I was shot in the head. When I started to complain my friend confessed that he killed me 'cause I was making him go mad. In revenge the three guys shot him in the head. But they were nice enough to put all our stuff in a chest and explain its location. Except one thing. My guitar. They said that the confiscate it for the greater good of mankind. My friend couldn't agrre more with them. So I don't have a guitar now but the peace came back.10/10 would be a wandering musician again,Rust

2015-04-13,0,0,11,True,Not Recommended,The concept is great Survival in a post apocalyptic landscape with limited resources. Starting off naked with just a rock and a torch and working your way up from there. The graphics are nice and the gameplay feels challenging and exciting. The possibility of death is always near be it in the form of other players and wild animals. So far so good.Sadly many factors make this game an unenjoyable experience for me overall The game has severe framedrops which makes it near impossible to hunt animals and makes even the most mundane tasks frustrating. Advanced players with rifles continuously kill naked starters that only have a rock. Resources are incredibly scarce to the point of frustration. I played for two in game days without coming across a single stone deposit. Stones are needed to craft even the most basic tools. The whole map is completely filled with player built structures. Within hours of a server wipe it becomes virtually impossible to find a place to build a house and call your own even when walking several hours from your spawn point in a procedurally generated map. Russian hackers are everywhere.Should these issues be addressed I would love to recommend this game. In the current state however I simply cannot.,Rust

2016-04-17,0,0,31,True,Recommended,"I watched a play throuh on YouTube and wanted to try it for myself. It seemed to me like a game i could pop on a server with a bunch of friends and just have a good couple hours of fun.With in two mins i was shot 3 times and hunted down into the ocean where I proceeded to drown. I switched servers to one labeled 'friendly' and sure enough there were some helpful people that were kind enough to show me the ropes of the game and how to get around its overall glitchiness. The instant I headed off into a wooded area of the map i saw a few horses and a deer. I tried to attack it with my spear but it teleported to the top of a few boulders ran in a few circles teleported down and convolsed its way across the field. Even though it was a funny moment for a game thats been in developement for well over 2 years I expected that they would have worked these things out. After maybe a good 10 mins of just wondering around some kid (im guessing like 10) attacks me even after I yelled ""Im friendly! Im friendly!"" after maybe a dozen times. After I talked to a few people in game and they discovered that I was infact female I was harrassed multiple times by nearby players (again 10 year old boys) and who then made multiple threats towards me and a partner that I was tagging along with. I ended up dying a few more times before I ended up rage quitting. I personally would only recommend this game if you have a gang of maybe 10 people who you trust dearly. The majority of the community are 10 13 year old boys who think that being massive wads is acceptable. Along with the disgustingly vulgar underage community the game is lacking major updates and ways to promote a friendly gaming environment. Update 7/28/16 I popped on to another server recently and was surprised on the new updates that were added to the game. I enjoy the whole concept of leveling up to learn new recipes instead of having to run around looking fro blueprints while trying to avoid getting shot at. I recently met a band of players that helped me out and we teamed up to work on building a base. We took over someones empty raided base and now we are at war with the previous owners. ATM im shut up in an old base while the other members are offline and being camped by others. Its a fun game if you find the right people and they are a dimond in the rough.",Rust
2017-02-05,0,0,401,True,Recommended,Where do I start...I haven't played long but this is a great game in my opinion. Although it consists of grinding and going through rival after rival of bad people that's what makes rust...well rust! Just like undertake for example It's pixelated graphics and rpg style makes it it's own unique game. Generally what I think is that the people who don't like this game are just the people who have to deal with the Bambi hunters every time they spawn. (At least that's what I call them). You know the geared people who kill fresh spawns for no reason. And yeah that's an annoying thing to deal with but you can't blame the game for that. Hate the player not the game.,Rust

After I played for about a week I started to like this game and saw how different this game from others .In this game you will try to grind for the best loot and try to be stronger and stronger but sometimes you will be so mad that you probably will turn off the game .I'm pretty sick of the community but sometimes I salty and not friendly too that is what the game is about ""Saltiness"".I really recommend to buy this game and you have friends to play with its even better !",Rust

2017-12-09,0,0,1528,True,Recommended,After countless days of grinding fighting winning losing quitting and returning over and over i've decided to write my review. This game is so much more than you'd ever expect. I used to love every minute of rust even just walking around and exploring the maps at this time it was just a simple fun survival game to me. Then I made the mistake of taking this game way too seriously. Success was all that mattered to me if I wasnt winning it wasn't fun. Toxic players countless deaths losing resources it took hours to get in 2o seconds. This is just the surface of the frustrations any player will face. This game can be the most fun youll ever have with a ton of content and play time for $20 but it can also tear away at your sanity and ruin your whole day/week. Do I reccommend this game for casual players? No way this game is gut wrenchingly difficult with the only real challenge being other people. If youre willing to grind practice and play for hours on end this is the game for you. For me this game started to feel like a job it was no longer fun only stressful. Even with all that being said I know deep down that I will eventually come back to this game because thats the type of game it is.,Rust

2015-07-11,0,0,299,True,Recommended,This Game is great before buying this game I watched streams of people who played it That just made me want to buy it more plus most of my friends on steam have it. I've been playing it a lot and every week they have an update that adds more or makes performance better. This is survival its fun not dealing with zombie but with people and nature. What you put in is what you get out. You might start out confused but as you play you learn. This game just gets better and better It is in alpha but its more the community deside what gets put in the game and what doesn't the Devs just give the idea. The Devs are always updating there public on what there doing mostly on Twitter but on there website. They have an Devblog showing off the update stuff and what they are working on and the Communty Updates which showcase the players and there creation. They also have a subreddit for bugs and glitches that people can report that makes the game even better. Over all great community amazing Devs great content. Keep in mind there are cheaters and hackers but not everywhere and don't let that stop you from having a good time so if you love survival and PvP and PvE.Then buy this game what are you waiting for.,Rust
2015-02-02,0,0,1520,True,Not Recommended,This game is no longer playable.When i started playing this game when it first came out it wasn't even on steam it was played on their website so i've followed throught this games entire development process. It started out with a lot of promise and was honestly quite a lot of fun and that stayed true for a long time even after they decided to remove legacy and remake the game when they moved it to steam. After the remake it was still fun i played a lot of solo and then i also told 2 of my friends to get it and we enjoyed they game. But after a while the devs started making some questionable decisions and we started to take more and more breaks from the game part because we had played it so much and because the game was becoming worse and worse. Then almost from nowhere came the xp system instead of the bp system. This change completly ruined rust for the few months that the system was active. After the devs realised their mistake the decided to change the system again to the component system which was fun... for about half a wipe. Because the componenet system made it so that servers died faster clans had it even than before components took up so much space and there was no real progression anymore. Seing as you could have end game items in the matter of 1 or 2 hours. And now the ing game wom't even run properly and after about 4 or 5 hours of trying to fix this to give it one last try i've given up. This game is dead to me even though i want to like it looking at the game compared to what it could've been and what decisions are made by helk the game is dying it will never live up to the potential it had. Edit they just reintroduced bp combined with components this has made the game playable again for me however im still not sure wether i can recommend it yet. I will play a few wipes and see.,Rust

2016-12-27,0,0,184,True,Not Recommended,Well... I played rust almost from the beginning of its journey to the world.. First months of this game were certainly better although more ''rusty''.. nowdays this game is just 'STAY THE AWAY'. The optimization is horrific.. with a monster pc i can barely play it on medium graphics Gameplay is just random. You cant shoot its buggy and most of the times you get oneshot by someone that didnt actually wanted to shoot you in the head. Theres no mathematics and calculations as well.. sometimes you die of headshots sometimes not. Completely random. Mechanics are just laughable. On day 1 you get a big base and machine guns which you can craft easily if you have a big group. If not... 'STAY THE AWAY' parable. Bad developing team is bad. These guys keep making tha game worse and worse.. i mean how the heck can you do that... They can though. RAIDS. Raiding is just pointless.. most of the times you can wait until someone is offline and get his house.. its no fun and i really cant see why the heck is that easy to raid someones house.. (if its not badly built). WIPE WIPE WIPE WIPE WIPE WIPE EVERY MONTH. COME ON ITS ON ALPHA... WHAT? ALMOST 2 YEARS? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!To end.. i would recommend to 'STAY THE AWAY' of this ''game''. The community others stress out is logical for this kind of game i would say. So no probs there.If i could i would get my money back.. i had good times but these guys are a joke just like their game. And im not even sorry to them out like this. Because this could be a great game but its and getting more byt the hour.And for the video.. and the part ''make friends'' THERE ARE NO FRIENDS IN RUST. ONLY HOSTILE RUSSIANS THAT ARE YOUR ENEMY.I KNOW THAT BECAUSE IM RUSSIAN. AND I AM YOUR ENEMY.,Rust

2014-01-13,0,0,238,True,Recommended,Very good game for the Alpha stage of development content wise there are a lot of things to do and I would say this game has a lot of substance although there a a few bugs and the resource gathering needs a few tweaks to balance it all out this game is really good. For all the people complaining about people bullying you in PvP just go to a PvE(PvP disabled) server. I would highly recommend you pick it up if not now later when it is a little bit more developed. Oh and the game could use some sort of minimap or map system (maybe you could find or craft a GPS aha),Rust
2014-01-13,0,0,166,True,Recommended,Its an amazing game but it is like most games like Rust that got brought out on the Alpha Stage and again like most hackers the take advantage of this but i havnt seen any yet probaly just because Ive been playing on low populated servers. I havnt come across anyone that doesnt like the game. I find the game addicting fun and long lasting to play. Likely the more people that plays this game the better the reason why is because it could boost the development of the game. Already seen one person put that but I didnt see an admin respond. Anyways the game is extremely worth getting but read the discussions before hand so you know what your in for.,Rust

2016-10-06,0,0,264,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I have written alot of negative reviews about allot of games this on the other hand is a great game got its isues with anti social clan players but if you are 3 or more friends this game is a good start to let of steam. start a server run it its kinda really easy and i can assist you with that. then your server gets joined by others your rules your controles if we want to see less clan lardg group raids on individual players. we have to start by removing the platform that allows it to happen. with that said I have played the rival games and similar games to a great extent rust remains at the top of my recomendation list and the dev team is really active in making it bigger more balanced and better give them a 10/10 for there weekly updates and new contents.visualy this game is beautiful and not that hardware intensive compared to other games in its class.if your new in fps survival crafting gathering i recomend rust.if you are a cusual gamer or a fulll time nerd . rust is amazing and definetly worth your try your time your money,Rust

2014-05-06,0,0,117,True,Not Recommended,Currently RUST is going the way of the first release of All Points Bulletin. Hackers. Oh my god the hackers. The worst part is that even if you have a computer capable of recording via fraps or some other screenshotting software VAC bans don't seem to be doing anything. The server that just made me quit this game was an Official server. One of maybe 11 out of several thousand. It also wouldn't let me pull up a list of current players via steam so I couldn't even report the individual who was doing it.When I killed someone at a loot shack who had been stalking me his friends teleported to my brand new base and seeingas there is no way to see who is inside it called over voice chat to give his stuff back. Huh. Very good guess in a server with one of the highest populations. I opened the door and blasted the first one but suddenly was dead due to three headhsots from a pistol. Wow. Amazing aim.Think you're gonna run away from someone? Haha speed hacks are a thing. And the BEST part is that they are ALL toggleable. I understand the game is in Alpha but it's currently an unplayable alpha. I've been reduced to walking the map just shooting people because when I built an elaborate base a hacker was able to TP straight to me kill me then dump all of my possessions on the floor. Will the game be fun and playable someday? Damn I sure hope so. This game without hacks would be excellent. But that isn't this game right now. I am upset I even spent money on a game without some form on anti hack software. Save your money and wait for a full release. Oh and Steam? Could you please get on banning people for cheating like you said you would?,Rust

A chance find of a gun and you are a big step ahead.Hard to get anything establish if you are not in the know of exactly when a server is gonna be wipedWill have to make some alliances to thrive so buy it for a friend too.No center dot for ""from the hip"" attacks. Assume that there are others who will dot their screen for the huge advantage so seems like a decent thing to add to ensure others can't gain an advantage from external sources.food is super scarce.

It's still a very fun game but its almost neccessary to play with a group of 2 or 3+ because the game is overflown with so many other groups. The game play is pretty good not too many laggy situations during pvp that I've noticed. The component system needs a bit of tweaking but I know the Devs will get it settled.

2018-02-06,0,0,5498,True,Recommended,What can be said that hasn't already been said Rust is a super fun game. Challenging yes but it's the closest thing you'll get to experience the thrill/terror of living in a post apocalypse world where you're on your own to survive counting on no one looking over your back all the time for any and all dangers that threaten your very existance. Learn to trust some you meet but still keeping one hand at the ready for any sense of betrayal when your back might be turned. Experince the joy and relief of contructing your first small base to keep your basic survival gear safe and giving you a spawn point so you don't have to start all over again.To those of you still on the fence buy now before the price goes up on Feb. 8th 2018.

2016-10-14,0,0,212,True,Recommended,"This game is like the hunger games but much MUCH WORSE! If you are new to the game ill just let you know that there are alot of naked men and women throwing rocks and trying to survive against animals amd other naked people. But you will have to survive yourself. Yes. yourself. You will start to hallucinate and every sound you hear will feel like someone is creeping up on you coming for their next kill or every crackling sound will sound like a gun reloading. Its a scary place out there. There are the good the bad and then the very evil. The evil will make you a prisoner or a slave. They will keep you locked up forever or until your mind gives in and you type ""kill"" in console. They will feed cans of tuna when available and sometimes spare logs of wood. The evil might sometimes talk to you saying ""It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again"" and by hose i mean they dump charcoal on you. If you buy this game just be ready for full on war of the nude. But over all great game. 20/10 IGN",Rust

Go lone wolf or try your luck at approaching giant metal fortresses built by people much better than you because they have skill (many friends with weapons) Go out with guns blazing or offer the olive branch and form a clan.

2017-03-17,0,0,106,True,Recommended,Good game! Developers are very active and the game gets updated regularly so I recommend this title. If you're looking for more of a survival experience however this game isn't quite for you. Most players are mislead into thinking this game is survival based but as it stands as of right now that is not really the case. Sure there are survival elements within the game but it takes on more of a PVP playstyle rather then PVE. Definetly not friendly to newer players. But once you get the hang of things you'll find enjoyment Definitely worth a try if you haven't already.,Rust

2017-12-23,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,"Very unfriendly for new players. But that's okay I would normally take my time to do the research read stuff online and watch videos. But what really turns me off is the players. Like many other reviews have mention there is an absurd amount of toxic people on the servers.Short example (Benny the Bengalia) Asks me to stay off her property I walk off shoots me out of no where I said why. She said she hates N****s (N word). I proceed to say ""Why would that matter and I am Chinese."" To which she replies ""Even better you ing ."" I would be fine with someone shooting me for no reason. But this really turned me off for the game together with spending so much time gathering basic materials and dying and gathering and dying. I never got to even try buidling a base because the moment I start gathering stuff I die. Can't recommend this game unless you have friends who are good at the game already.

But the fact of the matter is the game is so poorly optimized and the Rust developers just keep implimenting new gear and weaponry without fixing the bugs and lag issue they had before hand...

2016-06-21,0,0,268,True,Recommended,Now why does my review say yes? well its a if if situation you see im only makeing suggestion's the decision of you the reader is to based off yourself useing the information you have gathered from reading this and others.Rust now i myself am not a veteran at all some may call me biased or too unskilled to say my piece but i shall so deal with it Rust is a open world surival game with wepons food water etc etc. now im talking about the players first when rust was open players were given a simple choice you be nice or you be merciless what do you think they chose? its obvious anyways from that simple choice everyone was under the assumption to kill each other or be killed by them and wars outbroke and all updates to this game have been good and balanced so i wont talk about that but instead the players. in this game people will kill you almost ALL of them will shoot on sight now some wont and some will chat and those are the nice players of the game and withe very game there are classes of players or atleast. Thats how i see it there are the Friendlys who are the miniority (im one of them P) they usually dont fight unless forced and have the general view to help people then there are the Regulars these people shoot or talk based on whatever they think they fight some time for pleasure or for some other reason nice people to talk to bad to have as your enemy then you have what i like to call the bandits now these people unless you are one are generally unpleasent to be with as they kill everyone and everyone except for theyre steam friends or clan they are generally toxic and rude and will taunt constantly in chat and be well. a Now thats what anyone can assume in a game correct? now heres what I say if you want this game to play yourself and learn the mechanics then yes get this game if you want it to group with friends and become great in a clan then yes get this game aswell but if you want to be friends with everyone and happy sunshine turn back now because you will be slaughtered like cattle.Hope this helped Pat,Rust

As most people know windowed is performance wise and especially on Rust it causes a lot of screen tearing. I had to enter a launch command into steam. 2.No V Sync have to force through Nvdia control panel. 3.Anti Cheat Software has started malfunctioning and is making it impossible to play I cannot get logged into a server. 4.Frame rates in game are bad even with 8 gigs of vram and every setting turned low or off. 5.Mouse has stopped working in game will work in menus but won't move camera around.

2014-07-14,0,0,865,True,Recommended,"This game is completely and utterly consumed by cheaters. The game is almost unplayable by non cheaters as a result of the many cheats exploits and hacks that are constanly exercised by other players. A simple internet search will reveal just how easy it is for any kid to become god against players who do not use such cheats. Also you should be warned that this gaming community is extremely hostile not only through gameplay but social interaction as well. The vast majority of players are hard core Rustians whom KoS (Kill on Sight) and mock those players which are trying to get established in the game (aka noobs). The official servers are unattended garbage while the community servers make up the bulk of the player population. However be prepared for admins that give themselves and donators tremendous advantages almost to the point of making this a Pay to Win title. The devs have abandoned original rust in it's entirety to focus all of their time on the ""experimental"" version which will be replacing the version you see here.

Such as team spawning etc. So far so good still has a long way to go but i'll enjoy the ride.,Rust
2014-01-19,0,0,35,True,Recommended,A very cool and unique game. Worth every penny it's also cheaper than its rival 7 days to die. Even though the game is in it's alpha stage it is indeed very playable minor bugs here and there but that won't spoil the fun. The A.I is dumb had to say it zombies get stuck and might ignore your presence and if a hostile A.I starts following you he'll ignore everyone except you meaning a person can dodge and another person can keep whacking him from the back. The game has a nice array of tools and items at you disposable including rifles pistols bows flare and not to mention a freaking C4. The map is very large! very difficult to find friends to meet and regroup. You still can't share doors meaning if you are planning to build a house for 3 then you need 3 doors /. I'll conclude with a tip use a microphone saved my life multiple times and find a secret spot for your house raiders are all over the game.. ) good luck!,Rust

The graphics are really nice if your computer can run it. Its and overall calm game until you find other players... They may kill you straight away.

The proceduarally generated worlds are simply beautiful. It can take you off guard.But then you realize nature is beautiful but also cruel.The wolves the bears the radiation are nothing. The real danger lies in the people. Who can you trust?You're new friend may just be waiting for you to fall asleep and eat your meat. Freshly roasted over the campfire under some damp dungy rock shelter as the dark of night envelops the land.You awake from a deep sleep hogtied. Is that my leg on the campfire?Oh but there is hope. You can fortify your base build vault doors reminiscent of those Vault Dwellers from Vault 101. But then an airplane flies overhead dropping a blueprint for C4. And BOOM! You are officially in the Danger Zone.Hunt craft build explore learn trust or distrust. Post apocalyptic survival in its finest and most gruesome form.,Rust

2017-11-15,0,0,939,True,Recommended,I have been playing rust on and off since zombies and there have been ups and downs. The community has always been horrible. People are seen as resource nodes and anyone not in chat are kill on site. For every 10 25 people that will kill you 1 might be friendly for a bit then kill you. Rust was going threw a phase of increasing the play ability for the pve er of the group but has since reversed any gain and went in the complete other direction. Currently the game is unplayable. It is a great game and there is plenty of fun to be had if you want a large scale arena deathmatch with a few minutes to hours to get equipped instead of spawning in with your loadout in a smaller arena.Rust has some of the best base building in the survival universe. This part of the game is why I have so many hours and I still keep an eye on it. destructible bases provides a nice designing challenge. This coupled with location specific building challenges allows the free form building of fun bases. Many players however watch the latest youtube and scout for a location to build the same base they watched.If you like to interact with strangers and find helping out people to be enjoyable this is not the game for you. If you like cs go cod or other kill people for the sake of killing people games then this is right up your ally.I currently recommend this game for the group of players that will love it. If you have ever enjoyed pve in a multi player survival game there are much better games out there for you.,Rust

2017-11-15,0,0,170,True,Not Recommended,Honestly the game can be very fun sometimes but what ruins this game is the toxicity of the players. I know its PVP but sometimes people take things to far. But overall this game is decent if you play with a couple friends. If you're a solo player I wouldn't recommend playing this because people have to much time on their hands so much so they have created a massive group that constantly harasses people. This game also is very hard to run due to how High Quality the graphics are which requires you to either lower your settings to make the game look and or get a better computer.,Rust

2017-11-06,0,0,553,True,Recommended,For playing a good amount I feel like it is time to make a review.First off never play on official server they are filled with hackers who never get banned as much so your better off playing community servers as they are better and have good anti cheat. You're also going to want to bring a friend as the game is rather hard play solo (I live the solo experience) but there are servers where it is solo only so you don't have to deal with large groups of people weilding guns. The weekly updates are awesome as they usually contain one new item added into the game along with the skins you can buy which are pretty nice. Though your going to want to find a stable community too as after wipe day you will see lots of people online but a couple days later the population is very low like 10 to 20 people online. I would also avoid servers that contain toxic and rude people as they can ruin the game for you. Other than that the game pretty awesome and I would totally recommend buying ),Rust

2017-11-06,0,0,156,True,Not Recommended,Heres whats wrong with Rust it wipes too often the game is literally designed to cater to whoever has the largest number of people playing the most Just like ARK. oh they did a bp wipe? great well you have a giant group of 8 s who have guns day 1 of the wipe and just go trash new players. the game is literally cancer its all about how many people and how long you have to sink into it. theres no skill its simply a time dump.,Rust

2017-11-06,0,0,23,True,Recommended,What I like limit group or team within the squad which allow or let other players have a chance to enjoy the game. base built its fun reasonable price for the game (unfinished game or never finish or intended will never release the game).What I dont like (Dislike) Its a bad game for so many patch and updates. bad graphics or design on characters etc. Look very poor design. optimization still not very good after years of new updates Very unfriendly server setup take times to know what is going on in the game. game bored very quick once one team get well equiped basically hard to play after that. the game get wipe too quick and start all over again which make no sense or pointless.I will recommend this game when the game developer upgrade the graphics and optimization of the game. Right now I give about C++ compared the Just Survive by Daybreak (F ). So the game is not very recommend it but hey its only 9.99 on discount time so I give OK!,Rust

2018-04-26,0,0,1160,False,Recommended,Ok i'm nearing almost 1000 hours in this game so i'm guessing it's time for a review Let me start with saying Rust has changed alot over time and not every change was positive. Facepunch has tried to balance the game more and more which of course is understandable but they sometimes forget not everybody has alot of time to play this game. I don't play as much as I used to in the past which means I simply cannot play Vanilla anymore for the following reasons Rust Vanilla is just no fun anymore. It is an endless grind for Blueprints and resources and if you're a solo player you can pretty much forget about it unless you wanna spend a couple hours every day. The only way Rust Vanilla can still be fun is if you play with a large group. That way you can share Blueprints and resources. In the past being in a group also was easier obviously but as a solo player you still stood a chance because you could get your hands on better tools and guns. Now this is way harder if you're on your own. So they think they helped to balance the game with this but really they made it just harder for solo players.This wasn't always the case. About a year ago Rust Vanilla was still a great experience. Of course gathering resources took alot of time but you at least could craft everything right away. Now you need to spend almost an entire day to find the blueprint of a better tool which you need to farm resources. So if you play Vanilla prepare to spend alot of your time hitting trees and rocks with the worst tool available in the game which just means grinding and grinding and grinding.Another big downside of Vanilla is the introduction of Workbenches. Workbenches is what you need to stand next to to craft basic stuff. So no more crafting on the run. Horrible decision. These awful things require a shatload of scrap (more like crap) which getting your hands on also means extra grinding.So Blueprints and Workbenches was a terrible move by Facepunch and have pretty much ruined the Vanilla Experience for Rust.Another thing that is worthy of mentioning is that the Tool Cupboards have changed alot. Over time a Tool Cupboard had a radius of 50m to protect your base and people coulnd't ladder up your base when they were within it's zone. Now a days you need a single Tool Cupboard for your base and it expands all around your base no matter how big or small it is but they can ladder up your base easily. I also dislike this because now everybody just roofraids you. Getting raided is easy now so I prefer playing on Modded servers that still block any form of building in someone else's Tool Cupboard radius.This game is still great fun if you play Modded. Modded has alot more support for solo players since most Modded servers have faster gathering rates or don't require the need for Blueprints at all. So if you're like me and only play in the weekends or maybe like an hour during the week Modded is still the way to go.So if you're gonna play solo make sure to play Modded on a x5 server. I also recommand playing on a server that doesn't require the need for Blueprints or the need for a Workbench. That is hands down the most fun experience for this game.I highly not recommand getting this game if you wanna play Vanilla on your own because that way it's almost like a fulltime job to get a fun experience.Downsides of Rust Vanilla Endless grind for Blueprints to unlock basic stuff Endless grind for resources (this wasn't the case before but it is now because you have bad tools untill you found better blueprints and you also need more resources to upkeep your base). Building upkeep Everybody can just build up your base with ladders or twig building and raid you from thereSo in short Rust Vanilla vs Rust ModdedRust Vanilla Not RecommandedRust Modded Highly Recommanded,Rust

There was a certain update sorry that I can't remember it off the top of my head but the update featured where you were able to build on top of people's bases which made you think differently about the game and made you create based in different ways which in my opinion brought more life into the game. The game does have an issue with open mic which creates a bunch of toxicity and might drive some people away from the game. But reporting them will help bring the community to a better stance on this. (Do it!) The game also features a karate verity of weapons anywhere from small melee based weapons to Rockets and C4s. Mountuments are also a big feature in this game this is usually the main place you would want to go for loot also the roads are a fairly decent place to get loot as well. They recently added a mounument called the ""Launch Site"" which has a tank protrolling the area defeating it will give loot as well. There is also a day and night cycle which in this game actually does something. At night it is pure black and your only source of light will be your torch and swimming in the water at night will make you cold which will cause you to lose health unless you create a fireplace. In conclusion I would give this game a 8/10 enjoy!",Rust

I thought this might have been due to it costing $20 instead of ARK's $60. WRONG. Rust is the It's hard crude but there are no levels to climb restrictions to building and it runs smooth as butter on the highest settings unlike ARK (really.. 80fps on med low settings!?). Rust is more about encounters. Save your money.,Rust

But as always this game is cool enough that people could have fun in it. You can build base's you can fight vs. other people. You can play with friends.

2016-10-31,0,0,637,True,Recommended,This is a very good game. The devs are constantly updating the game (every Thursday). There is so much to do and the player interaction is amazing. Besides this the games community is pretty toxic and you will almost always be raided and killed by larger clans. The game may have these cons however I would still highly recommend buying it. D,Rust
2016-10-31,0,0,796,True,Recommended,This game has come along way and has had uphill and downhill moments. At its current state it is still a fun game (as it has been and will always be) its just a endless grinding cycle to level up by yourself. If you dont have a group this game is pretty much not one you should pick up.The postives outshine the negatives though so that is amazing.The PvP One of the best you will find requires skill it makes your adrenalline start to pump and makes you want to finish off that group or person you're fighting.The Resourcing Pretty much you just hit stuff for resources ( i know sounds boring but it is fun at times if you're with friends)The Crafting makes sense already will make more sense on november 3rd 2016 when the new componet system is coming out.Finally... The Toxic (But Salty and hilarious community) it is fun getting in arguments when you just triple headshot someone who didn't have a chance to say you and they talk mad beef in chat. Definitly a +i would give this game a 9/10 just for it is not perfect but will eventually become amazing like when the BP System was here.Oh and P2 Nerf Didn't need to happen !,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,58,True,Recommended,This game is only in Alpha and it is fantastic. Can definatly see where theres need for improvement but thats the exciting part. Much like with Minecraft when it came out it was awesome. Its only gotten better and we got to see it get better as time went on and thats what i forsee with this game. I mean exploring building crafting and those occasional air drops that are excting on there own to try and get. Plus with this game only being multiplayer there almost someone always on and ive mostly dealt with people who are friendly and help all the time or people who just keep to themselves only had a raid problem once. But all in all i say this game is worth it cause its only in alpha and its only gonna get better and while its in alpha itll be cheaper so try and get it now while you can haha.,Rust

2015-09-05,0,0,193,True,Recommended,This game is real fun for when you have time to grind it. Or you just have nothing els to do. But the only downside to this game is the requirments.

2018-02-08,0,0,238,False,Recommended,Now that I have 150 hours in this game and it just left early access I will write a review. This game is amazing while I go on hour long rants about how bad the community can be and that I took a couple month long break I still adore this game. The graphics are great and the gameplay is amazing. I don't know if the main stream is ready for the gameplay which consists of a really hard experience to learn the game. You spawn in and try to gather materials most of the time get shot but when you don't you get a base. This base feels great to keep upgrading and get all your bp's. Or you get eoka raided when you go to eat dinner. Thats the problem with new people trying to start the game is brutal and the clans and people who somehow get every gun within hours cause physical and mental pain when they kill you. And the community can be terrible when they say welcome to rust when you get mad. I'm so glad this game gets developed so much by facepunch and that they are so great at releasing weekly updates. While some updates are pointless (flares) they still respond to the community and make great updates most weeks. I was so happy to see rust now available on steam but I don't know if a lot of the mainstream can handle the pain of dying. The graphics gameplay aesthetic and developers are great. Looking forward to a good 900 more hours 9/10.,Rust

No. There's no mercy here. If you like casual survival like Minecraft this might not be for you. Then again there are plenty of PvE servers for you to try. Whether you like hardcore survival or laidback Rust allows you to try both (with the Rust servers and PvE servers created by players). Worth my money IMO.,Rust
2016-01-18,0,0,214,True,Not Recommended,I used to love this game. An entire point of it was that you could go from having nothing to having everything in an instant depending on your skill. With the addition of an XP and levelling system this game has gone from a fun survival game to a boring grindfest. You have to spend hours to simply make a sheet metal door with a codelock. And if you come into a server a few days after a wipe you're ed. Everyone will have better weapons than you and you have no chance at survival. Facepunch please make this game great again.,Rust

I liked this game for the first week. I had a really good base going with my friends from Serbia. But then i called a mexican kid a fat squeaky rat because he sounded fat annoying and dumb (rat because he was from mexico). Then his group of hackers flew into our base and insta killed us all. THis made me hate the game lots. Another thing that suks is load times. It takes me up to 20 min to load into a server and im running thsi game on my dad's work computer(it has an intel cpu so its very fast btw). Last thing there is full nudity in this game and it is very gay. I turned nudity on because i thought i would see nice boobs. BUUT there then i saw a like wtf who wants so see that you .

2017-10-25,0,0,681,True,Recommended,This game is still under development It has the best most caring and active developers I've ever seen. They listen to the players and constantly try to improve the game. Sometimes the changes are good sometimes bad. But if you've been playing long enough you can see how far the game has come and how much stuff they've added.Despite many hours I'm not particularly good at the game but I still enjoy it nonetheless. I've made a lot of friends in the game and also a lot of enemies. If given the chance Rust is definitely a unique gaming experience that is well worth the money. I'm excited to see where the game ends up once it leaves early access one day.,Rust

We both had zero supplies and we died. After that we could not find each other and we both go killed a million times.

2014-01-26,0,0,241,True,Recommended,This game is tough. You have to fight to survive. Other players will kill you you will kill other players and you will die often. The important thing to remember is that just because you lose everything doesn't mean it's the end of the world. The point of the game is not to progress and build it's to survive. Survival of the fittest. It's a great game I highly recommend it. Just don't cry when things don't go your way. Keep at it and you'll get it eventually.,Rust

2018-02-08,0,0,142,False,Recommended,Rust is honestly a really fun game though I recommend playing with friends. There is a lot wrong with rust now but with the devs that I've seen they pay attention to what the community has to say and try their best to fine tune. This game has a lot of potential and I can't wait to see where it's going to go outside of Early Access.,Rust
2014-01-19,0,0,194,False,Not Recommended,I'd love to recommend this game but the dev seems more interested in making some kind of political statement rather than catering to what his players want. I logged in one day to find my avatar gone and a bald ugly woman who looks like shrek in his place. Now the game is released and I still have to play as the shrek woman. What's the point of selling cosmetics for your game if you don't actually let players pick what they look like? It's giving kind of mixed signals isn't it?I don't know why Garry wants to force people to play as an avatar they hate but there's plenty of games where you get to pick your appearance I suggest you go play one of those instead.,Rust
2017-04-16,0,0,360,False,Recommended,First off for transparency sake I don't enjoy this game very much. I enjoy it in the company of friends and I believe that is how it should be played. This game is a grindy hard to understand game. The official trailer does not describe this game what so ever. Please before purchasing this game do some reasearch to see what it is truely about. It is a survival game where you join a server that has reset that day you build a house get weapons and your two main objectives are to expand your base to further protect your growing stockpile of weapons and resources and use those weapons and resources to destroy other people and their base. Playing alone on an official server will make you refund the game. The good players play on official servers I suggest going to community for a smaller player count try looking for a solo only server as on official servers there are large clans of 8 20 people. If you want to enjoy the game playing solo look up how to build bases and learn how to fight. There are community deathmatch and battle royale servers that can help with this. Playing with a group is optimal for a game like this. If you wish to compete on official servers you need at least 4 people who are exceptionally skilled at the game. We are talking like 800 1000 hours. You will come across people that are on 18 hours a day and have 2500 hours on the game along with their 9 buddies that have the same statistics. It is not fun fighting those. I'm just trying to give you a picture of how I view this game. The community is cruel and toxic. Do not play alone. Know what you are getting your group into and if you are well edcuated enough proceed. I only play with a group of people and I only farm with them getting wood and stone occasionally helping them out in a big fight flanking with something cheap like an SMG but every person has a diffrent role at least in our group. Seriously play with friends only way you can enjoy the game if at all.You have been warned. This is a toxic and competetive game and you can and will be outnumbered. I can not say wether or not I reccomend it so I am just putting it as I do the choice is up to you I just gave you my raw rambling thoughts.,Rust

2018-02-08,0,0,439,False,Recommended,My best and worst moments have been in Rust. Such a variety of emotions can't be delivered by any other game.One week you could build your base up get some weapons make some allies and maybe fire some shots at a couple odd nakeds with foreign accents. It could be a mellow week with minimal hiccups in terms of progression. The next week you could build a small 2x1 hut and never build a proper base because you're being shoved into intense firefights near monuments you built too close to kill a geared player and run away with all their stuff then log on to find a five player group take it all away in an instant. Not being attached to your items in this game is a good skill be prepared to lose a lot of your This game is well worth the price as the developers have really put their all into this.

2018-02-08,0,0,934,False,Not Recommended,I have a fair amount of hours in this game and i can promise you if you dont find a group thats 4+ people you will get rolled always. People have figured out ways to use scripts to make their aim better so they always head shot or shoot a whole clip in two seconds dead accurate. There are so many hackers on offical servers doing this kind of thing and admins dont do anything. If you play on a private server admins can manually remove the cancer but again then you risk admin abuse. Which also happens a lot. Overall if you can tolerate losing everything most times you play until you get into a clan then ya this games for you.,Rust

2018-02-09,0,0,236,False,Recommended,I bought this game in alpha stage a month back and It was 10 dollars it looked fun. I bought it. I hopped into a server and found myself naked on the beach with a rock and a torch. Like any survival game I looked for rocks and trees. Then out of nowhere was shot by a guy who was fully geared and had at least 4 guns in his hotbar. I respawned and this time was able to gear up and make a small base. It was small but it worked. I killed people got airdrops. Made friends exactly as the game says you will. Although the servers take a while to load the payoff is worth it.Pros lots of map to explore and varying maps helicopter fights can happen and are intense with friends the game can be lots of funCons game now costs 35$ three and a half times what I origanally paid for it gunfights are annoying as you almost always just either instantly die or you instantly kill them it's very frustrating to get off the game in your base and come back not only dead but your base looted and now have to start back from square oneOverall The game is very fun in general but in the fifty hours i've played there are countless rage inducing things that were completely out of my control.A 8/10 for it's 10$ versionfor 35$ though? wait for a huge sale otherwise? a 6.5/10,Rust

2014-06-07,0,0,208,True,Recommended,"Rust a Survival Open world game so its just you and your rock. The goal is to survival for a long time their are many survival games out that are big like Dayz 7 Days to day ETC. but rust is diffrent because you can build in diffrent ways much diffrent from 7 Days to Die because its more of a survival off of nature time deal unlike 7 Days to Die you go to towns cars and much more. Rust is bare bones when it comes to surviving off of only towns. Also Rust is diffrent from games like Dayz because well its a no duh question Dayz and rust are very diffrnet by many ways like Dayz zombies Rust animals Dayz everyone wants to kill you Rust everyone loves you! But the game is diffrent and the game should be picked up by you because The origanality and its building and how cheap it is and constint updates when updates are coming out and when they are out. you could maybe is you love the game get maybe 300hours out of the game i put about 200+ hours and it was well worth it! Also FacePunch yes the creators of the beloved game Garrys Mod made the game. For an alfa it should be known for one of the hardest working team for the stage their at! the graphics at the momnet arnt the best (The towns are Terrible looking) but what their trying to do for rust is make a ""sand box""(I think thats the genra you would put it in) A sand box survival game. and their going to have random worlds (people cant just play 10hours of a new server and be king of the server) they would have to work for it! and the art their working at looks very good and the random worlds look buitiful and out standing for random world! ___ HOPE YOU LIKE ONLY 13 Tryed my best ___",Rust

But here was what I once thought of the game below!I love this game! It teaches you some of lifes most important rules. 1. Never trust anything.2. Walking around the wilderness WILL get you lost. 3. Bears don't want you to pet them... They want food! AND YOUR THE FOOD! 4. Everything you have worked hard to earn will be taken from you..... Unfairly! 5. EVERYONE DIES! 6. You can bend metal into perfectly acceptable guns with your hands. Seriously though this game does do a couple things very well. It is a massive world! And your going to get lost! It takes hours and hours of gameplay before you learn how to find your way around. When it's dark out it's REALLY dark...... don't wonder around in the dark.... your going to get hurt killed or perhaps just trapped down a pit of rocks like I did. You could market this game as a get lost simulator and it would be worth the money on just that aspect alone.,Rust
2017-09-09,0,0,230,True,Recommended,Lots of official servers and community servers to choose from based on if you're new (solo/duo/trio is good) or if you're skilled and have lots of people to play with (clan servers) and different mods drop rates etc. Looting gathering and farming are straightforward and easy even for the newest of players. If you don't know what to get just search the item by pressing Q and typing the item that you want and it tells you what you're going to need. The hardest thing about this game is finding a nice build that is hard to raid for your base. The only downsides I've found with this game is that in the 40 hours I've played I've already ran into multiple cheaters that will only get 100% headshots.,Rust

2017-07-01,0,0,219,True,Recommended,Very good game overall. But still some things they could have done better. They always wipe the server your playing on every month for the update. And the wipe is not needed as you see in other games like ARK DayZ and such.But I really like the concept of farming and building bases. The game has potential. The only thing that goes on my nerves is the server wipe thing.And it has this thing were it crashes very easily in the loading screen.But I can really suggest the game to every one who likes survival games like DayZ or ARK.,Rust

The distant fields and wooded areas offered little solace and I was soon slumped over in a pool of my own frothy blood simply because I had no time to react from the thunderous crack that ripped through the air from behind me. I couldn't even clothe myself and these guys had guns. FML.Respawning over and over I came to learn the ways of this strange and wonderful land. I brought down my first kill and for a single night feasted like a King! With hunger at bay I could explore my surroundings some more and ultimately carved out my own remote corner where I could buld a small but sturdy structure to make it through the night in. I fashioned simple garb to keep warm with. I crafted primitive weapons. I learned to harvest the land's bouty and turn what I unearthed into better and better items. Soon I too had guns.The prey was now the predator and I learned to strike at those who would take what I had. I could defend myself. I could force my will upon others. I could take what they had.

But if you get a group of 3 maybe 4 then you're pretty set aslong as you're all good players. unlike me i play with the noobs all the time so we always get ed on. But i think this game is really fun it has the most hours in my steam libary and its reallly grately optimized.Pros Fun to interact with random people Building system is ing great making plays makes you feel like a god Not many hackers but still a few Cons Very toxic commuity Have huge groups on populated servers need a really beast computer (thank god i do ) ) will make you rage like crazy spawn in the same ing area like 3000 times no cars or any means of trasport (but soon we'll have cars hopefully),Rust
2016-09-26,0,0,47,True,Recommended,"Interesting and fun game concept that is unfortunately soured by an immature community.Your house will more often than not be raided when you are offline and your items stolen or despawned just so you won't have anything to come back to. Some people will also go to the extent that they build difficult to destroy items in doorways to greif you or just demolish your base entirely.You will be shot on sight or stabbed by every player you come across no exceptions no conversations. People are not willing to trust one another for fear of being tricked causing the playerbase to become a self perpetuating kill on sight mess.You will be shot at by highly geared players when you spawn in like some kind of sport.While being shot at after spawning other players that have just spawned will try to kill you with their rocks ""just because"".Numbers Power. If you do not have people to play Rust with you will be repeatedly killed and greifed as listed above.Time Power. If you do not have many many hours to defend your base and grind for resources to construct some of the more elaborate buildings you will get targetted by people that do.Mechanically the game is very fun with only one glaring bug that I have come across (animals run through solid objects). The community playing Rust however is awful forcing me to not recommend the game.EDIT I'm not going to change what was initially written here but I will update this review after a year of game progress with my thoughts now that there have been some major changes to the systems within.A lot of what i've written in my earlier review still stands. If you build a house it will get raided every time you log off by people who are miles ahead of you in power using explosives to take out your budget little stone shack in the off chance it contains anything of value.What makes this into something that isn't so game breakingly annoying anymore is the fully revamped crafting system. Rather than requiring a home in which to place a fire smelter and other such crafting tables you are now able to craft the majority of things through your inventory alone. Any items that require higher level materials such as metal can also be obtained by raiding radtowns and using the free Recycler in almost every one to break down items into components.Using this system I have personally been able to make myself some nice armour and a crossbow without ever placing even a fire.Nomad style gameplay will become your best friend as a solo survivor and thankfully the game actually supports this as a viable albeit more difficult mode of playing Rust.The community is still as terrible as ever. What feels like 99% of other players will shoot you on sight out of paranoia that the other person will do it first. Do not expect to make friends.The game still has some issues with optimisation considering the detail in the models and textures I would have expected a more stable framerate on my rig (GTX 680 + 3770k both overclocked). It has a very cartoon ey asthetic which suits the game well it's like Team Fortress had a lovechild with Mad Max.The playerbase is still extremely active with servers here in Australia easily hitting 350+ players during prime time. I can't foresee the game being empty any time soon.Overall I think the changes to the crafting system alone are enough for me to push my review to Reccomended. The game is very fun to play as a roguelike multiplayer survival. I hope to see more optimisation in the future.",Rust

As I played with a clan and I conquered the game But about 6 months ago I had to stop playing and it wasnt because it wasnt fun. It was because my memory could not keep up with the game as it was using 99% of my cpu and I have a good cpu CoreI7. To this day I still have not found a solution and it has mad me really upset.

If you want to know more you just have to google ""Rust Memory Issue"". It's NOT an isolated incident and it's been around for half a year...Other than that the way the game is right now just makes it bad. The crafting is monotonous the ability to KNOW how to make a damn machinegun out of basically scraps is unrealistic. The raids the newbie squashing and general tardedness of the community on some servers have steered me the hell away from this game ever since.It's kinda sad actually since the graphics are nice and it DOES have a lot of potential but those facts alone are not enough to save this game in my eyes.IF the memory issues are fixed at some point which seems unlikely at this point I will give it another go.",Rust
2016-12-28,0,0,225,True,Recommended,About Early Acess Another example of an Early Acess (EA) game that is failing STEAM needs to take responsibility and stop EA games or have a contract with this DEV's/ game production companys that legally bounds them if the game never releases they need to pay the players back.And if the game is released and does not have the features that they promised (over promised) players get a percent age back. Like there was 30 feature promised and only 25 where implemented at release 25/30 83% complete which mean 16 precent is imcomplete. So 16% would be returned to the player at the price they purchased the game. This is what happens with almost ever EA game Dev cash in and then leave.This is up to you the players to push not me I am one voice and you need to standup to these game production companys that push imcomplete games.Copy the text above to any EA games that you feel this way. Un like Most Garry and his team have tried to right the ship but are currently failing. That is OKAY but I believe they are finding that they should have released the game 3 yrs ago in it's current state and update from there. The time it took them to create new maps UI and all of that has stalled this game way to long. I love the updates every week but it maybe taking a toll on the over all production and devoplment of the game.,Rust

2016-05-27,0,0,3992,True,Recommended,Takes skills and teamwork to get to the top of the food chain.If you are intending to play solo you will probably last for 24 hours tops in a 100+ server before getting your base raided and having hours of hard work taken away within seconds. However solo players can play in low populated server to survive longer or even until server wipe.However the game is filled with hackers ranging from Aimbot ESP and even super jump. Low populated community servers are usually filled with hackers. Official servers are always filled with hackers due to the absence of admin. Fighting a person using aimbot is nearly impossible so it really ruins the game.7/10 Would be 8/10 if it weren't for the hackers.,Rust

2016-03-16,0,0,185,True,Not Recommended,The game itself is fun and pretty good. The problem is the development speed. These guys have been at it for over 3 years now and every time it seems they are accomplishing something they say that they aren't happy and they start over again. This game has achieved in 3 years what other games like ARK have done in 8 months and it feels like the DEV team is playing us for fools and that they will never finish the game... it is always excuses with them... in 3 years you can pump out a AAA game not this unfinished mess of a game that isn't even out of alpha (which by the way is their and their fanboy base excuse for poor performance and lack of content...3 years in...),Rust
2016-08-01,0,0,1988,True,Not Recommended,This game is heading in a bad direction. I have played a lot of this game and had a lot of great experiences. From being part of a large group to playing as a solo survivor. Unfortunately the developers have decided to move this game in a direction that forces a specific type of play and makes it very difficult for new players to become involved with the game. The constant focus on rewarding large clans and groups while nerfing the early game for new players is ruining what made rust great. The flexibility to play the game the way you want. Most recently with the new XP system and changes to early game weapons they made it so a new player literally has no way to defend themselves when they start. They must farm or gather to get enough resources to level up and craft a spear. Usually just to give up these resources to other players before they can even craft a spear. This is made even worse by the fact that the XP system clearly rewards larger groups who can coordinate the XP sharing to quick level their members.I honestly hope this game turns around because it is one of my top games of all time. Let's hope the developers pull their head out of the sand long enough to see they have something that can be great.,Rust

But im reviewing this game as good but the fact is its intence and toxic i had fun in it but most of the times i rage quit either you're fighting agains a clan alone or server lags or high ping that you cant shoot you're enemy or farming till someone kill you and get your loot or login and find your base raided . Now you know whats waiting you .. at the end its a game and game like these not like cod or what ever . it needs time and skills . simple mistake or a bad location to build a base and you're off and try to play with friends . alone will be hard . everyone plays with friend now . and dont judge the game so quick . spend days playing it learn the mechanics and then decide .,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,307,True,Recommended,Rust Is One of those open world Sanbox that has a Minecraft (yes Theres crafting) S.T.A.L.K.E.R (i would say becuase of Zombies and radiation) Dayz (Pvp Loot raiding) kinda feeling. Personally I think if your alone the game gets 10x more challenging knowing you have to fight the night bandits and doing 100% of the work by yourself. If you Do get this game Get some friends. It makes The game So much better. Either persuade your friends to get this or hope to find that one golden nugget person who actually is there to be your friend. Theres also a few bugs I should talk about. In the Version of alpha im running (30th dec.)((i think)) gun models all look the same so u cant tell if the guy has a rock or 9mm pistol. or the m4a1 and Mossberg Shotgun have the same model as well. while in the players hand you can tell because they do look different but if you look at another player the guns have same models. This is also one of the best day/night cycles ive seen because at night it gets so dark you literally cant see anything and you freeze if u dont have clothes and a campfire and in the day the sun gets so bright if u look in its direction u cant see anything. I do Recommend this game because you have to realize that this is alpha and these things can be subect to change.Alpha version 9/10 *must play*,Rust

2014-01-04,0,0,2,True,Recommended,"Early Thoughts Rust is a truly fun game that is taking a bit of a different viewpoint on the survival genre. No zombies. I love zombies but there are at least 5 games out currently (in early access) trying to be ""THE ZOMBIE"" game. Rust has other creatures you have to survive from including wolves and other players.One interesting mechanic is that your player location is stored on the server and you character still persists after you log out. Making you feel the need to check in on your character to make sure he hasn't been murdered or generally bamboozled.VOIP is a good feature in this game as it allows you to try to build relations using your own charisma. It doesn't always work and most people will attack you regardless but there have been a few times where this has saved my life and the player taught me more about the game and how to survive. Thanks Luke! )The most intense moment that I have experienced so far I saw 2 people meet up in the middle of the field about 50 yards away as I crept through the high grass (naked as you start the game). One man was naked and the other was fully clothed and in a red shirt. A few tense seconds passed and it felt as if the 2 were friends. Suddenly the red shirted man shot the naked man and looted his corpse. I was slowly approaching but then realized I had to get out of dodge. I crept away silently and cried myself to sleep.Rust is coming along nicely but still has a ways to go to be ""THE SURVIVAL GAME"" of the century.Early Review 74/100Pro'sGraphicsGameplayYou can troll people.Con'sUI can be tricky some of the items feel hidden or less obvious such as the crafting button which is 50% of the game.Trolls.",Rust

2014-02-02,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,Was really looking forward to this game players are you cant even find supplys without a random player shooting at you even if you have hardly anything I played for two hours out of those two hours I got shot several times just out of randomness Each time having to restart from scratch because you don't respawn where you were killed making it incrediably hard to find your shelter again unless you have a sleeping bag which requires wool which requires you to kill animals how am i suppose to kill an animal with a rock that keeps running away? While playing I played on two different servers which had hardly any resources to begin with so as i walked around for along time searching for resources i was getting killed from players and from my hunger because of the little amount animals that their were that I could not kill Yeah I know I've only played the game for 2 hours but that was enough for me to judge the game Why would i want to keep gathering the same supplys over and over again just to be killed minutes later Making it extreamly repetitive. Maybe the edition of death cords or maps would make this game better. I defiantly don't think the game is worth $20.00 as an alpha.,Rust

2014-02-02,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,I know this is an early access game so I am writing this review for the development of the game and ways for the game to improve. This game is a very great game perfect for people who love Minecraft. I first saw this game and it looked very fun and a great way to play with my friends. It has great scenery and a very open environment which I love. The thing is my computer is a decent computer I can play almost all of my games without lag issues (unless sometimes if it's due to MMO internet connection). I have a 500 GB computer with a video card for my games so my games are usually very fast when I play them. However when I purchased this game and I went on a server I was unable to play the game due to excessive amounts of lag throughout the game. I did put my graphics and effects to the lowest settings in the game but it did not help. The game was causing a lot of trouble making me unable to even walk around without experiancing massive lag. I do like this game and the gameplay is fun. And I do suggest this game but waiting for the actual game to come out would be the best option. The lag in this game is very annoying and bothersome so unless you have a perfect computer I would wait. Wait for the updates to come and wait for the early access to end. Wait until the game is updated fully and a game that is fully developed. I think that if you wait for the game to update and solve these issues more the game will be worth the wait.Thanks.,Rust

You never know if someone has good intentions or not. Constant paranoia running away negotiating for your life over voice chat bartering building gathering...One of the best games I've ever played and it's not even ready yet!5/5,Rust

2016-10-01,0,0,849,True,Recommended,Rust is a very unique game. It is not a game for everyone. One person could love the game finding it's all or nothing PVP style exciting while another could find it annoying to get killed when collecting wood. Rust is really what you make out of it and it's about forming alliences with other groups or clans. While solo play is possible it is extremely difficult on higher pop servers (But some people like the difficulty)Rust is a huge investment if you plan on playing on a competitive level. Which can wear one thin. I recommend everyone try it out play solo play with a group. see what the game has to offer. It's less of a survival game but more of a FPS tacked on with a few survival elements.Base building could be better as everyone mustly uses cookie cutter designs to help limited raid loss (If you haven't play this game before a determined group could get into your base and well ruin it)While I personally think I'm done with Rust for a bit I'm sure I'll come back as the developers are ALWAYS making changed and are very active on reddit and their forums.Enough rambling pick it up try it and try not to die.,Rust

2016-10-01,0,0,168,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a very well made multiplayer survival game but... over the time all i find now are little kids with scripts EX recoil cripts damage scripts and health scipts. and ya the occasional person gets kicked by valve anti cheat but there just arent enough people to deal with all the scipt kiddies and valve anti cheat isnt pulling its weight it would be nice to see some more ways to detect cheaters/scripters. Im not saying this game is bad but untill the script kids are gone in sitting on the fence,Rust
2016-01-26,0,0,251,True,Not Recommended,IT BELONGS TO CLANS NOW. Dont play unless you have friends. things to fix make supply signals 100% accurate again.

2017-12-14,0,0,1233,True,Recommended,Great game overall. Servers can be cancerous at times but in the end it's all up to you on how you play the game. There is no storyline and very little PvE elements. PvP is the source of entertainment for this game and it excels at Defense VS Offense strategies. Anything can happen in the game and the weekly/monthly wipe cycle is refreshing especially after you get your base wiped on the last day before the entire server gets wiped. Learning curve is extreme but even the most casual players can find fun in lootingthe map and protecting their base.,Rust

2014-01-05,0,0,152,True,Recommended,I have been having problems playing the game. When I go into the server section I cannot choose one to play. How do you connect to a server?,Rust
2014-01-05,0,0,662,True,Recommended,It's a vert well concepted game with a ton of room for innovation and improvement. Of course it has issues ranging from hackers to visual bugs but this is honestly to be expected in any form of alpha whaever game. Only new and better things can come from it. Community Everyone is complanining about the community. But from 150 hours into this game so far I can easily tell you that this is due to people not giving an effort. The odds of being kos'd upon spawning is very minimal and to avoid this the NUMBER ONE thing you can do is to create a group. Roll with some buddies on your friends list or make some in game. When I went into this game none of my friends played this game I've made friends with some prettty damn cool people since then and I don't even have a mic. It's all about player interaction choose what you'd like to do with it. (Quick note I personally don't experience people who don't have guns out kos'ing me) Fighting Fighting in this game is like no other. It's one of those few games where your ability to kill isn't determined by your gear. In this game kill of getting killed is determined by deception and skill. Many people won't waste bullets on killing a presumabely new spawn. Run up naked rock in hand get close and blast them. In a firefight it's all about the aim. Someone wit the best gear in the game can be killed by someone who has better skill with the recoil and the sway. Housing Making your own base is absolutely awesome!! You can design it however you please and the possibilities are endless. Also you can look through cracks in the wood to see whatever is inside said wall window doorway etc. Raiding Raiding is absolutely amazing especially when they're online. Firefights planting c4 on doors cover fire. It's all fun and very much enjoyable. Sleeping upon logging out This feature is one of the best and most bistinguishable between Rust and DayZ (I haven't played Dayz Standalone yet) It prevents combat logging and makes and incorporates an interesting aspect on base building and protection. How long does it last? (Late game?) Best feature of this game is the longevity of it. It's completely replayable and it takes a while to get blueprints for all of the advanced gear in the game. Extra Features Then there are many more features crafting airdrops etc. which adds to the game and things to do. CONS Hackers Hackers are ruining this game accross the board. Atleast community servers have admins to filter out some of them but it's still an issue. I believe that FacePunch needs to make an anti cheat of their own steam VAC is good and all. But in those days where it doesn't insta ban and just records to ban on a certain day hackers can wreak havoc. Official Server Uptime A lot of the larger Official servers which will have a (Stress Test) to them are very unstable and it's unfortunately the only official game servers that have 200+ people. Can't think of any more major ones. Overall A good game that has things coming for it but potentially game ruining things at the moment. (Mainly Hackers),Rust

2014-01-05,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,Very bad game at the moment I strongly advise people NOT TO BUY this game atm it has potential to be a good game but not yet. About an hour or 2 into this game i managed to get a few items saved it in a storage in a hut with a door. There are HACKERS EVERYWHERE walking straight into my place and looting everything. There's no use in playing this game right now with these hackers. Servers are LAGGY it gets really annoying. Hard to play with friends because there is NO MAP and you don't spawn at the same area there are many. Waste of my $19.99.,Rust
2014-01-05,0,0,71,True,Recommended,Rust is a game where (if you're playing alone) you must build your house really far the map then for 30 mins gather some resources and spend an hour finding your house when a lagging werewolf has been following you for also a really long amount of time. Then when you reconnect to the server you'll notice that either it has been raided or the server has been wiped out (because of several updates). I really enjoy Rust and altough the community is a bit is actually finding a good server the most difficult part but when you have it it's really REALLY fun.,Rust
2014-01-05,0,0,91,True,Not Recommended,This game is literally FULL OF CHEATERS. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. You spend your time to gather stuff build house etc. and you lose everything in one minute because of nasty cheaters... NOT WORTH,Rust
2014-01-05,0,0,70,True,Recommended,Although I do not have many hours Rust is a fun survival game where you must gather supplys to survive. It is supposed to be a mix of minecraft and dayz so if you like one of thoose or both this is the game for you. My favourite part is The Blueprint system this is where if you find a blueprint and study it you then know how to craft the certain item the blueprint is for. This kept me playing and hunting for more intill i found my m4 blueprint. There is a steap learning curve though so I personally reccomend go watching some begginers guides for rust. Although it is pretty easy to figure out once you have some basic things. I rate rust 9/10,Rust
2014-01-12,0,0,14,True,Recommended,I initially gave this game a bad review for past issues I had with it. I've recently tried it out again and wow does it look good. I'm serious I'm really digging the graphics.I do feel like this game is going places but it would be nice if we could just play it for longer than a few minutes at a time. The servers crash and reset so often it's unplayable unless you play the legacy game.,Rust

2016-02-28,0,0,390,True,Not Recommended,This game started off as a magnificient survival game set up in a sombre atmosphere with a unique art style a huge map with tons of details a building system like no other we've ever dreamt of an unbelievably caring and cooperative community and lots of adrenaline rushes caused by strangers zombies and rad animals. In short it was about primitive men some better geared than others versus nature making friends and enemies along the way.At some point Rust was rebooted from scratch. That made a lot of sense back then because the amazing concept behind the game was being hidden by its modest technical level and the messy code in Good Ol' Rust supposedly hampered developers progress to an ill extent. Getting more features and a better game seemed optimal. This new thing was labeled Rust Experimental.Now two years later Rust Experimental is simply known as Rust. A lot has changed since the beginning of said massive revamp. I'll give you one thing it looks fantastic. It totally does.The negative side? The game has totally turned from a survival to an FPS. The community is now crowded with players who are intellectually uncurious at large they are not interested in interacting they will never ask for food nor will they try to convince you about letting them in to spend the night and they will not cooperate in any way. If any of the previous ever happens to you it will be to kill you and to raid your house. Most of the times they will refrain from using these old tricks and just shoot on sight with an AK 47 rocket launcher flamethrower or sniper rifle with a 4x zoom scope if they are able to. Everyday they stay late at night with one goal in mind use C4 to raid as many houses as possible right when everyone's logged off.People are simply not open to expanding their friend circle and so the hilarious and creepy dialogues and situations that made Rust the best game I've ever played they're all gone. The developers' ill emphasis on military weapons has taken this too far away to the point that I've found myself playing DayZ trying to recover some of this experience while still visiting Rust from time to time to check on the progress of users' devastating mindset and the building system which I still enjoy quite a bit.Some other bad bits that are in no way nearly as defining as the ones above developers are poorly organised and seem to tackle issues randomly instead of as a team developers' progress is tedious to follow mostly because of their lack of focus realism and priorities (although they manage to pull some decent weekly devlogs) performance is poor and seems to be slowly getting worse the building system hasn't received barely any update in a year (bugs are virtually the same ones as back then) developers' only goal in life is adding modern weapons to the point that even this new FPS addicted hostile community is feeling wrong about it procedurally generated maps are losing features for no apparent reason (amazing desert and snow biomes forests and canyons suddenly just flew away) caves have never worked properly and old Rust's rock formations which allowed players to hide build shelters where they'd never in a hundred years be found simply don't exist anymore. Animals have not worked at all for two whole years and they want to have it fixed by June (!). Now let me tell you a story. Facepunch didn't like the zombie fashion they took them out of the game put rad animals instead and took them out again when moving to the new Rust. After that they spent years deliberating about adding NPC hostiles (there are none) doing intellectual work on the topic coming up with amazing new beings that would terrify survivors thinking of refined concepts that would shatter the world as we know it. After all that effort on a paramount subject the only NPC threat now in the game is... guess what. A cannibal tribe? An ancestral monster? A wizard in a tower? Nope a chopper a ing chopper with a machine gun. You still think it's not that bad huh? Okay picture Facepunch staff would be replaced by one CoD mad 14 year old tell him to develop a concept for The Boss of a game like this and give him two hours instead of two years. You and I know even he would've thought of something better. And have I said this game requires too much time? Several hours daily. And also that it includes a few pre gun powder weapons who no one can use thanks to the mindblowing number of guns?There are a lot of minor points I could make too but I'm lacking the energy and time for it.In case you are considering this as an FPS purchase I firmly believe it makes no sense for you to go through the annoyance of building a house gathering blueprints and resources crafting weapons trying not to die at night and moving from wipe to wipe if all you want is to simply shoot down some people. Of course this game allows you to shoot down some people who really care about what they're doing and who're expending a sick lot of time putting effort into building their place which I have come to understand motivates a bunch of people. (Sigh)If you are still going to play it bring some friends from real world and enjoy the bloodbath or simply get abused non stop playing solo.Rust is opposite to what made it different.,Rust

2018-02-23,0,0,3004,False,Recommended,This is by far one of the best games i've ever played. First the pvp is smooth and solid in my 2k hours i have never seen a glitch or bug while fighting another pearson. I love the heli it gives you a good boost to getting a gun or high end raiding supplies. Animals have gone through multiple stages form flying through rocks to being something that can be challenging and dangerous fight deppending on the animal you fight. The base building is the best i've ever played with compared to any game that involves building. The armor has been evened out where is isn't OP or bad enough to the point where you dont even bother getting it. But by far the guns in this game are what made me play so much. Guns in this game are tiered by Early game Mid game and End game. Early game guns are more focused on close range mid range are a mix of close and long range and end game guns are good a close and long range. I usaly get comments about how the game is too grindy about hitting trees and nodes but pearsonaly with the new hotspots that have been being added grinding isn't even one of the thing i remember about a wipe. These are my reasons you should buy and maybe even enjoy this game as much as i do.,Rust

I went down to them feed them and clothed them and told them they could build there house atop our mountian of course they accepted this offer. about an houre later is when it gets intresting me and my group were inside my house and the trio were outside just getting set up so naturaly I needed to stir something up. I took my shotgun and fired at my wall 2 times and all we can hear outside is screams the went something like this ""OH MY GOD WE'RE UNDER ATTACK RUN GET DOWN THE MOUNTAIN!!!"" we had a good laugh at that one but the best was yet to come.The trio came back after about 10 mins we left them to there own devises for about another 2 hours well we pland what was to come.In the dead of night where nothing was happening our posse slowly surrounded the trios house and laid in wait. The door opened as one ran out then two then at last the third closing the door on the way out once they had nowhere to hide we opened fire effectivly killing all of them as they respawned in there house we could only see them typing to me ""Man we need you there are bandits at the house!"" little did they know i was among them. I responded to them ""Sorry I can't help im pined down about 20 mins away."" at this point they wanted to get out and kill the bandits attacking there house so they opend the door guns blazing but what they did not expect was 3 shotgun shells as the door opened it was me they finaly knew the truth.

2018-02-21,0,0,86,False,Recommended,"First stuff the game client and servers run well. There are TONS of servers and players. You can find one with &lt 30ms ping no problem. Gameplay is quick to pick up although fairly undocumented you'll get no help figuring it out and there is no ""new user experience"" per se you'll have to wiki everything. The textures object detection and collision seem just fine and better than most. All things being equal this game is totally worth the price and you can play it endlessly.My complaint(s) I've played most games of this type. After about 100 200 hours of gameplay I'm the first one to suggest that butt hurt victims of my cross bow ""get gud"" in just about any game. I've never gotten to what I consider to be the ""end game"" i.e. large bases heavily armed players using squad tactics etc. I've only ever been clubbed in the head repeatedly while naked on a beach or been able to construct a decent stone or metal base about 10 minutes before a bunch of &lt insert unintelligible foreign language&gt speaking Zerg show up with explosives kill me and take about 4 hours worth of resources.So the game is suffering from a fate similar to most Battle Royale games and I've seen it in the battle arena games too some people like world building and some just want to destroy everything. The ""goal"" of course is to kill the most enemies and ""all's fair"" and so on. But non veterans may be scared away easily by the difficulty in progressing due to the scavengers and the naked player murderers and that sits just fine with the kids who feel mastery on their server(s) because they keep them away.

The devs obviously put a lot of work into making what they put in work and work well. They are slow to add features like some of the other games but what they put in is polished and great.But the true beauty of Rust is in the pure chaos of the player interaction. Since Rust lacks any clear goals there is a wide range of what people do. Yes most of the time you are just trying to dominate each other in a huge match but you'll run into a bunch of personalities just wanting to make the world a weirder place.

The player made skins. Where to begin? What could break the illusion of being in some kind of post apocalyptic environment more than black and neon coloroed hoodies bandanas and weapons with green skulls and flames on them?I recommend Dayz standalone if you want a more immersive interactive and unforgiving survival experience and do not care about base building.,Rust

2017-05-25,0,0,2401,False,Recommended,"After nearly 2k hours I think its time to give an ""official"" review on this amazing game You know your money went to good use when it let's you experience almost every emotion within a single wipe. Rust is a VERY unforgiving game and you have to make quite a lot of hard desicions that's how it's always been as long as i've been playing (very very early into early access). This game have been through a lot of up's and down's but i always keep coming back to it just because of the original vibe you get of this game while playing. This game takes a LOT of dedication You need to be able to sit down and put a fair ammount of time into the game before you get somewhere (ESPECIALLY IF YOUR PLAYING SOLO!). This game is often labeled as ""Impossible"" for playing solo and i always have disagreed with this statment even with this new blueprint update. Playing any playstyle in this game is possible with dedication and effort. It's a challenge and that's what gives this game its jazz. Hackers are rarely an issue in this game because the dev's take that into their own hands and are VERY good at catching people who cheat in this game (I'm not saying you will never run into a hacker i'm just saying it's very rare). I don't like making reviews this long but for such an amazing game I decided to put some time into writing this. I 100% recommend this game to ANYONE considering buying it.",Rust
2018-08-06,0,0,8,False,Recommended,The game is actually pretty fun if you have a clan that can literally kill every person in the server but if you are all alone you can't even survive for atleast 20 mins. So before buying it think about how your experience in the game will be. I advise you to find some friends to play so you can survive longer.,Rust
2016-04-15,0,0,89,False,Recommended,In RUST you survive. That's it. You can loot irradiated towns hunt wildlife kill other players build houses and bases and raid other peoples bases. The game goes downhill once you've built an amazing base with ample supplies because everything is already handed to you on a silver platter. However with each server wiping the map at least once a month you're forced to start all over which can be positive for some who are tired of being OP but negative to others who had a good base going at the time. All in all RUST is great fun with a friend or two and I'd recommend it to survival game enthusiasts. Watch out for the helicopter!,Rust

2017-08-23,0,0,1113,False,Recommended,Rust is a game that is always changing. Some decisions are hard to live with and some are easy to live with.This game i would recommend cause it will give you a life experience in the gaming industry not like any other.This game forces you too have goals and work hard to achieve them. Trains you to forcefully practice your skills in Pvp or Building or else someone else will take it away from you.As in all other games people will be using Racial insults trying to get to you by bullying you. People will be salty and mean. My advice is to answer to those people by using nice words and not lowering yourself to their level and stay a good sport.This game will and always will be in our heart for the ones that have been with it since the beginning and we all apreciate the developers that kept this going and never gave up to achieve at the stage it could leave the early access stage.Love Rust and would recommend to everyone.,Rust

2016-12-26,0,0,283,False,Recommended,Now that the game has finally left early access I can give it a full review. If you dont want indepth information then here is a basic score card.8/10 Multiplayer8/10 Controls8/10 Graphics9/10 Freedom8/10 Crafting3/10 Dificulty 4/10 CommunityOver alll this game is a solid 8/10 minus some toxic playersFor a more precise look at the game I can say that it is rather fun although challenging. Rust is a survival game with a good amount of freedom and a large playerbase. While the game is simple and easy to learn the dificulty of the experience is based solely on what server you are playing on. With the customization to servers PVP can be shut off or limited. If it is not limited in any way then you will have a rough time if you join a server even a week after a game wipe. A large portion of the community is toxic and trollsome but the building mechanics make up for it for the most part. House construction items learning new blueprints and all can be super fun and have a great amount of creative freedom. My over all rating to this game has changed 4 times through its movement from when I started playing to its current and final form. As of now it has my full reccomendation. The only thing I would change about it would be to give players the ability to host a server from their home computers for small groups.,Rust

2016-07-07,0,0,318,True,Recommended,I've been playing Rust for over 200 hours now. What to say?Rust is a game where you spawn at the coast of a big island and you got nothing but a stone to harvest stone and wood. To survive you have to kill animals and use a well created crafting system to craft weapons houses and lots more. You can kill other people to get to their inventory what makes the game interesting but difficult for singleplayers.But Rust offers you great ways to raid the bases of other people!Me and 2 friends for example raided a base by One person playing guitar and singing Let it go from Frozen through the voicechat on the roof of a base. The inhabitant lost his nerves opened his door to kill our mate but we were waiting with our bows pointing at the entrance and killed him.

2014-02-12,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Sounds like this game should be great but I wouldn't know because the game is so buggy that i have never ahd a chance to play yet. I hope this company soon resolves this issue or at least formally addresses it so I know what is wrong. If you have a Mac do not purchase this game.,Rust
2018-08-18,0,0,208,False,Not Recommended,Heres the deal this game is great in lots of ways and also bad in lots of ways. The building loot gathering mini boss and etc systems are awsome and unique. Rust is always keeping you on your toes and when your searching for loot and resources you rarely get bored AND when you finnaly get that awsome loot drop from a crate or that couple thousand stone youve been farming for you really feel like youve accomplished something. and with new content bug fixes balancing systems a dedicated dev team and graphics optimizations being added every month this game is always being improved upon. BUT. no game is truely perfect espacially not rust when playing the game theres no system dividing groups of players from solo players and with 95% of the community being toxic scum every group of people you meet will gun you down on sight this obviously isnt good solo players and especially not for new players with no one to play with. With its own unique gun recoil and crafting system the game favors players that hang out in large groups and that have lots of time to play and master the game. every player you see will either have very few hours put into the game or very many hours put into the game thats because those who dont have an unlimited amount of time on their hands or lots and lots of friends on rust will usually be driven away from the game and those who do will spend all their time playing since ethey probably dont have anything better to do (no offense). on top of all this no new official servers have been added since the game's launch and those original servers havent been expanded upon either which means that servers will often have ques to get in and will be laggy for those with a slower internet connection.So. in conclusion. if you dont lots of time and a strong will i dont recommend buying this game.,Rust

2014-05-28,0,0,1352,True,Recommended,Rust is a game about survival. But that takes time. Initially it's just about death. It's about freezing to death and starving to death being shot to death and getting bitten to death occasionally mixing things up a little by slipping on a warm radiation coat and fading faster than your faith in humanity after being stabbed in the back by a supposed friend's hatchet. Sometimes you get gored to death. Other times bored to death. It's not easy surviving post apocalyptic civilisation with nothing but a rock especially when your enemies have guns and double especially in a game that makes you work just to earn a pair of basic trousers...

2014-05-27,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,"Rust is a fun distraction and has the potential to be something great but in its current state Rust isn't worth the twenty dollar investment. To start the review off on a positive Rust has a great sense of humor. The game doesn't take itself to seriously as you start off almost naked with nothing but a rock to defend yourself. I find this immensley funny. Another positive would be that the games world (depending on what server you choose to play on) is very large. Gameplay is standard and nothing at all revolutionary but it fits the game and serves its purpose. On to the negatives. Although the world in Rust is big and filled with wildlife enemies minerals and the occasional ruined town the world often seems bland. This is counteracted by the fact that there are usually other players to play with and come across. This is not a great experience though. Other player unless they are your friend will usually just kill you for no reason. When you see another player you won't instictively think ""Are they good or bad "". You instead think ""I should run or strike first"". Sure it's true that you may occasionally find a kind player but those moments are few and far between. Another complaint is that the game just drops you in with no instructions. This means new players will die alot until they get the hang of. Combine this with the terrible user interface and an ubandance of bugs and clipping issues you get a game that is far from done. But thats okay. Afterall it is an early acess game. I've had alot of fun with Rust but I cant justify suggesting it you twenty dollars. Hopefully in later versions and even the final version my problems will addressed but until then the current alpha for Rust gets a6 out 10.",Rust

If you play solo prepare for hours of hard work to go to the trash. You won't get any progress alone. Everything you will feel is pain. It feels good.,Rust

2018-08-22,0,0,115,False,Recommended,Time for a review!introduction I've been watching rust video's on youtube for a while and when it came on sale this summer I felt like I had to buy it so I did. The game exceeded my expectations in so many ways!visuals The video's I had been watching probably were older because as soon as I joined in (highest settings) it looked so much better. Sadly I had some console like fps especially at some moments so I turned my settings down a bit after which it still looked great!some gameplay My first days were spent on a server with around 100 people online at the busiest point. A friend of mine showed me the way and helped me set up camp and get gear the first day. after that he didn't play a lot anymore but I did and I learned a lot. first shoot people then ask questions never throw away scrap skip the key lock fase and go straight to the numpads (with teammates)after these days the server reset I bought some new games and I kind of forgot I had rust. Until that same friend invited me to start a team with him and 2 other friends. So I obviously joined. The server was pretty peaceful but you still had to watch out. but because we played on a canadian server instead of a european one we were able to get a lot of good gear while the canadians were asleep.We've had to deal with door campers so many times sometimes even three times in three hours but our base survived every raid because we played tactical. So here are some more tips on how to play you never have enough doors is 19 enough you think? no double it! choose random door codes and just save them in some sort of file especially with 38 doors. never go outside when there are doorcampers. ran away from shots and explosions even if it sounds like it's far away. try going on loot trips with buddies you will die at least twice as much if you go without them.community I wouldn't say this community is 'bad' their behaviour is just really defensive because some people will otherwise up your experience. But if you manage it to make some friends it's great. And making friends in rust isn't hard at all with such an active community. I never expected so many people to be online and I also never thought I would have so many encounters in such a big map. I don't know what they did to make this game so attractive but it 100% worked.conclusion This is a great game and I am really enjoying it. but that doesn't mean you will too. I don't really recommend you to buy it for the full price with or without friends but without friends you just shouldn't do it. This game also sure has it's flaws like so few animals. From a technical view this game is pretty good and optimized but I don't see anyone getting decent frame rates on some built in graphics.,Rust

2018-07-03,0,0,178,False,Not Recommended,This game is unfinished unoptimized for any pc build. The gameplay consists of mining for hour's building square bunkers that other players who have build up fater than you blow up said square bunker only to be shot in the head buy a player who has hacked or used mods to kill you.The gunplay is clunky and laggy.The building is basic.The resource gathering is somewhat entertaining but tedious (without modded servers).The comunity is toxic and un monitored.If you like a toxic enviroment that dwells on negitivity and abusive atmosphere then this game is for you.on the plus side it is a least somewhat entertaining with friends.,Rust

I would reccomend picking up a friend or two to make your time in game alot more fun and enjoyable but the game is very soloable. I have so many Great and bad memories with this game The feeling you get when you spend all day gathering Materials for c4 to raid an Enemy you have made or hell even your neighbor and you start blowing through walls until you get to where they are storing everything. You open that first box and you just made the materials back you spend the last few hrs farming for then some. As you load your inventory up to run back to your base your heart starts to beat rapidly you want to keep all the loot you just got as you start running back to your base you see a naked run up to you. In your head your thinking o thats fine he is just a naked as you run past him he pulls out a shotgun kills you and takes all the loot you just got as this naked screams into the mic WELCOME TO RUST! It's encounters like this that make Rust well Rust while its very diffrent from how legacy rust use to be and you dont run across it as much as you use to it's still a very fun game and you pick up some really funny stories along the way. So go pick up a few buddies and enjoy the game you wont regret it. While the new version of Rust can be harder to run on older PCs and can be a bit laggy at times but it is worth it if you know your pc can run it.

2017-11-22,0,0,87,True,Recommended,Rust is a PvP battle royale where the only goal is survival. Players spawn on various maps naked and alone except for a torch and a rock. From there it is mad scramble to find food and resources build bases craft useful items and weapons and above all survive. Strategies vary depending on whether you play alone as a duo or join a group.New players are advised to start on low population community servers with few or no other players on it. THere you can learn the mechanics of the game and what resources are avaible to craft better tools and weapons. This is because official servers are filled with high level players who reside in elaborate well defended base guard resource sources jealously killing new players on sight. There is a steep learning curve to this game but an active online community can help with that. If you like such games you will enjoy Rust.,Rust

2018-02-22,0,0,6481,False,Recommended,This game is great i have logged so many hours which is evidence that it is extremely interactive always changing and is different each time you play it. However with change there is good and bad the bad id have to say in this instance isnt the game itself its the extreme amount of people using scripts hacking ddosing servers aim botting esping and so on. On official facepunch servers this is probably the most common by far as there isnt an active admin group to respond to blatant abuse. Even servers with highly active admins however like rustafied for example its still difficult to get a situation taken care of quickly and unfortunately the quicker the better in this type of game because in this game the time you invest is the outcome of your success time spent building skill harvesting and overall advancing forward can all be taken away from you before you know it which is why this game is so fricken awesome but when someone is abusing using scripts hacks and so on thats when its easy to find yourself hovering your mouse over that uninstall button.,Rust

2017-01-19,0,0,143,True,Recommended,At first I hated this game more and more and more. I stopped playing it completely for a couple months but then I saw a video on youtube of some guy making a Trap Base and thought I'd give it another shot. Started out hating it again until someone random on a server decided to show me the ropes. Got good fast and learnt the basics then the advances. Soon I was raiding making kick strong holds PVP the works. The graphics are nice The sound design works well the amount of weird things people say and do on here will get a laugh out of you. Even the combat has a learning curve that gets pretty rewarding when you get the hang of it. Don't go in especting that there will be tons of online players trying to be your friends and help you out. Its not going to happen Its every man for himself and when yoy realise that then you will see how its a good game. A game thats always going to challange you. A game that will reward you for taking risks and also punish you at all the same. I recommend it if you have mates to play with then its even better. I will say though the biggest nagative I have about it is Chat can be toxic and this game wastes loads of time. Though with all that in mind its still a game that will be the closest you will get to the most hardcore survival.,Rust

2018-07-30,0,0,589,False,Recommended,Honestly one of the best games I have ever played the experience the community and the concept are what makes this game a true success. Being one of the newer players I can't say quite as much but every time I get on and play there is always a task I can do. This game will not bore you even when farming you will be on edge as the unforgiving players on the server try to take your stuff. This game lets you have the ability to make each wipe your own and every single time the server does wipe its a whole new experience. If you love PvP but hate grinding then you can go kill those who do farm and play this game without much grinding at all. If you don't PvP that well you still are in the fight with the ability to blow into anyone elses base and take from them. This game enables anyone to succeed and after you get past the somewhat steep learning curve you will be completely hooked.,Rust

2018-07-31,0,0,335,False,Recommended,My favorite game is rust because of all the cancerous kids screaming and playing ear Another thing I like is the toxic community and salty raiders getting mad over you killing them once. Prepare your ears when you enter this hellish survival game and get ready for the grind so you can build that beautiful base get some ing weapons/armor to actually have a chance unless you are god with the bow and spear. I also like when you drop an ak and it disappears into the void and you get by korean hackers that don't speak ing engrish. Oh man watch out for that zerg of 5 year olds they are going to gank you with their terrible pvp skills and weapons xD. Huge clans being big and thinking they own the server because they grind right when wipe starts and have no life. For real tho this game is very fun solo and with friends I recommend this if you like base building pvp roleplaying if you are that type of person on every base in your area and over all having a good time. People say Rust is dead but it really isn't honestly the only thing I don't like about this game is getting dosed and stupid ing hackers.,Rust

2018-03-03,0,0,1057,False,Recommended,Well after some hours playing it I have to say that for me Rust it is now probably the top survive game side by side with Ark.The game optimization its just great nowadays.The BP system works good and as long as you join the servers when the wipe (full one) is done you always have a chance to fight and survive.Teamplaying can be fun but solo its great.You start with a torch and a stone that you use to gather your first wood and stone by hitting trees and rocks and from there you build your first tools ... with luck you can get them from loot box you find those in roads or shops / monuments and then its all about surviving ... hunting ... and building your base (and make sure it lasts P)Community servers are awesome as they give you the chance to either play in a no team limite server or you can play solo or duo or trio ... There are some Mod Servers too where you can have fun and perhaps try out things in faster pace servers with higher rates like 5x and 10x servers.Surely having fun with this game.,Rust

Surviving crafting raiding and trusting others are a few of the many challenges that Rust provides. Unfortunately this was the old Rust the Rust Legacy. Sadly the new Rust is the opposite of fun cause Everyone will shoot you on sight there is no random encounters where a chat partnership or even a clan can begin out of nowhere. It seems that everyone on the server is afraid of dying so they would rather shoot before anything than risking losing their loot. You'll farm a thousand resources just to wake up naked in the beach the next day cause you have been raided by a big clan that dominates the server even though the wipe was a day ago. Oh and playing solo is a death wish... You'll be headshoted 100 miles away with a single pistol bullet. Most of the encounters will be you with a bow against someone with an AK. Rust was transformed from a truly survival experience into a game that people only seek to be better than another group of people so they rule the server by themselves. Having a lot of members to farm every single rock and shoot every single naked spawned player. "" As I've said before the old rust was amazing but this one... it sucks.

2017-07-14,0,0,425,True,Not Recommended,I have over 400 hours played in Rust. And i went from loving it to hating it with passion . Rust is now stacked heavily in favor of groups/clans and offline rading. As solo player you get almost 0 chance. And with every update its getting worse and worse for a solo player to play. The component system was fine when the loot crates were spread out all over the map giving you a chance to atleast build your house and some protection but now they moved it all to just a few places and roads making 60% of the map pointless and solo players zerged while trying to get basic components . To top that off they remade the resource nodes so now you need to travel huge distances to even find some building basics or make a basic tool. They keep making more Hot Loot zones (like the new launch site) where clans and groups dominate and the solo player can't hope to survive thus making the game even more stacked against you (solo) because while you trying to survive and make your first tools and house groups who camp hot zones are showered with loot and running fully geared and with AKs few hours from wipe. The new twig/ladder raiding also kills any motivation to play .....Top that all up with the worst community you will ever meet in an online game which is being encouraged by devs .... and you get RUST Horrible and nerve wracking experience .,Rust

2017-10-20,0,0,210,True,Recommended,Great shooting and building. It is the most challenging game I have ever played. Public servers will have you frustrated early so I would recommend a low pop server with higher resource farming abilities just to get the building and crafting down. Also keep in mind that even though there may not be a lot of people online at the same time you are because of timezone differences your base may be raided while you literally sleeping in your base. This is the most frustrating part to me I would spend hours farming resources building and protecting my base from raiding and glitching wildlife only to have a large group of people that would get on as I would get off and raid my base...not complaing just saying that this is how this game works. If you are looking at trying this game out I would look into all the more recent Youtube videos from players who play this game and see if the game play looks like something you'd be interested in. I have spent weeks on this game having a blast and then not touched it for a year only to come back to a better looking and running game.

However when installed you are assigned a race and gender based on your steam ID which I absolutely disagree with since I was assigned both the race and gender I didnt want. There are player bases everywhere sometimes with 20 meters of eachother most of which are locked up and abandoned. There are no resources for miles you die of starvation or radiation long before then. Overall poor game permenantly assigned unchangable race/gender and not new player friendly at all makes this one of the worse purchases I've ever made. Am pursuing a refund.,Rust

The servers wipe after a period of time so there is always a chance to be the best geared rust player in the server. I kinda like that they did that because imagne building a base and suddenly a clan of 10+ people who has been grinding on the server for months just attacked you and destroyed your stuff with their overpowerd gear. Well this does not happen since this game has wipes. I Would Reccomend the game to anyone who likes Survival Games and isn't too salty about loosing their hard earned items.Rating 8.5/10Peace.,Rust

2014-06-27,0,0,108,True,Not Recommended,this is seriously how the game goes. and if you buy it you WILL experience this too. you spawn in a server if you choose one with at least 15 people this is how it will go.. if you choose one with 50 or more just skip the rest below because youll just die. anyways youll join the game with a rock a bandage and a torch.. if your lucky you wont spawn near a person or someones house. youll run and hit a tree or a wood pile to get some wood and youll hit a rock for some rescources just to hear the sound of foot steps behind you were a guy will ask you any number of things OR even tell you hes freindly either way when you turn around or try to run he will kill you... congradulations you now are back to square one with a rock a torch and a bandage... lets skip ahead a little say youve been gathering a while you have enough recources to start building foundation and walls... well while your building your building a guy will most likely come up to yo u( whether he only has a rock or a gun) he will most likely try to kill you but this time you are prepared you have made your self a pipe shotgun and you manage to kill him. only for him to rage to his buddies which you dont know about and they gear up and come finish the job.. killing you they take everything from you and they can RUIN your house... they can place a wall in the middle or foundation and make your house unfixable. lets say somehow you have made it further... you have built a house its a couple story tall you have a few steel doors.. and your in your house... and you hear click click click click click BOOM as C4 blows up your wall but your safe cuz there are more doors/walls they have to go through... you hear another clickk clikc click click boom they blew through a wall and now have acess to the majority of the house you happen to have an mp5 so you manage to kill1 or 2 but the numbers and m4s overwhelm you and you die... you spawn at your bed where they are expecting you and they kill you again. now yo uhave to wait 5 mins before you can spawn at that bed again so it spawns you randomly in the world somewhere... meanwhile they are looting your house of EVERYTHING and you have to find your way back to your house. which when you get there you have destroyed walls and absolutly no supplies... so basically back to square 1.... so if this sounds like your kinda game then go for it,Rust

2014-02-15,0,0,369,True,Not Recommended,"I previously had a positive review for this game and I wish I could still leave one but I was falsely banned from the entire game. When I inquired I was told by a dev that their anti cheat had detected a ""known cheat engine"" on my machine though the only things I had downloaded in the last month were steam add ons for stuff like Civilization V. I asked what they found so I could delete it as I loved the game (My hours prove that...) and got no response. I tried asking several more times to try and maybe repeal the ban but they never responded. Thanks Facepunch for banning me from Rust.",Rust
2017-01-15,0,0,285,True,Not Recommended,"Entire review is based on my opinion just like any other review out there.This game is absolutely horrible. I've been playing this game on and off for about 3 years now. Everytime I come back to the game I wonder ""When the hell are they going to finally fix and release this game?!"" Everytime I come back they change aspects for the most part make the game worse. For example they added a new leveling system that doesn't involve going to special locations to get blueprints. Instead barrels are scattered everywhere. Why does this suck? There's no more special landmarks in the game that mean anything anymore. The dome is no longer a constant warzone between the biggest clans in the server. Everywhere there's noobs middle schoolers running around looking for nakeds to slaughter because they're bored.Does anyone remember the glitchy animal A.I. that can somehow running through rocks and walls? When it's not running in walls it's running in circles. Does anyone remember that glitch from a few years ago? Yeah it's still here!The community also has gotten more toxic. Anytime you mention any of the bugs or glitches and how the devs are never going to fix it people attack you. It used to be they would agree but now they're stuck in a constant state of denial and their response always is ""They're fixing it just look at the Dev forum if you don't like the game then just leave.""To anyone looking to buy this game. It will be a fun experience phase for you for a week then you will get bored and tired of the glitches and regret buying the game. Save your money and pass this one until it's fully released.

2014-02-23,0,0,101,True,Recommended,If you like survival games in general I suggest trying Rust. It's a pretty cool game and will be even better as patches come as it's early access.Just like in WarZ(Infestation) Day Z Nether you get killed on sight many times. You can get robbed etc.That's part of the game if you can't handle it you probably shouldn't play any of the survival games I mentioned either.But if you get past that and maybe play with a friend or two you can build really awesome bases help people or hunt them.7/10 I guessAnd with every patch it's getting better,Rust

2017-01-04,0,0,240,True,Recommended,This is a great game but it requires a bit of a thick skin. By this I mean you will die people will wreck your stuff large groups of highly geared and skilled vetrans will chase you around and kill you again and again while mocking your manily hood and your mother. But you can and will survive and the moment where you camp outside the door of one of your past murders and take him out with a spear to face will feel great. Besides pvp the building and crafting aspects of the game are pretty interesting there is a learning curve though and I would suggest to anyone thinking of buying the game to watch some you tube videos and and save themselves a few hours of trial and error.,Rust

Trust is hard to come by and betrayal is an unescapable reality of the game. There is a lot of grinding but it always ends in one of three ways 1. It pays off you raid and have a great time on others.2. You lose everything you spent the last 6 hours grinding for.3. You accept your life as a filthy roleplayer and live vicariously through the others that are much better at the game than you.It will make you want to die but you'll have some fun dying. 11/10,Rust

2018-07-01,0,0,2255,False,Recommended,Reasons why you should not listen to most reviews This list mostly contains subjects what most people come down here to complain about 1. Listen dont listen to people that complain about how this game has changed since legacy. Those are some guys that cant take change in and like to say i played in legacy for some clout. And i dont understand why they write crappy reviews even thought have 2k hours.2. Most people that write bad reviews have under 500 hrs and if you are reading this and thinking about buying this game in all honesty that is not a lot of hours for a average rust player3. New player spawns on beach and looks around finds some funny guy screaming the screaming guy then he hits the new player in the head and the new player dies. Exits out and writes a comment about how bad the community is. In my opinon metting some weird guy and also funny guy is so funny to me cause it brings out the role player out of me.4. Zergs are i have to admit kinda a issue on some severs but overall they mostly like to stay on these severs Rustopia Rustified and mosty rusty moose which are where most zergs play. Yes you will run into clans 3 or 4 players against 1 player but over the time you play this game where you can meet new freinds like most people i play with all come from ingame voice chat.,Rust

2018-07-01,0,0,404,False,Recommended,Was lucky enough to get into the game with a good group of friends from the start and then put in essentially all of my playtime in one go. Had an absolute blast for those 400 hours however the game has and continues to change immensely since then. Facepunch is currently experimenting with features like a map that shows you exactly where you and monuments are on the map at all times and an on screen compass which I find really ruin a lot of what I found compelling about the game. That being said they are extremely receptive to feedback and criticism and put out regular dev blogs even all these years later.Even though I don't agree with some of the feature changes the game has constantly improved both mechanically and visually. Building is The current price of $10.00 is an absolute bargain for how much one can get out of this game.Compelling building mechanics that encourage strategy satisfying PvP that encourages player created endgame events like raiding espionage faction politics and all out war and new emphasis on dev created PvE/PvP hybrid events means there's more than enough to keep you busy.,Rust

Then he pulled out a spear and I freaked out and barley managed to kill him with a hatchet. After 100+ hours I was a little more aware off how to survive in this harsh landscape but whenever there was a player near me and I was holding anything valuable I was more scared than in any horror game. And now I don't even flinch when taking the lifes of others who theaten me. I wound strongly recommend that you play on a server with low population if you don't have anybody to play with.I am scared of what I will be like after 1000+ hours.10/10 would turn in to a heartless monster again.,Rust

It's hard to put into words just how great Rust is you really need to experience it for yourself. There aren't any other games that feel like there is a true THRILL to surviving. Not many games punish you and yet remain user friendly at the same time. Rust is such a strong balance of strategic creative and challenging. On top of that this game actually updates every. Single. Week. (I'm looking at you nearly every other survival game on Steam) And the updates are always beefy. I haven't been disappointed yet by anything in this game except for maybe the amount of people who think 'shoot first talk later.',Rust

2017-11-23,0,0,17,True,Not Recommended,As a Survival game enthusiast I thought it would be right up my alley and I'd meet some friendly people to build a base with..I knew for sure there would be some 'foes' on the servers but thats part of the fun right? Boy was I wrong.. The first time I spawned I woke up without anything (which I thought was normal). In actual fact someone had robbed them off me (this happened more than once). This was cool until every time I encountered someone they would say they were 'friendly' and then me over once my back was turned. This was also ok. Once I decided I should just kill on sight (and contribute to the problem) I'd last about 10 minutes before being shot by someone with a Bow or Gun..I turned to the server chat to ask anyone if they wanted to team up..I was then told to 'get better' 'kill myself' and 'get cancer'...For just being new to the game. The game itself is beautiful the mechanics are tight and the idea is amazing but the community is horrific frustrating and downright immature.Save yourself the stress.,Rust

2014-12-25,0,0,1716,False,Recommended,I have almost 1300 hours in this game and have played it since legacy. I recommend this game to anyone but this review is mostly to express my worry about the direction it is heading.It seems like every update since late last year has been to improve the quality of life of large groups. As a small group or solo you will likely have some basic stuff within two days of wipe. However large groups will already have everything they need and will be raiding all their neighbors. The servers die quickly due to that mostly. Also if you only have time to play 8 10 hours a week then this game is not for you. There is a grind aspect that requires a lot of time investiment and the fact that you are likely to get raided by larger groups rather rapidly it makes that time investment important. The more you play the more crap you'll have and less likely you'll get raided because no one likes an online raid.In another six months this game might just be unplayable for the casual or solo. It's still a great game though. I just go into knowing I'll get a day or two of fun and then pooped on and eliminated by a large group after that.,Rust

2016-11-12,0,0,2236,False,Not Recommended,"I think it's safe to say I have played Rust for a little while ... I have played solo duo and in groups. I have played on official servers vanilla servers modded servers PVE servers and I have run a few of my own servers. I have also bought more skins then I think I should have.I played through the blueprint system the XP system and now we are into the scrap system.The scrap system is a grind just like how the XP system was and it sucks and we are still waiting on rideable horses We got boats .... because that's useful on land where most of the gameplay takes place..... They had started on a sedan that was quickly forgotten about but admins can spawn them in Good luck finding one who will though.If you want to build bases and raid people then Rust is exactly what you are looking for but have fun grinding for work benches and everything else you need in order to fulfill your raiding desires ... But if you want a game that has more then I suggest that you look else where because Rust has zero quests or missions to do and has absolutely no story what so ever. Rust has server events that only fully geared/grouped players can take part in unless you're on a dead server If you are playing solo on a higher pop server your only chance at getting guns is to grind/slave/gamble for them or get lucky as and hope you don't get ambushed and taken for everything you have.I also don't think the Devs play the game because if they did they would be working to balance research costs weapon damage clothing/armour protection hunger and hydration base upkeep and adding land vehicles. Instead they are spending all of their time adding in useless like the up coming L96 and slot machine.This brings up another point it seems like every other month one of the Devs is going on holiday when they aren't to busy jerking off Imagine if these guys would smarten the up we might actually have a full game by now but nope they have in hand to their next holiday spot.A lot of people will say ""Oh you don't know what you are talking about"" Then how do you explain Devs teams the same size as the one working Rust who have made full games 10x the size of Rust in half the time!?!.... There are games being made by only one or two people that have more done then Rust..... And I know from experience it doesn't take 4 or 5 months to make a game ready model because I can grind one out in under a week and a handfull in a month.In its current state of development it is not full game release ready and should only just be entering ""Early Access"" I blame Facepunch for their poor work ethic and I blame Steam for allowing it.But whatever I have done my time in Rust and finding a new game to play is long overdue Besides the Rust community is toxic as and is highly unlikely to ever change.",Rust

2018-08-02,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources the entry level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign. I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance so when you're spotted by an idiot you'll start hearing the talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer they get louder and more confident and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.,Rust

2018-08-19,0,0,205,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I've played the game in bursts from January 2016 up to now most of the time as a solo player. Trust me It's a game that gets the heart pumpin fast. I find it more of a suspensful game than a survival game. Nowadays Rust feels more like a full time job than a way to relax and have fun.That being said I strongly recommend you play this game with a friend it is so much better that way. As a solo player it gets boring and makes you quite paranoid that anyone could be lurking around the corner somewhere. But with a teamate it can be a good laugh especially with some of the people you come across on this unpredictable game.In addition to that Rust I find is a very funny game especially on servers like combat tag where you can talk face to face without worrying so much about losing your stuff. Sometimes I laugh uncontrollably from the things that come out of these people's mouths. Of course as we all should know the community is very toxic but I've made plenty of great friends on rust. Sometimes there are s and sometimes there are some pretty chill dudes who just want to have a good time.Taking all this into account I recommend getting this game especially taking into account that Rust is constantly changing with weekly updates from the devs and much more.,Rust

On top of the community and little content in the core gameplay The game ""features"" include no offline base protection and sleepers (your character stays in the server upon you logging out) meaning other people can raid your base and kill you if you don't have 24/7 to babysit your base.

To the point if you don't hack you don't stand any type of chance. People will kill you over and over just for the hell of it. It doesn't matter if you hide they can see and shoot through walls. You can't run the hackers can fly.Then there is the kids 12 yr olds love this game and they love screaming in to their mics. There is no mute. You will need to remove your headphones or turn your speakers off.If your lucky you will eventually get a weapon that can shoot some sort of projectile whether it be a bullet or an arrow. However the weapons system is so glitched you will die trying to aim at a lagging target. But it never fails the hackers will turn around and head shot you. You damn near have to hack in this game otherwise it's time wasted trying to do anythingI read on Rust wiki the game made 50 million dollars. It seems like management could pay some nerd minimum wage to watch the official servers and kick the hackers. It makes me wish I would have gone into coding. There isn't much product no management and the game overall is . Looks like some coding intern made it.I look forward to the day a company puts out a good MineCraft meets a First Person Shooter survival game and gets it right. There is potential there. Maybe some day I'll try again once the game comes out of Alpha. For now I'm throwing this game in the trash.,Rust

2014-06-26,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,"This is a decent game... when you're alive. I bought this game in hopes that a few friends and I could go into a server and build a little base together. Finding eachother was very difficult because you spawn in different places on the map and the map is fairly large. Once we found eachother (using maps we found on the internet and using landmarks as guidance) we were able to build up our base which was pretty fun. Unfortunately pick your servers wisely because there are a lot of people out there who seem to ""run"" certain areas of the map. We spent hours building and fortifying our base only to find out that when we woke up the next day that we were all dead and back out in the open far away from eachother. This happened about 3 times (in different servers) so we ended up giving up on the game.",Rust

2014-06-26,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game so far although I haven't played too much of it yet. It feels fresh compared to Minecraft. Before I say anything else however I just want to let you know THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA! So do not buy it unless you're okay with some features being broken. Once the game became unplayable for a few days. So think hard before you buy it but if you're okay with work in progressy games I suggest you buy it.Fresh. That's the main word I think of when playing. It looks so mucb like Minecraft on the outside but in fact is so much harder and so much more pleasing if you know what you're doing.First of all I suggest you play this game with friends as it will help the experience and make sure you don't get killed immediately. So if you can get some friends to buy it when you do that's perfect. However if you can't do that try to make a friend on the community page for Rust and see if they'll play with you.Voice chat is an interesting feature in this game and works pretty well. You will run into the people who scream curse words in your face as they kill you but if you don't like this I'm pretty sure you can turn off voice chat in the settings.Now on to the community. Now although I have ran into nice people who want to team or leave me alone many are idiots who as I said earlier will scream curse words in your face as they kill you. But if you want a nice group of people to play with there are many small servers out there that will be good to you so just try to find the perfect server for you.Overall it's tons of fun with a semi high learning curve so if you do decide to buy it try to find a good tutorial online of how to survive and it will save you many hours of trouble. But if you can handle all that I've said above go ahead and buy the game it's awesome.,Rust

Of course they need to change ""zombie survival"" to ""stupid mutant animal"" survival.

I've ran in a horde of rock wielding cave men and fought men with guns or even just to fight over a pig or two. It's a little like Rags to Riches. You start out a literally naked man with just a rock. Scavenging cloth and other items and gathering meats you become a real survivor. Eventually you'll find guns and advanced gathering tools and kevlar armor dominating all who disbelieve in your authority. It's a hell of a ride and is playable with or without friends.

2018-08-27,0,0,398,False,Not Recommended,"I've played Rust ever since Markiplier played Rust Alpha back in 2014. I've seen this game go through dramatic overhauls controversial changes and thought a whole lot about exactly why I hate this game as much as I do. And yet despite all the terrible things I hate about it and about the developers' decisions I still love the core gameplay and want to continue playing it.Rust is a survival game. But if you take a look at the community today it's clear that Rust has gone from a game about surviving in a harsh environment to a game about surviving from other players. That was probably the most significant shift the game went through and it happened gradually.Here's a list of most of the things that I dislike about Rust. The controls are clunky at best and at worst just bad. The game is terribly optimized and has long load times. You WILL lose all of your progress either to other players or a server wipe. You will be repeatedly killed over and over by toxic scumbags who have better weapons than you. You will spend hours and hours and hours getting resources only to have it stolen by a group or clan with more combined free time than you can ever hope to have. You will die a lot and a large percentage of your deaths will be from PVE t not because somebody was better at PVP than you. The developers do not listen to feedback and make extremely questionable decisions such as purposefully removing or omitting features for the sake of ""realism"".Despite all of that I still love the core gameplay of Rust that was introduced in 2013 and I encourage you to go watch the First Day trailer that convinced me to buy the game.The problem is that Rust tries to be both a Sandbox survival game AND a PUBG style pvp deathmatch game. It just doesn't work. However I will continue to adore the Sandbox Survival side of Rust and I hope that the developers see the potential that is being wasted by the direction this game is heading.",Rust

This is a survival game. Read the descriptionTHE ONLY AIM IN RUST IS TO SURVIVETo do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter.

2016-12-22,0,0,121,True,Recommended,Based on my experience the game satisfied me quite suprisingly. The mix between the thought of possibliy dying in a server full of mostly hostile players and the thought of probably the next time you go online someone had raided your base and killed you sets of a strange but satisfying feeling. I think it's because the feeling of what might happen to you gives that 'up' feeling while playing. I reccomend playing this game with multiple friends so that you'll start of great aside from that you have protection. It's like prison you have to join a suitable group to hang in the line of survibility.,Rust

2017-02-14,0,0,974,False,Not Recommended,EDITED 7/5/18 I have waited for a few end of month updates before griping but I guess I will now complain. Linux build has always worked reasonably well for me at minimum and generally it was just shy of perfect. Naturally since actually releasing the game it is unplayable. I have learned that I am not alone so I feel justified amending this as the game is as of now for me suddenly unplayable. And it does not seem to be a problem that anyone cares about.Rust is either a survival game first person shooter role playing game troll's paradise or a clusterfleck of creative stupidity depending upon who you are and what you want out of it. It's more or less a sandbox that nurtures a style of play but it rarely constrains from playing using other styles. Despite the reluctance to label the game in part because that reluctance is what makes the game so uniquely interesting the fact is that you cannot avoid it being a shooter fairly exclusively for a large part of the player base. That means you will be shot at. If being shot at is a problem for you the game is likely not for you. Unless you seek an environment where such things are possible you generally will not be frolicking merrily through nature gathering materials. Well not for long anyway. Those that like to shoot seem to detest the gathering side of things so they are happy to allow you to do the work for them and work on their shooting.The player that simply can't engage in this sort of interaction is the sort of player that will be unlikely to find a niche in Rust. While the teaser from the developers remarks something along the lines of 'your only goal is to stay alive...' the reality is that it couldn't be farther from the truth. Dying is little more than an inconvenience. And often the greatest moments in the lore of retribution are born from a willingness to take a few .556 rounds on the chin. The message here somewhere is that mixed in amongst the serious shooter fellas that live to plunk anything moving are those that thrive on aggravating the serious shooter by mocking them relentlessly and resurrecting themselves to repeat the act until eventually the shooter realizes that he has gone through a pile of ammo to shoot at someone that seems to enjoy it.Such is life in Rust. or Death. I don't often review games and this honestly is a hard game for me to play regularly but I've put some time into it because it is for someone who grew up with the 2600 and Coleco just such a unique game in its diverse ecosystem of lunatics and tacticians. And despite the intermittent nature of my interest in the game all in all I'm not sure I've gotten better value out of a game. Even simply observing the development process and weekly updates is worth the price of admission.,Rust

If you have troubles to get started on a vanilla server try to find a modded server with more reccourses loot no Blueprints needed etc. It's simple as that.If you're completely new to the game find an empty server to figure the mechanics of the game or even play on LAN.Also if you dont understand the wipe system and you go into a full server after like a week of the wipe it's very easy to get frustrated. Don't do that except you exactly know what you're doing. Or you have friends on the server hooking you up.The build and craft system is the best I ever experienced and if you get the hang of it you can easely buld a starter base (1x1) in like 30 seconds.

2015-12-21,0,0,76,False,Recommended,"THIS GAME IS PURE CANCER and is steadily getting worse. Currently it is not worth buying. The community consists of possibly the most cancerous filth in existence more so on any competitive server. The cheater problem has improved slightly but is still a big issue. Many players play for the singular purpose of causing maximum grief. They would rather camp your doors for 6 hours run into your turrets for 3 days straight to drain ammo wait all day to offline raid your base and all around grief you than play to have a good time. Mountains of trash are also talked non stop regardless of circumstances. There are non stop accusations and crying. Everyone is a "" "" ""scripter"" or ""cheater"" for simply killing someone. Even server administrators are cancer with false or harsh bans but I understand why with this community. The developers have habits of fixing what isn't broken breaking things and half finished irrelevant updates because they would rather listen to clueless crying roleplayers on reddit than people who can play well. A less than perfect but fairly skill reliant recoil system was replaced with a terrible aimcone system so any trash can could kill someone and now a recoil pattern with slight aimcone for only some guns that lets anyone become a god among men with easily obtainable scripts. Any step forward is followed by 2 steps back. The current game systems are as cancerous as the community. A simple component system for crafting was turned into a terrible blueprint system. A simple time based base decay system is now an upkeep system requiring large quantities of resources to maintain any base remotely close to large enough to protect loot. A medium sized base will last 12 hours or less before decay starts and a large one may be less than 6 if no one is on to refill it's tool cupboard so casual players are left to live in weak loot shacks. A neglected base decays in a few hours. The tool cupboard used for building privileges and upkeep can be easily griefed. If your base is raided an empty tool cupboard gets walled in and it decays away. A fresh server and blueprint wipe requires at least an entire day usually more to find and learn blueprints for effectively gathering building and fighting and much more time to find everything needed even with a big group. If you want to change servers you have to find all the items again on your new server making switching difficult. Tier 3 items require massive amounts of scrap to research and more for workbenches to craft them. You may need something but the guy with the blueprint is offline so too bad. Normal gameplay feels like you should be paid minimum wage just for doing it. Many groups are now running 20+ deep to compensate for these terrible systems and they do not care about crushing smaller groups. Most vanilla servers have at least 1 group like this and popular servers have many. If you like casually playing solo or with a few friends solo and small group play on big servers is not viable at this time. Unfortunately the game has degraded into almost requiring cancerous zergs of 20+ players and continues to go further in that direction. There are servers with low population group limits or mods which can be fun but these are restrictive not as competitive and are not the true game experience. This game is still and always will be. Edit They fixed it. Everyone is still cancer but the game works.",Rust

After those six more hours I have to say sadly that much of what I had to say then has not changed. Tl Dr Don't get this unless you're fine with complete pvp toxic behaviour and a lot of death.Solo play is not only hard for any new players but will result in death eventually meaning even if you build a sizeable base and grinded your off someone will take your stuff and make you start over. You can just wake up on the beach and there will be swaths of people running around trying to kill freshspawns like you for no reason. Everyone wants you dead and even if you're lucky enough to last a few days someone or some one of the many clans with large towers camped on a nuketown will kill you and raid your base of everyhing you spent hours or days collecting.The only way you just might survive is by playing with friends and getting a gun/armor as well as being lucky enough to not be online raided. The problem stems from the fact that guns are locked by either the massive radiation from nuketowns where they commonly spawn and the campers already with guns who set up base there or the random drop blueprints. Not to mention the fact that for the most part players don't actually interact with each other unless they are also low level so joining a clan is unlikely. I don't know about the more experienced players but it feels as though the stars have to align for you to even begin to progress to end game. I guess I can't say this game is terrible because the premise is still really appealing but the gameplay has become so inseperable from the list of things wrong with this game. If you came for the crafting and long term exeperience go get minecraft save your money. If you like complete pvp and don't mind dying a lot get this game.",Rust

2018-03-04,0,0,119,False,Recommended,This game is very fun at times when you either have friends or some decent loot to begin with. But when starting out in the game in a community server unless you are extremely lucky and get tons of loot without dying from spawnkill its pretty much boring unless a friend gives you loot or such because being a starter with just a rock and a torch leads to easy kills and many people write bad reviews because of it. I think this game is very fun even if there is a very toxic community there should be some changes made to the game preventing spawnkilling but not to destroy the PVP base itself.,Rust

My final conclusion is it's fun but i'd just keep waiting for this game to get better and cheaper.,Rust

We used to mostly spawn in like an esturary beach area on the map and thered be plenty of loot and to get. You could actually PLAY THE GAME as soon as you logged in but the freakshows who use reddit decided that wasnt good because theyre all fat stinking neckbeards who want to play 24/7 without seeing another player until theyve build a massive off fortress with their team of 100 people so then they can go out seeking peolpe with a 2x1 base so they can them up epic win style.Redditors said ""oh pking newmans for their 100 wood huh? huh?"" and actively moan about it on reddit. the problem was that the majority of people who killed newmans for 100 wood at the time... were other newmans just playing a different start up strategy. There were different ways to play the game when you started and that choice made it fun and interesting. Now you can only do one thing farm wood and hope you dont get shot by some bored bandit player. Maybe it would take 2 or 3 attempts to get decent stuff without dying. That was part of the game and also kept the beaches full of players so starting wasnt boring. Now instead you can only farm because theres no newmans to pk or any other alternative starting gameplay then after a couple hours you build your house log off wake up the next day to find yourself raided by the biggest clan in the game because that clan had literally nothing else to do because it became so easy for them to dominate the game as the game was purposely biased towards massive clans of organised nerds rather than normal people who just wanted to play for funThey tried to make the game fairer for newspawns but made it a lot ing worse. The adding of the sashes for people with ""weapons"" aka a ing stone hatchet or wooden spear etc was one of the worst ideas. Tricking and being tricked and the element of surprise and uncertainty was another thing that made the game actually fun. When they added the sash you just had numb skull clan members headshotting you from the roof of a building and running down to collect what they wierdly thought would contain ak 47s and rocket launchers. just because you had a sash on.Facepunch made it very difficult for newspawns to find friends and that caused a huge deteriation of communities within servers and ultimately lead to most people playing to either be sweaty nerds in 20 man clans or irritating 12 year olds with a combined server IQ of 41",Rust

2014-03-15,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,Its a fun game yes it's what everygamer wants a crafting zombie survival game.its definetly worth the price considering its still in early development BUT There is only 1 map and honestly they could have added like followers whereby you can add friends and spawn next to them but limiting them to a few friends ONLY Crafting is okay but seems to basic And the map has not many structures and even if you were to find one playing in a multiplayer server with over 20+ 30+ you would get killed instantly if you go to areas with good loots.Furthur more as i have stated you cant make friends and even more if you want to meet your friend it'll take hours cause the map all looks the same along with the hunger building houses can be easily destroyed within a day of not logging in cause it takes a 100hit for a naked guy to break your wooden door and a pickaxe to break a metal door also making friends in the game is nearly 0 though people may give you items and ask you GTFO Yes there are kind people in the game but i can assure you 70 85% of the people wont spare you even if you're a naked guy with just a ing stone.AND MOST IMPORTANTLY they said creating a alliance BUT THERE IS no proper system to assure that if you join my clan i cant hurt you and you cant hurt m IT SAYS 'Create alliances with other players and together form a town' which is nearly ing impossible without proper system to assure that you cant injure me and the same applys to me as well.Its a Decent game But YOu wont live long in the game if you join servers with 20+ 30+ people cause they'll fk you from the back. AND One suggestion to rust developers CAN YOU PLEASE CREATE A ING FRIEND LIST SO YOU CAN SPAWN BESIDE THEM AND BUILD TOGETHER AND LIMIT IT TO ONLY 2 3 AS WELL AS CREATING A ING SYSTEM TO CREATE A CLAN SO THAT A TOWN CAN BE CREATED PLEASE.Hope you're reading this dev's its what most rust users hate the most in the game and if you add that inside i'll play the game for more than 100hours THANKS.

2014-07-28,0,0,1585,True,Recommended,Good game I have 850 hours on the game. This game does not have very good guns but it has very good crafting and building. (Editing after update bellow)They have completely changed the game and put it back into Early Access which dose surprise me because they originally had surprising sales but maybe people where getting bored with the know old version. I have barley played the game because they are still editing the game and it is not very good at the moment. So I do suggest this game but I would also wait a while before getting it.At this time you do need a very beefy computer to play. I am saying rlly beefy my computer just cant handle it. So be aware of that before buying or going out of the re fund policy. If you dont know how to get a re fund just look up on youtube. (Edit After another update)The game is great but huge map i would buy it had so many memories about theold rust thx for taking the time to get all the way to the end of my review.

Mostly you'll end up with stone or bullet in your head however if you're lucky some deer will chew your leg and you'll bleed to death. Or you'll go swimming and suddenly die from cold. Or you can starve. Sometime you'll build a house to protect yerself from ahem danger but on the next day maniac will wait for you right under your bed.,Rust

Getting by on your own will be extremely difficult as despite the goal of group cooperation everyone is out for them selves. Everyone will/ will try to kill you. Everyone will steal your stuff. Your base is never as secure as you think. Oh and it lags more then a dial up internet connection. I would love to see optimizations and improvements rather then pay to play features like armor and skins,Rust
2016-11-29,0,0,388,True,Recommended,Great Game I Absolutely Love IT I recommend getting a friend with this game additionally.It is really perfect who the two types of people (In my opinion) that enjoy the survival games The crowded bigger servers for the bigger fans of PVP that would rather have a smaller base The smaller unpopulated servers for the people that just want to build and build (Me)The community is toxic but you'll only find that on the big servers the server that I spend time on everyone is cool. A main critism I see of the game that it doesn't see much in the terms of optimization and content. It is somewhat true but what I'm guessing is that it just rocks a smaller development team. The game continues the look better and better. It runs much friendlier to ARK and the menu looks better.As it is alpha here are some things I'm hoping to see in the future 1. More building options. As the game does have a building community I'd love to see more options to make more unique buildings.2. Furniture just look above for an explanation.3.

2018-09-24,0,0,594,False,Not Recommended,This game is a heeping pile of toxic trash. It's supposed to be about surviving and building your base. It's not. You do that and you'll be called a role player. Most of the players are under age and many do not speak english. Expect annoying kids to jump on your head. Expect to be killed for your rock as soon as you wake up naked on the beach. Expect to be called names. Expect to bullied like you are in middle school. Expect to gather important items just get shot and lose them all. Then you do it again and get shot again. Expect no one to help you and then call you a noob. The game is complicated with annoying animals everywhere that randomly spawn in your path. The game lags. Guns are less powerful than a bow and arrow. Running from someone and finally making it to your door not be able to get in because of glitchy game mechanics. Die at the door base is raided unless you have air lock. Door campers. Tool cabinets are worthless because people use ladders and twig to climb your base. ANNOYING Kids kids kids and more kids. No one takes the game seriously and just shoots everyone. Have fun smashing your keyboard. There is no reward for acheivents. Blue prints are wiped every two months. Maps are wiped sometimes weekly. You don't level up. Nothing to show for your progress.,Rust

Logged off to a man smacking my house with a mace. Wrote this review. Friend logged on. Told me we got offline raided. this game. our outside door was opened and the inside door gone meaning they must have guessed the codes or if it was the same guy twice he was likely hacking. someone guessed our codes twice in one day. . this. game.7/10 its a good game at its core but it pisses me off more then any other. i'm conflicted with this game. everytime i got something good i would loose it within an hour. the only reason i got to the stage where I built a base was because i found a guy that helped me. on the other hand it can be fun. mostly when you arent getting jumped by some guy with a gun or crossbow from 100 feet away but instead when you are the person doing the jumping. unfortunately all i ever got to kill at the time of making this review were nakeds. if you can handle a game like this go ahead and get it. but if you arent willing to constantly loose hours of work over and ing over again dont buy it.,Rust

People complain about the toxicity but that makes this game incredibly interesting. I have had so many incredible memories playing this game. To having people shouting bad words at me to people wanting to be my lover. This game will make you rage but it will also deliver the reward we all look for in survival games.

2014-03-22,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,"This review will probably change with time.At the current state I wouldn't recommend buying the game. I regret buying early access. But why?1. Devs doesn't seem really know in what direction they want to take the game yet. And some has said they having been banned from the forums for having different opinions(?).2. It has been mentioned (AMA) that there probably won't be any way to see if someone is a ""bandit"" or not. This leading to point 3.3. The gameplay is basically a sandbox FPS (DM/TDM) and the survival aspect if fairly non existant unless you count being shot on sight by every player on the server. 4. Hackers. There has been messures take to fight hacking but they still linger. Build gather and see everything taken away from you in matter of moments by a hacker. And you will probably get banned from a server by having a good aim.5. There is no point playing on a pve server at this point. The only dangers is other players.I would recommend this game if 1. You like running with your pants down with the need to constantly cover your butt. Wild animals are a joke other players aren't.2. You love adrenaline rushes there will be plenty of those moments.3. You are ready to accept that you will be shot on sight no mater how friendly you are. And there is no telling who is a scumbag or not and there will probably never be a way of telling ever.4. Building a base is fun get ready to lose it to a hacker(s) with c4 or by non hacking raiding parties with c4.5. Good roleplaying possibilities.",Rust

2016-11-25,0,0,188,True,Recommended,Dev team is insane. They update it constantly they keep blogs that show what they are doing as well as what the community is doing. They don't always get it right but they listen to the community and make changes once they can come to a compromise. Put simply they are doing early access right.Now for actual gameplay.At it's core it is fairly polished and fun for early access. Guns are challenging to master and aren't just point and hold the trigger *boom* enemies dead. You'll look like an idiot if you do that.Base building is largely tactical. You can make some awesome structures but often you are limited by the meta of building the structure that will most efffectively deter raiders. They are addressing this with updates but it will largely remain the norm.Not recommended for Solo players unless you are actively scouting out for friends to team up with. Playing solo often ends up with disappointment and relocating to a modded server with 1000x resources just so you can reach the end game without waking up and finding your mini base blasted to smithereens.Community is what it is. Like all online games there are jerks. This one allows those jerks to be really in your face about it. Just be prepared for it. One day you will be a jerk right back at them and you'll love it. All's fair in love and Rust except for...Cheaters. Again like all online games there is the occasional cheater. Also again the devs are awesome about doing everything in their power to keep cheaters in line. It definitely hurts having your efforts thwarted by cheaters in this game but it is always worth picking yourself back up....Also 10/10 for the swarms of naked people with rocks having orgies on your corpse.,Rust

2016-11-25,0,0,2246,True,Recommended,One of the best survival games ever created. Still in early access and under heavy development. The Dev's update the game WEEKLY with an awesome devblog and they really listen to the community.My two biggest problems with this game is that 1. Clans run everything and it seems to only be getting worse. Solo play often leads to daily raids and unable to progress.2. Lack of PvE content. The animals are a joke. Bears are very strong but are so easily outsmarted. The pathing for animals will send you into a rage when you really need animal fat and they no clip straight through huge rocks.Even with this issues this is still by far one of the best Survival games available. If you're interested in survival games at all and you don't have this change that.,Rust
2016-11-25,0,0,256,True,Recommended,Like Minecraft on steroids! Love how it updates almost weekly and they keep adding new things to the game.

2017-12-26,0,0,113,False,Not Recommended,"Well it's out so time to NOT recommend this game. Though I DO like some elements in it and it CAN be really fun it essentially boils down to this You log off and someone usually with a big group of players that plays 23 hours a day destroys hours of your work. And by that point you've lost so much you can never hope to catch up in time so you might as well leave the server and find a new just wiped one.OR You get 5 friends and destroy xXxTHEMIN3CRAFTBEAST08xXx's shack that he spent 10 hours building and ruin his day. Hooray?It's either be the or be subject to s unless you want to set up patrols with your friends or play all by your lone self. At which point the game becomes a mechanical chore rather than something you look at your steam library and go ""Hm yeah Rust seems like a good game to play today"". No. If you start playing Rust you better get your on the server or get a friend on the server to grind for better resources and structures the next day or you can kiss all your bye bye.The hard problem is that this does NOT seem to have an easy solution it has been speculated that whilst yes you could adopt a system akin to Arma 3 Exile in which you keep your inventory and actually disappear when you disconnect but this game has attracted a very vocal niche of players that would oppose most if not all changes to the core login systems. Because in Rust your character stays in the in game world whenever you log off ""Sleeping"" meaning that you can get robbed and killed while you are not playing. Whilst this does add to the tension of it there is nothing fun about losing your to ""SasukeUchiha065726"" when you were asleep. Whilst it is not uncommon for games to reward you for playing them this is the only one that will actively punish you for not doing so routinely.It rewards the few that can and want to play it (And only it) constantly throughout the server's lifecycle and punishes those who even hope can catch up.",Rust

2014-03-30,0,0,112,True,Recommended,This is one of those game you love but hate the people who play it. To have fun team up with a group or plan on people killing you just because they can. Or you can play when the servers is empty (good luck with that) to build up your crafting skill up to the level of making metal strucktures and good armor. Then you'll have a chance against humanity at it's worst. They got rid of zombies and replaced them with weak radiactive bears &amp wolves. This is shifts the the attention of sick o's that want to kill humanoids to you.... You've been warned.,Rust

2014-03-30,0,0,53,True,Recommended,This game is pretty addicting despite everyone having a KoS (Kill on Sight) motto it's fun it's a great game but theres just a couple of downsides like when you first spawn you will probably get instantly killed about 4 5 times until one time you run to a safe place and start building and there is a 100% chance of a hacker being on the server so if have to keep your eye out and if you want to gather resources just go slowly and quietly this game is just in aplha too so there a just a couple of MINOR bugs but nothing too noticable. if you want to play this game for fun join a Non PVP server if you want the full rust experience then join a PVP server but get ready to die ALOT at first until you get supplies.

2014-03-23,0,0,5,True,Recommended,At first you will hate and/or not know what to think of this game with that being said let's look into Rust. The best way I think I can describe Rust would be Minecraft for adults. Your main objective is to survive and to do that you must feed clothe and provide shelter for yourself. Once you get a foothold then you start focusing on making weapons and going on the hunt for supplies. To get the full experice though I highly suggest you find a friend that you can have fun with. If you are looking into this game make sure you prepare yourself for a bit of a learning curve but once you get over that this game can eat away the hours,Rust

2016-09-23,0,0,172,True,Recommended,This game is very fun however there are a few problems in my opinion first of all the community is by far the most toxic i have came across in my years of gaming ( not to say i havent found a few good apples tho) secondly this game is less of a survival game and more of a glorified first person shooter so if your into that then i guess that isnt a problem. anyway id give this game maybe a 7.5/10 while does lack in some aspects the game is still in alpha so i guess you cant exactly blame it.,Rust
2014-05-06,0,0,63,True,Not Recommended,This game was very promising in early access but the main dev changed a bunch of stuff that nobody wanted and then abandoned it. I suppose the legacy version is still alright but don't expect any worthwhile development.,Rust
2017-08-21,0,0,215,True,Not Recommended,I'm sad to give this game a negative review but I'm going to be honest. This game has a lot of potential to be a unique survival pvp/pve game but it seems the developers haven't picked up on this yet. I have been following this game for years now giving each new update a far shot at being good. Instead each update released seems to continue breaking the game and further fragment the community. These updates make the game harder to play alone/ in a small group and doesn't attempt to fix the exclusivly kos toxic community. I hope in the future they are able to fix this game so I can give it a thumbs up.,Rust

2018-07-24,0,0,768,False,Not Recommended,I really like rust i do i have played it for a long time but there are a few problems that i just cant get past...1. performance the game runs awfully comapred to others and the devs seem to want to add boats into the game before fixing this problem unless you have an above average pc good luck holding above 60 and thats a big thing with this being a pvp game 2. toxic community there are so many people in rust that play just to ruin your day i understand the game and the fact that you thrive from taking from others thats the point and i understand but when your doing and a fellow naked just runs up and bashes your head in or a fully geard guy chases you for 20 mins just to kill you and take your spear its just annoying3. updates this goes along with the performance tab the devs add so many completely usless and un interesting things in this game its stupid they would rather add in completely usless thing than fix acctual issus 4. no real progression the game is fun and i understand thats what youre getiing yourself into but its kind of annoying when you bust your for 3 weeks just to get it wiped awway its has its pros and cons but thats my look on it rust is a fun game it really is but i cant say buy this game with all the problems it has honestly mainly the performance for a pvp game they NEED to focus on optimization rathger that putting out usless updates for me the game is unplayable and thats with all my setting all the way down and not even playing 1080p i feel its also good to mention i use to be able to run this game just fine it seems every update they put out it just gets worse and worse i hope facpunch sees this becase i miss playing this game i do but i dont have the money to go out and buy a entire new pc (ps i have a gtx 1060 but my proccesor is aids so take what i said with a grain of salt),Rust

2017-09-14,0,0,357,False,Recommended,Cons You know Rust there is a lot of grind and the community is mostly comprised of antisocial psychopats. That being said I am still giving this game a positive review because of the following pros Pros + The MAIN pro is the availability of modded and community servers. Modded servers take most of the frustrating part of the game away. Servers with increased gather rates and Zlevel make the game enjoyable even for casuals like me who can not afford to spend 8 hours a day in the game. Other mods include the ability to teleport to other players set and teleport between your homes erase walls inside your base and pick up tier 3 workbenches (yay to that) voting system to skip night time starter kits etc. Basically those modded servers make the game less punishing less grindy and more fun for casuals like me.+ No pay to win. You pay only once for the game. You can buy skins if you want to look cool but that does not affect item stats.+ Great atmosphere graphics outstanding sound design+ Well thought of crafting system+ Overal balanced gameplay good gear matters but it does not define who is going to win the fight.+ You can build whatever you want and there is a great freedom when designing your base you wanna do a trap base? a roleplay base? a castle? a cozy log cabin? Rust allows you to do all of that and more.+ Devs are constantly adding new stuff to the game fixing bugs and taking the game to the right direction IMO.,Rust

2018-07-03,0,0,781,False,Recommended,I would consider rust a game that can be both extremely fun or a painstaking experience in most servers there is a lot of griefing as you'd expect in any survival game especially to new players whenever this game comes on sale.If you know what you're doing the game isn't that hard in the beginning but getting to that point either requires a fresh server (wipes happen frequently but there's always the search for a good enough random gen map to survive on)my biggest issue is how the game deals with solo players the experience by yourself can be quite boring and tedious and I'd suggest a team of 2 3 people on most serversIn general this is probably the best survival game out on steam and has some good polish on it besides some LOD issues which by god it's terrible if you can put up with the initial learning curve of the game you should be alright.,Rust
2018-06-26,0,0,797,False,Recommended,"Originally meant to be a reply for Kelmont 's review but got too long. (Text is written as if he was the reader)I don't agree. In the list below I'll be showing counterarguments from my perspective in your order.1. Solo might be hard and unsafe but that is why everyone else is also recommending that Rust is a game that is played best with friends. Bows and spears are still amazingly good and doesn't need to get better. They require practise and that's the whole point. Get better get bigger.2. If you have a problem with noncommunicative stranger players then you should try find a specific server that supports people looking for a friendly atmosphere.3. A lot of people still talk over chat. Most likely talk over other 3rd party programs such as discord teamspeak or skype. Again if you want people to talk more find a server specifically made for that or host your own.4. ...Mic? really? if that is really your central negative perspective of the game then you should try doing the above that I wrote still. There are many friendly servers with helpful people all around.You ""undoubtly"" sound like your angry and just have experienced the basic ""after raid feeling"" and you have gotten tired of it and given up.I have had many hilarious experiences with strangers strangers to friends and friends in Rust. Though Rust is fully released they are still making the game better as the great developers Facepunch are. Your target is a part of the community/people that doesn't even nearly describe Rust.You can't change toxic people. They are in every game (Those neckbeards smh.) But stopping people from buying the game is basically going against yourself and improving the percentage of toxic players. (As I'm assuming that you are talking to non toxic people.)Facepunch is continuesly making the game easier for newcomers and creating a more exciting and more skillbased world.There is the old motto from Rust legacy that still stands as we are in the new Rust ""Don't trust in Rust"". They are many types of people in the game. Some will take advantage to your empathy and backstab you. Some are generous and will help you and a few will just be a standard player between the both as they wouldn't come off as a and not putting themselves in risk of getting backstabbed.It is indeed sad to see how newcomers are greeted with getting into Rust without any knowledge in the game and gets insta KOS'ed but that will be enough to have then be able to adapt to the game.The only people that would have a hard time at the game would be high tempered and sensitive people in my opinion.But...*cough cough*There are downsides to the game. It takes A LOT of dedication to get the full experience. Either you play on a modded 5x server that is just 100% KOS or you'll actually have to use around 2 5+ hours everyday. Oh yeah and zergs steamhappy",Rust
2018-07-03,0,0,11,False,Recommended,i would say that this game is okay and the reason why i would say that is because mostly the people who play it are very toxic of what they say and also that i cant get into the servers that quikly and can be slow the thing which can be annoying for new players is that the people who have played it more than them will have an advantage to this by building a base most likley where a new player will spawn and then someone can jump out and kill you. The things which i like about the game is that it can be fun and also has a great adventure and also i think that the randomizer for your character was a really cool thing to do even tho some people might not agree me with me but i think it's cool but i also think about it too much also and sooner or later it did made me feel uncoumfortable when looking at my character because it wasnt what i wanted but it's not my game and if face puch wants to do that im fine with it but i guess because it is a new thing for me having a automated system pick what i look like in game permenatley but i think they could somehow make it pick what you look like randomly but when you die or either go to anougther server it could pick enouther character to have some what of a realalistic thing to it because then facepunch can also have there message across of being a random person and dealing with it but as i said again it isnt my decision to make but it is the game developers to choose what things they should go for in future,Rust

I've made countless friends gone on countless clans and had a blast over all. The only thing i would like is if they made it easier for solo players but keep it hard for clans. As a very avid solo palyer myself i find it incredibly hard to farm all that scrap and upkeep time myself and my friends are basically never on. I do like the workbenches and blueprints alot but they messed it up with the prices and rarity of blueprints. Maybe turn down the scrap price a notch make scrap come in 2 3 for barrels? Like workbench level 1 is good but two? 500. Seriously? Turn that down to 250 or something but for clans make stuff like ak's and bolty's EXTREMELY rare. like ""getting a karambit fade out of a case in cs go"" type of fair.

2018-07-03,0,0,3142,False,Recommended,Rust. Hmm what to say. I love it but yeah its frustrating.If you have some friends it is way more enjoyable. No you don't need a zerg clan of like 15 or 20 to have fun. With 2 or 3 dedicated individuals it is a lot of fun and you can accomplish a lot.For those whining about being killed by zergs go play on servers that have group limits.The gunplay is great the building is really fun as well.If you are the whiny quitter type don't bother playing Rust its not for you. As exemplified by a lot of the latest reviews.Yes you are going to get killed by a guy with an AK. Yes you will probably be naked at the time or just have a bow. There will always be tool bags out there that kill nakeds they do so because they can't kill similarly geared players. Its like this in every game.To summarize Rust is a great game. Fun combat. Great building. To newbies out there i suggest playing on smaller servers (community) with limited group size. Learn how to do things like build a base and then go to the bigger servers with some friends and it will be a lot of fun.,Rust

2014-08-08,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,Updated July 2018 I don't understand why this game is so popular. It had a lot of potential at one time but never really achieved that or anywhere close to it. A lot of the features now were ok when the game was very early because they were simple albeit poorly done but at least they existed. The fact that they are still there is just bad. The crafting and overall game is very uninpsired. The entire game play just seems like the least amount of work or content that they could possibly add then just kept running with that. 4yrs later and there are MUCH better alternatives in the survival genre. Go play those. 2014 review It could be a good game eventually but I think it still has pretty far to go. There really isn't much to do in it yet but build some VERY basic buildings and find a few tools.,Rust
2018-07-05,0,0,1886,False,Recommended,Great game!it's never ending the amount of possibilities in this game makes it fun for everyone. If you don't like pvp u can play pve if you like playing with your friends u can play with as many as u want. If you rather play alone go on a solo only server. It is definitely a cycle but every cycle is different.,Rust

2018-04-05,0,0,56,False,Recommended,"Pros This is by far one of the most intense and amazing games I've played in the last few years. I bought this game 1 year ago on my other account and have played over 350 hours. There is so much to do in this game and is so many possibilities and opportunities to have fun and do what ever you wish. There are modded servers official (vanilla) and community. All of which are fun. If you don't like the PvP aspect and like the suvival play PvE if you don't like the gathering mechanic play times 1000. There are even servers dedicated to Battle royal PvP Times (#) PvE etc. Cons This takes a really good computer to run so if you get bad FPS I'd recommend turning the resolution down to 1280x720 and graphics to Fast. I average 40 Fps at those settings with an ""Okay"" computer.I would recommend this game to every kind of person because there is a game mode for you.

I dont know what it has on it but i always come back no matter what. The gameplay is so freaking good. Although this game is great its really frustrating because you can get raided and lose everything you have also they should make the game less grindy for solo players so they can get the same experience as when you are with a team. ILL TELL YOU ONE THING JUST BUY THIS GAME.,Rust
2018-08-29,0,0,1436,False,Recommended,well I have almost 700 hrs in rust so I guess I'll review it. I love this game. I spend countless hours in it almost every day. BUT if you're going to buy it make sure you have friends to play it with and make sure you have patience. This game will take you to a place with anger that you never even knew existed. It's VERY difficult and VERY TIME CONSUMING. Just because you get good with one gun doesn't mean you can jump straight to an AK if you can even get to where you can make one. IF YOU BUY THIS GAME AND WANT TO SUCCEED FAST MAKE SURE YOU'RE UP FOR MAKING FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH OR HAVING FRIENDS BUY THE GAME TO PLAY WITH. otherwise you're screwed.If you like sandbox survival with lots of players this one is the best. servers are anywhere from 50 players to 450.,Rust

Then under the instruction that a few of my closest friends would hang out and we could chat again I made the choice to buy it. Holy crap I don t know if they named it RUST because that is what your car will be doing while you are too busy playing this game or if your mind will rust from all the naked wangs in your face as you continually get beat down by strangers. Yes this game is amazingly fun. Way better than all of the other survival games I have played. If you are on the fence about this game as I was buy it now. You won t be let down.

It has dramatically improved it's graphics are remarkable I adore when the sun sets because it's just like being there.

This game is to good to not enjoy (i.e. play on emtpy servers or just with freinds.)Rust is one of those games that you will either love or hate. The main reason being is that you will die A LOT. This game revolves around two ideas. Looting and Building. These ideas are supported by one ""Thought"". Killing. Here's a tip for you. Never ever by any circumstances trust a naked man stating that he is friendly. He WILL kill you. Honestly thats how rust works betrayal murder and MANY deaths. But all in all Rust is a pretty solid game when it comes to fun. Especially when you have a group of friends with you. The building is fun the combat is fun and the experience is just hilarious. (AND HORRIFYING)I'd rate this game a 9.5/10 for probably being one of the best sandbox shooters on the market.",Rust

I ve been playing rust for about four years and I ve been hooked on the game since the day I started. 1 out of 10 I would give rust about an 8. And the only reason I wouldn t give it a 10 it s just because I have a very good computer and I run very low frames and I run the game on the lowest settings possible that is the only problem that I encounter.

2017-09-29,0,0,558,False,Recommended,I have to say for the toxic community and crazy amounts of farming this game still seems enjoyable to play. ive heard a lot of people complain about the solo experience of it being to hard or almost down right impossible but to me i just say work harder and practice more. Some people just get salty and put a bad review on the game but the point of rust isnt to be pushed down by a better player but instead get them back out smart them kill them and raid them it might take a while and my not go according to plan but if you have such a problem with the community or someone being toxic to you dont complain and put a bad review on the game go out and get them practice more get more kill them and raid them and maybe even trash talk them because Thats the point in this game do whatever it takes to survive and if you have someone bothering you take care of it either the easy way or the hard way. by the way great graphics,Rust
2018-07-14,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,Just play Subnotica if you want to play OldSchool Rust. This game was fun as a solo in it's prime.The developer continues to make playing solo harder and harder.I have no idea what the developer is thinking they keeping ruining what everyone loved about this game and what made it popular in the first place.Until the developer recognizes and fixes the current meta of the only possible way to get anything done is to have a giant group I won't recommend this game to anyone. I would reccomend servers that specialize in different size groups.i.e.) Solo(1 player) serversDuo (2 players)ServersSmall Group (3 5 players) ServersLarge Group (5+ players) Servers,Rust

2018-07-14,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Overall a good game whwn you play with friends but i can say that it can get very boring when played alone. The server wipes make it to where it's balanced so that no one clan takes over and ruins the server though its an old game so it runs poorly.,Rust
2018-07-14,0,0,1454,False,Not Recommended,Rust used to be fun but at many veteran players will tell you it has gone massively downhill due to an extremely toxic fanbase as well as development updates. Facepunch looks to the future and optimistically talk of console releases and a 'final release' though continue to ignore the massive optimisation issues and buggy gameplay that plagues most every player trying to get ahead in the game. Frequent stutters when entering PvP as well as frame drops and crashing is something experienced by every single player to some extent. This game was far from ready to be released from early access. Not worth paying for full price at the moment though perhaps a t a 50% discount.,Rust

2018-07-07,0,0,83,False,Recommended,Product received for free. The game is very fun to run around in get loot and build bases and go to popular places to get more loot and meet new people whether its in a gun fight or just talking to random noobs around the map. I would only recommend this game to dedicated gamers though because it takes a lot of work to get a good base and good loot and there is a lot of grinding in this game. Also everything gets reset every month or week to allow new players to have a chance. I personally like the 5x or above servers since I dont have a lot of time to spend grinding but overall the game mechanics are great and graphics are great. I bought this game to play with friends and it has been super fun so overall I would recommend it.,Rust

2016-11-26,0,0,132,True,Recommended,Hmmmmmmmm tricky I hate love and like this game all in one . Obviously it's in early access and they are still making this game fully and it's got a long way to go. Yes I do recommend it but I feel like this game gets better with some updates and then gets terrible with other updates. If you like a open world survival and overall grindy gameplay go for it buy this game. but this game does have a lot of potential... lets get into it First if when I bought this game I loved it. I played it for days I recommended it to all my friends and continued playing it. But slowly as each major update came I grew slowly and slowly away from it until I can't be bothered to play it anymore and I'm waiting until the game fixes some of the issues that have been there for the start of the game like when your aiming you gun it's shakes and makes it hard to aim the recoil on some guns are terrible when you shoot it flames come out after the bullet making it hard to see where your firing animals going inside mountains and many more no matter how hard we complain about them they never get fixed. So my issue is that yes it's an early access so listen to the community and what they want fixed so that you can make your game better other than that the game is pretty solid. It gives you hours of gameplay addictive game mechanics while your trying to survive the harsh wilderness of rust and overall a fun experience for you and your friends so finally yes I recommend it but it has some serious problems that need to be fixed. So if you want my advice buy it try it out if you absolutely hate it refund it or if you like it play it and if you sorta like it hold onto it and wait for future updates because this game has got massive potential ),Rust

2016-11-23,0,0,628,True,Recommended,Where should I start well... the game is loads of fun although I dont have a whole load of hours in the game I do thoroughly enjoy it but I find it's only enjoyable with friends. In my case (and many other peoples) this game is only ever found fun with other friends and in groups not many people enjoy the struggle of playing this game solo as the majority of servers are heavily populated and can contain big clans. The overall gameplay is great if you enjoy minig and resource collecting it has that aspect if you enjoy intense PVP it has that apect if you enjoy both well lucky you it contains a very heavy dosage of both. All in all this game is very strategic (base placements and raiding) intense (PVP) and buckets loads of fun! On a side note the level of developer attention is phenomenal as there is wekly updates (every Thursday) and the game has gone through various changes in order to find a sweetspot for gameplay so expect pretty rapid development and a lot of neat ideas and in my eyes definitely worth the buy!

It is without a doubt a more eye opening trip through the deep dark corners of the human psyche than any documentary attempting to come close to the true nature of the subject.

The 10 hours I have played have been interesting though.I get a lot more enjoyment out of watching Ramsey's insanely well edited YouTube videos of Rust gameplay than I do from actually playing Rust and for a much lesser time investment.Perfect for NEETs who somehow own a gaming machine or any stupid LARPer who would end up fighting with ISIL if they weren't playing this. Otherwise don't buy unless there's a 33% sale or something I'd say. Disclaimers I have been playing without friends to help which is probably not as fun. My computer's GPU is a fermented potato which may have affected my ability to engage in combat. My only experience has been playing on a server less than a week away from being wiped. Some notes about my specific experiences I was on an Australian server generally ranging in about 30 70 active players. I wanted to go for a diplomacy and stealth oriented gameplay. * 'Stealth' raids are unlikely to be achievable solo and without the resources. * There are a lot of diplomatic players who just aren't interested in killing solo players or newbies. The immediate response to strangers in a lot of cases is to just throw objects in front of you. This is how a lot of trade ends up happening amusingly. + A very nice chinese boy actually helped me upgrade my base. It was awkward since his only English was ""I'm so sorry "" but I ended up with a metal door and stone walls in the end. * However not all players are diplomatic. Sometimes it's just their way of playing the game and perfectly rational and these players will not take things from your corpse that are valuable to you and not them. Other times especially close to wipe people are just going out of their way to ruin other people's fun and won't actually play rationally. + (tl dr people who play this game can be stupid but powerful pieces of A group of relatively crappy players who happened to have much better weapons than I did killed me while I was collecting wood despite yelling at them to stop. I assume they were going raiding. They took a key to the cabinet in my base (never will I have a key on it again) which made it sort of difficult to continue after logging off because my base would degrade. They did not get into my base as far as I know because it was pretty well secured. I had a lot of resources that they might have wanted. If they had stopped to listen to me I could have been diplomatic and offered them resources very valuable to them and they would have not killed me and stolen my cabinet key which was only really valuable to me. I would feel a bit more salty but they probably saved me from wasting another 5 hours dicking around on a server that was close to wipe. Getting enough scrap to do anything is damn annoying. When your microphone doesn't work you're pretty much dead whenever you see a person with at least as much gear as you. I found a guitar which was pretty cool and a fun way of trying to demonstrate friendliness but it sounded a bit glitchy. It takes a while to end up feeling safe enough on a server to log off and you feel the need to be logging on before your base starts degrading from lack of resources in your cabinet. (Even then someone with a lot of explosives could raid you while you sleep). Rust would be a very different game if this weren't the case though. If I had a week or two where I could play on a Rust server from wipe with a couple of good friends full time without destroying my life I would love to do so but sadly this will never happen.If you read all of this why the hell did you read all of this?",Rust

2017-08-29,0,0,808,False,Not Recommended,This game was amazing with it's novelty but since the past years the game mechanics haven't drastically evolved which left us with a salty pvp oriented game in which you can almost only play with a bunch of people in order to have fun past 50 hour of gameplay. There's also the fact that without communication there is absolutly no way to have safe relationship. Which lead to the problem of having to exel in english to play the game which is something that I've found really blocking. Rust is about a wide generated world where there is no rule it's like a big sandbox literaly. . I would'nt hate seeing RPG content there's alot of room for many idea as I said the game mechanics didn't really improve it's pretty much the same as in the first first rust. Even if I truly enjoyed this game when I played with friend (because alone it's pretty much impossible) I would give this game a 6 at first I would have given a 8 but considering how stagnated the game is well it doesn't deserve more than a 6 for now at least hope this game and it's concept can get further.Edit Oh well playing alone is now even harder to keep up a somewhat hard to raid base you need to grind big ressources to avoid decay to get some somwhat usefull blueprint you need to grind for ing 10 hours straight assuming you're not getting killed too much think about it 10 hour of gameplay to do only one thing breaking freaking barrel that give you 1 metal scraps and then you gotta farm 5000 scraps to have decent equipement and then there's the wipe you ing grinded your whole life on freaking barrel to have gun bewhile you got raided and you didnt have luck so suck for you man good luck for next wipe. Yeah. This game in its current state is really not for playing in solo I don't recommend that you buy it if it is for playing alone you wont have fun for much that optimistic 50 hour of gameplay tbh I'd say that after 25 you'ill be bored asfck.

2018-04-08,0,0,74,False,Recommended,Never play in a highly populated / medium populated server if you're a solo player. You'll just get your kicked by everyone else who's already ahead in the game. Its better to start from a low to zero populated server and learn everything first. Even then you'll still get owned. The game is very immersive you would hardly notice the time pass by as you think of the plans on how to build your base. Unfortunately after a few minutes it'll get raided. It's a PVP game after all so you cant complain. Majority of the players will also kill you on sight so rather than thinking you're playing with people you can communicate with it's best if you either run away or try to kill them. If you're only a casual gamer like me you'll find it very difficult to progress from this game. You will need to grind to keep your base from falling apart and you will also have to keep watch from getting raided.,Rust

You have to get used to it and losing everything. Once you do this game is awesome! Most people say if you rage a lot it's not the game for you. I used to rage a lot.

2016-10-26,0,0,366,True,Recommended,Rust is a solid game. I can say after having played for over 150 hours solo and with large groups. Rust is honestly a lot of fun. However that does not mean that the game is not without it's fair share of problems. PROS Fun easy to understand average survivor elements very large open world decent and simple building system constantly updated and worked on decent graphics even on lower settings. CONS Price of game doesn't quite match the value of the game in my opinion PvP is far too encouraged making it hard for new players to enjoy the game not enough in game activities game is easily hacked. Overall the game is fun and easy to understand however the lack of in game activities and heavy PvP incentive means that most of the time you will find yourself doing 1 of 4 things...gathering building raiding or being raided. Which isn't inherently bad but it makes the game seem very 1 note and dull at times. I have personally found myself bored at times after all the raiding and building is done there isn't much left to do. I spent a lot of time just sitting in my base making metal fragments and organizing my storage boxes. In short I feel that the game needs more PvE elements. Something that will give people more things to do while also steering the game slightly away from PvP while also keeping it an option. All in all I do recommend the game if you're looking for a new survival game with less survival elements. Just note you will be mostly building gathering and raiding and you will find yourself becoming bored at times.,Rust

2016-08-04,0,0,1562,False,Not Recommended,Its amazing how a great game can go from good to bad so simply. I have had issues with alot of the new content since its adaption from Legacy. Some have been fixed others seem to remain as permanant reminders of a game that still in its alpha beta stages. The Devs while capable programmers seemed to have lost sight on the playability of the game for small clan or solo players. Back in legacy there was only one real way to raid a base and that was to fight your way up this worked because damage was focused on a singular path but since the introduction of rockets you can just mow down a whole base from a safe distance and the bigger the clan the more rockets youll own thus giving even a group of three or four people no chance to make a base big enough to withstand an attack should it be raided. Then theres the insta wall im talking 2 story high solid stone or wood walls. Just dropped down anywhere outside a build zone as a baricade for raiders the realism in this is so broken which in turn makes the game broken as well.Then theres the other implementations that come and go like the xp system ladders on any wall able to build thatch within build zones like really thats just offline raiding simplified. All these add up to the devs struggling to balance the game by over complicating it or bringing elements that may seem realistic but in a game just make bad play. Then theres the grinding long before I gave up trying to defend a base I grew bored of grinding for materials. Its not that you shouldnt have to do it but only to get established but after that game play should be directed away from tedious chores and directed to the fun stuff. So why do they nerf the only automation of resource collecting in the game?Initially youll enjoy the game but eventiually you'll get tired of the broken systems the trolls and other menial mentalities that seem to be attracted to this game and eventually like me you will end up regretting having wasted hours of your life feeding a sub culture of toxicity.The devs do their best to prevent hackers but there are so many out there and have made this a pay to win game in a way depending on the server admin try to keep the hackers out but they cant be on 24/7 and in one major server I played on a hacker was a major donator and openly flaunted his superiority. (Yes niglet of Rustralasia name and shame your just scum of the highest degree for ruining onlines games for everyone else)Despite the negatives I have mentioned the game can be fun if you find a server with active admin these servers the Hackers tend to keep a low profile which gives the game a more playable experience but these are rare and youll be lucky to find them.,Rust

Large loot tables gives you very little opportunity of finding exactly what you want making the game about just searching randomly across the island and hope you stumble upon what you're looking for. s everywhere This game is shoot first don't ask questions. The community is mostly made up of mostly people who want to kill you raid your base ruin your progress and move onto the next person. PVP Total garbage. Whoever has the better connection will win 90% of the time. YouTube So many YouTubers emphesize that the fun of the game is only in RAIDS and killing SALTY PLAYERS new players feel like the game is about hating and killing ever single person you see. It's really great.So if you're still reading then let me tell you this under all this that has come up with Rust there is still a great game. It's beautiful the crafting is quite fun and exploring is really amazing. And if you're brave try to befriend a stranger in game have a conversation build a base together and log in 12 hours later to see that your trust was well placed.

If you are alone go to less populated servers first and learn. The game gets updated every week and the developers really listen to the community. Not recommended for people that gets frustrated really easy.

You can gather friends and make huge bases and have so so so much fun playing the thing that made me get this game and the thing that keeps me playing is the loot and raiding. There is just something about Rust that makes your heart jump when you make profit from a raid or get a toxic player out of the area. The only warning i have to the new players looking to buy this game is that this game will take hours and hours of grinding losing everything killing and raiding to do before you really get to know the game i have over 100 hours in the game and have only scratched the surface of what i can do in this game.

This Rust is worth the money and the times it took to make this.Buy it and try it. If you like to just mind your own there are servers.

2014-01-26,0,0,247,False,Not Recommended,This game is decidedly in every sense of the word alright. While the gameplay and content are of high quality and I've been following the development of this game (by the creators of Garry's Mod) since its first build it simply isn't shaping up to be what I had originally hoped. The community is rather toxic and focused on ruining new players experiences and playing by yourself is a sure way to have a bad time. The game is entirely online on individual servers meaning that you generally are forced to play with people who want to give you trouble. There is also a huge host of community made consmetic items that are in a sort of soft lootboxy steam marketplace position that I don't feel comfortable with. The revolution in playerbase attitudes that this game would need to appeal to most people is unlikely to ever happen. I could only recommend this game on some sort of sale but only if the buyer has friends to play with. Giving a negative review after so many hours of sticking around to see where things go makes me upset. That being said I'm going to keep checking in to see if things improve and if they do I will update my rating accordingly.,Rust

2017-12-26,0,0,317,True,Recommended,"My first game in a nutshell. I spawned then was forced into a fight with another naked person holding a rock. I'm proud to say I triumphed and he was no more. I proceeded to make a small but cozy fort conisting of stone. The night was dark cold and mysterious. I then hear 4 5 people running past my small cozy fort. I try not to make a sound I open my small box a few feet from my in game character. It made made an obnoxious thud. I shout. The foot steps quickly halt. I try to remain silent but my efforts are in vain. THEY know I'm here. One calls out ""Who's the stain living in this pile of "" I was undoubtably scared.

2017-07-12,0,0,541,False,Not Recommended,REVIEW UPDATED APRIL 4TH 2018 Please consider this review if you wish to know the most honest review for this game from someone who has a mature ethical point of view for life. Played for over 380 hours and it took me only 25 to realize all this. My score for this game 5/10. Yes score first. Because this game is currently impossible to play. I uninstalled this game about 2 months ago.Pros Very interactive game very fun to play with friends PVP and building creativity can pump your heart with blood and adrenaline. With the naked bodies funny motion movement and the aggression of low quality players the game shows a strong sense of humor especially during PVP. You will lose yourself a lot and get laugh tears during some interactions.Cons IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY UNLESS YOU ARE WITH A GROUP OF 5! With the addition of the new blueprints components and decay it is has become very hard to keep up as a solo player. Especially when clans of 5 20 people roam around the server destroying every fresh spawn/duo/solo they see. You can spend 40 hours farming and researching and then get demolished in 15 minutes by a clan of 10 who split hard work you just did. HACKERS! HACKERS HACKERS! Yes Facepunch doesn't seem to care about the ruined experience in games. They would rather have a couple of hackers rebuying their game due to VAC bans. Aimbot ESP file scripts flying all kinds of things are common and seen daily in almost every server in SEVERE amounts (25% of all players in an official server use some sort of a hack and try to make it less obvious on purpose with all kinds of tricks). It make take weeks for official servers to ban a hacking player. Facepunch spends their time enhancing the design aspects of the game (adding lots of useless items colors trees etc) but not the overall user experience. NO AGE/INTELLIGENCE RESTRICTION IN THIS GAME! You will find A LOT of little kids who will try to chase you with a rock and yell the dumbest and immature things into their budget microphones. If you are above 20 you will have issues losing your temper because some kids will just you off to a brand new limit. There are a lot of immature 6 14 year olds playing this game with poor logic skills who will interfere between you and the excitment of this game. There is a severe use of foul language coming most players foul language that pops out randomly in chat at a critical level literally for no reason (most think it's funny). I haven't encountered this problem even in games like Call of Duty. Little kids and some of their parents think this game is Minecraft but it's not. If you read the game description you will see VIOLENCE BLOOD GORE NUDITY and more. I've encountered TODDLERS playing this game and I am not joking when I say TODDLERS!! Bugs and graphics need to be improved and balanced. As a jr. game developer it is easy for me to tell that the game has an unbalanced rendering system. My gaming computer has a GTX 960 4GB with i7 6700K and 32GB of DDR4 and I temporarily drop down to 20 40 fps when it renders further terrain (medium high settings). This issue happens to many people I play with. I have tried a lot to try to fix the issue even reprogrammed the game and overclocked both GPU and CPU but that didn't do much with this game. I really do not want to spend another $450 for a top notch graphics card just because of the unbalanced rendering. Animations are sloppy and slow (but improving). You will find a 4 7 second delay every time you switch and prepare a different weapon. Getting you killed and ruining the pvp experience. MOST of community members in this game are very salty spicy toxic and mentally violent/ill. A lof of foul language sexual content and violent interactions between players. Something you will have hard time finding in other FPS/TPS games. But you have to consider this when you buy this game and when the game's fan base mainly consists of underaged kids and lazy puberty teens. Other than that the game WAS really fun addicting and made me stay until 5AM.I would NOT recommend this game. I hope it improves because it is hard to play this game with all those issues.,Rust

2018-04-09,0,0,413,False,Recommended,I love this game but I wouldnt if there weren't a few factors. 1. Community Servers have a less toxic atmosphere most of the time. They make playing the game bearable. 2. Some ( Community ) servers dont allow massive clans. Maxxing out how many players can ' team up ' so you dont have a group of 30 people making the entire server unplayable. 3. Ive grown with the game even when they broke core mechanics. It's not perfect and I dont think it'll ever be ' perfect ' but I can see myself doubling my playtime. It's worth the price of admission if you're willing to stick to the weird skill progression. I suggest going on community servers not main servers if you want to actually play. Otherwise clans will murder you wether you started a minute ago or if you've been on the server since wipe day.,Rust

The only thing that is a dealbreaker for me is the playerbase. the whole core gameplay comes down to the playerbase. It is (was) the best thing about Rust. The game turned into a sizing contest about who can KOS better and who can Raid better. The community makes the game what it is and the community decided to make it a KOS and raid game. The ""playstyle"" of the servers are pretty much all the same now. There is so much more to this game rather than just killing everything in the server. the game is great and I have a great time playing it. The whole game boils down to one thing. patience. People will wait outragous amounts of time to door camp you or to wait for you to get offline so they can offline raid you. it doesnt matter how much better at the game you are if they wait longer you lose. if you want to have a good time playing rust and you have more than a day.

No server or anything you build is gonna last more than 2 days. Ive got almost 1k hours in this game and ive had some good times but those are long gone.

2018-04-10,0,0,116,False,Recommended,"Rust is one of my all time favourite games. Look at my library and compare it to the amount of hours spent on other games. Rust tops every game I own almost 3 times over. That makes it in my opinion a good game. There are however negatives to account for. First of all. The game has been in early access for a long period of time (4 years edging on 5) but it is receiving constant weekly updates showing progress that the team at facepunch are attempting to create to enhance gameplay for us the consumer. There have been many changes in the ""system"" in rust. When I say system I mean how the game plays. The first ""system"" was the blueprint system and was within the game for around 2 3 years. This system was loved by many players for its simplicity yet challenging nature. It challenged the player to find scraps of the blueprint to obtain items within the game that are increasingly rarer. This went from lower tier items like roadsign armour and pickaxes to items such as AK's and Metal Armour. This system required the player to spend larger amounts of time within the game to grind for better items (Note rust is a game where time has to be available. One cannot simply join a server and expect to find AK's and higher tier items. This takes time and gathering). The second system was the XP system which was liked and disliked by many players. It took the aspect of grinding to another level. I remember when the system first came out my group and I despised it as it was simply farm kill harvest repeat until the golden level of 31 was reached for the ultimate item the rocket launcher. This change to the system was upsetting to not only myself and my group but hundreds and thousands of players who were thrilled by the raiding aspect of Rust. It was acclaimed as the system where farming and free time were key. After a wipe sinking 30 hours into a base and gaining level was a common sight for many Rust players. This system had its pros and cons like all the others but was generally the most disliked.The third and final system is the current system Components/Blueprints. This system was a comforting relief. I did not have to sink an initial 30+ hours to simply be up the XP level for an item I wanted but simply had to find the resources components and build away. I at first was unsure of this system but came to like its simplistic nature and accessability to the more average rust player who has to balance his/her life with work school or other activities and can only manage to scramble 5 10 hours a week. It gave the player a chance to have PvP guns and armour without sinking their life into what some would say a pointless video game. After a while the system seemed too good to be true. In true facepunch style (sorry for the hate but most players will agree) they f*****d it up again. This was when the component system was merged with a new and improved blueprint style system. This implemented an item called scrap. Scrap is an item which is used for most activities in rust such as researching an item to craft and use it later on making a workbench and recycling components. Now when this first came out I wasn't too fussed and played along not seeing what the problem was. This wasn't until our group started to thin out to around 2 3 active players a week. Gathering scrap was to say the least difficult. Items such as AK's require 750 scrap to research and not to mention the cost of a Tier 1 2 and 3 Workbench accumulating to 2000+ scrap. This is to simply craft items. Not to mention rust has an enourmous quantity of items in the game. Tier 3 items are the most sought after and usually cost 750 scrap each. Let's jsut say it is quite a lot of scrap for lets say a solo player. This system although good and bad in its own way is detering newer players from even buying the game. They look up rust solo for instance and see a player ranting about absurd scrap costs. This singular thing is stopping people from playing the game. It is hard enough to survive in rust and keep a base for longer than a few days and facepunch decide to complicate it even more by increasing difficulty every patch. I want people to like this game. I thoughroughly enjoyed it. It has been and experience going through new systems testing out new base ideas pvp'ing making friends and more and more. Rust can be a good game but facepunch please listen to your audience. Make the game more user friendly. Right now it is a game which acts like more of a deterent rather than an enjoyable experience.I want to recommend this game to all of the current people thinking of buying it but warn you of the possible negative experiences and time you will need to play the game.

2014-01-08,0,0,989,True,Not Recommended,*WARNING* Don't waste your money and your time regardless if it is an Alpha release or not.This game is PLAGUED by hackers. It is a hackers freaking paradise. You can easily spend hours mind crafting everything you need only for it to either be taken away or destroyed at a whim by a hacker.Types of hacking programs that hackers use in this game are Speed Hacking. NoClip Hacking. God Mode. Flying. High Jumping. Walking &amp Shooting through walls. Aim Botting. ESP. (ESP can locate all of your items and resources that you have hidden anywhere in your base). You name it these hackers pretty much have every hack you can think of.VAC &amp Admin bans are useless against players that use hacks because they just keep coming back. And when they do get banned you can be rest assured that a DDOS attack on the server is not far behind. Admin support is close to 0% active.Every server that you can think of has hackers. Some have less some have more. The worst are the official servers which tend to have hackers everywhere due to the lack of Admin's monitoring those systems.When I first purchased the game I was unaware how prevalent the hacking issue was. After about the 2nd/3rd month of hopping from server to server to find and enjoy a hack free game I finally gave up and stopped playing. There were talks that the development team was working with a new company which was to provide better security against hackers. So after a 6/8 month hiatus I decided to give it another chance. This was a huge mistake on my part. Not only where the hacking issues unresolved it seemed to have grown considerably worse. Currenlty the development team is revamping the entire Rust game onto a new engine. There are talks that you will be required to download a program prior to playing Rust. This program will monitor each player to identify if they are using hacks or not. When caught the program will immediately ban that player on the spot. Personally I think by the time they get it right there will be no community left that will be interested in playing this game.Originally I had posted a review back in the day. The review stated that if the Development team was unable to get a handle on these hacking issues it would end up destroying the game play and the community. Sure enough this has come to pass. The community for this game has shrunk greatly. Servers that used to be full of players are now housing only small handfuls here and there and yes hackers are still prevalent on these systems. I'm not sure when the new version of Rust will be launched but my advice is to stay away. Stay away until there are more positive reviews that the game play and community have been restored to somewhat healthy levels and the hacking issues have been properly addressed.My guess... That will never happen...,Rust

2018-02-27,0,0,157,False,Recommended,It's been a while since I've had such a fun game. Every step I take in this game I feel an intense thrill in the stomach knowing that you can be killed at any moment and lose everything. It's a game with great thrill which is evolving and improving each month. I love this game it is so intense and immersive that I recommend it to everyone and especially to survival enthusiasts.,Rust
2018-02-27,0,0,775,False,Recommended,I've tried almost every survival type game known to man yet I always come back to Rust where I feel as though it's the only game that's done it right in every aspect. Yes the community can be toxic but also HILARIOUS! I've tried the game solo where I feared for my life every second i've stepped out of my shack. I've also played in a large group in a huge secure compound where we pretty much run the server and do what we please. Either way this game is always changing mostly for the better. Honestly what's better than literally starting out naked with a rock and torch scrounging for every resource possible. It's a survival game for a reason it's not meant to be easy. You are rewarded by how much effort you put into the game. Every player should want to kill every other player because you want those resources for yourself. Yes...it's a selfish mentality but again it's a SURVIVAL game. People who complain about being raided constantly need to suck it up or go play the Sims. Yes it can be frustrating but that's what makes the game so great...gameplan with your group and find out how to rise to power or learn from your mistakes and try a different tactic. And for the love of god always watch your back...because somebody somewhere is trying to kill you.,Rust

2018-06-24,0,0,297,False,Recommended,"Even though it's not a noob friendly game and many people may be frustrated at the beginning if they are going on official servers Rust is one of the best survival games I have ever played. That being said I have read some negative comments and I understand their frustration but there is one thing to keep in mind... Rust is basically still in pre release even though it is ""officially"" released on steam. They have a long roadmap ahead for the next 2 years and I'm sure optimisations will come to this game sooner or later.Positives great graphics (wonderful water and overall look basically unity engine shines here) the gameplay is great if you don't go on the fullest/official servers great crafting progression monthly updates (before they were weekly) lots of mini games to keep you entertained (parkour tree chopping etc.) building a base is fun and it can also be a true test of your imagination (it's fun to build bases and then people can try to raid them but newbies probably don't get to experience this on official servers... even I don't sometimes) this game makes you a bit more careful with people since you can't trust anyone in this game (believe me I know) playing with your friends is mostly fun the only problem is when people are slacking off and they are not helping with the base mods are nice even though I didn't play a lot with them (played rust royale though hahah) skins are interesting since you can even craft boxes if you want with the materials from the skins you don't want (I think they drop once in a while for free)Negatives harsh environment for beginner especially on official servers building decay is a bit too much sometimes especially for a solo type of player (you can't build big bases since you will not be able to keep up with the upkeep) there should be a middle ground for people who don't like their characters (monthly character reset or something similar?) even though I like the idea of getting an unchangeable character depending on the steam ID but there seems to be an overwhelming amount of people who dislike it high PC requirements (I think that this game should be able to run well on Potato settings on almost any machine but there seems to be some struggle even for me with a 1060 random fps drops and stuff) load times are horrible for those with an HDDRust is a game you need to get used to. When bad stuff happen I now say ""yep that's rust for you"". The most frustration probably comes from the community but you know what? That's how it is in the real world also. There are many s and you need to learn how to deal with them. Sometimes with a good plan sometimes with smooth talk... and sometimes with a good bashing (not recommending this irl tho). Ultimately this is why I'm leaving a positive review. Most of the negatives don't bother me (I have decent PC and I got used to the community) anymore. If you manage to get past that stage I think that you will enjoy Rust to its fullest. ALSO Rust has huuuuuuuuge potential. Check out their roadmap... the electrical system should be one of the best features the game can offer when it's properly finished.",Rust

The vanilla system of survival is honestly so easy this shouldn't be considered anything more than a casual game that anyone can pick up and play. The building system is perfect gathering and crafting is actually engaging and interesting and the graphics (from it's legacy form factor) is somewhat breath taking. I had the pleasure... and in some instances DISpleasure of seeing this game transform and mold into one of my favorite games of all time. I've been here since Legacy Rust and it's been one crazy ride thusfar.

Rust is an unforgiving wasteland where you are left to yourself or some friends to survive in the wild while fending off a bear a chicken or some nice gentlemen wearing wooden planks and road signs who want to blow up your base and maybe take your stuff. If you want to you can be those nice gentlemen. Anyway this game is great. the devs are among the best if their kind releasing consistent updates packed to the brim with content whether it be new monuments items or crucial balance changes and bugfixes. We really don't deserve Facepunch. I don't play the game as often as others do but I can say that it can give you an endless amount of fun. You can go from a naked man with only a rock and a torch to a person wearing a coffee can helmet roadsign armor and frog boots in just one day. On top of that when you log on the next day you may find out that all that stuff you worked hard to get was worked on harder by someone who used rockets and C4 to blow up your walls and take your stuff. Then you put arrows into his head and take his stuff and blow up HIS base. All while some naked man is trying to slap you with a rock.

2015-12-31,0,0,360,False,Recommended,I don't have a good graphics card and I don't have SUPER internet speeds and as a result of both this game is unplayable...A game shouldn't demand so much from your hardware that even when you've reduced all graphical settings to their lowest possible setting it's still not worth playing...Can't walk up stairs can't climb down ladders (so don't go up them unless you want to die) and the walkling in water sound starts waaaay before you've hit the water...?UPDATE 2018 Well I have super speeds and a decent machine now and I really enjoy this game. I can't really say if it's improved since my last review since everything I complained about could be attributed to gammy internet and a gammy computer BUT I feel like changing my thumb on this one...,Rust

2018-05-22,0,0,1613,False,Not Recommended,This is a very addictive and fun game and Ill always recomend it to friends but im leaving a negative review for the moment because they recently changed something that kind of changes the untire game.... yes im talking about upkeep/decay they have made it impossible for anyone to build big bases which was kinda the whole reason I played the game. Its not that upkeep is too expensive its that you can only fit enough materials in the TC for a couple of hours therefore making it impossible to maintain a bigger base. with the current upkeep/decay system it takes all the creativity out of base building and makes it to where everyone has the same boring base off youtube.....,Rust

2016-04-04,0,0,124,True,Recommended,"Rust is a great game to get into if you have a group of people to play with. It has a bit of a steep learning curve if you don't have friends that already play. This gets even worse depending on what server you decide to play on. Servers can be modded to have nice features and if someone isn't there to explain them you wouldn't know! While so far this might sound kind of ""meh"" it really isn't. Willing that you have a posse it's actually quite fun! You can get into staged fights with different weapons leave creative and probably lewd drawings for them and even blow up all of their hard work.",Rust
2016-04-05,0,0,185,True,Recommended,I have never played a game that has had me so invested into protecting items which are merely pixels on a screen. I must warn you that you will probably spend hours upon hours grinding for resources to simply die from a wolf or a non friendly player. Not forgetting constructing your base to find you were raided and killed when you logged in next. That being said the pure adrenaline when taking part in a raid and exchanging gun fire will keep you hooked! Would recommend to anybody!,Rust

2018-01-13,0,0,123,True,Recommended,I understand that i am yet t log a massive amount of hours. However in the relatively small amount of time i have played i can safely list a few things i noticed.pros difficult but rewarding grind that allows new items just often enough to hold intrest. The unpredictability of the game also means that you can go from 0 100 rather quickly if you end the right player. weapon system that rewards skill and practice relatively vertical recoil for most guns. the social aspect of the game allows for some of the most memorable and EVERYONE has a mic from the 700 deceble screaming inbred autistic twelvies to literaly the chillest human being i have ever met to cheeki breeki crazed slavs who squat in a cave they call a house and throw axes at each other all day. solid buillding system good way at balancing teirs cons upkeep system is a bit of a joke that is only there to mop up servers literal morons zergs are real on high pop servers Travis,Rust
2018-06-18,0,0,304,False,Not Recommended,I have mixed reviews on Rust. It can be alot of fun with friends but not for a long time and having too many people with you can be a cluster . Let's get started1. LootingLooting in Rust isn't really a main part of the game yes there is looting but that doesn't happen much at the beginning of your life. The game is more about resource gathering and crafting. You spawn into the world completely naked bearing only a rock and torch. You can use your rock to hit trees nodes and barrels. You collect cloth and start to craft your first clothes and weapon/tool. However that's where it isn't fun with friends. You could spend a whole hour just trying to meet up with 1 buddy because of dying from the following reasons Starvation Dehydation Drowning Freezing Heating up and then proceeding to die of thirst Another player A wolf A bear A chicken A scientist and even Cacti! After finally meeting up with your friend survival begins.2. SurvivalSurvival in Rust can either be fun and moderately difficult or it can be a waste of time and insanely difficult to meet up with friends/ make a base. Going back to how you can die servers can have up to 500 players (give or take). This means that you have a good chance of crossing paths with another survivor. Now in other survival games you're chances of them being friendly is about a 50/50 (again give or take) however in Rust there is a 90% that they won't say a word to you and they will instantly attack you sending you back to square 1. This brings me to...3. Community ...Community! Oh boy the community in Rust is dare I say CANCEROUS. This game started as a decently friendly community you probably did have a 50/50 chance of making a friend. However just like a cancer cell the toxicity of this game spreaded like wildfire and today you have a good chance of someone running at you with a sword playing/making obnoxious sounds through their mic. Now if this sounds like your cup of tea you'll fit right in However it gets old quick and after dying constantly and spawing in naked again you'll end up giving up. I don't see a future where the community of Rust becomes friendly ever again.4. ShootingShooting in Rust is good. There is Spray Patterns Recoil Bullet Drop and Travel Time. But you probably won't get to the point of having guns unless you're an absolute professional time waster and you farm for it. That's all I have to say about shooting5. Closing UpNow Rust is not a bad game it gets frequent updates and I don't expect the game to be abandoned. The updates definitley add some good mechanics but it doesn't change the things I dislike about the game. Anyway you can make you're own decision about the game but that's just my thoughts.,Rust

2015-02-09,0,0,50,True,Not Recommended,"Legacy Rust was and will always be the true version that was ""Rust"". This *new* thing they call ""Rust"" is not what the fans fell in love with. Oh sure you can switch to Legacy Rust but there's no support for it updates bug fixes anti cheats etc. It's now dominated by Russians and hackers. There aren't any fully functional/ populated English speaking servers to be able to play on the Legacy Rust even if they could solve the hacking problem. The original Rust (that was highly acclaimed) is no longer available and has been replaced with a completely different game. New Rust has completely different game mechanics graphics game play less features etc. It's a horrible flop that promises to be like the original version but it will never be the same game that got all those positive reviews and hours from us gamers. Buy it? What will you even do in game? At this point in time H1Z1 (a brand new clone of Rust) is much more exciting to play and H1Z1 itself is terribly boring. Stay away unless Rust becomes free to play! (WARNING Micro transactions are a planned feature for Rust)",Rust

2015-02-09,0,0,13,True,Recommended,I have waited for a long time to write this review why? because I didnt think it would be fair to judge a game that is in alpha. It was a rough start. The first couple builds where remarkably dull. I would get on play for a half an hour get my head bashed in by a rock and proceed to spam ALT F4. The game has since then become an uncut gem in my opinon. The UI is amazing and simple to well use and the bugs have for the most part went away. I only have three issues with this game. One grass is all over the goddamn place and the only way to turn it down is through the console (it's not a performance issue I just prefer less grass). Two lag is always present when it comes to PVP which is more than essential to fix in an online only game. And three I find it very hard to find wildlife I dont know if they just dont spawn or what but I might as well be looking for a tumbleweed to eat. To give my final opinion if Facepunch can cut this gem they're looking at my Game of the Year(s).,Rust

2018-08-03,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,At first I got excited for Rust for it seemed it might be a more grown up verison of Minecraft with its harvest/research sandbox mechanics. I suppose it's my own fault for not taking the survival part seriously. Any attempts to avoid the kill or be killed mentality will bring you nothing but frustration. As mentioned by a number of other reviewers solo play is nigh impossible. I bounced from server to server trying to find a quiet corner to amass even the most basic of supplies to no avail. I found servers to run rampant with players decked out with superior equipment trolling on the coastlines where the noobs begin their journey. Were there a way to keep the PVP aspect a little more fair I maybe would have invested more time into the game.I think it's important to mention Rust has the most toxic gaming environments I've ever encountered. Players flame up at the drop of a hat chat is plagued with complainers swearing racial slurs you name it. Heaven forbid you ask a question to the community to help you find your way else you'll be made fun of for the next ten minutes. If you need an outlet for your poor sadistic soul you'll find it here. But if you're more along the lines of a casual gamer definitely walk away from this one.,Rust
2016-05-04,0,0,467,False,Not Recommended,The game is fun and the idea behind it is incredible. You can literally do whatever you want.However the community is toxic and kinda sucks. It's super grindy and you'd have to put aside time to play almost every day so you can stay relevant on the server. That is until someone wipes you while you're offline. If you're solo HA.

2018-06-02,0,0,920,False,Recommended,The thing with Rust is where you play it. You can play on anything from Vanilla servers to Modded servers. I personally prefer some of the modded servers. The game is what you make it you can play team style or solo. The degree of difficulty depends a great deal on the server. The game is still being developed and there are occasional set backs but I think the positive outweighs the negative in that regard. Competition and lifespan are variable also. Challenge yourself on a vanilla server or chill on one of the modded servers it's personal preference and how you play the game. I bought this game as an early release and I have logged a lot of fun hours playing it. There are so many fun aspects to Rust.,Rust

2017-04-07,0,0,675,False,Not Recommended,Played this game for a decently long time I loved it. The adrenaline pvp making bases everything seemed just so great about the gameThen they added loot tiers map.Ever since then you spawn in like 1 7 spawn points which basically are all near each other and you're meant to get away from there as fast as possible because you're going to get camped by the people that were lucky to get a bow early and basically spawn kill you and oh boy are people s in this game. Doesn't matter if you have a sash or not you're going to get chased across the map for that rock and torch of yours. Did you just pick up a hemp near a fresh spawn? Well too ing bad because now he's going to chase you across half the map just to try and kill you and ruin your start just because they can.Then comes the interaction with the community which is almost nonexistant past fresh spawns. If a guy has a bow you can bet he's gonna shoot your sweet for no reason other than to kill you and maybe take the you got IF you got any that is.To the people who played this game for a pretty long time now. How many people have you talked to who have a bow without them trying to kill you? Because 95% of the time they're gonna draw that and kill you and Im guessing you weren't even taking the chances of talking with them because you probably were already aiming at him with your bow or spear.Clans rule the game It's been like that for a while if you have no one to play the game with you're usually gonna have a time. Honestly early game problems come from the loot tier map and how you just don't spawn around the map anymore thus increasing in density of people in one place and like 20% of the people making out of there without getting attacked by a guy with a bow.In the end ill still play it because i enjoy the pvp and base building but these are the issues i seem to find the most troubling.,Rust
2018-05-28,0,0,565,False,Recommended,GENERAL OVERVIEW Learning how to build/craft gets headshot by a bolty. ACTUAL REVIEW After playing more than 555 hours on rust I can say that it is a good game (besides the screaming naked asians).It is driven by the community you chose how to play whether it be Playing in a clan roleplaying as a merchant or ransacking someone's shop. There is a lot to do. Sadly this has become a problem. The community has grown in toxicity making new players quit after a few hours of playing. Due to this it will slowly die. But YOU can change it. Whether it be giving metal tools to a newman or not griefing someone's wooden house you decide what happens. Don't make the wrong choice.P.S. Very gud gam mest bye!,Rust

2018-05-28,0,0,294,False,Recommended,This game is amazing! The progression system is currently perfect and although PvP is often stacked towards large clans but then again this is an issue with every survival game and a good player can outplay them in the right situations. One thing that holds this game back massively is the fact that the community is complete due to tryhards spawncamping freshies so that they cant build up but every now and then you find the right person who helps you along the way. One tip if you wish to avoid salt play community or modded servers because officials are near impposible to start on even on wipe day and they tend to be reserved for the best of the best. Also dont anger a big clan. you wont have fun unless your IQ is above 180. They'll demolish you.,Rust

Its a very fun game to play with friends and thats why I love it but it can also be a cruel game at times. You work so hard to build your base and gather materials to raid other players and you return to your own base comepletely destroyed is the worst feeling in the world. This game is not for the faint hearted as it will constantly be throwing obstacles at you that you have to mentally endure. I would also say that this is the best survival game out on steam currently. It had weekly updates and they show what they are working on and you can also suggest to the devs what you want to see changed.,Rust

Smart base planning.You have to plan every step you take and base everything around other player's actions.Walk the long way to avoid getting wrecked? Do it. Wait till a player is offline to raid them? Do it.The only thing you shouldn't do is get asshurt when you get raided and have to start from scratch just like you've left another player. It's just the cycle of Rust.Pros Nice weaponsNice crafting system.Nice building systemNice resource system (a bit grindy but eh)Cons Not enough animals. I find myself running around for ages to find 1 measly pig and have to wait to find another 2 just to build a furnace.The monuments need textures.More enemies. Bring back zombies and have them infest the monuments for a little more dangerFix the animal AI it's horrible they run in circles on mountains and get stuck in rocksNeeds more irradiation i mean this game appears to be post nuclear war so where's me rads?Yes i know this game's in Beta but it has been for 2 years and needs fixing.But I love the way it turns everybody into survival mode. The adrenaline rush is real when you see another player with weapons or players raiding another base or even attacking you. It's hard but it's so much fun. 8/10,Rust

2016-09-12,0,0,527,False,Recommended,I like this game I've had it since legacy and i see it only improving but I would like to suggest some ideas to the developers (since I don't know where to post ideas to developers)1.Reduce the amount of time to actually use healing items (The bandage and the and Medical Syringe (cant tell you how many times I injected myself but still went down after a gunfight)) or stop the bleeding effects when applying medical items or just do away with the bleeding effects entirely (but this one is a stretch)2.Focus on horses instead of cars since most rust maps are mainly nature focused (if that makes sense) and the maps roads are only a small percentage of the map.3.Shields or some type of blocking methods to counteract melee attacks and archers (if shields are implemented) and to have better melee focused battles 4. (Controversial Opinion) Get rid of the twig system that allows people to build all the way to the top of the base and raid easily from there raiding should be challenging not a walk in a park where people can easily be offline raided. (and to some extend getting rid of ladders) Also this system makes walls next to usless limiting it to be more of a honeycomb.5.Make the food and water meter last a bit longer its somewhat of an annoyance at this point.6.Continuing on the shields I would structure it to having it on your back would protect your back only and not your head. When you equip your shield it should have three stances one where it protects your body (base stance) one where you hold right click to cover your head but somewhat reveal your body and the third stance which is when you crouch and hold right click for ultimate frontal protection but it leaves you slow and vulnerable to flanks and with these stances you should be able to hold a one handed melee and a spear for throwing and melee but no guns. There should also be catagories with light medium heavy and super heavy where small medium and heavy block arrows and give reduced damage to gunfire and while the catagories go up the shield gets slightly bigger and the durablility increases and the damage to gunfire is slighty reduced as you get higher and in these 3 catagories you can equip a melee weapon but for the super heavy shield you can't equip weapons but its bulletproof and it covers your entire view so you will need a buddy to point you in the right direction and its durability goes down as it gets shot up. Moving on to melee combat with shields it should be a timed block where if you block correctly you receive no damage and the fight continues until you dont block correctly your character should receive a staggering affect leaving you vulnerable giving your opponent a hit on you and the fight continues until one dies. That just leaves us with two handed weapons which should get the ability to block but the person wielding it should focus on dodging and the two handed weapon will be an anti shield weapon meaning it has an easier time breaking shields and the stagger affect is much greater if the shield person does not block properly.,Rust
2018-04-05,0,0,226,False,Recommended,Good game. Its hard as a beginner and it takes awhile to get good at. Once you get good at the game and your not a scrub anymore it becomes fun and have some good times killing and taking loot. Over all 9/10 IGN rating.,Rust

The game is unstable as hell people playin suck very hard. I may get back in some years when this game is actually playable. It crashes fps drop every minute menu and interaction bugs on a 1000 euro pc. Nice... OLD UPDATE So after many months and many updates i think i should edit this review.Welcome to rust where everyone is hostile and a killing naked people with guns is really fun especialy if you are the one holding the gun. Drawing SO BAD STUFF on sings is also great!I used to have 3 hours to this game this number jumped to 30 just in 3 days while playing with a friend. The game is playable now even on low end pcs and i can handle the game almost on full settings. Its really fun to play and great looking! Also you will discover something new every time you play its basicly minecraft for psychopaths. I see so much potential to this title. I saw that they made the price 30 euros i could say its kinda worth it. Actually they made it 31 so you are forced to put more money on steam shady.

FacePunch Or it could also possibly be the case that most people thoroughly dislike most if not all of the recent updates and therefore are writing bad reviews.. Sadly this game will probably never return to the simple exciting and fresh experience that it was around August of 2016 for the last 2 years it has been plagued by inconsistent update cycles that seem to add new and interesting content one day and horrendously bad changes to existing game mechanics and features the next. In its current state I can't recommend this game.",Rust

2017-03-07,0,0,2867,False,Recommended,I really Like this game a lot and its really reccomended by me beacause its a great game and You can invite your friends to play it. Also when you start playing the game its going to be super hard but around 500hrs i think you will know everything about the game and be a great experienced player if not keep on trying until you you reach your goal with rust. I myself have played this game for 1 634.1 hrs now and i still think its so fun also if you get mad and frustrated at this game dont give up and say i cant do anything beacause you can i know it. The only downside with this game is that you have to be playing this game a lot to not get raided and specificly if you have a small base and if you do have a big base then its a really small chans of you getting raided unless its nolife 8 man clan farmers that will raid you then you might hide your loot.,Rust

2018-02-19,0,0,561,False,Recommended,I daresay this is the best survival game available on Steam. It's composed of action grinding planning strategizing and that's what makes it so special and so addictive. There's really not much to say about it. The main core of the game is about building your own base gathering resources and raiding other players. The only things which I would consider as cons are too much darkness during the night and not exactly mature community (but the game istelf cannot be blamed for that right?). If you'd like to forfeit all your spare time then buy this game.,Rust

2014-07-26,0,0,178,True,Not Recommended,FOR LATEST REVIEW SEE THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW.This game although is in Alpha as clearly stated is very playable and is great fun!Choose from over 5000 servers mostly UK and German servers and build and raid other bases.Make new friends and team up to suvive or brave it alone and shoot on sight.You get all kinds of people on Rust which is what makes the game so brilliant! The constant fear but also peacefulness of the surroundings.Updates for this game are regular and the devs are contantly trying to improve the game. I bought this game instead of buying DayZ because 1) it was cheaper2) didn't require a super computer to run3) and for the ability to build in an open world game all kinds of stuff from huge bases to a camp fire.Edit After 176 hours of playing this game it has changed very much to when I first reviwed this game. All of the above still is relevent. The requirements have maybe increased a little but I am still running it. The game is visually stunning! I have teamed up with many people on this game I have also killed many people and most of all be killed many time.Most of the time this game is a shoot on sight but depending on the server you join that can really change and people will help you and will let you live with them in the game. I have even been on a server where a group of 6 people controlled a rather large section of the map.9/10 because it's still Alpha and there are still things not complete but that is expected.Edit 2 30/05/2015This game is now uninstalled and now to most likely never be played again. This is because of a few reasons 1)Optimisation is complete rubbish and even if you have a great computer it will most likely run crap.2) Hackers ruin everything and has been something that the devs have done nothing about it seems.3) Spend hours of your life playing this and its wasted its a hitting stones simulator after a few hours of this game you will be killed 100 times starve 100 times but not achieve anything because everyone tom and harry are chasing after you. It's NOT WORTH A BUY! I bought this when it was 11 I'm glad I haven't been too ripped off but still ripped off.EDIT 10/05/2017 Still useless with poor optimisation and the devs just killed the game by bugging it out. GG.,Rust

2018-02-19,0,0,591,False,Recommended,"First things first Rust is not a survival game persay... It is a game about surviving in on island with no social contract. This game is the closest thing to a political vacuum that any of us will ever experience. This game brings out the caveman in us all the mistrust the fear the covetousness the vengefulness the connivingness and so much more that you never knew existed in yourself. There are brief glimpses of modern courtesy and humanity but they are vastly outweighed by the uncaring crushing force of our base nature. Rust gets one thing very right about survival Nature doesn't care if you live or die. Unfortunately there is only one real way to die in Rust which is what makes it different than the ideal survival game. Nature is mostly forgiving in this game there will always be mushrooms clean water cloth and firewood over the next hill. Human nature is the real killer you will die thousands of deaths by the hands of the cruel the fearful the determined and the jealous. Surviving is uncomplicated if you know how to avoid other players which any lone wolf player can confirm. There real challenge comes when you decide to look for FUN. Player interaction is inevitable the game will not force you into it but you will force yourself into it. After half an hour of gathering materials you will hear a gunshot or see a distant figure and you will be filled with an irresistable curiousity. If you steel yourself against it and slink back home the world will pass you by. You have everything to lose by avoiding your fellow man. That distant figure may be a potential ally a roleplayer who can entertain you for hours or a dying man whose misfortune will become your livelihood. It could be a hardened no lifer whose zerg clan will descend on your like biblical plagues. As you approach this figure your hands will tremble and your mind will be filled with self doubt and terror. The firearm you cling to holds your future in its chamber. Each missed bullet is another piece of your past and future that you throw away. But maybe you will not miss today or maybe you will not need to shoot. As you step out from your hiding place weapon raised your target turns to face you. Their face is filled with surprise and they cry out ""No wait I'm friendly! Please don't I'm looking for a friend."" Are they lying? Are they trying to protect valuable goods? Are there hidden cries for the aid of unseen companions behind their pleas for mercy? How long do you have until some other vulture descends on this feast? Is this what you've become a vulture? This is where your story will truly begin. And believe me when I say that there will be stories. There will be tragedies that fill you with self hatred and shame. There will be comedies where new friends are made and many laughs are had. There will be epics where you defy the odds even just for a minute before the island crushes you into nothingness. You will have to make your fun. You will have to endure the slow grinding parts to make it to the climax. After every wipe you will have to ask yourself how much have I given and how much more am I willing to give? In my case my answer to the first question is that I've given over 500 hours since I first purchased this game in early access in 2013. I cannot answer the second question.LONG LIVE THE NAKAMAT TRIBE. DEATH TO THE TOWER PEOPLE.",Rust

Now I'm not saying this is the greatest game ever but it is the top game in my library even though i do not play it as often as I use too. I am wating until something BIG happens to the game so I can play this more often. It's just very slow as of right now and I've done it all and have had my fun. Eventully I'll come play this game 24/7 again. Alll games have toxic communities and when people complain about them with over 500 hours on the game I laugh. Don't write a bad review if you have more hours then me sure you may have liked the old rust but that does not mean this is the only game you are able to play. New games are made everyday.

This game Although its not terrible very fun massive potential but the communitiy or atleast 1 in 3 people whom you'll never pick out of the crowd untill it's too late are out to kill everything in sight hen crywhen they die.Base Both your survival and deathTorch stay away. ( the big shoot me beacon)Players stay away or likely get shot. ( 1 in 3 players will have guns and happily test them out on your head If they don't have guns and you do Goes without saying not to give them any)Rocks.. can't live without em love em.. but players with em... haha stay away from nudis with rocks... lolNow I'm sure theres alot of this roaming around Game is amazing But if you are the type that hates farming Bi weekly(not literally) mandatory server wipes base trolls or hacker like accuracy with the least accurate guns in the game at some points (due to lag on one end or the other) Then this game is not for you.

2013-12-18,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Rust is by far the most impressive early access/alpha build games I've ever bought. Just the fact that it's alpha but the lighting is magnificent and there are so many features that seem so fluid already. I spent my whole afternoon playing this with friends and in that time I'd found my friend we then killed zombies for blue prints and looted the nearby radtown constantly building up a nice supply of items we made an alliance with two friendly players whom helped us out immensely we met up with another 2 friends and then we started making out base. It's funny though we ended up with the best weapons we could get surplus ammunition decent clothing and a whole host of weapon addons but we we're still defeated by zombies when we went on an expedition. This game is really about survival no matter what you have you can still be as easily killed as the next guy over. The periodic supply drops are interesting hearying the plane go overhead watching the cannisters parachute to the ground and then running in that direction hoping to find them before any other players though it can be quite frustrating when they land on mountains that have no way of climbing.If you have a bunch of friends to play this with I would highly recommend buying Rust sure it's fun solo but it's worth it to play with friends and to co ordinate and build large fortress like bases. The upcoming features are really going to make this game stand out from all the other survival games on the market.,Rust

I never cease to have a good time either making friends with strangers or getting killed by strangers trying to make friends with them. Only bugs i ever found was a deer that when i shot began ragdolling and flying around in the sky more berzerk everytime i shot it left me in tears of laughter for nearly an hour. Never ran into a hacker the ENTIRE time and caters to many playstyles.Only bad thing i might have to say is the simplicity of legacy has somewhat faded into a very complex game but that brought a really enjoyable rp/strategy aspect to the game.,Rust

I personally feel like the game keeps getting better and am glad that the developers are constantly adding on to the game. I definitely agree that a lot of people can be toxic in the Rust community but I have also made plenty of friends on Rust. I think it all comes down to finding the right server. There are plenty of servers to choose from if you are just looking for a PVE experience or a PVP experience. At times I can get bored and not play for awhile but I always end up coming back for more. Definitely an awesome game to play with a bunch of friends.,Rust

That's not why I'm giving it a bad review.As it stands I'm giving the game a bad review because it is WAY too exploitable. After taking every precaution to protect my hard work and resources it turns out people can just wall hack their way through and take my s*** anyway. Why f***ing bother?

2016-07-09,0,0,153,False,Not Recommended,"Originally I recommended this game under the condition that you be prepared for what is one of the worst communities of any game you'll ever play with. Of course it wasn't always this bad. In the glory days of rust you were only killed on sight by maybe 4 out of 10 people. That was manageable and it didn't destroy the experience of a game that relies so heavily on the people you play with. But as more and more people come to this game due to it's increasing popularity despite the fact you have zero loot you'll find yourself being KOS'd pretty much 100% of the time usually by some 14 year old who manages to squeak out ""f ggot"" before you bleed out.This means that the only instance in which you can survive the grind to a point where you can defend yourself is on a freshly wiped server where everyone else starts on an even playing field. You can forget joining servers that were wiped the day before as a single day is plenty of time for players to get semis and AK's.The more I play this game the more I realise this isn't something I can recommend to new/solo players. You may get lucky and find a random group that would take you in but the gameplay experience shouldn't rely on luck to be fun. It really is a shame too because the core gameplay is so well designed compared to other survival games like ARK. Your only chance is to search the forums and discords for a group of players looking for more people. Other than that you're out of luck.",Rust

2018-04-19,0,0,415,False,Not Recommended,"This game was incredibly awesome when I first started playing a few years ago. Everything was new survival was extremely challenging and although there were some jerks out there overall the community was just as noob as I was and for the most part we worked together. The game has progressed well due in large part to the great development team. They keep the community updated with darn near every change they make and drop hints as to what lies ahead. With that team I have no complaints.However the community has become extremely toxic and KOS (kill on site) has become the norm not the exception. Fully geared mobs roam the island a day or two after wipe day and do all they can to make life a living hell for newly spawned nakeds. There is almost no cooperation on either sponsored or community servers except for real life friends that you dragged into the game to join in your misery. Then just as you finally get a base up and a perhaps get a gun it's wipe day and you have to start the whole process over. If you get really good and you have a skilled group you can rise to the challenge and compete with the other mobs. But whether you win or lose there will be massive amounts of cussing and cursing in chat and over in game audio. Toxic.Finally I saved the best for last. This is ultimately why I gave the game a negative review. Not because of the toxic community. Not because of the endless cycle of scavenge build die repeat. But because of the terrible ban system. I have zero count em ZERO cheats hacks modifiers etc. on my machine. I have put in 415 hours of clean playing into this game. And suddenly with no warning I am ""gamebanned"" and can never play online again. WTF? Once again I have never had any modifiers on my machine for this game. To make matters worse there is no recourse. Valve gives the power to ban solely on the developer and then wipes their hands of it. Yes Easy Anti Cheat are the idiots who banned a clean player but I paid Valve for the game. Ultimately it is their responsibility to ensure that the developer does not abuse this right. And clearly EAC doesn't know what they're doing. When searching for a way to contest the ban all I could find from EAC is that all bans are final and that there is NO inquiry system. So when they screw up and ban someone unnecessarily (which happens all the time just Google their track record... it's horrendous) there is no way to enjoy the game from there on out. And they never tell you why because ""then the cheat developers would know"". I'm sure those guys know very quickly either way. So at the severe cost of customer service EAC chooses to ban and run.

The dev team is still pretty great however I feel they try to micromanage somethings a little too much like with the roof exploit which gave smaller groups/solos a better chance against large clans that rule servers. The community has become straight unless you're a popular youtuber or one of the high and mighty of the server aka a member of the giant zerg clan that destroys everything. Your experience now is pretty much getting shot at by anyone mauled by most animals and spending your entire time grinding to pop down a base only to get mowed over by the first guy to pop up with a crappy gun.

2017-05-25,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Having spent a fair bit of time watching the forums I'd say the dev clearly cares very little whether or not people are enjoying the game. That or they kowtow to the vocal minority of old time players whose idea of a fun game is very different from the majority's.Due to this the game only gets new people during sales and hemmorrhages them between sales http //steamcharts.com/app/252490My personal peeve with the game is the stubborn refusal to allow character customization not even if it's only available once at the start. The reasons given are many and varied and not one of them holds water versus the vast majority of users being entirely for it. From what I see it's a matter of being too lazy to create an interface for it and/or some misguided SJW agenda about forcing everyone to live in racial harmony which clearly doesn't happen even without customization.I'd just say don't do it. I know it's only 20 bucks even when it's not on sale but there are cheaper ways to bang your head against a brick wall.,Rust

2016-11-26,0,0,920,True,Recommended,I had this game for a while but didn't play it much because of how hard entry is to new players. After coming back with some friends (everything is funner with friends!) I have found the game to be much more enjoyable. I have to commend the devolpers for updating this game and listening to feed back. It is of my opinion that they should stop listening to reddit though. Rust is intense and fun where the stakes are high. There are numerous obstacles in the way of players such as radiation hunger thirst and wildlife. Those are nothing to other players who can and WILL gut you like a fish for just being in there territory. Eventually this game will get a proper release I'm sure but it still is trying to figure out what kind of game it is.,Rust

You will find out the hard way that you should not trust anyone you don't know. Even with these downsides this game is great and is going to get much better.

One thing that I was glad to notice is that the game mechanics incentives playing in a less toxic way there is no achievements for killing players (it will still be necessary some times) but usually is much better to trade with them. Upkeep mechanics make the clans work harder to keep their bases and the new damage output on the missiles and C4 make raiding a lot more difficult for them. You can counter clans with traps more easily. Im a solo player and I have been able to play wipe to wipe with a big size base no problem. And even survive 4 raid attempts from clans.

2013-12-29,0,0,38,True,Recommended,This game is a survival and resource collecting with a hint of pvp danger type of game. Since its in Alpha there is no tutorial which I think is the biggest flaw and 2nd is when you log off and log back in all your stuff on your person disappears. Now you can prevent this by putting them in a container. You are limited on what you can craft which is enough to survive but not enough to get that shotgun to murder all those innocent zombie guys. You have to either A) Find a blue print that lets you learn how to build it or B) Find a shotgun that you loot and kill zombies to you get a research kit which allows you to make the object that you already possess. That feature is really handy cause the next time you log in you might not have that shotgun.

2018-04-29,0,0,227,False,Recommended,"This game is brutally based on the concept of survival.Over the course of its development the devs have allowed modding to stay in the game as long as it is restricted to certain servers. Thankfully the devs listen to what we as players have to say about the game.The game play itself is unlike many I have ever seen survival is hard enough as i had to run around desperately looking for food while starving but i couldn't find any as all the supermarkets in the area were looted. There were no animals in the area to kill and for the first time in a while I found myself battling a concept in a video game I never thought i would have problems with. Typically there are 3 different types of enemy you can encounter who can and will attempt to kill you.1. Players The community is known for its toxicity that shows in the form of racism sexism and otherwise homophobic comments. Due to this games extremely toxic community you should avoid trusting other players with well anything. After someone as decided they want to kill you they will unlikely stop chasing you until you are dead e.g. I had just spawned and I found myself being chased by a naked with a rock who would smack me every time he got the chance. Eventually he gave up and ran off. Sadly the more geared players will often kill fresh spawns for no apparent reason so avoiding contact with further developed players is recommended. 2. Animals Annoyingly somewhere about maybe a year or two ago animals could glitch through walls/foundations and begin attcking you inside your own base. Around that time they were also even more unforgiving than the players and their AI would not stop targeting you until you were dead or moved out of their aggro range. This is sadly nearly improssible to do as most animals are either faster or just as fast as you are. Some advice to newer players is that after you kill a wolf you should not crush its skull for bones as it can be used to craft pretty much the best ""primitive"" helmet the wolf headress.3. Military. There are four military enemies including the scientist the helicopter the chinook and bradley the apc. All of these npcs are hostile but are difficult to defeat with the exception of the scientist. THe heli is an npc that has long been in the game which patrols the entire map before dissapearig and respawning later. It targets players with armour or gunpowder weapons/guns. The chinook is also a helicopter however after a certain time of patrolling an area and gunning down players (including nakeds) it drops a form of airdrop which typically has better loot than a normal airdrop an its location is marked on the map for everyone to see. The scientist is an npc that can be found roaming the military tunnels or nearby junk piles. They are armed with guns and shoot once you are within aggro range. They usually have mid tier loot on them such as med syringes. Bradley is an apc tank and like the scientist and chinook will shoot regardless of whether or not the player in question is geared or not. They spawn only in launch site and are armed with a primary and secondary weapon that either fires tank shells or guns you down with a turret.",Rust

But here's my opinion since the latest updates This is a update as of 02/08/18Years ago I gave Rust a bad review mostly because of how the game was changing to be more clan focused... Well all that's changed.It is possible to play the without a large clan and even more so might be better because of recent updates ala the Tool Cabinet requiring materials for base upkeep.As of today Rust has left early access and with that I give it a positive review.

2017-04-21,0,0,4634,True,Recommended,Killer game. I have played since Legacy and its pretty awesome to have been on the train the entire time with the development of this game. I was pretty skeptical at first related to the new version of rust as Legacy was so good. I am not convinced that it was the best move Rust ever made. I went back and played legacy a month ago it was shocking how bad it was compared to new rust. Props to the developers for weekly updates.,Rust
2015-02-03,0,0,6388,False,Recommended,I recommended this game when it first game out but after playing over 3000 hours of Rust I will tell you that legacy is what made Rust so popular and it's honestly just sad to see how it ended up. Legacy gave me my most immersive and exciting gaming experience that I've ever had and even far beyond any AAA title that I've ever played.I wish the developers could see it from our point of view but I think they're just in it to milk it. If they would just ditch the experimental project and continue to make Rust legacy a lot better than it is now I think they could resurrect what Rust once was. c,Rust
2016-01-27,0,0,579,False,Recommended,I have 575 hours logged into Rust as of now.This game was in development for over 3 years and every two weeks for every single month with only a handful of breaks in between they updated and added new stuff. They never ever gave up on the game and even included Community updates and reached out to fans to promote fan art and content creators. They listened to the community and made changes and tried new things in the end they succeeded. I have played every iteration of Rust from the VERY VERY early to the zombies rad animals and the new version which premiered as vast empty fields where you ran around with only a bolt action rifle without being able to aim down sights firing bullets that arked like tennis balls and glowed like star wars lasers.While I guess the final version of the Legacy Rust is going to be something people talk about in reviews I say this is the better version. Legacy is forever burned into my memory. I spent countless hours playing it with a friend who passed away before the new version came to be so I understand the memories and quirky charm it had. But aside from that it lacked content and it lacked more refined mechanics.Garry Newman wanted to create a successor to Day Z after he was frustrated by the lack of updates the game had and wound up redefining the survival genera. What started as a zombie game turned into a brutal social sandbox where some of the most complicated interactions I have ever had with other users in a video game occurred. Factions wars rivalries pranks trolling and even acts of kindness carry weight behind them that few if any game has ever captured before.In a weird way you almost learn about human behavior where 0 accountability and high stakes pushes some people into becoming monsters. How massive groups of people faction together form alliances break them and in some cases resulting in civil wars. The randomly generated terrain are nice but what really gets me are the buildings. You can come across bases some that rival small cites completely abandoned with an odd player building a small fort inside of it. I have found fully realized towns with signs layouts and even a giant shrine. It was abandoned and had walls missing from rockets it felt eerie to wonder what had happened and why. Exploring the decaying remains of a these once impregnatable fortress always feel fresh and interesting like exploring an abandoned ship hoping to find some treasure inside.This game is not for everyone. It is harsh brutal and unpredictable like nature. No other survival game captures the feeling of raw nature like rust where each experience or encounter can lead to unforgettable stories.,Rust

2017-03-30,0,0,312,False,Recommended,Honestly an amazing game. Worth the $20 i spent on it. The game is not easy to start especially on vanilla but after a bit you will get the hang of it. I like how there is modded and vanilla so that you can play casually or a little less casually.Update after it left early access Game looks so beautiful i was on potato settings and it still looked great. Not the easiest to run i have a decent laptop and cannot run the game at 60fps with medium settings. Only about 30 at medium settings. On potato i can run 60 smoothly though. Now since the new uodate potato looks great so dont worry you aren't missing out by lower to potato.The one problem is that about 95% of the population is extremely rude but the other 5% (not including roleplayers) will help you start and continue the game which is a great help.Also i have no friends so..... playing solo is rough when im not good at PvP.,Rust

2017-08-31,0,0,1051,False,Not Recommended,In short no end game repetitive gameplay you need to commit to gaming daily npcs are too easy solo trios are penalized by not being in a big enough group zerg focused gameplay updates never fixed player concerns and they hardly got addressed overall stale game after one or two wipes not worth the $30+ pricetag it has i got it on special for $10 atleast I got my moneys worth before the game took a nosediveGame was decent before now it penalizes you if you cannot commit to gaming daily. Back then you could join a server late and still be able to compete with other players now you start out handicaped and have to grind an insane amount to even compete. It seems that update after update the developers want to emphasize that you need to be in a zerg inorder to have a chance in the game as progression in a zerg is way too quick example zerg can get end game items day one while a solo trio can't get all end game items by next wipe unless you join a montly wipe server which tend to be empty because zergs end up being too powerful and snowball. Biggest issue of game is there really is no end game and game gets too repetitive after your second or third wipe. Needs more npcs that make the game harder for both heavily geared players and beginers. After you get above bow phase the animal npcs are no threat the other npcs aren't that good either as you can easily dodge the tank and the helicopter won't attack you if you unequip items there is no real difficulty in this game from the environment. Just stale gameplay. Even pve servers for people who like the roleplaying aspect of the game is way too boring as the wildlife isn't challenging.,Rust

2015-12-26,0,0,769,True,Recommended,"Rust is an AMAZING game and if you have a really good PC then I highly recommend you purchase it. It is one of the best 3D multiplayer survival games. There are a lot of items you can play around with and you can design your own base however you want. The graphics are clear and crisp and the combat is intense. You can see the bright tracers light people up in the air. The gun sounds are realistic and loud. They are also balanced in recoil damage and range. A problem with the game is that on a lot of servers there are huge clans that I call ""Server Monopolies"" which basically dominate the server by taking over smaller groups and individual's. It is easy to get raided by them and you would have to be online a lot to keep track of your base. Other than that Rust is a great highly competitive game and I recommend you play with friends in a group because it is hard to survive solo on large servers.",Rust

2018-05-28,0,0,1580,False,Recommended,"Rust...Rust is a mean game! If you like to give up easily this game isn't for you. If you don't want to grind and whine about having to do it this game isn't for you. If you suck at PvP and don't want to try to get better this game isn't for you.I wanted to give up my first week playing it. But I also mostly play solo.. which makes this game way more difficult and at times annoying. But in that challenge is what makes Rust a great game. When you succeed and make good progress Rust gives a very rewarding feeling of accomplishment. So I stuck with it. Everybody has their favorite aspects of the game. Personally I like base building and grinding for better BP's. The PvP is awesome even though I suck at it. It's a struggle.. which if this world was a reality it would be just as it is. You'd have good people (friendly) and your bad people (toxic..KOS) It is what it is. To find the balance you want you have to find the right server to play on. I have almost 1000 hours on record and I'm still not ready for large official servers. I don't blame the game. It's mostly because I don't have many Steam friends to join up and tackle the game. You will not make it long playing solo on a busy server. If you're new start out on a slow server. It will be easier to learn the grind build a base you prefer and have an easier time earning higher tier BP's. Eventually this will get boring as you will want to see more action. From there you just need to give it a try. If you have a good group of Steam friends that will enjoy playing with you then it will be even more enjoyable. Yes there are toxic players and clans that will make your life a living hell. But it is what it is. It's meant to be a gritty survival game. But again there are servers with admins that try to control the experience so it's enjoyable for all who play. You just have to sift through them. Most important you need to join during fresh wipes. If you join a server that hasn't been wiped for a while it is just going to be an uphill battle. But if you stick with it you'll find a server with a good group of MATURE people that offer challenge but don't aim to just be a D**k and keep killing you. Overall..Great graphics. I play on ""good"" setting and it still runs and looks amazing.Gameplay mechanics and physics are excellent. Not perfect but better than a lot of other games I've played. If you enjoy base building and foritfying this game is excellent for that.and the overall experience depends on your attitude and the server you play on. There are well balanced servers that allow the game to be enjoyable you just have to find the one that gives you the balance you're looking for. It is certainly challenging and if you embrace that and don't whine about it then Rust is the game for you!The only things I would change is tweak the sulfur to GP cost by 25%. And raise the % of finding higher tier weopons. It's hard enough to get them but then you need to research them. I don't think this will hurt gameplay but up the fairness for newer players to secure better weapons to defend themselves. Especially if they're joing later in a wiped server.9.5/10",Rust

Expect to die and lose your stuff in Rust no matter what server you are in. People are ruthless here and that's just the way it is.

2017-01-14,0,0,480,False,Not Recommended,Don't do it don't buy it just do not. This game is incredibly PVP oriented but not in a fun aspect. The community is the most toxic i have ever seen. Anyone with a normal life job school responsibilities etc will not have a good time because you will spend 6+ hours a day grinding for resources to build a base and then get on by someone who spends every wake moment of their life playing this game who simply wipes your base to nothing. This game takes too much and is only for a small niche of people willing to invest their life to it. I know i did wasted a whole summer playing it. Once you buy this game you marry it. So in one last ditch effort to save others from the blackwhole of time that is this game i urge you to just buy something else instead or better yet not waste 35 dollars to have hundreds of hours of your life wasted to amount to nothing.,Rust

2018-02-17,0,0,213,False,Not Recommended,I've had this game sence early to mid 2016 and at this point this game has lost it's charm for me. First rason and is the biggest problem I have with this game is the terrible community. For example I spawned in once after a wipe had nothing but my good old rock ok 2 guys fully geared with ak's come up to me and kill me. They said I was a threat to them. I thought to myself HOW THE F*CK IS A GUY WITH NOTHING BUT A ROCK A THREAT TO 2 GUYS FULLY GEARED WITH GUNS. This is one example. This has probably happened to me thousand's of times by now and now its just annoying. To me the only fun I have in this game now is playing and chilling on pve servers actually interacting with other players. I swear I've had more fun pve servers comunicating and teaming up with other people in the server to destroy the heli and the apc/tank. If you're willing to spend possibly hours or even days of work and possibley have it all go away in a matter of minutes sure go ahead get this game.,Rust

2017-11-22,0,0,559,False,Not Recommended,Rust is A fun game when you sit down with your friends and have a good time there are many things to do in rust from hitting trees to killing naked people who just woke up. While rust is a good game and it excels where many other survival games have failed such as good graphics monthly promising updates and a excelent dev team at the ready it also has alot of flaws and somewhat feels not ready. The Game is good dont get me wrong i still enjoy and play this game but its current updates have been turning me off from playing. It is almost impossible to play as a solo player now its been said multiple times and im saying it now rust with friends is rust without friends rust is not playable in its current state your better off becoming a pvp legend with no base. in the most recent update where player bodies float i dont know if it is a servers issue or not but stuff doesnt float when it should boats are a good step in the direction of rust but theyre so uncontrolable its terrible. A.I driven players (scientists) are a good idea but in their current form no road or powerline is safe from anyone as they will shoot theire pistol like an ak and have the accuracy of a hacker. chinook event is cool and helps alot of new players catch up but at the moment ive seen bradley kill the chinook 5 times leaving the crate up for anyone who can go in begin the hack and hide under the rocket for 15 minutes. the decay whilest it has been nerfed is still too high for these big bases the biggest base probobly houses 500 chests and is easily broken into. tool cupboard still has a very low amount of slots that you can put stuff into. and its starting to become a one base beats all scenario. now i love this game i really do but i feel like the game shouldnt have been rushed out of EA along with other titles such as subnautica which in itself should also be looked at before purchase.,Rust

2018-06-10,0,0,109,False,Recommended,The fun of this game depends on the kind of server you find. You can go from the most toxic kill on sight no chance to farm hellscape that forces you mute voice chat to a zombie apocolypse server where strangers running by rescue you from certain death and throw you some meat and a pickaxe before they're back on their merry way to stock their RP weapon shop. Best played with friends for raids and base building although you can go solo on the right server (with fewer people milling about looking to oneshot strays). With the right friends it can be fun to be killed gathering wood or have your stolen from strangers because of the ridiculousness of it. You can plot revenge raids and create trap bases that force players to off themselves to get free. Be creative for maximum fun.However I got tired of the obligatory server resets erasing all of my work and having to start from zero constantly. It was nice to start fresh for awhile because it put everyone including the decked out players/teams back on even playing field but that doesn't last long. Eventually I was just over mining for stone and metal frags just to strengthen my base to protect more stone and metal frags inside my base.After awhile the game just never offered anything more than mindless farming and anxious visits to common loot areas trying to avoid getting killed while you have 250 scrap in your pack. Still worth playing for awhile. Try different servers don't trust anyone and save your scrap.,Rust

Knocked on the door.... he opened the door shot me and said my house you go build new house... 10/10 would respawn asking for my house again.Edit Been playing rust for awhile now I must say I would never play on FacePunch servers Community and modded servers are the best. 100 Airplanes modded server is by far the worst experience I've had playing this game. Stay away from anything related to MeatCircus. Modded servers are fun but server owners are uckers. Rusty Forest x10 is a horrible server and I would not recommend supporting that server admin plays on server and builds in rocks have proof if you want to see.Edit July 25th 2016This game has gone from pretty good to a compete game with the new xp changes. I'm sorry but exp systems in survival games is not appealing at all. Should have just let the way it was. If its not broken don't with it. The owner of this company is a complete ing joke and doesn't listen to the community at all when it comes to feed back. Get your ing together FB before you lose your entire playerbase. Struggles out.Heres an update Modded Servers are corrupt and a waste of time poor admins and staff. I wouldn't recommend and modded servers at this time. Rusty Forest is yet another server who has admin abuse and abusing staff I would not recommend playing on that server or donating. I wasted $40.00 usd never again will i donate to a server. Admin abuse and cheating.. Proof of admin building in rocks with a clan on server. PM for proof.Edit Sept 15th 2016So I played Rust the other day and since they have a componet system now its not that bad. Much better than bp's and exp. Modded servers are still an overall show... speaking of which I got all my donation money back from that corrupt Rusty Forest Server. ) them. Other than that its a decent game.Edit Nov 28th 2016 Garry Newman. Don't like negative reviews don't be a twat. #PCGamer article.2018/02/09 Glad to finally see it come out of early access.,Rust

2015-10-16,0,0,545,False,Not Recommended,This game is far from leaving early access and they still did it. The game lacks content and for me it's not fun anymore I still remember those old days when Rust used to be my main game to play but now I don't even see the point of playing it. Know this All servers have to be wiped after 4 to 7 days if the server has few players (not talking about vanilla servers which are a pain in the anyway) after all the work you have done you can say goodbye to all your stuff and start over. This has become a slave simulator in which you are the slave to yourself it's not fun sure the game looks pretty if you have the juice to run it at its best for some time it looked like they were only working on graphics which i can't even say how much i don't ing care and now they even started working on a NEW GAME... Yes bois a new game RUST themed but in a ing Fantasy World...What can i say good job leaving early access.,Rust

2018-06-07,0,0,1409,False,Recommended,This is a great game if you are looking to play with friends and have a good time that is about it. With the recent update of the scrap and blueprint system it is impossible to play this game solo. You have to grind and gather so much stuff to get guns but you can lose it in a instant if you run into someone with a gun while you are running home with the last scrap to learn a blueprint.

If you're new to Rust it's an exercise in repeated death and frustration.

2015-05-21,0,0,1428,False,Recommended,I couldn't think of what to say that hasn't already been said so here's a poem depicting my time on Rust We team up or go solo we gather some stuff build our base hoping it's safe and not hollow.We hit barrels my god how we hit barrels naked people with guitars singing christmas carols.We can be serious but also immature a blast with friends but time consuming that's for sure.We always come back to Rust promise ourselves we won't sometimes a break from rust becomes a must.We gain some stuff we lose some stuff in the end I had enough. A continuous cycle of raiding towns fighting clowns probably still worth the 15 pounds.I enjoyed it for the most part it will always hold a special place in my heart but for now Rust and I must part.If you have a lot of spare time I recommend this game but for me it's a shame I don't have the time to play the game.It's not a bad game it's not a great game it's just a game that will cause you endless amounts of pain and possibly make you go insane.But that's Rust That's Rust. Don't get salty when you get raided or shot don't get angry if you die from being too cold or too hot not every headshot is someone cheating with a bot!Enjoy the game don't be a pain can we try and treat each other the same?

2016-01-24,0,0,289,True,Not Recommended,Rust is fun but really bad for a game in alpha. The game is badly optimized my brother plays the game maxed out with a gtx 670. I have 1000 times better computer and i play at lowest and the game will still lag soo bad that not even my computer can work. The game lags and gives you server errors eac disconnected so that you would have to go into the game files give the game administator permmision turn off your antivirus and then launch it from steam. The servers are ing trash. My character throws his tools randomly. The servers do never contain blueprints and all that. All servers are pretty empty no stone it s impossible to find something good expect for some servers. And when you go look at videos where people find these barrels that they can break and get bows and canned food. You will almost never find what you see in this game. You will die almost instanly. I spawn and mine a tree for 5 secs later im dead. And that happens everytime. Everywhere you go there is a base. The game map is so empty. And you will almost never find anyone expect for someone who has built a base and kill you the second you spawn. I know the game is in alpha but Oh god horribe. Try to find your friend get shoot. The admins abuse. And it s filled with hackers. The things that happen on videos are something you will never find.,Rust

2017-11-25,0,0,126,True,Recommended,This is a game where developers work actively to improve gameplay all the time there's strong relationship between playerbase and developers that probably I haven't seen anywhere else.I love the fact that I can host my own server to play with my friends on the other hand when playing on public servers it's so much a fps/pvp/raid system that makes you want to just stop playing. If you don't or can't work with other friends to build a base and defend yourself and even more if you join a server after it has been online without being wiped for a couple of days it becomes frustrating because everyone will just try to shoot you dead even if you just spawned and had nothing but a stone and a torch.I actually liked when zombies were reintroduced for Halloween they were a nice addition especially when playing in my own server.,Rust

I understand its early access but its been over 5 months since the freezing and it still haven't been fixed. They're more worried on stupid items to put in the game than to focus on the one bug that other people have had since then.

2017-12-02,0,0,294,True,Recommended,i love this game i think it is amazing since there are options of what you can do you can be a person that relies off the land and drops or a raider and murderer. i like modded games that have the chance of no wipes but i still like the wipes on other servers. overall i really love this game and it is really fun!,Rust

I enjoy the crafting system along with the blue prints to learn new things. I like playing with my brother and his friends because it adds a level of immersion to the game. Either work together or kill each other. So far I've meet really cool players here but again it depends on the server if your a new player. I recommend you head over to the community servers that are noob friendly many players will be glad to help! Also the game is good that I had to host my own Rust server now I get both of best worlds.

Hobbled away swam across the currents of the river and attacked another survivor hoping his house might have some bandages and food. He ran away screaming. House had nothing.Found a few corpses and found some clothes a steel mace and a bandana. Found a cave and went to sleep. Was killed in my sleep.Woke up by a abandoned port. Found a derelict ship. As the sun fell found a place to hide inside the ship. In the distance a wandering torch. Coming closer. Approached the torch and then suddenly the aggressor's torch went out. Doused my torch and took out a nasty weapon found in a box in the derelict. Complete darkness. Lit up my torch BAM I reel back half dead. He was waiting for me after all.Doused my torch got down on my knees waiting. The shadow of the nearby moon lit the figure's shadow. Swiped madly but nothing just air. The figure had disappeared and I was alone. Again.Found a quiet abandoned house and went to sleep. Woke up. Found a cave that went into the earth for an endless depth. Tripped and fell down a long long chasm. Not sure how I survived. Found a pair of binoculars. Progress stopped with an enormous pit cross hatched with broken beams.Very very cold down here.Jumped across. Tripped and fell to the bottom of the pit. Could hear bones break. Crawled back up. Leaped again. Twisted my ankle and fell. but this time couldn't get up.

2016-04-04,0,0,545,True,Recommended,"After logging 300+ hours of this game I finally entered the Rustopia server with 3 friends. We spawn naked and afraid...there is 290 people online in this server. One of us gets lucky and gets a bunch of cloth which means he can make sleeping bags for the other 2 guys (sleeping bags acts as spawn points when you die). So we go in to the consol and suicide and spawn in the bags.We're at a beach. It looks beatiful as the sun is setting. But there is no time to marvel at the graphics. Time to farm materials to build a little cabin. As our cabin is taking shape and the tool cupboard is down (the tool cupboard acts as a building blocker for anyone who isnt authorized on it) we venture out with bows and encounter our neighbours not far away. They viciously attack us with crossbows and waterpipe shotguns. One of us goes down in a heartbeat and starts screaming on the ground...Im thinking to my self we are ed. I cant get to him and save him in time but I can revenge his death. Me and my friend who is still alive keep our distance and headshot all 3 attackers and kill them. I scream in TS as I loot them and the adrenaline is pumping. We get a ton of loot and enter our cabin and hide the loot.Our 3rd friend who died spawns in again after a 200sec wait and we venture of to farm animals for animal fat and cloth. As we are up on a hill we encounter a naked man with a rock. My ptsd instantly kicks in from the fight before and I put an arrow in his shoulder. He screams ""Im friendly please dont kill me!!"". I come to my senses. Now we're standing there in a circle trying to apologize to this naked man with a rock.In my periferal vision I see a person with a waterpipe shotgun and a metal facemask. It must be our trigger happy french neighbours. I yell attack and charge with my own waterpipe and crosbow.The chase is on. The metal face maske is retreating in a military fashion swivelling between bushes and rocks.Oh no...it's a trap. My hot temper finally got to me. There is 3 of them. They are all attacking us...and somehow the naked guy with the rock is taking advantage of the situation as well as he is chasing me with his rock trying to bash my head in. But the 3 people that just attacked us is now fighting each other as well. What is going on...is my last thought as I get an arrow in the head.My two friends rage quit and do a fresh spawn and try to build somewhere else. I do not. I spawn in at the cover of darkness and return to our cabin. It has been raided by who I can only presume is our french neighbour. I do a pitty knock on the door and say hello in the most pathetic way...A teenage boy awnsers. Clearly not french...maybe dutch?He asks me if I want to come inside and hide during the night. He has a fire going and some food on the way.I accept.As I enter my old cabin I see that it has been redecorated. Nothing fancy just different. I tell the boy I use to live here. After some talking we realise that he was the metal face mask from before...My ptsd from the french got the better of me and I attacked an innocent bystandard that was just there to farm some animals.As we come to terms with the whole ordeal he invites me to his base. As we are about to leave the cabin as the sun is rising there is a knock on the door...I think to my self ""What now!?"".It's a russian dude. He is saying ""Hello...come out plz...is iz new player""I say to my new friend ""It's a trap dude dont open the door man..."". We device a plan that I will be his meatshield as I have nothing to lose. He opens the door and hides behind it as I peek out. I see the russian dude.Behind him in a brush there is a guys in hide clothes with a waterpipe shotgun. He blasts me in the face as my newly found friend closes the door just in time for me to no die.We're stuck...we're like a fox in a fox den just waiting to be smoked out. I realize I have a sleeping bag at the beach from before so I say good bye to my newly found friend and die. I spawn at the beach use my stealth to get back to the cabin. I see the naked russian and the guy with the waterpipe.I yell ""CHARGE!!!"" and rush him with my rock. I hit the waterpipe guy in the head as my new friend rush out of the cabin and starts blasting him with a waterpipe shotgun. The enemy is dead and I get his loot. The naked russian is no where to be found...sly son of a .My new friend takes me to his fortress. Outside is a little 2x3 house that has a sign on it ""Fighters Camp"". I get a room in it with a bed and some storage. One other guy joins in as a fighter as well thru the global chat system on the server. As we settle in its time to head back to the god awful place I once called home...to farm some animals. Its me the other fighter and our lord and savior the teenage boy that rescude me from this tragedy.We farm an animal or two with our bows as we see a naked person with spear. It fits the description of the naked russian we encounter. We take pursuit.But not for long...7 FULLY GEARD people with ak's shows up behind a hill. We got to focused on reveng and let our guards down. The other fighter goes down with a headshot while the dutch boy screams ""RUUUN!!!"". I do as he says no further explanation needed.The dutch boy goes down...he screams. I'm to affraid to turn back to help him. I hear the finishing shots as he dies.I run...for about 1 2 minutes. I think they lost my trail. NO...they are close. I come up to a circulare base with a geared guy. I beg him to let me in so I can survive this onslaught. He says nothing.I hide in a bush outside his base as I hear the fully geared guys run past me. As I'm collecting my thoughts and trying to figure out how I will find my way back to camp I hear the door open to the base. The fully geared guy who did nothing to help me comes out. I greet him and he greats me. One of his friends comes out...he is naked. I walks up to me as I am about to greet him...he pulls out a hatchet and says "" you"" with a russian accent. As I see the hatchet coming at me I realise its the russian from before...but its to late.I ragequit. 10/10 will play again tomorrow.",Rust

2018-07-13,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Toilet paper orientationA toilet paper roll has two possible orientations the toilet paper may hang over (in front of) or under (behind) the roll if perpendicular to the wall the two orientations are right left or near away. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference dictated by habit. In surveys of US consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists 60 70 percent of respondents prefer over. 1 Some people hold strong opinions on the matter advice columnist Ann Landers said that the subject was the most responded to (15 000 letters in 1986) and controversial issue in her column's history. Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics hospitality and cleanliness to paper conservation the ease of detaching individual squares and compatibility with setting specifics such as recreational vehicles or having pets. Some writers have proposed connections to age sex or political philosophy and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.Solutions range from compromise to using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms entirely or simply ignoring the issue altogether. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.,Rust

2016-12-10,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,Buy at your own risk. And please read reviews before you buy this game. The community is TOXIC.Any random servers it's very likely you're going to be killed on sight. KOS is everywhere. Not if you're a newspwan or a collector. Highly possible to get killed on sight with no question asked. The game has a mature building mechanics and plentiful items and nice graphics it's possbily by far the most developed survival/Early Access game out there. I personally think the game is like an upgraded Minecraft with a lot of matture building and construction mechanics. But gameplay has been bogged down to the pleasure of KOS there's no fun at all if you play at a populated server and trynna take 2 or 3 hours to get your own residence done. Because either way you're going to get killed by strangers at the process OR found out you're lying on a beach with nothing else after you log off the game for some time.Very unfriendly to new players. So there's some noob servers take some time to find one but whatever got killed either in noob server. No learning curve at all because you're just constantly getting killed don't even bother to learn the basics of the game. Unless you open your own server and lock it play a single player. If you enjoy raid and constantly getting killed buy this game. If you just want to build somethings or play nice don't even think about it.,Rust

Either you're forced to play on a community server that constantly wipes your blueprints and thus any progress you've made.

They can tweak the loot tables and such but ultimately modded servers will be completely different anyway so someone who wants the ""core"" Rust experience is forced to choose an official server that will always be hacker infested and subject to ddos.Also the community has gotten worse every year and exponentially worse since it left EA.",Rust

First off the performance issues I got a decent laptop that runs most AAA titles on the highest preset at 60+ fps but rust it fails to maintain that value even on the lowest preset additionally the game lacks actual end game content. There is no true motiv to reach the top other than raiding fresh people and making their days crappy. Overall game is good but fix the perfomance issues and add more content.,Rust

2018-04-06,0,0,20,False,Not Recommended,TLDR I want to like it but it just isn't fun due to the necessity of constant activity in the server you are on or a large group of people to split the activity 24/7. Overall I hated the experience with the game (other than the guitar. That's a gem). On top of this the community is extremely toxic. I really wish this game was enjoyable to me because the idea is wonderful but it just isn't enjoyable. I played the game about a half a year or so ago with some friends and it was relatively enjoyable. That was until we had to get back to our usual lives and were therefore unable to be on relatively consistently. At that point we ended up loosing everything rebuilding to an even further point loosing everything again rebuilding again and then loosing it all again. This was a result of us not being on at 3 o'clock in the morning and therefore getting raided and killed with absolutely nothing we could do about it. I then uninstalled the game because I didn't feel like wasting hours of my time trying to build stuff up only to loose it because I'm unable to be online 24/7. After a year and a half I decided to try it agian per my buddy's request. This time I come to another conclusion that is very similar. We tried to start and found a server that was relatively busy but not overly populated. Each time when trying to meet up we would get attacked and killed by people with guns and bows and all that with high end gear. This was on a server that had been wiped the day before. We kept trying but after about the 7th or so time trying to meet up I decided to once again uninstall the game as it just isn't fun at all. Not to mention the community is overly toxic. At one point a clan of about 20 or so people teamed up on me and my two friends and hunted us down even after killing us once and us moving elsewhere. It just isn't enjoyable. You build everything up only to have it taken away without any chance to stop it. If you were able to play the game with only your group of friends easily it would probably be amazing but in its current state it is absolutely terrible. I hate to say that because I want to like it as the concept is nice but the execution is terrible. I shouldn't have to play the game 24/7 in order to progress. I shouldn't have to have a rotating team of people to always be online so that I don't loose everything for actually living a real life. In the moments were my friends and I were actually able to play the game we absolutely loved it (especially the guitar. That's the highlight). So overall it's an interesting take on this style of game but it just isn't enjoyable if you can't dump tons of time into the game or if you don't have a large team (probably around 10 or so people) to rotate activity. I wish I could like this game but I just can't. It's not fun to build everything up with your friends only to have it ripped away when none of you are on because you can't be on all the time.,Rust

2017-10-07,0,0,2625,True,Recommended,This game is fantastic. The PVP is intense the sounds are realistic. I actually hate pvp but my husband loves it and I do go with him at his request to hunt players. I get soooo scared in pvp in this game because you can actually lose things that you've worked hard to earn. Some people may think that's a con but honestly I believe that the ability to lose your time is a boon in games. The fear aspect makes your heart race and makes it exiting. So many times we've gotten angry and quit over pvp only to come back because there are so many aspects of it that we love that keep us coming back.Personally I love the building. I love creating as massive a base as we can designing it to be a maze. We try different methods to make it more secure each time we build. I love the upgrading of the base. I love the farming tool crafting hunting animals even if on some servers the navmesh is disabled and they are stationary. We enjoy trying to snipe animals from as far away as possible. Fighting the helicopter is so thrilling. I used to just shoot at it to have it engage me because I would laugh out loud at parts of my base falling to pieces when it gets napalmed. Now we actually build towers and reinforce them to take it out.Many people complain about the recent update. I enjoy it so far. I believe it slows down the game a bit. It used to be that when a server wiped you'd have the players that server jump just to build get guns make one or two c4 and raid your base early. Now they have to actually play for an amount of time to do anything and time invested yields reward.I find it amusing that someone gave the game a negative review calling it garbage after he played it for 1 000 hours. My only guess is that he rage quit as we often have and wrote a review while upset. I certainly wouldn't invest 1000 hours in a game that I call garbage. This game is cheap and is amazing. But you need friends or a companion to play it with you. That's when it's is amazing. I only enjoy it alone when there are no players to fight against (Dead server) I actually purchased a server recently with the intention of it being just my husband and me playing on the server and was surprised that apparently buying a premium server with great ping brings flocks of players. I live in fear (and excitement) but I organize and strengthen our base and sneak around farming as my husband pvps and draws me from my nest to occasionally scout for enemies as he burns down doors.,Rust

2015-05-26,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,well what can i say? The game has a community with bullyish players (Subjective to server) There is still t physics like a pig running directly up a hill despite they had the time to add features like temperature control when you stand on water or in snow (spawning in a snowy environment is near impossible).left the game for several months still awful.Frys your Gpu (Amd) even lowering the settings on a new Driect x11 card it still crashes and has poor support.Waste of 15. Go Buy Reign of Kings,Rust
2018-01-06,0,0,110,True,Recommended,I can recommend this game if you have at least 4 friends to play with and you are into resource gathering and progression in techs and so on. It's cool learning the blueprints and grinding for items and blue prints. It's a good time coordinating with friends in a more serious version of minecraft to put it that way.I cannot recommend this game if people that kill you on sight are going to trigger you. Or if everybody double crosses you at every turn. Build up a small community that farms together and has each others backs and kill on sight yourselves and raid the hell out of people that annoy you. Otherwise you are wasting your time since going to the places with good loot will get you killed. Gathering resources will get you killed. Spawning will get you killed. Dedicated PVE servers would suite a certain player base and that player base that wants to play PVE will have a very hard time getting anywhere that feels accomplished in Rust,Rust

2016-12-07,0,0,174,True,Recommended,First off I'm just going to say this is easily the most fun game I've ever played. The community is not toxic I think a lot of these new players giving bad reviews don't realize that this is a survival game... you never know who is going to try and kill you and what they have up their sleeve. It really isn't very hard to get started even solo and build a decent base but you can't expect everyone you encounter to want to help you because that's just delusional. The beauty of this game is it's crazy pvp and the rivalries formed to battle for territory 11/10 would recommend to anyone who isn't going to cry about getting killed in a pvp game. Kill or be killed good luck.,Rust
2014-08-14,0,0,1025,True,Recommended,"2ND EDIT OF REVIEW Being a fan of this game for years i cant express how happy i am for the game to finally leave Early Access. The variety in weapons and NPC's is pretty nice and i cant wait to see if Ruin will be finished. Vehicles being added to the game is a pretty big deal and will change the entire way we play Rust. More hostile ""human"" NPC's being added to the game is nice and hopefully soon (havent checked the roadmap yet) scientists being added will be a very welcome change. Definitely a 7.5 for me.",Rust

2015-05-09,0,0,816,True,Recommended,Game just became one of my favorite games of all time. The new component system makes it so you cant dominate a server just by having more playtime on any given server for the most part. The new max group 1 2 3 4 5 servers make it so you and your tightly knit group of friends can thrive and not get dominated by groups of 20+. Best survival game yet imo. BUY IT. Some servers do have admin abuse going on so if you run into admin abuse just report it to facepunch and continue searching for a fair and balanced server. I recommend playing servers with LOTS of components so that you can make armored doors easier because whether or not someone can raid you depends on how much sulfur they can get and how little armored doors you can make.,Rust

With this recent blue print update I feel the amount of scrap for things is a bit high. But after all of the game reviewing it and looking at it I wouldn't trade Rust for anything because Rust is all around to fun I highly recommend finding a good group of people to play with solo in Rust is very hard so for a just starting out player try finding someone who will take you in and help you granted it will be very hard but if you try hard enough you will find the special someone. Rust is a great and amazing game and I feel everyone should at least give it a chance and form there oppinions around that.

2016-12-27,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Its alright.Probably one of the more basic survival games out there. easy to play.All you have to do is play for a weeks (unless you are on a modded server) Build up supplies then raid your neighbors while they are offline.I feel like there needs to be offline raid protection. maybe there is? but ive not seen any servers like that.This is kinda discouraging for new players. You come into a game get set up collect resources log off and go to bed. Then wake up and all your stuffs gone and now there are holes and doors blown out every where. But once you get settled and learn how to secure your items and base a little more the games experience changes for the better. I dont feel there is any buyers remorse for buying this at full price. But i would recommend holding out a little for a sale price.,Rust

2016-08-15,0,0,1935,False,Not Recommended,Great game! Its a extreamly unique game you have traditional survival stuff like food and thirst but you also have stuff unique to Rust such as the Patrol/Attack chopper (There the same thing but people call them both) and supply drops that make for real blood baths! The developers will liston to the community on most changes but as it says in the games description its only early access and alot is broken and will be changed but they have a vison and to trust them. And boy have they delevered! Some people b**** about how there is no single player but when your game is based on pvp and player interaction then why would you have a single player? Also if you looking for a game with friendly people you might want to look some where else because almost everybody in rust has a hidden agenda if they dont kill you on sight then their probably looking to kill you later. The game is great solo but can get stale after a while but if you have even just 1 friend to bounce jokes and gather resourses with it makes the game SOO much more fun. Also if you dont like people stealing your s*** then rust might not for you. People will as we call it Raid you also know as blow into your base and steal your gear and materials. All you have to do is be able to get over losing gear if you do then rust is a great game. Comment if you have any questions and Ill reply as soon as posibleEdit This review was made back in the day. Back in the good times of rust. Back when the game wansn't a full time job. But those days are gone long gone. Now adays to be successful you have to not only play in groups you have to live in your parents basement and play the game 24/7. The way that the devs took the building makes it impossible to build big and if you try your base will become an actual job just to keep from decaying. Then you have the hackers. The people who get hacks kill the whole server for days sometimes even weeks before an admin decides theyre too good to be legit. Like when you get headshot from 1000+ kilometers multiple times by the same person something isnt right yet its just left to happen because... well there isn't an answer to that question. Its just left to happen. With the way the rust devs have taken the game I cant see myself playing it anymore and I DO NOT recommend any of you to. Its a chore and isn't something I find myself wanting to play becasue I have a life I have friends to talk to school work to do sleep to get. I like most people cant afford to play the game for 200 hours plus per two weeks just to get a good base. Its dumb and Im not going to put myself through it anymore. Facepunch yall had a great game and I thank you for the countless hours of fun I had meeting and killing people but this will probably be my final goodbye to this game. Its sad and I bid you farewell my friends,Rust

When Experimental becamse ""the new thing"" and tried to replace Legacy completely I was not having it and was kind of turned off of the game for some time... During a spur of the moment decision that changed my life I redownloaded Rust and HOLY CRAP! Experimental Rust (Or just Rust as it is called now...) is awesome. It kept everything that was great about the original rust and amplified it x1000. Uploaded a tour of my bases here https //www.youtube.com/watch?v DlfL91qy loOwning my own server I am able to choose from an insane amount of ""map seeds"" which gives each server a differnet experience and the added danger of taking a missile to the face from a helicopter or tank really keeps you on your toes.

2015-03-09,0,0,208,True,Not Recommended,This is a good game but I don't think this game is great. It has easy and fun crafting methods fun building and raiding /looting. Some people will go as far that they will cheat and hack the game for loot and raid which means they will destroy your built building in impossible ways. While no building is unraidable lesson learned. But when people hack and then fly to the top of and seriously high building and then use millions of explosives to completely obliterate your house which was designed in a spesific way. This kind of destroys this game and makes it pretty bad and frustrating. Yes yes I know this is in alpha but this problem should be fixed above all else in my opinion because this is otherwise a good game. Been playing 70 hours but I don't think I will be playing this game and won't recommend this game to anyone yet until that particular problem is fixed.

2018-06-24,0,0,67,False,Not Recommended,"Summary It's like Minecraft 2 but without singleplay and with super toxic communities on every servers.Graphics and Spec The graphics looks very nice only if the graphics settings are high enough.The graphics is very heavy so you will need a super strong gaming setup. I have a laptop with Intel Core i5 8th Gen (i5 8300H) 8GB ram (One slot) and an SSD (M.2). This setup was enough to run the game on Fantastic settings. Of course the ram is not enough but apperently virtual memory or ""swap"" on the SSD was fast enough for me.I've tried to play this game on Linux but it seems like the game crashes during the asset loading. There was an update but I have not checked on a physical Linux machine.Multiplayer Gameplay Get some friends or play on solo only server (mod) because these ing people are not nice. If you really have to play solo on most servers because you got no friends and/or girl/boy/bothfriend(s) then you must get a microphone to minimize a change of getting randomly killed by s. Some of these s ask you to talk in the game through a microphone before they decide to foot you so having a microphone ready is really important. If you decided to play this game without microphone and/or as a solo you will get foot ed by racists feminists communists socialists animal protesters and neo nazis in about every 10 minutes. Simply don't expect these s to show mercy even if you are not wearing anything and have nothing but a rock and a torch because there are a lot of s who loves to shoot newbs with bolt action rifle from long range.Many servers will completely wipe out on Thursdays so if you are starting new then you should wait till it's thursday and then start playing. Yeah it's kinda sad to let go of your super huge base with tons of guns and because 'Murica but it's somewhat necessary to prevent those clans from completely consume the whole server.Gameplay Overall it's fun but you should expect to do a lot of man labor works. You can literally craft everything but you will also need to collect tons of scraps to get all the blueprints for everything. Goodthing is that you can take a short cut by trying to get some air drops and locked crates however if you are on a highly active server expect to see other players targeting the drop and the crate. That's the other fun part too.It's just so fun to go PvP and stuffs for both sides but raiding someone's base is always fun on one side of course. Good thing is that making traps to prevent raids is also the fun part too you know. Seeing some deceased poor dudes with assault rifles and buncha C4 who got foot ed by your traps is also a lot of fun.",Rust

2018-02-03,0,0,256,True,Recommended,This game is crazy. My first time playing I loaded into the game and was immediately murdered by a naked black girl with a rock. I love games that have a decent learning curve with enough opportunity to get going but not too easy. And this game does that. I also like the fact that playing does not allow for you to generate your own character. Like life you are what you are. May seem counter intuitive but I have played games that you could spend an hour getting a new character just right only to find out the playability of the game is boring. So this game flips that on its head. One complaint though is that it takes a long time to load into a game. And I think that when you start loading you are already in the game. I have come across a bunch of people who were just lying there waiting to be murdered (which I was happy to oblige). So there is room for improvement. Also the game supported servers tend to be crowded making newcomers pretty much meat. The upside though is you respawn in a random location if you don't have a sleeping bag to spawn to. SO you can at least respawn away from the last thing person or environmental hazard that killed you.,Rust

2018-01-27,0,0,194,True,Recommended,Been playing rust for about 10/11 days now highly addictive. Played ark for over 400 hours prior to this and although ark is more advance I would say rust is the better game. It s a lot more realistic player contact orientated and more live or die than ark. I personally would prefer to put my 400+ hours of personal time into rust than ark. I ve just day talked my friend who plays the same games as me into giving rust ago and even after less than 3 hours in he loves it! New duo in the picture! Oxton heads! Brilliant game 9/10. But it now before the price goes up!!!!! Much Love Dan Browne,Rust

That will have you screaming in frustration and pulling your hair out. On top of that the community is pure toxic.If you want to enter this game and find a few buds to survive with Forget that. The only thing you will find is a shotgun in the face. I would suggest going into this game with a group of players that you know you can trust and won't steal the clothes off your back.

2018-01-21,0,0,1454,True,Recommended,After playing rust over a time span of 2 years and sometimes taking month breaks due to bugs and glitches that made the game unplayable I have finally decided to write my review as I think the game is finally in a state that is playable and enjoyable.Most people ask is rust worth the money I say yes rust is only $20 and compared to the price of games these days its pretty cheap theres no in game content in rust and the only thing you could spend your money on is skins and cases.Over the years rust has built up its community and development team and for as long as I can remember there has been an update every week. The developers dont stop there is always new content to explore and new things to do if the game ever gets boring you can just wait untill the new update and have more stuff to do and explore with your friends.Cons my only problems with rust is the insane fps drops and insane lag on rust offical servers if you want to play on a offical server just remember theres gonna be hackers and no admins to stop them theres going to be server lag so if you get angry easily go to community and lastly if you have a laptop dont buy this game.If rust gets there servers under control and hires some admins for the offical servers this game could be even better.Lastly if you want a good fun cheap game to play with your friends get rust just remember if you have a laptop the game will not be playable unless you want to turn your graphics down to 2D.,Rust
2018-01-21,0,0,84,True,Recommended,"Its PVP survival game with awesome base building wall by wall. You will die to random people all the time and lose your stuff. I played Reign of Kings before trying Rust so kinda used to that hardship already. After a few times dieing to a smack talking punk while I was holding alot of resources and loot that took me a long time to gather I really lost interest. Its good short term fun though! Got a good laugh the first hour or two fighting other noobs with rocks. If someone was to make an MMORPG with the same kind of base building mechanisms build castles towns etc it would already be a good game. Unfortunately Rust and Reign of Kings are unfinished free for all PVP ""lose it all"" type games and the special building features are getting lost or perhaps type casted into the genre when they could be really great features to another type of game.",Rust

2017-06-14,0,0,2805,True,Not Recommended,My new review Cheaters all over the place at the moment. I can't recommend this game anymore. Just too frustrating to play against aimbots. Like tripple headshot in 1 2 sec with PYTHON from 50 meters from a guy with 200 huours. Bchilz posted video half year ago about graphics exploit and it's still isn't fixed. Devs are focusing cosmetics instead of game breaking things. My old review I am fan of hardcore PVP games and this is one of the best game I ever played. This game shows the primitive nature of modern humans.Attention! This game is not cry baby friendly. You will get killed a lot. You will learn to loose everything you have and live with it. If you play alone (I very recommend to do that dont rush to find team) you will be forced to use your brain to survive hide build plan solo raids scavange scout other players. Community is salty but it's even more fun to beat those salty dudes and make them rage quit hehe. Cheap investment for tons of fun.,Rust

We raided couple of left over buildings found a nice looking mountain party and decided to build there. It was perfect!Everything was going fine until a group of raiders came by and harrased us. I told them to my wife and leave me alone. Instead they Fatima and killed me Hussein. Looted our house and left it burning.We wanted revenge! Rebuilded and found out where they lived.

I used to be an end game wow raider killing raid bosses in greens and blues early on. This game is poorly conceptualized. Is it a survival game? Nope! PvP Surivival. Encourages group play strongly discourages solo play.Mess up a build cannot unbuild your own structure.New Content released? Total server wipe.This game supposedly came out of EA in Feb. 2018. Don't believe it. This is still a crunchy Beta AT BEST.Gotta scavenge for really anything in game. Ok cool I'm good with that. 99% of the things in the game are cosmetic. Beans on the shelf in the store I'm looting HAHA JK there is one box in the entire store you can loot and it has a single granola bar in it.Game is trash from so many perspectives.

In my 600 hours or something I have not faced a single hacker because I never play on official servers. If you arr thinking to buy this game I definetly recommend it and if you are a solo play on solo only servers to make rust life much easier for you. E.g Wilsonator's solo server which does not die quick at the last day of wile expect at least 30 people.,Rust

2018-01-03,0,0,579,False,Recommended,Rust is the best survival game out there. It doesn't only have great looks the gameplay is absolutely amazing. The reason for this is because of how much Facepunch updates their game and how they actually take feedback from the community. Every part of this game is incredible from early game to later in the wipe as the combat evolves from simple bows and spears to heavy weaponry and armour. For some it can be challenging to get started (especially further into map wipes) and most of the random players don't make it easier as they can be toxic at times. Not all players are this way though I've ran into many helpful people.,Rust

You will spend countless hours holding down mouse 1 chopping trees down and collecting stone. Creating a base is one thing you can choose to do or you and some other player can create massive walls around many houses. Create almost kingdom like bases. Create allies or enemys and hunt them all them out. Rule over the whole server or make a cave base and hide from society. There is many things to do in this game and this game gets updated literally every thursday so there is never a lack of content in the game as it gets updated so much. This game is well worth your $20 as long as your start of on a community server is not many people playing then as your skills get better switch to official.,Rust

2014-07-01,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Rust is a fun game for people that are a fan of Minecraft. It is a survival game where you have to survive along with other people on a multiplayer server.(Yes it is MULTIPLAYER ONLY as of right now) It does have the same collect and craft as minecraft but there's alot of other stuff like guns and clothes and things. But because it is only multiplayer it is hard for noobs or people who aren't that great at first person shooters because everybody just kills you the second they get the chance. It also has a few bugs too. Like it gets a little laggy sometimes even on a beefy computer but it is early aplpha and they update it pretty frequently so play at your own risk. I would recommend it though it just depends on who is playing it.,Rust

2015-07-07,0,0,171,True,Recommended,Slight update since I now have a different better PC than before. Still very system intensive have to run on the lowest settings to play it. Reccomend the game if only on sale. Main drawback for me is no single player mode.My PC specs OS Microsoft Windows 10 (build 16299) 64 bit CPU AMD FX(tm) 4300 Quad Core Processor RAM 6.0 GB Video Card NVIDIA GeForce GT 740 Video RAM 4 GBI plan on adding more RAM to my PC soon maybe I will have a better experience then. My 4GB card has no issue with most games of similar age as Rust. I know my RAM is my bottleneck mostly.So yeah I understand my PC is old but I'm on a budget and have to make due. I am NOT giving this game a bad review I am only stating that it doesn't run well on older low end PCs. So those who don't have at least a quad core don't even try this game. The servers are always laggy as crap and I am always getting dc'ed.,Rust

2018-02-08,0,0,485,True,Recommended,"Awesome fantastic survival game. The community is absolute cancer mixed with a strange foreign strain of AIDS with a touch of herpes. Most players are under the age of 18 and kill you on sight without saying a word. The ""Survival"" game is played like some sort of call of duty game running around shooting everything that moves. Takes away from the whole purpose the developers have said the game strives on surivival. Of course PVP is inevitable but to play the game just to kill people just kills the game as a result. Potential to be one of the best survival online games ever but limited by young kids and limited minds who act like literal neanderthals. It's to be expected but not at such a large scale and percentage. Very interesting to be honest from a psychological stand point intriguing. I recommend finding a less cancerous server if you are thinking of buying this game buyer beware.",Rust

2016-04-24,0,0,31,True,Not Recommended,This is a game like many other survivor pvp games. You start with nothing and have to gather materials to make a base. The combat is decent definitely has room to grow in terms of controls hit reg and balancing. You can make a decent base with the materials you gather in the world as well as hunt to feed yourself if you manage to live long enough. For higher leveled tools/weapons/armour you need to gather what are called blueprints to reveal the crafting recipe.Here are the problems You start with only a rock and a torch the torch may as well be useless the light is too low to be useful and you don't exactly want people to know where you are. There are many servers to play on you DO NOT want to play on a populated server you WILL DIE many times. People will not hesitate to gun you down repeatedly. I have not had a situation where I saw someone with a gun not kill someone and 90% of the time they know they get nothing from it. Players will camp the sites where blueprints spawn with the best gear kill on the beaches where you spawn most of the time. The way the game sets it up requires you to play at the very start of a server after the wipe or have a clan. You cannot be successful on your own on a server with more than 50 people.Do not expect a single person to help you. Even if you ask in the chat in the many servers I asked new player questions to see the responses most of the top players of the servers would rather insult and flame the new players rather than help someone in the slightest way. The community has no dignity they will kill you trust means nothing no one owes you anything for anything you do.Developers if you are reading this your game needs to have something you can earn preferrably crafting recipes rather than having all comodities be able to be camped hoarded and trolled. As well as guns are far too common it simply makes it easier for people who know what they are doing to kill new players. This puts off anyone who has a small interest in the game and for those who have higher interests in the game follow suit when they finally get a gun.,Rust
2016-04-24,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,Well made in many respects and improved lots since earlier version but too many annnoying things arm the moments. if you had a large group of friends on it would be fun but for every one else expect to die many times and expect to have your base destroyed many times especially with the helicopter which patrols key locations and if you build a base too close it will destroy your base in seconds.,Rust

2017-06-28,0,0,50,True,Recommended,community is toxic but game is good. completely depends on the server you play on however. you might spend hours building a base only to have it destroyed or die 10 times as soon as you spawn because this game is extremely PVP oriented. you can also have your base destroyed and your body looted even if you're offline. so I'd only recommend this if you are not prone to rage quitting and can deal with the community. its not exactly based on survival as much as it should be instead it is more focused on PVP and killing people. however there are good servers out there with good communities so not everyone is toxic. stuff like towns aren't as common as they may seem. component system for Rust does need a rework as it is not balanced at the moment.,Rust

I had next to no idea what I was meant to be doing but I had a rock and three meters. I spawned in at night on a small beach so I instantly began to freeze and lost a bit of health. Following the coastline I found many houses (in hindsight they were all probably abandoned) and pilfered some pumpkins and corn from a small crop field. I then immediately hightailed it to the mountains and began cutting down some trees for wood. After about 45 minutes of running around and trying to figure out how to cook food I died of food poisoning from stolen food after starving and drinking salty water.Spawn back in again and this time I go straight to looking for food. I found some mushrooms but I guess they belonged to a guy as he shot me with an arrow. I managed to hide inside a bush but I spent the next ten minutes hiding inside of it thinking he was still there until I poked my head out and found out it was a horse. Didn't find any food but I found a player idling on the beach. Died of starvation.This time I went inland. There were a lot of gunshots in the distance and people getting angry over someone cheating. I got shot in the back by a guy with a bow who then apologized thinking that I was a threat and let me go. For whatever reason I thought it would be a good idea to run towards the gunshots. Got scared and hid in another bush. I slowly snuck inside an empty house and took my bearing. Killed a horse (first kill!) and ate it over a fire in the empty shack. I then got out of the warzone and headed towards the beach. I was still pretty hungry so I needed to get some food. After following the beach for some time I found and killed a wild boar who happily dropped four pork for me enough to sustain me for a long time. After chasing down another boar a man saw me shot me berated me for my sloppy fighting (despite never really ever fighting before) and then murdered me with my own spear.I joined a new server (my dignity was low but spirits still high) and went exploring the forests. The people here (if there were people) were a bit more friendly keeping their distance from me. I actually managed to make myself a bow 100 arrows and a burlap suit. But food was another story. I searched every forest and valley for food and all I could find was the occasional mushroom. No deer horse or boar to be seen. I pilfered another pumpkin farm and set to work building a base only to be suprise attacked by a bear and killed. I did build a sleeping bag this time but the bear just turned around and immediately killed me again anyway.After 3 hours 4 or so deaths and 6 or so kills I think I'm done for the moment. This game is fun but I don't think I can get too invested in it what with all the raiding and such.",Rust

The comunity is highly toxic the game is boardline unplayable without wanting to grind for 15+ hours just to make a base and overall isnt a fun game. I would rate a solid 6/10. The game does get right the building and pvp systems. Both systems work beautifly.,Rust

Now you can't get anything from high tier areas without stacking a ing ton of rad pills because the devs implemented that hazmat suits leak a ""little"" amount of radiation over time in certain areas (Try every high tier area and an increase of 1 per every 2 seconds so essentially impossible without spamming rad pills bandages and syringes and sometimes even with that still is impossible). Just makes the grind that much more boring and longer find something better to do with your time than this right now not so good.",Rust

I think he is dead.Rust Ran around naked with a hatchet stalking some guy at night while making scary noises.Rust Spent 3 hours stuck on a rock surrounded by bears until the zombies came. Then I was surrounded by bears and zombies.Rust Everything tastes like chicken.This game is great. Start out with nothing and rise to be the most feared person on the server. This game is still in Alpha but I have already spent many nights trying to master it. There is still room for improvement but I'm sure it'll be amazing on launch day. Join up with friends or be a lone wolf whatever you desire.7/10 as it's still in Alpha but this game will be a smooth 10/10 once it launches.Tips Build yourself a shelter with a furnace campfire and sleeping bag as SOON as possible. Wooden doors can be broken down easily try to make a metal one to ensure your safety.Don't light a fire at night! At least until you are in a very secure building. Fire draws attention and can be seen from leagues away at night.STAY AWAY FROM WELL GEARED PEOPLE. If they approach you be kind hopefully they will spare you.Find resources. Trees Wood Piles large Gray/Brown rocks that spawn Animals... Farm them but remain safe and aware of everything around you. Find a friend and watch each others backs.Don't mess around with people until you are ready to do so. Be well armed and prepare for any situation.Last but not least Have fun. It can be a bit frustrating at first but you'll get the hang of it.,Rust
2017-06-28,0,0,246,True,Recommended,One of the best survival games !,Rust
2013-12-23,0,0,483,True,Recommended,EDIT You can read my original review from December of 2013 below the line.It has now almost been 4 years since I got Rust and wrote my review on it. I remember when the game first came out the idea was generic yet ambitious since the guy behind the game is the same guy that made Garry's Mod. People weren't sure what to expect but were hopeful for the most part. Boy has the game changed from what it once was. Rust used to have zombies and radiation infected animals now it has a player base. The game is so much more detailed and thorough than any other survival game out on the market at the moment. It blends base building PVP interactions and hardcore survival against the elements (mostly when you're a freshspawn) into a nice little bundle of absolute frustration. Oh and it doesn't even stop there. If you're fortunate enough to build up a decent base you now have other players to worry about. Raiding is one of the most heavy aspects of Rust invading other bases and taking the spoils for yourself. Unfortunately most raids are offline but if you get the opportunity to defend your base while both parties are online it is one hell of a rush. If vanilla Rust (Rust without modifications to the game settings) then perhaps modded and community servers are more your type of thing. Most modded and community servers tend to have tweaks and modifications to the base game in order to create a less grueling experience. For example if you decided to get the game for you and your friend but always fail to find each other on the map modded servers grant the power of teleporting to your friends. Another popular attraction of modded servers are the increased gather rates of resources. 2x 3x 4x 5x and so forth are the increased rates at which you would normally receive resources in vanilla Rust. It makes for a more enjoyable experience if you didn't join the server at the beginning of the wipe. Overall Rust is a pretty fun game but it is in Early Access which means the game is inclined to having bugs crashing freezing etc.. If you're willing to bear through such things and acknowledge that the game is still in Early Access then you should have an enjoyable experience. Completely disregard what anyone has says about Rust still being in Early Access. You have to keep in mind that the development team behind Rust is extremely small compared to the say the development team behind H1Z1. Considering how much the game has done within the year it has been in Early Access then they have come pretty far. They've fixed their fair share of bugs and they've completely updated the look of Rust in the most recent months. You also have to keep in mind that Garry also has other things to work on and doesn't have a team that is literally dedicating their entire lives to developing Rust. In my honest opinion this game has an extremely positive future and you should buy it now while it's still $20 and before it rises in price.,Rust

2017-06-28,0,0,183,True,Recommended,I have played just about every early access survival game there is. Previously I had vouched for DayZ for years saying it has the potential to be the best game ever made and all the hate was unfair blah blah blah. When I finally purchased Rust I was completely shocked with how much fun it actually was. DayZ ARK H1Z1 the forest etc. Can't compare to how well put together (relatively speaking) Rust is. For the genre at this point in time it is hands down the best game to play. At the cheapest price point (I believe) It is much more fun Runs much better Has better building. The only aspect of the game that is rivaled is PVE and ARK wins in that field but I wouldn't say to the degree that it even competes overall. At the end of the day I would say Rust is well worth the 10 20 dollars and it still receives consistent (FREE) updates.,Rust

2015-05-18,0,0,47,True,Not Recommended,Okay i will try to summorize my experience with this game so far. You start at a beach with A stone and a torch and immediately you're faced against people with guns spears bows and other stuff. They kill you so they can eat you that's a thing now. When you by some miracle manages to get past them you have to use your stone to gather resources. when you got enoguh resources you build a hatch (takes 2 min) and then someone kills you. then you do that all over again and manages to stay alive for over 5 min. After you've collected a bunch of wood you run around looking for stones once again you die. when you've managed to find wood and stones you start building your base. immediately some s with a bow come and ruins your house. they break each wall in 1 shot and then they kill you. When you actually have a house some food and some other resources you either start looking for friends or try to find barrels so you can get blueprints. you'll get one every 15 barrel or something and they will mostly be useless. If you find a friend he will straight up murder you the sec you turn your back and then proceed to mutilate you. if you by any chance do find someone that isnt a blodthirsty he will have friends that s everything up and by the end gets you and everyone killed by inviting every naked man he sees to your home. After you've collected a few more resources and killed a couple naked guys just to get your revenge you log off thinking it was worth it. the next time you log in some s have stolen your base and everything you had. you spawn back at the beach and get spawn killed and all you have to show for it is some blueprints that teaches you how to make shoes. this is my experience and it took me about a day (IRL) to do everything and now all i got is some blueprints that suck balls cuz you wont find any animals so you wont be able to craft any clothes and when you finally do find some animals they use their noclip to walk through rocks and their super speed to outrun you. To make a bow you need cloth and the only thing you can kill without a bow is either wolfs or pigs. both of witch are rare as . once now and then a air drop will drop things right next to your house so people will come guns and bows blazing shooting each other and then taking a giant dump on your house. If you try to go for a airdrop you will get anally by people with AK47. They have a cold system now also and at night you will die from freezing unless you make a fire and if you do make a fire you will get hunted and killed by people with weapons etc. you cant defend yourself from them all you can do is bend over and take it. and forget about running if you encounter a small hill you're ed. Hills slow you down with 80% or something. I would rather suffocate on a balloon then play this game again it gives you nothing and then they steal it from you. Kicking yourself in the nuts is more fun than this game,Rust
2018-07-02,0,0,136,False,Recommended,Ya know I'm going to be honest. This is a really good game though a few stuff here and there needs to be worked out with an example being the loading time to get in. though it really depends. Like for example if you get one during the weekend your going to have a long load time getting on but on weekdays i've found it to be a lot more faster though it really just depends. when it comes to the gameplay I would say its great though when looking at the mininum requirements I would say to get a little more stronger stuff for no lag but if your find messing with the settings in the game it can be worked out. Now when it comes to the players they can be toxic but its really just a hit or miss because i've ment a good few thats just past to say a hi and a ho even the experienced but it can be better to just be wary. So if you have the patience for a long load time here and there and are fine messing with the settings so its not so lagy and are fine sometimes getting killed by toxic players then I think the game will be really fun for you though if not still try it out cause you still may like it the game is really good its just going over a rough patch right now.,Rust

I reccomend this to anyone looking for a great stranded/survival based game that will take plenty of hours away from your life! Having friends definitely will help your gameplay experience be that much more fun. I have met people on servers and have began to play with them it is just hard if you don't know anyone to began with. I also reccomend this game to anyone that plays a lot of Garry's Mod. This game will bring our your tactical and creative side.,Rust

2014-03-28,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,I play quite a few early access games this one is pretty lame. I know it's unfinished I know it's early access but that doesn't stop the fact that the game is essentially pay to win because people buy a server just to abuse admin powers. The few servers that are not full of that doesn't stop the game from being boring. I love minecraft this is like a cheap Xbox Live $1 game that knocks it off but with guns so people just act like a 13 year old at a Beiber concert. This had such potential primitive weapons only and more variety would be amazing. A game that looks this good should have crafting on the FTB level and just more overall. It's a flat experience that doesn't have much of a serious peak to it at any point. As many bugs as DayZ has and so many stupid things in it it's still fun as hell...,Rust

2017-10-22,0,0,449,True,Recommended,I play this game at least 6 hours a week and its is SO FUN. But there are some things you have to accept for example people in this game are the saltist people ever. You gonna spawn into a server a think pkay lets get a base going so you do and you get everything you need to ger going then a few fully geared people with Ak 47s and armor will raid your little 1x1 hut. To get full enjoyment out of this game for me is to play it with friends and if you don't have friends find people online. That will help so much. People also ask whats the point of Gathering and Building if it just wipes in a week. For me it trying to control the server before it wipes be the best clan in the server. Anyway Idk if this was helpful at all but the game is enjoyable if you have a group of 2+ people.,Rust

His scatter brained development process introduces things into the game just because he feels like it. So called features left to be untouched for months even years. The game's population fluctuates frequently because Helk changes his mind every 3 4 months. Claims the previous systems introduced were inferior when he never takes any time to balance anything. Listens to the shills of the loudest player base and cater's to their play style. Don't bother with this game because it will never be finished. Helk will decide something isn't perfect remove it and replace with some thoughtless idea he came up with while browsing reddit on the toilet...The final nail in the coffin is he uses Twitter to troll his player base promising features that should be implemented but never will...Just Remember the History of his Incompetence Stairs still don't line up with Doors and the stairs only face one direction and can't be mirrored.You're defenseless if you lose your rock you can't punch or anything...a game without punching made by a company called ""Face Punch"" Melee Combat is a ing joke.A spear costs a whole tree.....you need a workbench to craft a stone spear... A spear is a simple weapon made from a long piece of wood... how does that equate to a whole tree? you find a stick and sharpen it... i feel spears should be a more accessible weapon not spend 15 minutes chopping a tree down and another 3 minutes crafting a damn spear..Most Loot you get from barrels and boxes are utter trash Blue Prints that are purely cosmetic or for Role Players... Yeah I definitely enjoy risking my life to gather mailbox blueprints and bear rugs...You can't even remodel your own base if you mess up you are stuck with it. Sure you can destroy objects but only within the time limit.The Survival aspect is a joke. Thirst and Hunger really have no effect on the gameplay. you can practially bandage through the damage..You shouldn't be able to abuse the healing mechanics in the game spamming Bandages and Medical Syringes just makes the game feel like who ever has the most Medical Supplies automatically wins the battle. Also why have Large Medkits if no one uses them?The Game is just mindless PVP now no objectives or endgame.. its like a Free For All where you have to build all your gear just to lose it to someone who is better geared than you.They couldn't even hatch up some Bounty system that rewards players for killing someone thats been on a kill streak etc. The are no incentives for peaceful interactions in this game. If only they added a safe zone where everyone could come and trade and pick up bounties from a bullentin board. I dunno something more engaging than...

2018-03-21,0,0,333,False,Recommended,So much to say though I will try to be as brief as possible for people who just want a quick review. I've been tracking on this game since it's release in 2013 and yet the community that supports the development of this game is still going strong. It's games like these that make the market because they keep the player coming back for more experiences and more memories within the game. It's release from early access should definitely increase that player base in the future as well. The progress that has been made on this game is outstanding. Since the first version of it in 2013 the development team made canyons wide leaps in making this game look as beautiful as it does in it's current state. They also engage their community and ask them what they'd be interested in seeing in the game both in mechanics and in content. These ideas aren't ignored either and the development team really does consider any really good ideas. Easily the most fun 333.9 hours I've spent in a game. I usually choose server populations of around 15 or 20 to get a good start solo which is what I usually play as. On servers with more than 50 it can be a little suffocating and difficult to get anything done as a solo player however it's these servers that maximize the most on the competitive side of Rust. Let me give you a rundown of my kind of typical day on a modded server on Rust you spawn in gather your resources and you choose a spot that's safe enough to build in. With low pop servers you'll occasionally run into a fellow naked or sometimes stumble upon an active base but for the most part I avoid areas with a high player concentration. Once your base is up and running you begin the ambiguous process of upgrading. This is where the fun begins because you're not technically just focusing on upgrading but also improving upon your knowledge of the server where the best guys are how much stuff (bases people etc) is around the map where the radtowns are etc etc. This process is also a great time to make friends join clans participate in raids and destroy other peoples livelihoods within the server (lol). While doing this it goes without saying that you will also run the risk of being raided yourself and once that happens all you do then is just dust yourself off and repeat from step one. It can get frustrating at times but it can keep you coming back again and again. While playing I've also met some very interesting people within the servers some of whom I still talk to and play with today. It's these social encounters within Rust that give it it's amusing quality because in real life unless you're living in a nudist colony where men in bucket helmets shoot at you on a daily basis you don't expect someone to come up to you brandishing their testicles and shouting an incomprehensible mixture of memes and gibberish. On top of that the ragdoll effect within the game makes for some interesting death scenes. Overall this game has been a great purchase and has given me many memorable moments to look back on as a gamer. I encourage anyone interested to pick up this game as it will undoubtedly give you the same experience and quite possible more. With an open ended game like Rust anything you think of doing can be done.,Rust
2018-03-21,0,0,369,False,Recommended,This game is brutal but fun. The more hours you spend learning the more payoff for the first 100 hrs then it's just luck and what you want out of it. The PVE seems to be improving. PVP is still fun but critical to the server you choose. I recommend trying multiple servers from the start. It will help you get acclimated with the map and the different types of players.Overall a must try. Worth every penny and fun to play with friends.,Rust

This game will never be a good experiance for new players like myself and caters only to those who have played since it first entered early access. Nobody cares to help out new players. Nobody cares if you worked days on your home. Nobody cares if you just spawned and have nothing. They kill you. They just kill you over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

The game went from being a trend setter to ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" through literally hundreds of developer updates. By the time this game is finished I predict most of the player base will have moved on.For me I won't be playing anymore because I can't stand the 10+ minute load times constant wiping of maps due to performance issues and ever changing strategies required to play this game. On the off chance I find a fun group to play with it can be fun but right now it's way more entertaining to just watch popular streamers play the game.",Rust

2015-01-02,0,0,240,True,Recommended,Love how high you are allowed to create buildings and structures and the fact you can build on bodies of water! Once you learn the controls and kit and teleport commands the world is your oyster. Hopefully you get on a server with helpful people or play with friends. You need friends in a game like this otherwise you better be careful how much you player kill or karma will come back bigtime. Some of the pitfalls (at least to some) are you cannot dig underground the zombies are gone in rust (not sure about legacy people can and will break into your base kill you and take your stuff (happens often if you do not fortify) gathering is tedious if not on an excess gather server and gathering supplies in the dark is downright dangerous because you cant see the bears and wolves until its too late. Still for all its faults Rust is a great game highly addicting and time consuming. Many of the things which make it most annoying are also its best attributes you have to build elaborate bases dummy bases sniper towers and use friends to keep from being raided. Learning HOW to outsmart the other players is half the battle.,Rust

2013-12-16,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Game is fairly challenging and enjoyable. Community is a mixed bag. Some people seemed fairly relaxed and friendly some people were not. I'd imagine that will sway either way as the game develops. Would love to see a party system because the only way you can find your friends is by sheer dumb luck. Also it is likely just my bad luck but the animal spawning is rediculously low making food very hard to come by. Bushes with berries would be an awesome addition to counter this if anyone else is having problems. Overall do recommend trying or at least keeping an eye on as it moves through alpha ),Rust
2013-12-16,0,0,47,True,Recommended,For an alpha its in a really really good shape.Its lots of fun to play especially on smaller servers.Can have up to 200+ players on a server.I personally think it needs a bit of a bigger map with a couple more distinct landmarks but it is awesome and really well done so far.,Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,571,True,Recommended,I ONLY have 500 hours in RUST so not as many as some. It is a very rewarding game but can also be hard. If your the type of player that longs for an adrenaline rush Rust can most certainly give that but it can be frustrating when you are trying to get set up and keep getting killed by people with better guns big bases or a large group of players working together. The game is amazingly fun with friends and some of fondest gaming memories are when we had a group of 5 6 RL friends and built a large base to defend. It is a very hard game solo but not un enjoyable you will just need to invest a lot of time to enjoy it that way.The devs are constantly reworking major systems in order to try and accentuate the best parts of Rust which doesn't always work but the new updates seem like a step in the right direction.Rust is at it's best during an intense bow fight a feud with your neighbour or 2+ real life friends trying to stake a claim on a server. It's visceral intense and sometimes frustrating but it can be very rewarding. The graphics and base building are also great.,Rust
2017-10-13,0,0,739,True,Recommended,After a decent amount of hours on the game I can highly recommend it to anyone thinking about jumping on board. While some vocal members of the community are outraged by the balancing taking place as of now (FYI both major and minor updates occur on a weekly basis which always makes the game refreshing to play) I would gladly say that it is heading in a direction that promotes a game in which all can enjoy not just zergs. This game is harsh. It always will be harsh. It's one of the most survival esque survival games I've ever played. But don't let that discourage you. The fun is in the brutality of it which sees regular players turn into immoral monsters as you forge friendships and hatreds in a game where you do all you can to both survive and dominate.,Rust

2017-10-13,0,0,1234,True,Recommended,Been playing Rust for about 4 years now. When the game came out it was truly a one of a kind experience and the market quickly populated with games that emulated certain aspects of Rust. While it could be argued that DayZ was the originator of this genre I would argue that Rust innovated enough with base building and brought much more depth to player interaction. But the question at hand isn't whether Rust is historically relevant in the gaming world. It's whether Rust is a good game or not. While I might claim that this game sucks when I'm angry it also has brought me a lot of joy. I've met some people in the game that I've gone on to play other games with too. The daily life of Rust can be sometimes frustrating but thats what's amazing about the game. It lends itself to large amounts of randomness and unpredictabilitly.Buy Rust. Play it.

2017-10-13,0,0,314,True,Recommended,While Rust is an early access game the developers and designers are constantly making updates and changes not only to the functionality of the gameplay but to the graphics and perfomance as well. While the constant updating can be an upside to the EA norm of getting greenlit and then never touching your game again the updates have also been a headache to those that loved the game at a specific stage of development and would rather it not change.It's a fun game with a really fun premise of survival and base building. PvP is constantly being tweaked and PvE is having its ups and downs as well. If you get this game don't settle in for how it is at any given point and expect things to change from week to week each Thursday.I would recommend this game to anyone that likes PvP survival games with crafting and building elements. I would not recommend this game to anyone wanting a finished game that won't change. Please believe me when I say this game will change. The hings you love may be deprecated while the things you hate may be promoted.,Rust
2017-10-13,0,0,190,True,Recommended,Rust is a game of patience and persistence and you experience that the moment you start the game and that turns a lot of people off. As of recently updates have been kiling the game but I have hope for this wonderful game. This game attracts the player who enjoys sitting down and grinding and having their work pay off (most of the time) but it also attracts cucks so watch out. I reccomend playing this game with a veteran if you're new but once you get the ist I reccomend playing solo to better understand the game. Overall I rate this game 7/10.,Rust

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Rust

2017-08-14,0,0,310,True,Recommended,I think i've had enough playtime to justify a review. This game is incredibly fun especially if you're playing with other people or friends. You get into the routine of starting over so much that eventually you get completely used to it you also realise that only 1/100000 people are geniunely friendly in Rust but when you find the odd friendly player you can have some great fun. Base building is very solid if you have a small team of players you can make some huge bases that last a long time (a long time in Rust is probably more than a day without being raided) likewise raiding is just as fun although you have to grind a lot to get the bombs/rockets/guns (at least on non op vanilla ish servers). You also die a lot in Rust if I haven't mentioned already here are some fun ways to die Get killed when you are a naked (freshspawn) most common. you get used to it Get raided online and die whilst witnessing your hours of work put into your base gone probably most depressing Get killed on the way to a raid very annoying Get killed by abusive admins there are more than you think! Get killed while raiding a base annoying if you have good loot Getting killed by a wolf once one locks on to you you are ed ) Getting doorcamped definately very annoying Realising the server has been wiped just after you made your gigantic mega fortress base it'l put you off Rust for a while hahaThis game I definately think is more fun with friends or other people although it is definately still fun by yourself but I only really fine myself playing it when a friend is on etc. There are regular updates which add some cool content and it definately feels like a finished game already despite the many years it has been in Early Access. Probably the most hours i've put into a game in my Steam Libary.,Rust

2018-01-02,0,0,229,True,Recommended,"I have only played 24 hours so far in Rust but they have been fun filled and exciting! I watched a few tutorial vids before starting and used some recommendations and advice to choose a suitable community server before starting out. Go for one that isn't super packed and you stand a good chance of avoiding the spawn killing chaos that so many people rage about. A couple of highlights from my time so far I woke up on the beach with no idea where I was and a guy runs up to me with his buddy. Rather than slashing me down with a sword he pulled out an acoustic guitar and played a song for me whilst I jumped up and down naked in a desperate attempt to play along and not be killed on the spot! I built my starter base with an airlock type entrance as advised and I hear people outside. I hear them knocking on the door as I try to make as little noise as possible in the hope they'll just leave. Time goes by and I realise that I cannot wait them out. I think ""hey I've only started what have I got to lose?!"" and open the doors with spear in hand. By mere luck I manage to head shot both with my wooden spears as they peeked into the open doorway. In any other game this would be nothing but Rust makes it mean so much!So many people bash this game for poor community aspects.

I understand the whole ""Rough surival"" genere t but this game 99% built around raiding and you will usually lose your stuff regardless of how well you built your base.

2015-08-28,0,0,86,True,Not Recommended,In all honesty unless you know how to get aimbots or whatever you won't get very far in this game. The game itself super cool. The whole surviving stuff is pretty fun. However as with many games the players are what completely ruin the game. Finding another player that will actually work with you or just simply not kill you is especially hard to do in this game. Here is a breakdown of a Rust experience.Wake up on a beach naked. You have a rock and a torch and that is it. You use your rock to get wood make yourself a spear. Find some cloth make yourself some clothes. See another player running towards you. They might be friendly you are obviously a freshly spawned person who has close to nothing and for sure have nothing they need judging from their fully armored body and the AK 47 they are carrying. You give a pleasant hello and start to ask Dead.They shot you. Why? Because you are playing Rust at the same time they are and they found you. So unless you literally play this game non stop for days on end play unfairly or have three other friends that play with you you most likely will not have a good time playing this game.,Rust

I thought it would be a minecraft style game mixed in with PUBG. Boy was i mistaken.First 5 minutes of playing i got blasted with a shotgun. Then a crowbow then a shotty again. I figured wow i cant wait til I can craft those.I never did. Begining in RUST is IMPOSSIBLE unless you have friends or you hide on the outskirts of everything where resources are even more scarce more wild animals can decimate you and you base is widely out of place making it a target for raids.After 3 days of running around getting materials and avoiding fights i had a solid Metal base 3 layers thick with multiple doors and i thought ""Now i can rest and start working on guns and other protections over the next few days."" So i signed off and went to bed. Woke up the next day and my base was gone. All my items were gone but the other 2 bases near me were fine... Thats Rust in a nutshell.Dont have friends who play? Dont get Rust.Dont have 8+ hours to devote to a game per day? Dont get Rust.Dont like running around naked and getting shot at? Dont get Rust.Its not a BAD game its just way too difficult for what it should be this game shouldnt be a full time job.

2015-01-11,0,0,253,True,Recommended,"Edit 08/29/2015 Okay so I thought I would give this game another whirl seeing as how a lot of the reviews have gone from negative to positive. I fired it back up and it is a fantastic game now. The graphics are stunning and there is finally no more wild hacking being done. They have changed the crafting system as well as quantity of resources. I am happy to say that this game is once again fantastic and I look forward to playing it a lot. Changed from not recommened to definitely recommended.**** DO NOT BUY****Okay so at first this game had A LOT of promise. There were days I really looked forward to playing the game after work and seeing all the funny fights between naked dudes with rocks. Now though.... It's different. There is so much hacking and cheating it is unreal. They have programs online where you can pay like $20 a month and be able to do pretty much anything. I watched a friend use it once and he could press like F5 and everybody on the map would pop up with a box around them. Then he could press F2 and kill them from anywhere on the map then pretty much fly to where that guy was at and steal all of his stuff he had on him. He also had infinite C4's which was ridiculous. Graphics wise I can't really complain. For being an Alpha game the graphics are actually really nice looking once you turn it to the ""Beautiful"" setting. Fires looked great as well as pretty much everything else.I just miss the days of night trolling. Nights on here get dark. Like REALLY dark. At times when it was night I would go around and try to creep people out. The way voice chat works on the game is if you're really far you're barely audible. But if you're close you can hear the other person just fine. So I would go around to these run down shacks where I knew somebody was at due to like a campfire and maybe the people inside talking to themselves. At that point I would keep my distance and play ""Tiptoe through the Tulips"" by Weird Al. People would stop talking and immediately extenguish the fire and run out with just a gun to kill whoever was doing it. But now I can't do that thanks to the hackers. Now I just get killed by a hack as soon as I start (3/10 Will not be playing again. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME",Rust

Unless you have a close group of friends A lot of free time on your hands and the patience to withstand(and I'm not exagerating in the slightest here) the most toxic and vile community the internet has to offer from racist homophobic nazi hacking exploiting group of indiviuals this game is likely not for you. But If you can stand everything in that list you may get somewhere in an official server before someone exploits or hacks their way into your base (not joking). Or you may take a crack at one of the community/modded servers where theres active admins that constantly try to prevent those things while only occationally(Just about always) breaking some of their own server rules along the way.

Also try to find some place that has all the resources readily avalible or you'll be screwed if you have to travel across map to just chop some trees or mine some stone.

2017-09-19,0,0,1097,True,Not Recommended,The game is on sell at the moment right now people because they're trying to get a final cash grab in before they drop the ball. They've had plenty of opportunities to optimize the game for multiple system setups so that more than just a few people can enjoy the experience of rust. Unless you're running a specific setup with a specific set of drivers.. expect memory leaks and fps drops like crazy. They aren't focusing on this issue either they are pushing out more money grabbing with skins. But what they don't realize is the community will slowly die if the game continues to become more and more unplayable. Don't buy and waste your breath until they show they've fixed it. Keep watch and once they fix it I encourage others to join cause it is fun otherwise. But fun is only when it's playable.,Rust

2015-02-18,0,0,500,False,Recommended,What's the objective in Rust? For most people in Rust it's establishing a base that you can defend while you learn new technologies and advanced from a rocket wielding naked to a fully geared killing machine.There are multiple roles you can take in your group. You can hunt people and steal whatever they are carrying you can harvest resources raid bases explore monuments or be the dedicated builder in your group.There are many sandbox elements in this game which allow for a lot of creativity. You can chat up your neighbors and try to form an alliance but can you ever really trust them?Cons The biggest problem in rust is unbalanced mega clans. The team that has the largest number of player hours to spend dominates every time. You have no chance if you play solo. This could be fixed by implimenting something like factions in game but there's nothing on their current road map to address it.The meta game. If you want to optimize your chance of not being raided you need to build specific base designs. Being creative will give you a good chance of being raided.,Rust
2015-05-28,0,0,765,False,Recommended,Rust is a hardcore survival game with a heavy focus of player interaction and raiding. The game revolves around talking to people and forming different types of relationships whether good or bad. These relationships alter the way you play and can dictate whether you are peaceful to your neighbors or wild savages that become their worst nightmares.Everything in this game is nerve racking and tense regardless of how many hours you have under your belt. I find myself feeling the same emotions the same fear the same rush the same nerve racking tension that I felt when I first got the game and it doesn't get old. The game feels ruthless and the more you play the more you see your own ruthless tendencies.Other than blade or gun fights the game allows you to raid your enemies. Building a base is a must as you're going to need a place to stash your goods. At any point with enough materials you can attack a rival's base bombarding it with explosives. Raiding becomes a game of strategy in which the defender must use their base and its layout to take down any attackers or at least outsmart them and run them dry of firepower. Regardless of the results of a raid it's an intense feeling being part of one and the rush alone is worth it.Facepunch the developers of the game have shown an extreme dedication to the game. They push regular content updates harsher anti cheat and quality of life improvements. These arrive monthly and throughout the game's early access development have always given us a reason to keep playing.Lastly Rust isn't for everyone. It's a very harsh toxic and blood thirsty world full of savages ready to spear you down in an instant. If you can handle it Rust can offer small rays of hope in a dark desolate place. Small towns are sometimes formed trading posts bustle with industrial product and sometimes you meet people that stick it through the thick and thin with you.I highly recommend Rust for one reason alone. The bonds you create with others within the game aren't like those in any other. It's an experience you must try for yourself to understand. It's not easy to survive but when you do and you do it with others it becomes a whole different game.,Rust

But between hate mongering and people who act to almost cruel degrees it makes this game extremely difficult to enjoy.Example Get shot by player I'm annoyed and ask if he can at least not kill me. He picks me up gives me back the resources he looted off me and says he's ""sorry."" No more than a couple seconds later he puts an arrow through my head and laughs. Another game where people calling themselves ""pirates"" somehow changed all my door locks in less than one minute which only increases my loathing for PvP gameplay. Along with this one thing I've noticed a high amount of people in this game act rather immature and do everything ranging from idle threats acting profane and being plain rude. Most of all though I do understand it almost all players are kill on sight no questions asked even when your fresh off the beach nude and armed only with a torch and a rock while they're sporting an assault rifle.But of course there are plenty of people who can be very friendly. Though most are located within the PvE servers and seem rare to find in the PvP aside from people who run hotels. But most friendly people will express a healthy cautiousness of other players they don't know KoS doesn't apply to that group.As for the game itself. The graphics look pretty good. Nothing mind blowing but things like lighting and shadows are fairly well don and textures remain consistant thoughout. Plenty of graphics options to get things tuned to your likeing which is always a plus. Though some textures or actions look a little weird here and there the game is still receiving updates so this is a plus as well.Gameplay feels pretty solid. Though a bit grindy depending on what your doing or what server your in. But there's a great range of servers to choose from. Everything from battle royals high resource count servers which create a battle that spans the island roleplay and PvE servers and a few others with their own additions in the modded servers.All in all I really like this game but a majority of the player base are incredibly immature and it appears that majority are in their teens. The only other game I have to compare the player base too is GTA Online. People just being rude and thinking ruining others experiences are fun when their just out trolling. So honestly my recommendation is a soft yes but a yes no less. But this game isn't for people who are tempermental.I will say I'm done with this game for the time being. Far too many hackers. Between changing the locks on metal doors in thirty seconds aim bots and fly hacks I'm honestly done.Update 11/30/2017 The hacking situation is getting worse servers are dying faster. Game is becoming a bit more balanced and sharper looking. But I have to say something very specific about this game well it's advert on it's Steam store page. It's lies. You're first day in Rust will not be peaceful. The first few minutes will not be peaceful. It's trailer should show you waking on the beach cutting some wood and then suddenly it cuts to a fully geared individual running down the beach with an automatic weapon mowing down naked people while making inhuman noises into their microphone. That is all for this update.",Rust
2017-12-01,0,0,174,True,Recommended,The game has huge potential. Even though it can be super rage inducing sometimes and the community can also be toxic many times (except some friendly dudes sometimes). But the idea behind it is just amazing. Put 150 hours in the game after the first 2 weeks upon purchase and still planning to do many. Hopefully it's gonna be even better once it's getting released.,Rust

Ridiculous motion blur the sun rays are blinding and it's near impossible to find your friends.

2015-08-28,0,0,283,False,Recommended,Great game with original gameplay. However new players need to go into this game with a certain mindset.Gameplay Players need to be able to commit multiple hours to a play session. trying to play for 30 minutes at a time will get you nowhere fast. You will have setbacks in this game and will almost certainly be killed multiple times or have your base demolished before you figure out how to survive for longer periods of time but that is the point of this game. To Figure out how to survive. While you can play this game solo it is 10x more fun to play with friends or have a clan. This makes it harder for you to get greifed and a overall better experience as playing solo will get very lonely the majority of the time as pretty much every random player you meet will try to kill you on sight.Development This game has received major overhauls and is currently recieving major updates on a weekly basis. The devs listen to community feedback and have an overall great commitment to getting this game out of early access and into a full game status. This game is probably the single greatest example of a early access developed game as most other titles have lost dev support or ended up bascialy being scams.10/10 Would recommend to anyone who loves FPS Survival or teambased games.,Rust

Eventually I managed to make a little base and sleeping bag thinking I was then safe.Wrong again.Whilst finally getting a furnace and starting to produce some metal fragments a guy shoots down my wooden door kills me destroys my bed and loots / destroys everything.I would never again ask anybody to get this game it's seemingly an output for anger for experienced players as they constantly taunt you and attempt to upset you in any way they can imagine.Never thought I'd find a game I'd sincerely think was bad to this extent but here we are.,Rust

I would say that the blueprints are its biggest downfall. Now if you want to make anything in the game you must either get blueprints through random drops or pay heavy amounts of scrap for. It was a bit of a grind before but now the grind fest is just too much. I really hope they take away the blueprints. That would bring me back to this game. But for now I really do not see any point in continuing with the game in this state. Or maybe if they were to release an old version too before all these updates that would be really cool.

2017-02-18,0,0,930,True,Recommended,I love this game it is my favorite game. The graphics are great the community is but thats ok. It is hard as a solo player but a lot easier with another person. not everybody is a i have gone outside my base and made friends with man people. Some guy and his group raided me as a solo plaer and now we are pretty much best friends. I say all you have to do is make friends and you will be fine. I recomend this game to everybody. I think it is a great game with huge potential. EDITED VERSION Current version of Rust is still a lot of fun but for me where I don't have much time to play a game it is very hard. The blueprint system they added makes the game more grindy. You have to play for a very long time to get things simple like pipe shotguns or armored doors. You need to gather a lot of scrap to craft these things and it is a high amount of scrap. I still think the game is fun but it is just to much to play.,Rust

2014-04-06,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Review Contents Abstract Gameplay Graphics Biomes Audio Performance Bugs Final Verdict 1. Abstract Rust is an online survival game that puts you against the elements and other players. The video shown on the store page does not accurately depict the gameplay. Yes you will have many intense battles only if you play the hours of grinding before hand. The game in its current state (First day post release) is playable doubt its worth $40 to anyone. In this review you will be reading my perspective on the game may not reflect everyones but I have over 100 hours in it most of which were played in Legacy Rust (pre unity 5) less than half on unity 5 and then 10 ish hours post release. 2. Gameplay Rust's gameplay is very grindey to start with but this isn't the most boring grind on earth. You need to learn the mechanics of the game to enjoy it a short few youtube tutorials should get the game going. Playing with friends is a sure way to also get your money's worth. The grinding is to get materials for the crafting system. The crafting system is well designed with a tiered system requiring different tiers of tools to create better weapons. Ontop of the tiered system there is a certain level of unlocking to do it's not through a pay wall or through a grind wall. You can unlock by finding blueprints by scavenging dangerous areas or by researching the item you want to create in the future by finding one and using research tools. The PVP aspect is where the game shines but also takes a dive. The PVP is well made great netcode great gameplay. Only issue with PVP is that most people are s you will forsure get killed many times as soon as you start the game dying without a chance to achieve shelter and basic tools makes the game impossibly hard to progress in. If you can over come the horrible people you will forsure have fun. 3. Graphics Graphics are quite impressive although on release day there's still some work to be done. Your character will not render feet but your body can cast odd shadows foliage tends to float and occasionally building bits will clip with eachother although easily fixed by careful placement. During sunrise and sunset the game really shines with the colours day time is nice and bright allowing players to see far for enemies and gather materials far faster. Nights are pitch black scary and the best time for sneaking around. Night time is immersive with how the lighting works when other players run around with torches. Expect nothing short of wonders going into this game. 4. Biomes The biomes in this game deserves its own section facepunch studio went through great deals of changes to masterfully craft the biomes in this game. There are a few biomes to name forests flat planes deserts oasis and caves I'm sure I missed a few. The forests feel really thick with foliage all over the ground thick trees to obscure vision and the audio rustling when you run through the foliage. The desert is baren with occasional sections of cactuses or palm trees. Oasis' form between deserts where you might find horses or pigs to kill you can even set fish traps there! The most interesting and awesome biome are the caves deep webbed caves that go far down have small platforming puzzels and lots of mineable ores. 5. Audio The music in the game is quite minimal very ambient and fitting. You won't find the music overwhelming in any situation though it can feel off sometimes when nothing is happening around you but the music picks up. The sounds of the guns firing is loud and clear allowing players to hear gun fights from afar. 6. Performance I tested the game on max settings on a GTX 1070 i5 6500 and 8gb of ram. On max settings the game ran 99% of the time over 75 fps. Although performance for lower end computers may vary wildly. The settings allow for all sorts of adjustments to allow the game to look and run the way you want. 7. Bugs I mentioned before the foliage tends to float. This probably happens due to the fact that the maps are procedurally generated. Small issue but quite noticable along cliff edges. Sometimes items in your inventory will switch to boxes in troublesome ways I occasionally find myself losing items only to realize the game put them in the storage boxes I was interacting with earlier. 8. Final Verdict The game provides good content for its money if you can learn the game mechanics and have friends to play with. If you plan to play this game solo maybe wait for a price drop to $30 CAD or eqivalent in your currency.,Rust

2014-07-05,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Until one can host one's own server rather than either paying for private hosting or playing with a bunch of strangers under the threat of griefing and/or the server going down due to any moronic reason (or simply stopping to pay the host and thusly being closed) plus having to deal with high pings or players you can't avoid (as doing such would force you into servers with higher latencies) this game is not worth buying not because it is bad (for it isn't) but because playing it with friends on a ping friendly and safe server is impossible not because it hasn't been implemented but because a password is required for the game to be playable and as of yet only hosting companies have access to said password.The main problem is not paying for hosting it's being forced to pay for a service I do not need that after having paid for the game already I understand this is an Early Access Game and crashes instabillity and such should be (and are) expected however servers are running! In fact for it to be expected of me to pay for the servers they ought to be rather stable so it's not a stabillity issue.I (and obviously I can't speak for anyone else) don't mind hosting a server even if it might crash or freeze or just die on me out of the blue this is an Early Access Game after all. Renting a server either it is always an option for the people who can't be arsed to port forward and set things up and are not bothered with the problems I brought up in paragraph 1. I expect in the future the release of a dedicated server client for players but until then the game good as it might be or become is simply not worth buying which is a shame because I'll most likely change my review once the server hosting is released. The game as of yet without a 'single player mode' (which I don't know if will ever be implemented as I haven't seen any mention of it) or a server client avaliable is unplayable (to me obviously This is a personal review).I bought the game this early on its develpment because I believed in Rust's premisses I still do this game has a lot of potential and I ween it will fulfill itself as a game that's why though I may not recommend it being bought If you happened agree with paragraphs 1 and 2 I eagerly wait the full release of the game as I'm sure I'll have a lot of fun with it and my friends.Until then Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Spycrab Steam wgah'nagl fhtagn.,Rust

2017-08-07,0,0,47,True,Recommended,Rust begins off as a love and hate relationship. But it slowly becomes one of the best survival games you'll ever play. First of let me say Rust is not an easy game. You'll have to be active work hard and learn the game. It's a very time consuming game. The devs are passionate about the game and update it every week non stop with no excuses. But of course theres always some cons about every game. First wipe day is crazy. Servers are full. Everyone is naked and trying to kill you with a rock. Second the servers slowly die down in days. There should be a bonus for staying on the same server. Third raiders can place twig structures anywhere on your base. To me this defeats the purpose of the tool cupboard. SummaryPros One of the best survival games. The devs are passionate and listen to the community Theres building Challenging A new experience every timeCons Wipe day is crazy The servers die in a few days Raiders can place twig structures anywhere at your base.Conclusion I highly recommend Rust. It's a very challenging and fun survival game. There is some cons to the game but it can always be fixed with the dev team.

2017-08-07,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,I believe that the Game could be good but after trying mutiple servers and constantly being killed in under 10 Minutes it really makes the game boring and teadeous.

2017-10-14,0,0,1303,True,Recommended,This is my review for the game if you are still on the fence. I have had this game for 2 years already with a little over 1k hours. I took a year off because I hated some of the updates. As of 09 OCT 17 I came back because the new blueprint system came back. I love it and hope they keep it.So this game is the most addicting game I have played ever. The grind in it is reasonable and it feels like you have actual goals and when you achieve them it makes you feel accomplished. When you are in combat I have never had the same feeling in any other game. Just the pressure of not getting killed when your inventory is full of loot from a raid or you have been farming wood and stone is just thrilling. I have been fearing for my life not to die and lose all of my stuff and it s every fight every fight I get that feeling if I die I will have to go back out and farm for another 15 minutes if not more just to get all of it back. I love it.The combat in this game has improved drastically. Great weapon selection and fits anyone s fight style if you want to be a sniper in the back they got that or a run and gunner they got that too. Since 2 years ago Everything feels a lot smoother and the combat faster paced. All of the rad towns just look so much more alive since 2015 and now their is harbor gas stations and rocket facility. All of them have a their own personality and benefits to going too. To me it s incredible how much more detailed they are from 2015 from looking like some barebones models to now having plant life growing on them graffiti and rubble all around. Hats off to facepunch .Only thing I can saw to improve the game is to stop listening to the community as much especially the subreddit. It s mostly screaming 14y/o s and just toxic. Their have been many good suggestions but the complaining their is far too much and not enough constructive criticism. Also it would be nice to have official 1 3 man group servers because many of the community or modded ones do not have enough population or die off quickly.I just recently tried playing solo on a official server and it s difficult. Just imagine playing a game on hard mode. That is what playin solo is. Granted I don t want FP to cater to solos or small groups but neither too clans. I believe their is a happy medium and FP will find it through CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. I started playing the game with about 5 guys from work and I believe to get the full rust experience you have to find a group. I felt like I was part of something when I played and legitimately cared when someone was hurt or when we were raiding the relief of finally getting into the loot room and all of us screaming about the loot. This game is great to play with friends and you really build bonds. This game currently is only 20 bucks a low price for the amount you get. If you have it buy it find a group to show you the ropes and enjoy. Also for new players PLEASE read the dev blogs so you know what s going on so you are not blind sided by something. No matter how many times you get killed or raided this game is still very good. This game is special even after a year break I came back too it and plan on keep playing. Buy the game and you will see what I m talking about.,Rust

The games rescources that it uses aren't correctly allocated and uses anything and everything it can. What this means in a non technical sense is that It over uses power in a Mac which in turn causes the game to run horribly and extremely slowly/laggy and heats up your computer to dangerous temps in the process of running the ame at its lowest video quality settings possible ( which is supposed to make the game run faster ).

Almost 4 years later this game's perhaps younger community has created an unfortunately toxic gaming environment to which many of my original Rust team players now stray away from and with good reason.

It really take survival to another level and it makes really angry when you lose all your stuff after countless farming. The only thing that bothers me is the update that allowed other people to be able to place ladders and twigs on your base even if they are not authorized to the tool cupboard. And if your are playing solo you are kind of playing the game on hardcore difficulty.Here's some pros and cons.Pros.Good GraphicsMany weaponsGood crafting systemUpdates every weekBuilding system just got better aswell ( it was still good before )Cons.Ladder/Twig update.It's still in early access (although it was released in december 13 of 2013)Community is worse than in cs go but better then in dota.Overall If you are not ready to get killed hundreds of times and lose your stuff then this game is not for you.7/10 Will kill nakeds with rocks again.,Rust

2017-03-31,0,0,58,True,Recommended,"My experience with this game can be summed as thus every update I found myself testing the changes nodding in satisfaction then quitting the game to await the next update.Arkane knows how to make a good game. No question. But if you film an Oscar worthy movie and the lens is smudged while filming you can't judge what's underneath without acknowledging what's been marring your experience the entire time. PERFORMANCE Everyone is aware of the performance issues and these still persist to this day. It runs much better than at launch where it was literally unplayable but that's because the game looks worse than before the most noticeable change being the extremely aggressive LOD scaling. Out of the corner of your eye you notice the shapes of window frames and posters on distant buildings morphing in shape or the furniture at the opposite end of a long hallway suddenly blinking into existence. FPS dropped to 15 when stabbing a gravehound so they simply removed the inky visual effect that was causing the problem instead of optimizing it.Also Denuvo authentication is one of the longest ""loading screens"" of the game. Around half a minute to a full minute or more every startup. GAMEPLAY For the most part gameplay is excellent and is Dishonored's strongest suit. Dark Vision was changed to a blurry short range sonar so unlike Dishonored 1 you aren't constantly seeing blue and yellow because you had no reason not toAI is much smarterNonlethal combat options are a blastBonecharm crafting system allows for player flexibility and ""builds""Each level feels lived in while maintaining the duality of directive flow and open options that made the first game so good.Emily and Corvo have distinct animations and final weapon upgrades. The animations are supremely cool.Each level is fairly distinct some with extremely interesting central ""gimmicks."" I do however wish the game relied less on them and had more ""regular"" areas.However under the hood lie other problems. Most of them are quality of life issues Gone are the hotkeys for journal inventory bonecharms powers. Only one ""journal"" exists now despite still having separate subsections.It took months for the power wheel to be fixed. It took almost a full second after activating to pop up and be usable breaking flow so badly I almost never used it in the first place. It's finally fixed now but this issue was glaring and it took so long to be addressed most of us played through without it fixed.Thrown objects don't always go exactly where your crosshair is. While this adds a layer of difficulty it feels noticeably more clunky than in the first game.Mana regen is pitifully slow. From using a power to fully regenerating Dishonored 1's time is 4.7 seconds &gt 3.1 seconds with Spiritual Pool. Dishonored 2's time with 4x Spiritual Pool is 6.3s &gt 5.5s. The devs said they fixed this effect but it was only made worse.Bugs. Street speakers not playing. Dying after possessing gravehounds. An arc pylon never shutting down after pulling out its power leaving it to either be dangerous to you to dangerous to your nonlethal playthrough. Some of these still aren't fixed. STORY AND ATMOSPHERE Reactivity Great. My favorite part of Dishonored. You need to hide from a gang member to access a certain black market shop and there are different scenarios and dialogue for if you hide if you run into him outside kill him outside or kill him inside.Emily and Corvo Emily and Corvo are voiced. And... they don't talk enough. It's good that they're silent for most of the game but there are times when you come across a portrait or photograph with an ""Inspect"" prompt. I'd love to hear Emily's thoughts on the High Overseer as see how that compares to Corvo's or if it changes based on whether or not you accept the Outsider's Mark. Instead all I get is the protagonist muttering the name of the person pictured. What's the point? Might as well keep them silent.It made sense to me to play Emily first but her story felt lackluster like people at every turn were saying ""check your royal privilege"" despite my efforts to resolve everyone's problems without drawing blood. Corvo's is MUCH more interesting as a veteran of Dishonored 1.The Outsider and The Void I hate the new Outsider and his new voice. He felt threatening and malicious in the first game due to how calm and composed he was and the Void felt like a strange and otherworldly place. The vignettes of Dunwall made it feel both unnatural and unnerving yet fundamentally woven into the universe. In Dishonored 2 it's just smoky blackness and sharp rocks. The Outsider is much jollier and moves around erratically making grandiose hand gestures. They actually had a plot plot that could explain this change but it was never addressed so it just seems like a pointless retcon to me.Main Plot Dishonored's worldbuilding was always one of its appeals and that remains true in Dishonored 2. However the villains felt lackluster. Only the main villain has a real presence throughout the game whereas everyone else feels introduced abruptly only to fall by your hand all within the same mission. In Dishonored 1 everything felt personal and real. Perhaps it was because of the long intro where you interacted with most of them or the Hound Pits's cast of characters all having different connections to your targets. As you can see I've played this game a LOT and have put a lot of thought into it. It was definitely worth all those hours and all that money but the condition it was at launch and the sluggish drip feed of support we barely get now is unacceptable. To set a precedent for future games I can't recommend buying this unless they manage to fix all the performance issues and bugs which doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.",Rust

2016-08-28,0,0,158,True,Recommended,( !!Tl dr warning!! )Firstly to anyone reading this post THANK YOU! Now on to what I'm about to say. SOLO IS DYING!!! No not the game in general that aspect is actually doing VERY well lately. What I'm talking about is players that have no friends no 'clan' to back them up going out straight from the beaches where they spawn and building up thier base. That whole chunk of the base of palyers is dwindling. It is increibly hard to be able to go alone in this game without having all of your hardwork torn down again and again AND again...and I know some of you can relate to this heavily. To be able to defend this way of playing the game we (the groups of people who go solo) need to raise of voices up and be heard saying 'Hey we're getting SCREWED out here can someone get things changed around here?!' I'm not saying mess over the whole game just aspects that kill off solo players so easily. *cough* Xp system *cough* grinding *cough* So basically what I'm saying is for gods sake don't kill off us little guys!! Please Facepunch!! But don't screw over the rest of the cummunity as well!! We need a balance to where we can defend ourselves in this torturous game without having to slave for what seems like endless hours only for a metal shack!! But seriously though I will NEVER call out this game as a terrible product unless it ever (sadly) becomes that. Thanks for reading this guys!!,Rust

2016-11-26,0,0,990,False,Not Recommended,"Why No ?*please keep that on mind that this review is just my point of view at this game.* It changed a lot.Original idea that was rust how it was created how it works changed a lot as legacy player i seen all versions of this game and as far as i can say i enjoyed Legacy version most and somehow i played Rust until XP system comes. Lot's of things that where promised to old community and they where never been delivered to us.I don't know who was it if it was Garry or another developers or whoever was responsible for this game at the times when game changed from Legacy to newer version. But it was promised to us as for the old community what we recieve few changes. First was original legacy map that should be named as ""Hapisis island"" that was complete bull***t ? Why ? Simply this map was expecting by whole old community when it was delivered in patch it was something diffrent completley diffrent and unrecognizable from legacy map. It was not even explanined they did never say why did this happen and current appology is that it is hard to make 1 1 Old legacy map. For me this was one of the nails to coffin. We can talk about things like debuff's that was promised but never actually happend. Lot of players just leave the game because simply they never truly told us what is happening with game and why actuall promises in devlogs where never delivered to community. They considered to give us a level editor at launch of course it end up as promise that never happen... Current system. Dear lord i will recieve a hate for this but this is actual problem for me i was learned in this game to grind week a whole week of grinding hard working on blueprints fighting and now ?...Whole randomness that was given to us with blueprint system is gone. You start with 0 blueprint's that's ok so then you grabbing from barrels then you running like a madman trying to find a hazmat. Do lot of runs but where is randomness ? Bascily when you need something you know where you find it... want level 3 weapons go launchside want weapons grind barrells. This is why this game comes down from Week gameplay to a 3 day's gameplay. Peoples jus't now they raid like crazy it's not even hard right now... and at third day server is almost dead. Blueprint was more random and i feel it was made for this game ? Why... imagine situation like now. You have everything for raid and some simple gun before component/bp it was risk to go raid. Why ? You never know what that guy that you are going to raid will have. Sometime's he played pistols and guess what you come raid him he pulls AK47 stright away destroy's you whole raid just failed because you did not observe your target and never actually get's any information about him now its more like pingpong he comes outside and you can tell if raid will be or not sucessfull. It's boring and repetitive.Cluster f... to your mind.Why stable map was better but stable system is problem. This was the case of actual fun in this game with old map you just know you really know what to expect where big clans are going to build where players will be PVPing(""But hey PVT that's why POI's are there"" i know i know but before there where places where you fight even without POIS a great example of big PVP non POI place where Resource Valley and if u know that place well you could survive.) Or where you can go to hide or raid some solo/duo players. Everything on old map had a palce and with randomness of blueprints it was like symphony. PVP systemThis is my personal hate and why i hate so much PVP system at current rust build.Legacy again ?Yes legacy again and this was most or top or whatever you want reason why peoples like this game. Old legacy PVP system was just like Counter Strike. No bulletdrop some simple patterns and here you go perfect PVP game with some survival aspect. Current system of shooting looks like you take some very old old pistol add 30mag to it and make it shoot it just all over the place and it's disgusting it takes tons of times to learn it when you come from other games. Just meh in general. Upkeep systemFor me it's like hey you you dont have time for game ? Well say goodbye to your base... etc...Like nerfing in past false hopes for changes and etc... i would not even write about it because this will be review on 30 papers.Now let's see a better things that happen to this game(LOL).+Graphics+Building system+Good for peopels who never play this game before.+Some tutorial that is not helping.Conclusion For peoples who support this game at start and buy it and still hold up to this days good job but for me....It's just diffrent game its so diffrent that it have litteraly almost 20% from old and actual RUST that i used to know and enjoy. This game is almost dead to me one solution for me and maybe for players like me would be something like give us back old map stop promising t's and keep being sorry or full of excuses that it's not possible. Give us choose to create servers with old BP system and keep also current one for new players. For new players it might be a good game that they will like but as i said you have litteraly no guarantee that current system will not change even if they released this game.",Rust

2017-07-25,0,0,838,True,Recommended,A amazing game,Rust
2017-07-25,0,0,335,True,Recommended,Would I recommend rust? As you can see I have hundreds of hours in the game. It cost me 10 dollars. For 10 dollars I would recommend almost any game. Rust is a special kind of awful. The player community is toxic. The gameplay is repetitive. The crafting element changes so often you're never sure of how you make anything. If you enjoy being ganked by mouthy ten year olds I definitely would recommend rust. If you enjoy having all your hard work destroyed again and again and again I would recommend rust. If you like playing with people that would kill you for a piece of wood that would be easier to get themselves than it would have been killing you I would recommend rust. After 300+ hours in the game I can tell you if not anything else it's a great way to kill time.If you want a real challenge I would recommend you play rust as a pacifist. After my first 10 hours in the game I decided to play it without making any of the weapons. I decided to help anyone who asked even the 55hats who did nothing but kill you repeatedly. I made the game enjoyable for me by doing my best to be the anti rust player. That's what made rust an interesting experience for me. Rust is like The Lord of the Flies for a modern age who have no idea what The Lord of the Flies is. I don't know if I'm qualified to reccomend rust to you but I can say if not anything else it's interesting. Rust may make you a worse person than you already are. Rust may tear you down to it's level. So good luck out there and remember the game is as good as you make it.,Rust

2017-01-31,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,"You know when you play a game and find youself thinking ""You know what'd make this even more enjoyable dying all the time and playing with people who are s."" In Rust you can starve in half a day *long* before you die of dehydration.You can stand in a river. You *will* get wet and even get hypothermia if you stay in it too long but you *can't* drink from it. Why? Why have a survival mechanic for hydration when you're so frikkin hipster that the only water you can drink is bottled that you *might* find in containers?The mushrooms are apparently edible and give you a small boost to hunger hydration and health. The mushrooms are modelled on the fly agaric. You know the red one with white spots that's poisonous as . Are they *trying* to kill off idiots who'd eat one in real life *because they saw it in Rust*? If so I'd leave a kinder review the world needs less idiots. I suspect however it's because the colours stand out better on the background making it marginally easier to spot and tbh why bother thinking anymore about modelling an edible mushroom on one that's deadly irl...Meanwhile if you eat meat raw it will *actually harm you*. Yes there is a risk of food poisoning if the animal was ill and if it's not fresh but think how many people there are who like *rare* steak or sushi who miraculously survive everytime they eat it. What a ing dumb as mechanic.You can gather rusty metal plates and maybe even some wood but then find a bear *somehow* *without making any noise* is actually standing behind you and *oh dear* it hit you once and you're dead and you lost your scraps of crafting crap respawn in a random place and start again.You can always ask other players on the server for tips or even help but *oh dear* they're s and won't even try and help a newbie and are significantly more likely to kill you.In 2.2 hours of playing time I was killed something like 12 times once by a player who appeared behind me again without making a noise and *oh dear* one hit dead and the other *eleven times* by bears. Seperate bears. One I saw glitching next to a stream so I crouched down and walked away silently. The second I turned away it unglitched *bam* dead.On my last attempt of playing this game and bear in mind about 1/4 of the playing time was loading screens I happened to respawn near where to the two or three long time s of the server happened to be gathering crafting crap and ignoring/killing anyone else. I crouched and walked quietly up to the crates they were using took every single thing I could fit in my inventory out of them ran behind a rock and logged out.

I didnt play the game when there was leveling system but the need is out there with difference of experienced player and beginner shouldnt matter witch server you join in. Still needs som minor improvment but overall very good survival game.8/10,Rust
2014-03-24,0,0,6,True,Recommended,After a couple of days with this I can write something about this game. This game has way more potential than it gives. I recommend it but only if it gets better. The new guys will have a hard time as I am. I've been playing this for a couple of days now and I have yet to get anywhere with it. There is one HUGE drawback which other MMO's have and that is to draw (higher level) players away from n00b areas of the game. Though this game has no levels it has bigger guns and fending off 2 people that have guns with a rock will not cut it. I could crush a skull in real life with the size of rock that you are given yet it takes hit after hit after hit to kill someone in this. If you are attacked by someone with an axe you bleed out and the only way to get away is to run away then patch yourself up before you do (if you're lucky enough to not have the person still chasing you). Food is hard to get with a rock too and you need to find resources where people hog so that you can build better weapons armour buildings etc. There are camps you can join and this will be the ONLY way you will get anywhere in this game. I was hoping to scope out the game by myself for a little before going into an occupied area but you can't. It's literally impossible to play this without making friends first unless the entire server is full of friendly's. Most people aren't unless you're part of their group. Another huge drawback is when you die you lose everything and there is no failsafe for this unless you have a storage unit that's well hidden or locked up which you need when you're first starting out. If you die you start out as a noob again (rock med kit and torch) unless you're lucky enough to find your drops if they hadn't taken it which is also unlikely. I had a ton of wood needed to build stuff then died of hunger. I ran around looking for food but there was literally nothing in a forest near a wide open field. I haven't asked anyone in game how to do anything yet but I may next time I login if I can't figure things out. To give you an idea you beat your n00b rock against a tree and it gives you wood. The tree does not fall down but rather displays a message telling you there is no more wood available (disappointing I know since we ALL should have hardware that can handle this kind of stuff). You would then use the wood to build stuff like wooden barracades or wooden shelters and the like. Instead of putting these items where you are building them they go into your inventory (how the hell do you carry a shelter around?). I haven't figured out how to take the items out of the inventory to place them on the land yet though. Drag and drop just puts a bag in front of you with items in it (seriously a shelter in a bag?). You can pick these up again easy enough. I haven't been able to do much else because I get killed so quickly and gathering wood doesn't exactly help you build a better weapon right away. For a new weapon you need to do the impossible and find rocks which people seem to be guarding the resources for because of where the resources are located (and very few of them). The map needs to be a LOT bigger (or at the very least different bigger maps) with more resources and better resources to lure players with better equipment away from the noobs. As I mentioned before the trees not falling was a big disappointment for me. I would have rather cut down a tree then harvest it for wood. The graphics are sub par at best. Trees rocks shadows and characters (including the animals) all have low res textures. The only thing good about the graphics is the amount of grass and it makes the fields look grassy instead of fake. Add the trees and it looks better but only from a distance. When you kill animals in the game you get chicken no matter which animal you kill. Would like to see variances in the food and amount of hunger satisfied by the food (since a steak is bigger than a chicken leg pork chop etc. and a pork chop is bigger than a chicken leg but not much). I understand that this game is still in alpha stage and can still change drastically but all in all this game has HUGE potential and I hope that it will change for the better. It needs to so anyone new will not be so frustrated like I was (am).,Rust

2014-03-24,0,0,166,True,Recommended,I'm going to review this game while it's in Alpha FYI. It's a lot of fun kind of a cross of minecraft and DayZ put together. I play a lot of FPS's and this is the only game where my heart pumps everytime I'm in a battle because you have so much invested in what you have on you. One you kill a person you can just take all of their stuff and it might have taken a while for them to get. I also like being able to build my own base and raidig other peoples bases.,Rust

Not only is it as hilarious as a bunch of naked men running around hitting eachother with rocks but it's so much fun to play with friends and it is very diverse and has a nice world.It also taught me not to trust my neighbours friends dogs bears and people in general because they all just want your 20/10,Rust
2014-03-24,0,0,55,True,Recommended,"I got this game a few days ago and I gotta say this is fun as hell but there's way to much KoS'ing. Be prepared to die. A lot.First server I joined was chalked full of KoS'ers around the good resource places so within 3 minutes of playing I gave up on collecting rocks n stuff and tried my luck at raiding a house I found with a wooden door. 10 minutes later I had full kevlar and an m4 after I accidentally accused one of the few friendlies on the server of KoS'ing me. Thinking the game was too easy I went around raiding for about another 2 or 3 hours before being worshiped by the moderately well geared players as ""the luckiest n00b ever"". My luck was about to run out. I built a nice base in the mountains and had tons of gear and got contacted by a n00b helping ""friendly"" and his buddy who invited me on a night raid. Needless to say they took everything I had and killed my buddies. I quickly switched servers.The second server I joined had more friendlies but they mainly stuck to themselves. I teamed up with another n00b for a while and collected wood to make a base but got KoS'd while going to the place I had built up shelter before. I decided to switch servers again. I hopped around on more servers for a couple of hours before settling down on the server I'm currently playing on. Me and my buddies built ourselves a small base in the mountain in the middle of the map and logged off for the night. When we came back online we found our base heavily raided so we decided to move. After finding a nice place to set up shop we built up a base and collected a ton of resources for further building. A few hours later an airdrop lands right next to our base and the one major group of KoS'ers finds me and my base. They kill me a lot. But I kept coming back and eventually they actually gave me an m4 mp5 2 pistols and a research kit. Somehow I had accidentally made an ally of the strongest and most feared group on the server. They've stopped KoS'ing me and now I'm aiming to build a metal base way in the north away from everyone. I only have a little over 36 hours logged in the game. This n00b has got some skill. Can't wait to see what else gets added in game.",Rust

2017-11-25,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Maybe 7 Days to Die just raised my expectations for all other survival games too high for my reviews to be fair but I'm reviewing anyway.Rust feels like 7 Days to Die but without zombies (obviously). It's rather boring to play alone or with a small group of friends and on larger servers it's hard to do anything without getting killed immediately upon spawning. So the options are playing privately or on an empty ish server or playing on a large server and getting killed upon spawning. The first option is boring as there are really no threats to your survival to make a serious challenge and the second option just sucks for new players trying to join a server.Once again I compare this survival game to 7 Days to Die which is challenging thanks to the zombies and day 7 hordes and other game mechanics.,Rust

Like a city with school food area (Resturant) and like shops with clothes that you can take from manekins (the white plastic human doll). And more guns should be developerd. With this i mean there is more forest then there is to explore. But I would say that if they fix more rads city or town the. This game will be sooo popular.And like abounded subways in the city. If you developers fix this I swear this game will be at the top on the first summer day next yearThis game is awesome you should definitely get it it's worth the money and you can easily make friends.And I also want the developers to make it easier to get weapons cause now I want them to add zombies ),Rust

This game offers all that w/ a price point that is really dirt cheap especiallly now with the autumn sale that this game just became a steal. There are some problems the game but not too big of a deal for me anyway but if there is a survival game that should be given a chance it is this one.,Rust

2015-10-04,0,0,663,False,Not Recommended,I have lot of mixed feelings when it comes to this game. I played it back in 2015 where I played the game hours on end and found it extremely addictive. However through the multiple changes of the game and the development path it has taken down until now I find it difficult for this game to have me captivated for even five minutes. Honestly I've just gotten tired of this game now. The xp system was alright and the components system was kind of just meh. But the current crafting table system is just not my style anymore you can't be really creative with building anymore because of daily upkeep costs that were implemented and the recoil changes make gunplay less unique. Overall I can't play this game and have fun anymore. Sure go ahead and take it for a spin. But I'm done.,Rust

The only problem i have is building up your house nice and big accumulating lots of supplies and crafting/finding all sorts of guns and then it all of your hard work and dedication to the game is just THROWN IN THE TOILET BY HACKERS WHO SHOULD HEADBUTT A KNIFE. Steam if you actually take time to read this YOU NEED TO IMPROVE YOUR ANTI CHEAT SYSTEM I SWEAR THE SYSTEM HAS SCREWED ME OVER SO MANY TIMES WITH MULTIPLE GAMES AND ITS T. IVE PUT SO MANY HOURS INTO RUST TEAM FORTRESS 2 AND GARRYS MOD AND MOST OF MY MATCHES IN TF2 AND GARRYS MOD AND ALL THE HOURS IVE PUT INTO RUST HAVE BEEN FOR ABSOULUTELY NOTHING.

2017-02-15,0,0,291,True,Not Recommended,"So after quite a while im changing my review for Rust.Rust is an amazing survival game with great graphics and atmosphere. Its a much more harsh experience compared to games like Ark because your number one enemy in Rust is not nature but all the humans you play with (though bears will mess you up).Sadly with the many latest updates for Rust basebuilding has gotten incredibly mediocre with focus on making automatic turrets and traps rather than fortifications in the shape of engenious construction work. Forced server wipes upon forced server wipes has made it a pain just to play the game. With the added component based crafting it is now more of a scavenger hunt vs. other players than a harsh fight for food and water. simply put bad update after bad update has made me change my standing from ""The best survival game i own"" to ""im going to uninstall it and never play it again"".I can no longer recommend this game to anyone.",Rust

Rust is a very fun game where you can connect with friends or just people you meet and try to survive against nature and other players wanting a little bit of your hard earned loot. If pvp isnt your thing there are hundreds of servers with little to no people on them. But if you like pvp then you can join some of the more populated servers where you have to look over you shoulder while you collect some rock or wood. There are also a fair few servers that offer a PUBG version of the game where you can fight against other players to increase you skill in combat or just have a good time.,Rust

Many depends on you don't trust anyone or make strongest friendship ever.Now about some horrible disadvantages their anti cheat politics. There is no ban safe warranty for any player. You may get banned if you didn't cheat as well as you won't get banned even if you cheat for months. The game is also unsafe from script using dishonest players (no recoil script as example). Playing on modded servers (the ones that use legal plugins) you may discover that your key bindings are getting collapsed each time you launch the game. I got banned for creating a script for myself that was replacing corrupted cfg file into a working one each time i launch Rust. I went even further and got myself a new copy of a game. And quickly discovered that there are still some other players with aimbot and wallhack which were not banned unlike me. The most irritating thing is the EAC anti cheat. You can't appeal they don't provide any evidence or reports from other player on you. They just ban. Pretty dubious politics of behavior some people are being banned for 8 years already. Hey finnish rats from EAC if you follow zero tolerance style of business to the ones who cheat on your opinion you'd better look deeper into each case. Otherwise is just a rip off of people's wallet. There won't be any cheaters indeed since everyone will be banned.Summarizing the game is cool but think twice before purchasing it.,Rust

One wipe your walking around fully geared next wipe you have a 2x1 the whole wipe struggling to roam with bows. now I didnt know how to rate this. yes or no? I say yes because in rust you have VERY i mean VERY thrilling and fun moments. Like raiding a jackpot base. But then you have EXTREMELY boring moments like when you hike up dome get nothing then die because you failed a jump. Now for people reading this who never played. It is a intresting game. Not only is the game hard but the community is stupidThe community Toxic af but still can have fun and interact. will play downstairs in the basement for 48 hours on wipe day.

Frustrated with the ridiculous zombie AI mechanics of DayZ I found my proverbial survivor home with Rust. I originally stopped playing Rust almost a year ago because of the increase in hackers.I recently came back and was blown away with the new graphics and building system! I haven't had any issues with hacking (not to say it doesn't exist) but still have a problem with raiders. I am all for open world PvP but feel as though a properly upgraded base should provide players with a bit more security. In all honesty this is the ONLY complaint I have with the game. I would love to see the following implemented into the game Stronger base capabilities various trap systems would be incredible! BRING BACK SOME FORM OF ZOMBIES (please!) Fishing (as an additional food source) More clothing/equipment options (e.g. camo ghille suits etc.)I love the direction the devs are headed and will still continue to be a fan of Rust. &lt 3",Rust

As many of you might know from other reviews this community is toxic as . No seriously I don't think I've seen a more horrible group of (apparently) humans in any other game....or existence.It wouldn't be so bad if the dev's actually didn't favor very very sick narcissists who need mental help to dominate their would be high ranking game.Until I see more care for the whole of humanity than the one's who SERIOUSLY NEED HELP I'm expecting a refund or actually being paid to play this head ache.Making a bad game is one thing but making a good one and twisting it into something terrible is unforgivable.,Rust

2018-02-18,0,0,75,False,Recommended,Early access PUBG runs better than this game. That says a lot honestly. This game is still very unoptimized despite it being out of early access. Lowering the graphics options barely does anything to fix the framerate drop and I have decent specs that can run games on higher graphics settings fine. I literally get more FPS from PUBG on ultra than I do in this game on lower graphics settings.But you know what it's fun. There's lots of stuff to do lots of possibilities and I appreciate the challenge of survival it brings up especially in... m multiplayer.Don't enter multiplayer servers alone your will get ed believe me. But this is the same for any other multiplayer survival game.Rust has a bunch of depth to it much more than you'd ever expect and I appreciate that. There's so much you can do when building bases crafting etc. that the game has unlimited replayability. And even though the dangers of survival in this game are the same every time they're always unexpected.,Rust

Now it's all about group battles killing noobs hording profanity and being a general douchbag. This game turned to crap once Facepunch focused on group play. Now It's horrible playing casually. You earn too slowly &amp you get raided after a couple hours. You can have a crappy wood shack and a group of guys will come tear it down just because they don't benefit from it infact it wastes their resources. Servers are all littered with already raided bases because groups do nothing but go out and raid just because. I did mention that in the past there were glitches yes but at least those didn't kill you. Imagin casually exploring the ocean in your wetsuit &amp diving gear. No need to worry you have 5 min of air... Yup then you drown randomly for no reason with 545 seconds left of air in your scuba gear. Amazing!Facepunch needs to scrap Rust and themselves.

I was fortunate enough to have 2 other friends who bought the game and later on met a few of really good friends.

But i have had a blast playing this solo and in a group before and i still would recommend this game for others to try. But for me i have lost interest in the game after the new BP/Component system as i see u spend more time trying to get those gears rather than roaming around doing pvp or other stuff.To finnish this i am looking forward to what the devs have in plans for this game.,Rust

2018-02-24,0,0,91,False,Recommended,This game is... interesting.When you are starting out much of the game is running around naked and beating people to death with rocks or stabbing them with pointy sticks. When they kill you however you have to be really good at begging for your life.If you manage to live long enough you can acquire some resources to help you build a base to keep you safe from those people out there. Only problem is now people target you because they know you have stuff and you are constantly worried about losing it all.Problem is you can't just sit in your base because if you sit in your base your base decays and eventually crumbles into nothingness thus forcing you to go outside and gather resources to keep your base maintained thus putting you at risk of death.Soon as you think you're doing well some jackass with a nailgun comes kills you and takes all your stuff and back to square one you go.Overall it's a 10/10 game. Amazing hardcore apocalypse survival akin to DayZ except without NPCs and less of a learning curve.,Rust

2018-02-24,0,0,442,False,Not Recommended,"So why am I not recommending Rust? Many reasons. 1. Grindfest. Ever since the implementation of the scrap and component system the game has become a chore especially for small groups and solo players. I personally quit when I was devoting 60 hours a week to maintain a small base with basic gear.2. Lack of direction from game devs. As much as I like Helk and Garry they both don't know what the final vision of this game is going towards. It first started as a serious ish survival game then survival game with elements of counter strike and now its just a week long PUBG simulator with bases.3. Servers. The ""Official"" servers have been a garbage for a while. They are filled with cheaters massive clans and DDOSers. The community servers are extremely unreliabled. Crashing frequently abusive admins are getting constantly DDOSed and some even adapted the Pay 2 Win method of monitization. 4. Leaving Early Access. This game is plagued with numerous bugs exploits and optimization issues. It is in no state to be ready for full release. From what I could gather from the dev blogs it seems that they justified this by saying ""Because we want to slow down development to work on other things"". If the devs want to slow down development for Rust I'm cool with that but it just seems that they are trying to use the Full Release to poorly justify this. Plus see point 2. 5. Constant sales and the cheater problem. This game has been sold for extremely low prices in the past year. The lowest I've ever seen was about $2 in a humble bundle. This low price combined with the fact they use one of the worst anti cheats out there (easy anti cheat) has led to a quite high rise in cheaters. Even to the point where many people will not play if the game is on sale to avoid cheaters. Ending Note. I did once love this game and it was once a game I pointed at when people asked what was a good Early Access game but now it just feels like a shell of what it once was. I really did wish that Rust didn't become what it is now and still hope that it can become as great as it once was.",Rust
2017-01-30,0,0,1388,False,Recommended,Ok I'm changing review to positive since they fixed most of the things i was frustrated of so i won't be a ... Rust is a great game but there is still one MAJOR problem draging around for years... most of the servers (unless you want to play on biggest servers with 15 man clan people) just die after 1 or 2 days and there's practically no reason to play the game if everything you achieved would matter no more after a day... big big problem really i guess that pure BP system back in 2015/2016 really kept the game most alive than ever.,Rust

2014-04-21,0,0,244,False,Not Recommended,small groups used to do well in this game but over time a form of social gravity brings huge groups together. This makes it too difficult for new people to get going. I can t reccomend it for small groups but if you have a large friend circle go for it. Also this game is not for people who are too nice like it will tear you down how mean people will be but that s what they have to do to survive.,Rust

2018-02-25,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,As much as I really want to like this game I cannot recommend this for anyone that is looking for fun or a semi relaxing game of survival and resource gathering. This review is not based on my experience with gameplay or the mechanics that the game has. The one reason that I can't recommend this game is mainly because of the people that play it. It doesn't matter if you are a passive player walking around gathering resources you will still die to by people with powerful weapons and strong armor. Yes I get that raiding is a big thing about this game but it's just not fun nor ok if you die every 5 minutes after respawn. It's not worth the money that I paid for it and I don't think I can ever find myself playing this ever. If you ever find this game at 50% or more on sales by all means pick it up with a couple of friends. Other than that I would rather play MineCraft than this game.,Rust

2016-11-07,0,0,1661,False,Recommended,"all right es sit down and buckle up for a bumpy ride were I talk ab Rust I started playing this game during the original Blueprint progression system btw.Rust is the most unforgiving hardest game to get into piece of but once you get in and figure what the flying is going on it's all worth it.By the way if you play this game solo you're either a) a very good veteran player and / or streamerb) autisticPlay this game with friends or you're gonna have a bad time and don't expect to make friends with people in this game cause the community is more toxic than Chernobyl ever since around the experience progression system.This game has seen good and bad days but things are starting to fall into place. Combat system feels fluid for the most part guns are where they should be. Guns that cost high amounts of resources have a definite advantage on lower tier guns but also take a slight more amount of skill to use i.e. high damage but very high recoil.The current progression system is also exactly where it should be despite the fact that I (personally) despise it. Personally it feels like a crawl trying to find the item then the scrap to research it only to then go back out and farm resources to make it and that fact that if you get the item or not from a crate is totally random doesn't help much either. I feel like it heavily harms veteran players who like to occasionally drop in for maybe a week use their skills that they've aquired over the time they've played to make some insane plays on other players then be rewarded for their skill by getting more stuff in less time to me it should be like that if you're good at a game it should show however with the new progression system it forces those veteran players with 1000's of hours to go back to exactly what they hate to do farm . The reason they gave a to get good at the game was so that they could outskill other playewrs through PvP and thus completely disregard a need for farming however the current progression system hinders that process a ton.What this means is the system is good for new players as they are more willing to stick around for the farming process and there will be less guys who can 1v6 your zerg clan who bought the game on sale 5 days ago.To conclude these two points Rust was a mess and is still a big mess animal AI is bewilderingly there are lots of bugs and dumb that will you off but this game is a mess you will come to love. It's definitely not gonna fix it's hot mess of a self any time soon but it' still worth the hassle. And with the current look of the devs's update roadmap this game has my hopes high for turning into something truly spectacular when it's done.Although tbh for where the game is at right now it's definitely not worth $40 I can't stress it enough wait for a sale.And a lil' personal game play story for those of you who stuck through this review to the end &gt be me&gt be 17&gt still loving rust&gt veteran player setup giat zerg base with other 5 guys who easily all have over 1000 hours&gt arab guy in group ""guys lets build a mosque""Holy muddafuq shett good idea&gt build giant 10 x 10 mosque&gt thing would make allah cry&gt neighbors frequently see us go in out&gt think its our base since they don't know ab underground true base&gt they begin to online raid mosquetheres not even a single gun in there&gt they waste 10+ rockets&gt our guy runs up waterpipes guy and get ak + rocket launcher&gt we gun down rest of them in name of allah&gt week later begin to raid them&gt screaming ""YOU WILL ALL DIE IN THE NAME OF ALLAH""&gt guys blasting ISIS music over mic&gt mow down every single one as they try to defend their base from the storm of rockets we fire at themNo one s with my rust mosque",Rust

But when you do reach that epic loot room goals and raid all of your enemies. It will be the best feeling ever!2 Never expect to enjoy the game without devoting time to learn it. Some gamers think just pressing buttons and laughing is the best way to play a game. this game is truly only mastered by those willing to research base design armor choices base locations and just the ability to be stealthy.

2018-10-22,0,0,1572,False,Recommended,I've played Rust for close to a year now and in the past year it has been my most played game and quickly climbed that ladder up to my favorites. I absolutely LOVE the rustic decaying artstyle. The gameplay however is definelete not for everyone. Unless you have a group to play with Rust will be a difficult game especially when starting. You have to have hours of time to spend on this game maintaining upgrading (primarily) researching etc. But when you get raided it feels like the world just collapsed ontop of you. Me being a solo player quickly learned that my prioreties seem to fall into running as far away from spawn as possible and then trying to make a base. I will admit I have gotten really mad and ragequit countless times. The game can be extremely frustrating but somehow just keeps drawing me back in. I only paid $10 for the game and I don't think i would have paid $35 for it but it has definaletely been an adventure. I would recommend this game if you have a bit of time to waste each day and you enjoy a good challenge but Rust is not for the casual player ESPECIALLY if you plan to go solo.,Rust

2018-02-24,0,0,399,False,Not Recommended,I'd like to recommend this game because I had some fun times back in the day but unfortunately I can't. I'm a solo/duo player mostly because of my casual gaming lifestyle. I don't like to join big groups where it ends up being a job because you have to be on at certain times or you have to do tasks put forth by the so called leader of the group. The most frustrating part of this game which has been mentioned I've seen many times is the offline raiding aspect of the game. Getting raided and having intense gun fights is part of the fun of the game. Someone shows up you fight for your life to protect your stuff that's what makes it fun. If I lose all my stuff because I failed at defending my base I can deal with that. But when I spend a whole day farming collecting and building only to wake up the next day log on and see that everything I did the day before is gone with no hope of stopping it practically every single day that's too frustrating. If that's something you think you can deal with then you could have a lot of fun on this game. Personally if that aspect was different I might give this game another try. Maybe they could do something like 7 days to die has. When nobody is online with permissions on a tool cupboard the stuff in range of the cupboard is fortified or something. Maybe that would deter people from doing so much offline raiding. I'm sure people would try to exploit it and just have one person have permissions to build then never be on but I'm sure you could find a way to counteract that as well. I guess just my opinion but personally I don't like losing everything I've worked for without a hope of stopping it on a daily basis.,Rust

2015-10-26,0,0,2534,True,Recommended,This is probably my favorite post apocalypse survival game to date And there are so many to choose from on steam I have played a good amount of them and Rust always sticks with me it has an addictive feel to the game. On most servers you will find yourself nervously attempting to make yourself civilised enough in terms of tools and weaponry to stay alive long enough to build a base and make it strong enough to withstand a raid. Other servers are purely for building and community pleasure and you meet a lot of great people in game eager to help you which cannot be said about the PvP servers even if someone is friendly on a PvP server you have a strong instict not to trust them and leave you for dead once they have robbed you blind. Here are a decent list of reasons why i choose Rust over so many survival titles *Dev team are solid on bringing new cool stuff with every update whist working on bugs from previous builds. * You actually feel threatened even in the safety of your base (Door campers zergs etc) keeping you on guard.* The look feel and atmosphere of Rust all way down the the maps and sound fx keeps you hooked* The many many options you have while building* Being able to customize your character to great lengths* The combat feels really intense and realistic.All in all over all other titles i would choose Rust I heavily recommend you to do the same.,Rust
2016-08-29,0,0,1404,False,Not Recommended,I used to ing love this game everyone did now it just feels like too much of a grind to get anything done like i have to wait for a specific time in the month to get on a fresh wiped server?Why dont we just make it like a wave where different servers are wiping at different times?Also thats another thing ADD MORE OFFICIAL SERVERS there are waaaay too many people on the servers whenever there is a wipe its half the servers are full 300/300 style and the rest are empty or about 2/150 style...How are we supposed to play a game which requires me to play for a full 2 weeks to even get close to any good gear? Sure if your a lazy no life who plays video games all day then go right ing ahead this game is for you! But if your like 90% of the earth then how the am i supposed to get anywhere past bows and waterpipes?All in all this game is just too much of a grind and no longer fun you know why i used to love playing rust when it was in alpha? Because i didnt have to spend half my ing life looting box after box to get a ing revolver.Garry if you ever see this pls fix and dont just add another ing crafting system when the last one was fine oh whats that?

2016-09-20,0,0,178,False,Recommended,"2016 review Got killed by a guy after we shot him 1 time with a shotgun and 3 times with a gun. He shot 2 times with a crossbow and we got killed. Also rocks are the stupidest thing to find the game is when it comes to rocks. Also animals clip through everything so you can't catch or run away from anything. Also bears walk on water. UPDATE Other than a horrible cheating issue where you can instant heal and make walls instantly to the best material you have on you. They mostly fixed the above issues. (I did shoot a person 3 times with a modded out Spas 12 with slugshots in the face from 5 feet away in the span of about 3.5 seconds. And he ended up spamming me in the face with a pistol and i died *note* i was wearing brand new metal face mask and metal armor and he had nothing on. Admin did not call any cheats from his ""logs"" but i can't see how anything else would be possible with the sounds of me hitting him.) So yea cheating is still an issue but they fixed alot of bugs improved gameplay graphics and animal AI. That is no more bears walking on water deers clipping through rocks etc. The fact that they kept adding stuff and fixing issues must be held to praise with these devs adding boats and all the things you would expect that come with boats. I can now sucessfully conclude this review from a would not recommend to a would recommend. Good price fun with friends and devs work harder than PUBG devs so yea overall great job.",Rust
2018-11-10,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,In my first few hours of playing rust was great and completely fun and enjoyable. the only thing I would have to complain about is the high toxic level of immature players on all servers.... it sure isnt easy and requires alot of time and proper stragety in order to succesfully deffend or raid another players base... the one thing I would like much more is an option setting to disable chat showing up unless you are typing in it... over all the game runs great Great graphics and 99.9% lag free unless you conect to someones server thats running off a there low buget pc... Game could still use alot more improvments tho... Like an option to sucide if you have nothing in your inventory because the game has trolls that knock you down and take your stone rock and tourch... you cant do anything then you gotta spend 10 minutes to find a cliff Look for something to clim up to jump off of swim to a drown at the beach... or find Animals that attaks you.... this game is a waste of time..,Rust

I asked other players too show me the ropes but it was just full of try hards and children who just went full ADHD. Basically you spawn try to grind get shot in the back repeat for an eternity. I honestly cant remember the last time I had such a tedious boring and annoying experience. This is the kind of game that makes me want to give up this hobby as a whole. All in all I say avoid this ""game"" like the plague. Its already clear that a toxic community like this shrinks the already obscure player base and will kill the game in the end.",Rust

I spent 8 hours straight building a 5 story base with reinforced walls loot weapons and much more. This is a very fun game to play with your friends. I suggest starting out with your friends because it is very hard. There are very hardcore people that will kill you with a bow even if you have a gun.

2018-11-11,0,0,409,False,Recommended,after a long while of play around 90 hours i can tell this game is one of the best games that u could ever buy however it has few problems within it.1.ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY SOLO no matter how good you are you either will die on road when building when farming or whenever you go offline the night your base will be raided by clans.2.REALLY BAD OPTIMIZATIONS lot of times when i click to join severs it crashes the whole game and i have to restart the steam all over again3.GRINIDNG FOR SCRAP as a new player you will think only problem in your life is to just get stones metals and wood but when you get enough experience you will realise that you need one more thing and that is scrap which you will get very little each run through out the map but you need insane amount when back in home and if you dont have scrap you will basically fight sniper rifles players with your hand made bow which brings two problems together one well again you need others to help each other grinding scrap and its frustrating doing it solo and.two its repetitive and time consuming which you litteraly have to go to the same roads hit barrels with what ever weapon you have and collect scraps.3RD problem i think is the worst part of this game especially if you dont have anyone to play with imagine your base is on very south of the map and if you choose one road and go all the way up and hit barrels and collect scraps and not die to duos and sniper clans which build theire basis right on top of those roads you will come back with around 100 150 scrap to home and it will take around 20 up to an hour depending on your tool which you brake barrels or how many you do on each area and each side in real life day you will find around 500 scrap each day if you play all day because thats not the only need of the game coz in the mean time you need ton of other things to do and you will be stuck at maximum crossbow while others use ak47s 4. AI human AI in this game is pain in the which together with 3rd problem will prevent solo players from geting end game guns even more.there are caves and places which you can go and find guns so you can bring those home and learn how to craft same guns by again using scraps which well first of all good luck getting in those places and getting out while clans farm those places every second and second even if you go there good luck killing AI with your cross bow which gaurd the place why?ok let me tell you why.Ak kills player with around 2 to 5 shots on average.same ak kills an AI around 4 to 8 shots on average.bow kills a player on average 4 to 10 (they are not idiot they heal as you shoot each time) same bow kills AI... oh wait it doesnt unless you shoot them 100 time and consedring there is 10 to 20 AI covering each place well good luck again geting your hand on that gun again.so long story short either play on servers that are almost empety like less than 5 players or have at least one good friend that plays everytime you play the game or have your patience level maxed out in real life otherwise you will brake ten keyboard and monitors each day other than that you are fool if you dont buy this game coz you will miss a lot.,Rust

Getting kicked out of queues on servers for no reason and given no error message has happened commonly and for those who haven't played the games the queues on a large server take a ridiculous amount of time. On top of that the new AI that they have implimented that is supposed to provide a safe zone will kill you for aggression which is should if you are being chased by people who are trying to camp it out and you run inside in hopes of them saving you they will shoot and instantly kill you because thats how good AI work. If you chose to subject yourself to the constant weekly wiping which makes all of your work meaningless the AI that can't get its finger off of the trigger even to those that are trying to flee certain death and possibly the most toxic community on steam good luck...

2018-03-29,0,0,26,False,Recommended,Is Rust a good game? Yes it is. Does it have its flaws? Oh yeah.First things first the world is beautiful and huge the graphics really are top notch. The crafting and building is insanely easy and fun. Its also very rewarding to get resources and work up to being the best. But the good things kind of stop there. The character modles are so rubbery and move in choppy manners the only way to get over it is to laugh it off. There are almost no animals in the map so it feels very fake and baren. I know most people complain about the community and how everyone is a and will kill you on sight but though this is a true statement for the most part Ive also met some very nice people who have spared my life and even helped me. And it is a survival game so you shouldnt explect anyone to be your bestie. It really is survival of the fittest or survival of the one who plays most. If you put time and effort into the game you will be rewarded. I recommend this game (but on a side note if you are debating buying this or ARK buy ARK. Better animals and stuff). Just watch your back look out for bears be slow to trust people and youll do just fine.,Rust

Killing you for simply no reason other than because they saw you and simply could. Raiding your base even if you have nothing of value. All of the worst the internet can offer all in one game.

2017-03-02,0,0,528,False,Not Recommended,A dielectric (or dielectric material) is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization. Because of dielectric polarization positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction. This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself. 1 If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules those molecules not only become polarized but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field.,Rust

As he runs through the grass fields Chad shows no respect towards wildlife nor silence. The madman probably deactivated push to talk and is currently singing All Stars with a mic volume buffer. Chad stops (his feet not his singing). A target has been acquired another naked player is chopping wood nearby. In a situation like this you would turn away and continue with your solo adventure but Chad is all about action and all about winning an imaginary trophy.Chad comes closer and the player immediately tries to keep distance with a bow and arrow Chad keeps walking towards him with a rock in his hands bouncing around thinking he'll dodge the arrow. The player is ready to nail this noisy man but notices something changed in Chad's lyrics. He's no longer singing the All Stars lyrics but he's actually asking the player to join as a team whilst keeping the song's melody. The player accidentally shoots Chad apologises and accepts Chad's request. The duo then traverses the planes singing All Stars repeating the same procedure when encountering a new player.When Chad's team reaches 4 to 5 members Chad's singing finally ceases. The group of naked men understands this signal announcing it's time to get serious. ""Where do we start building our base"" asks Timmy #2. ""Pff you don't start bases in this game. Follow me."" Chad replies. His eyes turning the reflection of the orange sky into fire when he spots a beautiful cabin down in the woods.The end.",Rust

2018-10-09,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,As a casual Rust player the game did not peak my interest. Rust feels like a standard survival game. You can gather materials to create things build a base and create items for you to use. I will admit the base building aspect of the game is impressive. You can build to your own imagination. The thing I do not like about it is the community is pretty toxic and your base can easily get raided and destroyed. It is hard to get started in this game because the already developed players can wipe you clean with no trouble. I suppose it adds to the difficulty aspect of the game but I was not a fan of it. There are many places to explore. I like all the structures you can investigate and loot. Rust may be for some people who enjoy hardcore survival games but my experience with it was unsatisfactory.,Rust

This is an amazing game and is amazingly fun with friends and even solo but you have to be willing to put in alot of time and effort even some days. it is better to start with friends but you must learn how to survive on your own or else you probibly wont be the best but if thats fine with you do it. 10/10 Amazing game buy if you have time and or willing to try over and over.............oh yea btw the community is toxic af REEEE Danit0,Rust

Ofc it's mostly the devs fault because there isn't much to do than building and raiding. The trade option is a good point.Dumb AI dumb physics (for example animals can run up on surfaces where players can't. No demolition hammer if you misplace something. Can't rotate the objects during placment you have to run around.Itt ragadnám meg az alkalmat hogy üzenjek a kis szaros ""lelőlek geci helyben mert megtehetem"" emberkéknek Attól hogy így játszotok nem lesztek többek csak kevesebbek.

Aki lövöldözni akar az olyan játékkal játszik. Itt nem a raid elésről van szó a szellemi rokkantak kedvéért.Update 2017.07.31.It's still a ""kill on sight"" game not a survival game. Some mechanics got better some are gone or got worse. New monuments? Yes.Better AI? Slightly yes. Is there anything else to do? No. Build check the new monument(s) kill or get killed raid or get raided maybe hide in a mine.

2018-10-25,0,0,894,False,Recommended,"Okay so i realize i havent made a review on either of the accounts I have this game on so im gonna make it on this one.My main account has about 300 hours on rust and this one 850hours at the time i write this comment.Sooo lets start out with the bad1) The game is absolute dog if you are by yourself (vanilla) modded servers make this better but at the end of the day you will probably get ganged up on by 4 people when ur farming on vanilla and get offlined. If you're new to the game i'll give you some advice to start off with. Go to /r/playrust LFG or whatever its called and find a noob friendly group that you can play with so you can learn more about the game while also having your own little team going.2) Repetitive game It its old much like every other game out there when you play it for a while considering how i have so many hours on the game it got rather old and stale over time. I have recently begun to play it again pretty often due to the amount of content that the devs have added to the game.3) Lag This game just like a lot of others gets lag at times for what seems to be no reason this could be you rubber banding back when your internet is completely fine or your frames becoming absolute dog out of nowhere. Since my computer doesnt have the best parts out there i will just assume its because i have out of date tech on my pc.4) ""Survival"" This game i really dont consider to be a survival game like a lot of people say... its more like a loot hoarding pvp game which is fine but really i just dont see it as survival. This is just a personal thing i guess5) ""Toxic community"" As number 4 states this game is pretty much a pvp loot hoarding game which means if you are a new player to a server and you just wanna make a base RP or whatever the hell you do you're in for a bad time. You will be pretty much KILLED ON SIGHT by literally anyone that sees you unless you are on a server that has a rule against KOS. Now even I can agree that the community of this game is toxic. Filled with hacking korean zergs dumb 10 year olds and just plain out s.. I believe they tried to counter KOS by adding a sash on your back if you have had a weapon or tool in your inventory but it seems that didnt do much of anything considering how people still KOS when you have no sash or loot on your body. People kill you just to be flat out I generally dont kill nakeds unless they are near a fight and may snag some loot or they are just me off. But some people do it as a big ""lol u naked"". So yes i would say that its a toxic community (most players at least)6) H a c k e r s Just dont ing go on a facepunch server please.The Good1) Content constantly being added and changed Ever since i first bought this game I always thought that it was cool how the rust team was always working on stuff to be in the game. They try to add more things like new events like the boats new items and ways to get loot etc.2) Interactions When you arent KOS'd on rust and you talk to people its a pretty good experience and usually you will have a good time until some geared guys kill you. People in this game can usually give me a good laugh when i meet them on the beaches and but thats probably just because they have nothing.. once they get a spear they will shove it into ur head more than likely. If you want to have more conversation or just talk there are places like the safezones you can run to and sometimes have a decent time in if you find other people in them.3) Pvp When the pvp works correctly and doesnt lag its a very good experience. Every weapon you use can be something you can make a play with a sword a spear etc all of these weapons you can kill someone geared with and snowball if you wanted to try it out. 4) Modded servers If you are a casual player like some and dont like the constant grind and bs you have to deal with to get to top tier modded servers offer things for people like you. Rust offers 2x 3x 5x even 1000x servers that just give you a lot more than Vanilla servers do. There will be less grind but more pvp in these servers usually. Most experienced players i've talked to dont like modded including myself so if you're solo or duo and just wanna get some quick loot join a 2x or a 3x they will be more friendly if you're newer to the game.5) Feeling Rust gives me a feeling that most other games cant do and thats when they just make my adrenaline flow fast as hell. When you are close to the nice snowball that you've been dreaming for.. no meds all teammates dead and just one more mag and that adrenaline pumps i just love that it makes me hard as hellOverall Rust for me personally is a 8 out of 10 It isnt really perfect at all with the lag and but it is a good game at the end of the day. The work they put into this game over the years has turned out to be in my opinion a great game.",Rust

2018-11-25,0,0,176,False,Recommended,I woke up on a beach with nothing but a torch and a rock. It was night when i spawned so i thought the best thing to do would be to light up my torch and look for stuff that would be useful for my first time in Rust. I was wrong very wrong. Seconds after I lit my torch swarms of naked and half dressed people came running at me with rocks and spears screaming and playing mainstream memes and music from their mics. It was then when I wanted to know how to kill myself in rust (If you don t know it s F1 and then type kill). After that when I respawned at a different beach a man wearing trash and cloth was screaming really loud and making weird noises. I looked in front of him from a distance and saw a bear attacking him. Without hesitation I lunged towards the bear with my rock and bashed it s head. But the bear wasn t done yet. It fought back and knocked me to the ground. Just as I thought I was about to die. I heard gun shots and saw the bear fall to the ground. I was picked up by the man in cloth and trash. He thanked me and took me to his base where he fed and healed me. He asked if I was new to the game and I said yes. He said I could stay with him until the end of the wipe. I went to sleep that night feeling accomplished in Rust. I woke up the next day excited ready to play Rust.I loaded the game and joined the server greeted by a a screen saying I was dead and I was killed by a semi automatic rifle. I didn t play Rust for a while after that until I learnt more about the game and found out what happened to me in the base was called getting raided.Toxic community savage bears and wolves. Just a great game especially with friends. 10/10,Rust

2018-11-26,0,0,796,False,Recommended,This game has a very sharp learning curve and can be very frustrating. At 600 hours I'm still learning how to play! Facepunch is doing a great job adding content with monthly updates and the developers actually listen to the community with some of those additions. Rust can feel very repetitive but something about it draws me back in every time.It is especially fun to play with friends and definitely gives you an edge in PVP situations. It is still playable solo and there are servers that only allow groups of up to one two or three players on a team if you're having trouble on vanilla where it is very likely you will come up agrainst a group of five ten or possibly even more players. I play as a solo or in a duo most of the time and the moments where you come out on top are definitely worth the struggles in my opinion.I wouldn't really recommend the game if you can't dedicate a lot of time to it since you need to constantly harvest materials to maintain your base. And the larger your base the more materials you need to harvest. You can find yourself playing for hours get some gear get a base down then you log off to get some rest. You go to school or work or whatever else you do during the day then you log back on and you've lost everything. Right back at square one. It can be very frustrating but some people enjoy that.However there are modded servers that speed up or remove the not so fun grinding process of the game which can also be very fun to do. There are so many different servers with different levels of modifications that can improve the game for people who don't have much time to game.,Rust

2018-10-11,0,0,243,False,Recommended,Hundreds of hours in and I'm still enjoying Rust. I enjoy the continual updates this games has gotten over the years as the develpment team is always working to improve the game. Rust's crafting system is solid and the loot drops are pretty fair making it not too difficult to get your base up and running.Although I do reccomend this game that reccomendation does come with a few caveats. For me rust is a mainly co op game. The majority of players you'll meet will be hostile or toxic. They'll usually kill on sight making it difficult to go alone. For this reason I mainly will play with friends. Fortunately I have met many players that are willing to work together which helps make the game more enjoyable especially if you're playing on your own.With all that being said Rust is a fantastic survival game offering a solid PVP experience as well as interesting roleplaying opportunities.,Rust

More like armed and friendly! Players armed with Thompsons as a result of grinding for hours on the first day of a server wipe oftentimes help naked players get started on the server! In the rare instances that armed players DO murder naked players they're usally very good sports about it.TL DR Rust's community is very player friendly and non toxic.,Rust

On the other hand you can do whatever you want its your choice but a fun game can lead to awesome adventures zombies are rare to the game but i wish developers could add more because scientists can kill them within a *snap*!!

One other dislike that i had is how toxic the community is at least with launge and among being very hostile all the time there still is some acctually decent people in the game.Another great thing about this game is that there constently doing resets to give a level playing field as well as there is a veriety of things that can be crafted.,Rust

2018-07-22,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,The game is made really well and is by far the best survival game out there. However the community is toxic and its almost impossible to set up a house so it will ruin your day. Making any actual progress is relieving but its a brutal survival sim and instead of the focus on getting gear and tech its simply staying alive. No matter how much you have you are always at risk of losing it all to some weaboo neckbeard or salty 9 year old.Great game but community ruins it play with friends or play very safe if you wanna have fun in the slightest.,Rust

2018-11-25,0,0,1465,False,Recommended,Honestly this game is a roller coaster of emotions there's vanilla servers which have 0 mods added nothing to help you in gather things faster which is nice but I don't recommend being solo on them or if you do start out as solo then get a friend or friends then there's modded servers these servers can vary you have servers where you can gather resources 2 10 times most servers above 3x are there to help you around the game then you have aim training and battlefield servers the servers mainly to help you control spray paterns these servers are great if you want to get better in the game.I recommend this game to people who don't get frustrated easily and for people that are okay with losing progress that you've put hours into this game is about gaining and losing there's s all over but sometimes you meet nice people which you begin a great experience with. If you buy this game good luck in the buttnaked world,Rust
2018-03-01,0,0,317,False,Recommended,Do I recommend this game?Yes!Rust is a unique open world survival FPS in which you must survive against many other players and NPCs.Imagine this...You wake up on a beach shore naked with just a rock and a torch and whatever you do next is up to you. You don't know who you are or why you're here but you have one goal SURVIVE AT ANY COST. You wander around collecting resources gaining valuable items and finally make a little base. You slowly upgrade your arsenal from spears and bows to more modern weapons such as revolvers and basic rifles.As you explore more and more you stumble upon other people some friendly and some not. Whether you befriend them or not is up to you...Now I'm gonna get all technical.This game has lots of pros It's open ended making gameplay and replayability basically endless. As of writing this I have spent over 200 hours in this game and I definitely haven't explored all possible outcomes of playing.The general community isn't the best but if you play with friends and make allies the game is much more enjoyable and less grindy.The weapon physics and movement system is pretty good in my opinion with gunfights being very skill based and rather realistic.The devs are very in touch with the community posting weekly community updates and constantly informing players of the future of the game. That alone to me is very important and I respect how much time and effort is put into each update.Now the cons The biggest con to me is how unrewarding the game is in the long run. Each month all progress from the past is wiped whether you want it to be or not.Now while this is useful for server/player balancing it's just an unfortunate event that happens.One other thing that deters me from playing is how grindy the game can be. Rust isn't a game where you stop by and play for an hour then be done because you can't get much done in such a short amount of time. If you are wanting to truly play Rust you are going to need lots of time to be able to play the game to it's full potential.Optimization is also a problem. You don't neccessarily need an extremely powerful pc to be able to play but Rust demands a lot of processor and graphics card power. Luckily optimization is constantly being improved to the point that I have gained over 30 fps since I started playing Rust less than a year ago.One last thing. If you've never watched any content over Rust I definitely suggest you take a bit of time to understand what you are about to get yourself into. The Rust experience is very hard and unforgiving and playing without any knowledge is extremely difficult.

2018-11-25,0,0,238,False,Recommended,This is the point where the game starts to drop. The toxicity of the community can make newer players upset about the fact that whenever they try to kill a good player they just get called a terrible player and they're 'trash'. Again this can make bad players really demotivated and not want to play on servers with players who know what they're doing. You could be doing so well and then get double teamed by a bunch of people with SAR's and then they would trash talk you while you bleed out infront of them. This is pretty annoying but after awhile it becomes kind of a natural thing to happen. You don't want this to happen to you. There's rarely anymore kind players and everyone just wants to trash talk other people and try to look good at the game. For a person that only started to play a week or two ago I've began to understand that RUST is a game about skill and if you don't know how to control the AK47 spray there's not much for you in a modded server or vanilla. I learned fairly quickly about the AK spray and quite frankly I really enjoy the game in some parts. I wouldn't find anything being grindy (except for component farming which gives a chance of you to lose everything and then start over again). Other than that. This game is pretty fun but there's still cons for new players.,Rust

2018-11-21,0,0,154,False,Recommended,"Although the community is pure toxicity and ""cancer"" I would say without a doubt that this is an amazing game. My favorite things about the game are Constant developer support for the game meaning new updates and new content quite often. Great to play with friends and with the new party feature it is easier to do so. Many items and features in the game. Huge amount of servers to choose from server support is well developed on Rust. PvP is plentiful it's almost impossible to become bored when there is always constant looting and killing and exploring to do. (not to mention raiding although it isn't really worth it.)I currently have a few complaints about the game mainly involving how the servers and community behave Toxicity is everywhere if you are faint of heart or one of those ""special overprivileged snowflakes"" then this isn't the game for you. Clans will dominate you clans are everywhere and if you don't submit they will take care of you easily. Zergs (massive groups of people who attack together) are common it's the same story as the clans but they are more violent and hostile. Game optimization is very poor even if you have a good pc you will have a hard time running this game at 60FPS at all times on the highest graphics or even medium graphics. Very high difficulty curve it's not easy to play the game and get good at it if you don't dedicate enough time. Although I haven't encountered too many cheaters due to my low play time I've noticed that people complain of hacking and cheating in the game a lot and it is true there are quite a few hackers and cheaters in the game.Most of my complaints are based upon the community and the servers themself not really against the game. If you feel like that there should be anything else added to my list then feel free to comment. Overall I highly recommend buying Rust despite the price being raised I think it is worth it. Especially compared to other games in the same category for higher prices.",Rust

2017-03-22,0,0,422,True,Recommended,Like the game but the fact that Favorites Hisotry and Friends Tabs under servers doesnt work and not all servers are being shown takes about 30 minutes to find a serveri was playing on previously. Only 10 to 30 severs only show up over a 10 minutes period is gonna be a deal breaker got roommates who play and they cant figure it out either. uninstalled and reinstalled dont know why theirs both show thoursands of players mine only show a few hundred with liek 15 servers in each category. Becoming a real issue game play though like 6.5/10 need more crafting options for everything including traps weapons armor like a Bola made from rope and stone. Maybe a Trap that fires blowdarts or arrows or one taht you coudl have in your base that drops a bunch of rocks or like somethign you pour over peopel raiding your baise involving crude oil and fire or a weapon coudl be a catapult/trabuchet that cost a GOOD amount of wood Or a Battering rams requiring liek 2 4 or 8 people for a game 13 years in the making or so could be alot better,Rust

2018-03-17,0,0,107,False,Not Recommended,"First let's talk about what is good about Rust.Decent Progression The current progression system in Rust is based around obtaining both scrap and blueprints from looting and using scrap in order to create blueprints at a research table learning the blueprint and finally allowing you to craft the item at the correct level workbench. While the system does have it's problems (which I wil talk about in the cons section) overall I like the concept of having to take time to find and unlock better items. It adds a bit more of a sense of direction to the game that before it was added was missing.Okay now that's we've talked about what's good we can get to all the things that are bad.First and foremost... The community is toxic as all hell I'm not joking I don't think I have ever seen a more toxic community in a game in my entire life. Almost every person you encounter will try to kill you regardless of how gear you are and regardless of how geared they are. There are servers where extremely geared player will literally just sit at the spawn points and shoot you every time you respawn. Heck I've even been on servers where other nudies (fresh spawns) will sit and spawn camp the other nudies... for literally no reason there is nothing to gain from killing nudies. You'd be hard pressed to find a single official server that does not include almost all of the following Fly hackers Aim botters Griefers who raid your base and then lock you out of it... not take it for use just make sure you can never use it again Massive clans that take over the entire server and relentlessly hunt down any new players until they quit the game People who wait until you log off to raid your base because they're too cowardly to do it while you're online Tons of racial slurs Tons of koreans and russians who speak no English in the slightest (on US servers)A zerg clan that has full metal armor and AKs 5 hours after wipe while you're still trying to build a base.The community of rust is just on a never ending downward spiral of toxicity. The toxicity makes the casual players quit which only leaves the toxic player remaining so when you join a server it's almost guarunteed that every player on it is the most toxic person you've ever seen. People who take pride not in a fair fight or in having fun or even in the sense of accomplishment of beating an equally skilled opponent but in attacking people while they can't defend themselves killing griefing and raiding not because they need supplies or because you are a threat but simply because they know it pisses you off.The base upkeep system The current base upkeep system was added by facepunch in order to combat zergs and large clans. Does it actually do this... hell no. The current upkeep system does nothing more than hinder casual and solo players. The way the system currently works is that once a base is built a tool cupboard (TC) must be placed which covers an area and only allows those who are authorized in it to build any higher than twig level inside of the protected area). The TC then requires a certain amount of resources every day in order to keep your base from starting to decay. The type and amount of resources is based on what the base is made of and how big it is. The more people who are connected to the TC the higher the resource cost. If the base ever gets damaged after ten minutes of no damage the TC will use even more of the supplies stored in it to repair the damage. Once the TC runs out of supplies your base begins to decay. Once the decya begins you can expect your walls to be destoyed in 3 hours and your entire base to be destroyed in around 6 hours.Now that you know how it works allow me to explain all of the massive problems with it. First off the upkeep costs are so astronomically high that it's near impossible for solo or casual players to upkeep their bases. A simple 3x3 3 story base (which in rust is a rather small base) costs 40 000 stone per day to upkeep which is around 3 4 hours of mining just to be able to upkeep your base. This makes it near impossible for any casual or solo players to play as they will have to spend almost all of their time just preventing their base from falling apart. Also you know how I said that a 3x3x3 stone base costs 40k/day to upkeep? Well the TC only has 18 slots and there are onlt 1k stones per slot so that means a completely full TC can upkeep your base for a whopping... 11 hours... not even a full day. The way the current upkeep system works either you have a ridiculously small base that is easy pickings for any clan or you have a larger base that you have to essentially fill every couple of hours... people who have school or work amirite?Another problem with this system has to do with that whole ""the TC repairs the base using the stored resources"" part. This causes a massively overpowered exploit where a clan can essentailly come to your base and instead of having to seach for the rooms in your honeycombed base the contain the loot they simply have to damage the exterior walls wait for them to repair and repeat this process until they've bled your TC of all it's stored resources and then just wait 3 hours for all of the walls in your base to break and it's looting time. So in short the upkeep system does nothing but make it almost completely impossible to have a base unless you have a massive clan that has players online 24/7.The blueprint system Like I said above while I like the concept of the blueprint system there are massive problems with it's application in Rust... first off... everything is FAR to expensive. First off there are three ways to get scrap the first is by breaking barrels which typically gets you 1 2 scrap per barrel. The second is crates which get you around 5 scrap per crate. Finally the high level chest can typically get you anywhere from 20 50 scrap. Now just to make the research table and all 3 workbenches you need 1 875 scrap which is either roughly 1 250 barrels 375 crates or roughly 60 70 high level chests (which only spawn in the hardest areas of the game). This is just a downright absurd price for this stuff and that's just the stuff to research and build stuff with that's not counting the actual research costs. Want to be able to research a hoodie? That's 75 scrap. A pickaxe? That's another 75. An assault rifle? Pfft 750 scrap please. A chair whos only purpose is decoration... 20 scrap.The costs are downright absurd. A simple hoodie should not take an hour of farming to unlock when the servers wipe once a month.The servers wipe once a month Now I understand why this was a thing back in early access Facepunch needed to wipe servers in order to put out updates... but the game is in full release now server owners should be allowed to decide how long their servers will gow before a wipe. It's virtually impossible for any solo or casual player to make any significant progress before the servers get wiped every month.Cont. in comments",Rust

They made us fight until one of us died. Once I killed him they game some chicken food water and a face mask. I was now part of their group.Ten minutes in I was shot in the head.Totally recommended 10/10,Rust

2018-08-21,0,0,1878,False,Recommended,The best multiplayer survival game this world has to offer but the devs cant seem to get it through their thick skulls that their game is dying not because the game isn't noob friendly but because they don't want to fix optimization/Bugs that leave your character standing still in the middle of a fight. Also the hackers that roam freely on official servers that when they get banned they come back within 10 mins on a new account with the same name. Community servers are great for keeping hackers off but those servers are slowly dying out or becoming solo/duo/trio servers also the admins on community servers are sometimes gun ho with banning when you might be a little too good.Me and my friends had this problem only twice but its still an issue. I've played this game since legacy and i've loved it since. In conclusion the game is a great game if you can look past the issues and play with friends you like. P.S. We want weekly updates back and scientists!,Rust

2018-12-31,0,0,48,False,Recommended,This game is really well made! The graphics are beautiful (even at fast graphic settings they are decent!) the gameplay is good but I highly dislike the maintenance part of the game Sounds/audio are good as well! It's a bit tricky to learn everything but once you get the hang of crafting and building the game is much smoother! Also there are a lot of things you have to grind for which I find kinda fun and realistic. It's worth the price especially with the winter sale they have on this! However you might crash or lag a lot if you have the graphics set on 'Fantastic!' so I recommend lowering them before you go into the game. (unless you have a really good graphics card then go right ahead!)Game(s) this reminds me of Skyrim Minecraft The Forest,Rust

I can confidently say that this is the best iteration of the game and with the dedicated devs it will only get better.If you want fat adrenaline rushes and huge amounts of stress then I would recommend this game just be wary of the steep learning curve and unforgiving nature of the environment as well as other players.,Rust

2018-11-21,0,0,573,False,Recommended,This game is simple. You start out wondering how you're going to overcome the world in front of you. It's not an overnight cycle as many would think. Start with the small things. Chop trees gather stone and build a base maybe. What's you're goal now? Pvp. Fight for mass amount of loot in populated zones to build your empire. Playing this game with friends only means you'll be better equiped to build your arsenal. This game isn't about surviving it's about thriving. With developers that care about what content is in their game on a daily basis new changes come monthly. This doesn't fully switch up the whole flow of the game but instead adds little hints of new things to explore experiment with and master. This isn't your typical survival game. There is always going to be a new experience around the corner. &lt 3 Facepunch,Rust

2016-03-05,0,0,93,True,Recommended,Rust is simply a fantastic game. Garry and his team are always updating content on a weekly basis and the gameplay mechanics continue to improve. Rust is a surivival style game and only playable with other players online. It's an awesome team or solo experience and you will sure make some enemies playing.Pros Vanilla servers are well optimized for low end PC's. Variety of procedurely generated terrain including snow grass mountains streams lakes and forests. Good early game and end game items and weapons. Great FPS mechanics. Regular updates based on community feedback. Base building is highly customizeable. Raiding is very fair for both parties requires skill and planning. Great hunting and crafting mechanics. Modded servers with gamemodes like The Hunger Games You can master crappy items and use them to kill unskilled geared players You can starve to death freeze to death be mauled fall to your death be quickscoped by a rock burn and really die any way possible. Everything is out to kill you! It's spooky at nighttime and you can sing campfire songs.Cons Abundance of cheaters on modded rust servers. Decay is rather fast so bases can disappear after a few days of inactivity. Dead bodies of animals and players glitch through the floor. Community is generally pretty savage.Overall Rating 9/10Worth the Price YesLike surival games? This is the best. This game is not very welcoming of new players but with a little practice it's quite fun. It's best played with friends but solo is always really fun too.,Rust

People are so low that this game is actually what would happen between people if there was a nuclear catastrophe so we can say at least it is realistic. There aren't enough servers and not to mention that they lag a lot. Clans have it too easy in this game. Solo survival chance is lower than me getting a girlfriend. Yeah it's that low. Researching stuff takes too much effort. It is so much that you reincarnate multiple times to achieve an adequate level of wisdom. Aside from all that grinding dealing with clans fighting off savages and LAAAG it is a unique game and devs are working hard to make it better.,Rust

This game is very loved and is always trying to be improved upon even after release. Wait for deals but don't pass it up if you're into goofy survival (with others) and optional raiding aspects depending on the server you want. PVE is available and really cool mods. If the base game doesn't have what you're looking for someone else has made it. (Or... you could always try to make it or smth... idk lmao)It's one of my favorite MMOs (my favorite games in general are single player).Heads up though. With good times come really awful ones where other players are the actual worst. The game is as good as its players.,Rust

2018-11-21,0,0,3017,False,Recommended,I recognize it is likely that this will result in strongly held opionions no matter what I say but now seems a good time to review rust. I have put enough hours in to feel that I have a fair view of the gameplay. Lets start out by saying you may be somewhat mortified that this game is fun to you. Why you ask? The short answer is that if you feel bad about killing naked people simply trying to chop a tree or pick a rock or waiting until someone has put in a bunch of hard work so that you can kill them and take their stuff you have choices. Dont Play. Become a Victim or the more popular option victimize you fellow humans while chortling that the tweleve year old you killed is raging about it and hoping you family dies in a fire. The thing that makes the game the most fun and the least fun is the player base. I have made great friends and some pretty distingushed enemies. I have also delt with what many consider to be one of the most toxic communities you can encounter. That being said I have still played this game and enjoyed almost every second of it. Game play is pretty simple and very intuitive. The tech tree is overly simple and provides a significant advantage to the players who log in and invest time after a server wipe. Due to this the servers with the highest population wipe weekly if not twice a week. As a whole servers that dont do this will see their player base drop off to almost nothing withing the first few days.,Rust

2019-01-10,0,0,238,False,Recommended,I love Rust so much. However I know that this request is stupid to a lot of people but if the Devs would add the ability to play solo without making a server I would be very happy and I know other people would be too. I just want to be able to play even if something happened like no internet at the moment for example. And be able to change every setting within the game instead of joining countless servers with their own settings. Or at least make it easier to make my own server. But other than that it's an amazing game and I highly recommend it to everyone who loves the survival genre.,Rust
2018-12-21,0,0,4292,False,Recommended,i have over 4k hours in this game i have had alot of good times in this game! but lemme tell you! one of the worst optimized games ive ever played ive put tons of hours in to just pvping and the pvp in this game is so junk to be honest its diffirent then most games YES! but atleast 75% of your shots dont even register its awful!!!! no game should have that issue! 6 years should be way more then enought time to fix or ATLEAST try to do something with the PVP! the PVE is really good like base building farming and just doing random roleplay can keep you busy for hours! just fix the PVP PLEASE!,Rust
2018-02-08,0,0,124,False,Recommended,One of the best Early Access famous games you'll ever play. There are serious moments funny moments and the moments that give you a face palm.

2018-11-21,0,0,251,False,Recommended,Hi there! My name is TheLastWarlord (as of posting this.) If anyone follows me on Steam you will know I am a heavy survival game player (Noone loves me so I doubt that) Anyway I just got rust a few years ago but I finally decided to play it. When I got in what do I get? Toxic players and a shotgun to my face. Is this bad? Up to you to decide.Rust is a straight PvP game with alot of young teenagers that play it thinking their hot stuff (me included) In reality it is the hardest game I have played but also the most addicting. I'd have to say grab a group of 3 4 friends and make a clan and harvest away!PROSThe pros? Well for one the graphics and sound. Depending on your computer they can be really good. I think the sound is the better of the two. This game is really heavily reliant on sound to determine where your enimes are picking hatcheting shooting etc. Is super loud but so are footsteps. So make sure your house is quiet turn up game sounds and enjoy. (Just kidding ignore my terrible advice lol. Keep your ears intact) Another pro is the resource gathering. This includes but is not limited to tools mats (Materials for you non survival players) and meds. Mining barrels is a sure fire way to get guns ammo armor and building mats. I personally think this is an amazing idea some think different.CONSToxic community I have to say it. Every once in awhile you'll run into a nice player but that is rare. I'm not saying the whole community is toxic but most are either quiet (Again nothing wrong with that) Really talkative too trustworthy or just outwright toxic. These are just personal cons for me don't take these too seriously. Hackers. Facepunch doesn't really help with this either. They are so common on Offical servers that everyone except the occasional noob and hacker goes on there. I play on a 20x that wipes every Thursday and I see almost 1 hacker a wipe. The admins usually take care of them but still nuts right?That is about it for my review. What is my overall thought? I wrote this as positive but tbh it can be both for me. Don't take this review too seriously as it is just me posting my thoughts on the game just to let you know how this game is anyway thanks for taking the time to read this ),Rust

2018-11-28,0,0,137,False,Recommended,Overall game is very good.Pros A lot of people are complaining about cheaters in any PC game which is competitive the game has cheaters ( didn't encountered not a single one in 130+hours of play ) but the company really cares about the game and banning actively them. They ban them in such a way that to return to the game is very difficult or costly meaning 1 banned cheater is gone he will not return for a while. Game very competitive and addictive has a lot of content had so much fun playing and very interested in streamers who stream the game. Developers are updating the game constantly every month they are presenting new features its like monthly Christmas you know that some big update will arrive and it actually changes the game and makes it better. The game has modded servers it means that if you want some different things you can easily join modded servers. ( For example if you want only to build you can join building servers same goes with PVP or anything you can think of ) Best survival game that exists to this day. Don't trust anyone who has 2 legs Involves skill you can't buy anything for money which will make you better it's not pay to win game it requires time ( much more time than i have 130+ hours ) and patience. Overall more you play you get better not your weapons or character.Cons The game badly needs optimization I have very high end PC and the game has FPS drops watched a lot of videos played with settings but didn't fixed the problem. This game badly needs optimization. Some bugs are there for months for example the bug where you can't pick up item because body is on top of the item and you need to remove body in order to pick up gun this is very annoying because sometimes you don't have even 1 second to waste. And other bugs which I checked are reported to facepunch studios. The game badly needs huge advertisement campaign to attract more people to the game I mean this game is the best survival game that exists and the same time sometimes servers are not full and lack people i understand that there are thousands of servers but the player base can be increased dramatically with the right advertisement. The game has so much content and for the beginner its pretty hard to understand everything how to do certain things i love that there was helping tips but its not enough.Overall If you like survival style games this is a MUST play game There is no better game than this in survival genre. BUY IT.,Rust

2015-12-27,0,0,793,True,Recommended,Going from having everything you can ever imagine too nothing in under 10 minutes? Yeah we call that rust. EDIT DEC 2018 As of December 2018 I thought I would write an updated review of the game in a shortish form. Lets just say that Rust has changed while still being the same game deep down personally I don't like the scrap system they put in but I'm getting used to it (my favourite was still blueprints from a couple years back).The game revolves around you starting out with nothing you must gather resources to build a base make weapons and armor as well as venturing out to collect other resources for scrap to get the blueprints for new and better items to make all while being hunted down by up to hundreds of other players. Very intense and fun game and I find it never gets old but can really be ruined by the community of certain players which isn't the games fault.All in all the game is fun and while you are doing the same thing over and over each time its different in certain ways making the replay value after each map wipe very high. The devs are very involved in the game and are constantly adding new things and fixing the old. One of my favourite games.Also don't expect to be very good at the game unless you play it quite a bit steep learning curve here get some friends to teach you how to play or else you are doomed. Rust can be a full time job if u wanted it to be.,Rust

2018-11-22,0,0,829,False,Recommended,Being honest don't come into this game expecting people to be nice to you. The community is so toxic and I love it. This game has given me the ability to grow above players and join a clan that runs the server. I do recommend playing this game IF and IF ONLY you have the requirements. This game is VERY demanding and with each new update the developers add more content to the game. Though at times it may be hard and boring but is fun when you get guns and start to gain wealth in the server. Knowing your base may not be there the next day you need to gain more resources and materials to build up your base and defenses. I would personally give it a 9.5/10. I can barely run the game due to the updates that have been added but I do recommend you play this game. Thank you for reading this D,Rust

2016-03-14,0,0,2857,False,Recommended,Game is fun and all. Rampant with hackers the superjumpers and brute forcers make light work of your structures without needing a single resource. The private servers seem to be better policed for hacking than the offical facepunch servers which is kind of sad. Would be a fun game without the rampant hacking.Update almost 2k hours definately the best survival sandbox game i've played. As before still hackers but with an EA game i guess it's generally easier to do. The XP system was a bit of a flop but thankfully they realised this and introduced the component systems not quite bps again yet a great improvement on the XP system. I returned for a month to check out the compnent system and had great fun. Recommended to anyone who likes surivival games. Tip Rust is brutal alone.UPDATE 11/08/17 It still has it s positives and is a bit of fun though have spent a lot of hours on this game and the devs have no clear path. They chop and change things constantly. Now I get it it's EA but complete system changes to poorer systems only to then change them again is a joke. The lack of actualy decent updates anymore and simply cosmetic fixes and looking skins being pumped out for extra cash. They first destroyed legacy rust now they are well and trully on the way to destroying experimental branch as well. Quit while you are ahead Garry..........

If you never had any experience with games like these dont download and waste your money. unless you want to spend hours just learning how to get food. The game also has a completely and stupid hard time to start because there are so many players on every server you cant even get wood without getting chased from a 10 year old kid and die because you run into another way. The would be good but the devs are just to lazy to put in the time of making a way for new players to get used to the game such as a server that would only let the people who have under 10 hours enter so that they could figure out how to play the dam game they just spent $30 dollars on.,Rust

2018-01-09,0,0,1319,True,Not Recommended,AS of right now i dont recommend this game at all. you can play on a small server rather peacefully but also it becomes incredibly boring incredibly fast. Play on a more populated server and get s KOS'ing you every time you spawn and the cancer community on rust will even go as far as to try to trick people into thinking their trustworthy. Even if you're a naked with not one item of value almost everyone on rust will kill you laugh in your face talk you and spread toxicity about the server youre on the second you say anything about the fact they KOS. even though its ed up they use the excuse 'its rust'. NO. it being a cutthroat survival game means pvp and gunfights and raids of course but it should also mean working together kindness loyalty and other things that in my opinion a survival game should have. people shouldnt be able to kill nakeds as a naked you spend hours just trying to get a base up only to continuilly be killed by people who claim that you can trust them and when they betray you the classic trademark excuse comes up and thats 'its rust stop crying'. really so because its rust anyone at any time can completely you. and then humiliate you turn an entire server against you grief your base and so much more and get away with it and have it be called a fun game? um excuse me. atleast pubg is fair. they start you out with gear so youre all on a level playing field with wipes sure youre even for a bit but its all about luck and who gets what blueprints and if you can find enough components. in the end this game just becomes a massive pile of cancerous not because of the gameplay but because of everyone who plays being completely cancer. i havent playedfor super long but just the fact EVERYONE so far has betrayed me i know the people of rust have no moral compass and beyond that they dont even mind trying to hurt you irl. By saying some of the most rude things they can possibly think of and often times screaming in the mic and saying offensive racist or sexist terms. the people of rust are immature and quite frankly have played rust for way too long or are wayy too thrilled with KOS'ing. Dont get this game for your children ever. and if youre thinking of buying it wait till it goes on sale. its community is so garbage right now its unenjoyable.Bear in mind as well on this server i was on where i was still getting killed on sight there were only about 15 people on the server. its a friendly to noobs server as well and even on those you have a dude with an AK who kills me while naked and proceeds to spam chat about how im like 11 and im crying cus he KOS'd a naked. he didnt just KOS. he lured me over by saying he wouldnt kill me. as an innocent naked at that time i then knew dont play rust unless you want everyone to on you from the second you spawn and stab you in the back if you ever even do make friends.

2016-10-16,0,0,1553,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch Studios. Inspired by games like DayZ Minecraft and Stalker Rust aims to create a hostile environment in which emergent gameplay can flourish. The aim of the game is to survive. To do this the player should gather resources. Hitting a tree with a rock will give you wood hitting a rock with a rock will give you rock and ore. You can then craft a hatchet from the wood and rock allowing you to gather faster. You can go out and hunt a variety of wildlife such as boars chickens rabbits bears wolves and deer. Once you have killed an animal you can butcher it to gather its meat and skin. You can craft a fire using wood and cook the meat inside the fire. Then you can eat. You face two major dangers in game. Rust is a multiplayer game so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust s world is harsh so you might need to make friends to survive. The environment is not kind. Bears and wolves will chase and kill you. Falling from a height will kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starving will kill you. Being cold will kill you. I will kill you ),Rust

So we played with Experimental and we really liked it. Then we looked at Legacy but after Experimental Legacy was not good enough for us. So i'm writing this for Experimental. We loved the environment physics interface and much more things of the game but ""connection problems"" are very very annoying. So we both stopped playing it. Here are the serious problems that we noticed We always disconnect suddenly from different servers and we don't know why. Sometimes when we try to get into a server the game freezes on loading screen. (Receiving data) I'm playing the game on Fantastic mode. But when i look at that huge trees' from a long distance their leaves and bodies look like blocks of glitchy little trees. There's a bug on the code lock. Sometimes it aparts from the door and freezes in the air. There's no options tab in the main menu.You guys should sell Legacy and Experimental seperately. And Experimental's price must be under 5$.

2015-09-29,0,0,493,False,Recommended,In my opinion this is the best game when it comes to building and raiding. Even if you are a solo player you can still find a lot entertaining things to do. There are many active servers with a variety of play styles and mods. The devs update frequently and the people/community (in my experience) are generally friendly and helpful.

2018-11-23,0,0,662,False,Recommended,This game started out as almost unplayable glitchy garbage. Now look at it. Even triple A studios can't compete with this community or ability to literally shape the home you live in or how you play.

2018-11-23,0,0,59,False,Recommended,Rust is an incredible game truly magnificent. Me and my friends have had hours building awful wooden bases only for them to be obliterated by a group of highly trained killers. Usually after this we are conscripted into some sort of army and used to wage war upon others like ourselves. Eventually the feelings of guilt and betrayal fade and are replaced only by a desire to please our overlords and bring death to their enemies. After several more hours of endless violence and bloodshed we stunble upon a few friends making a simple wooden shack. Tears flood our eyes as we remember our past and the journey we went on it to get here. We quickly put this out of our mind and mow them down like animals and then offer them a chance to join our glorious overlords army and they accept. the cycle continues.... Truly a fantastic game.,Rust

2018-11-25,0,0,59,False,Recommended,Rust is outstanding. A bit slow in the beginning as you are learning what to do. Then you die several times. But after a few runs you build the building find the clothes eat the food drink the water and make the weapon.

2018-11-25,0,0,270,False,Recommended,Highly RecommendBoy this game is fun. don't have too much expectations of immortality with farming collecting saving and This is real life simulator and real life isn't easy all alone without big community and support. This is why you have to make friends in real life and in this game too. the more your circle is the more you are secure and probably will last longer. Do not at all reference your invested hours of game play with your future in this game . They are worthless if you don't know how to survive.Roam around the beautiful landscapes gather stuff make friends hunt for food survive climate and weather rage wars around or spread peace! this is what all RUST offers!You will surely enjoy if you have a good team.

2016-11-25,0,0,762,False,Recommended,This game is possibly one of the best survival games out there with it's amazing graphics and game mechanics which really gives a feel of realistic survival especially with the base builder that allows for players to defend their loot and have other players attempt to raid it.The developers of this game are amazing as they are the only developers who actually listen to what the Rust community has to say and implement suggestions into the game compared to DayZ this game has better potential and has progressed more in the past few years unlike DayZ. However the downside of this game is that it does get repetitive and can have kind of a cartoony feel do it depends if you like it. Overall this is a great survival game that i have played since release and have watched this progress amazingly. I would highly recommend this game too someone looking for a challenge and wants to get into survival games don't buy DayZ for now.,Rust

2018-08-10,0,0,1090,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Before you scroll down and read the rest.. let me say one thing ""Rust is a high risk high reward type of game if you get salty every time you die.. then move along.. this game isn't for you""._______________________________General game informationThis game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.Obviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place._______________________________My experienceAt the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for hours. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it.After figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering i started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game I didn't.For some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them.This resulted in over 800 hours of gameplay._______________________________State of the GameWhen you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to ""Legacy"" being the best state of the game I disagree.The current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game.These are named The Blueprint system + The component system.Most Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love.A week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier.The Blueprint system + The component system Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped._______________________________The prosIf you use a microphone you will have the most fun and random interactions you have ever experienced.There's a lot of ways to express your creativity. Basebuilding gearsets drawing penisses on other peoples bases.There is no real endgame so you can set your own goals. Trust me when I say that those can be very rewarding.Its a great game for Youtube content (has profanity filter auto censoring nudes ect.)Its a great game for Twitch content (has a streamer mode to hide from streamsnipers has profanity filter auto censoring nudes ect.)As a big community that really loves the game but for the most part is filled with toxic players. (Like any other game these days)The game is constantly being developed. Weekly changes+additions with every patch.The game also has a great Dev team they are hardworking and very dedicatedThe consIt has a big learning curve. The first thing you need to do is join a empty server and start figuring stuff out cause on a populated server you will get punished for it.A lot of people KoS in the current state of the game which is fine for me cause im used to it. But if you are new it can be very offputting.The game has a very annoying memoryleak that will cause problems no matter how much GB you got in that godlike computer of yours. (they are working on it)Deciding on the correct server for you to join will directly affect how much fun the game is for you as a soloplayer.The official servers are terrible. There is hardly ever a admin in there to counteract a possible cheater. My advice Stick to the community servers.The game uses a day/night cycle. During the night it truly is pitchblack and you wont be able to see a thing. Unless you have Nvidia then you can just fire up the gamma and you'll be fine. Especially vs people that have a AMD graphics card. Its a annoying problem in the game thats currently being looked into._______________________________The future isn't set in stone.Well sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3 4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones._______________________________ConclusionIf you are still interested after reading all this definately buy the game. Over the time of me playing Rust I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game._______________________________I'm Currently trading rust items feel free to send offers to me!!https //steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner 892100980&amp token QzzjP36",Rust

There are times where you will get the end of the stick. But moreso this game can be very very rewarding.The first thing i'd like to capitalize on is it's RANDOMNESS of events. Not events scripted into the game per se. Lets put it like this. I was and am really still quite a noob. It took me awhile to learn this game.I could not find a single node of stone or a single hemp plant for like the first 50 hours. Do not let this discourage you. (also do not let being killed or raided discourage you. Do whatever it takes to get in on the action. Mess with people try to get involved with other players in some way shape or form). THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN SAY is to figure out what you're supposed to be doing and work towards it. Explore. Just the other day i joined a new server and within 5 minutes i had a pistol. Ive walked into decayed bases and past dead bodies with tons and tons of great on them. The bigger message here is you can run and run and run around in this game for 8 hours getting killed while naked starving freezing burning..This pattern changes with persistence. You WILL eventually kill someone with something good or find a dead body/broken into base full of loot. Once you get that first guy full of rifles explosives great armor it will motivate you. This game can be unforgiving but if you try to fit into the environment of hostile players the same way youd fit in at a new school a job prison try to communicate with folks even if you get screwed over. if you keep roaming building and wathcing youtube videos on all the aspects of the game you'll be at least somewhat successful. and it will continue to increase your motivation to play this. dont let trolls get to you. brush it off man. Servers wipe clean and everyone's item blueprints theyve acquired to craft essential items wipe clean typically between 1 week and several months. servers wipe monthly the longest ive seen and 4 days lowest. i prefer monthly wipes because i like to build. justwiped is a website that shows what servers have just wiped structures/loot and blueprints. When you start out on a fresh wipe everyone starts from scratch and things get a chance to be fair for everyone again. You're going to lose your base on wipe cycle date. youll probably lose it eventually otherwise unless you're lucky or you/your team happen to be the type to dominate servers. i believe the game is pretty balanced. More balanced than a lot of survival games. The building isnt too grindy. not like ARK. you can throw down a decent sized base fairly quickly when you get used to the rhythym and find good locations to seek residence in. LONG STORY SHORT i play on monthly wipe servers for instance...i like to think of the beginning of each wipe as entry to a month long competition against the other folks in the server. It's a game of elimination. People spend the first few weeks all building up and fighting with more pitiful weapons and it can get pretty amusing. Id say after around the 2 week mark things really start getting more hostile day by day usually worst to try to farm on a weeknight unless you're slick with the pvp. Once theres 2 3 days left before a month wipe people start using all the resources theyve had stockpiled and youll hear nothing but gunshots and explosions all over. therell be non stop chaos and destruction. it sounds like the 4th of july and its just beautiful. we start with nothing build up defenses and hoard stuff and go out with a bang at the end of every wipe and it repeats. new location servers hit population cap again new people to make rage. i go back to the randomness of events. I can say that ive been geared up in great armor with some of the best guns and have been killed by someone chucking spears or lobbing arrows at me. Ive also been the naked player with a bow to get a kill on a guy in full armor with a gun. It's all about awareness of your surroundings and not letting anyone get the drop on you. Generally a veteran player in high tier gear will have the upper hand but i have seen so many scenarios play out with what some would believe was pretty absurd irony. If you just try to do good and keep a positive competitive attitude youll eventually start making off with hauls of loot here and there. If you get ahold of blueprints for good weapons and items being wiped off the map does not stop you from getting a few workbenches back up a research table and mostly insignificant amount of materials to start crafting more of most mid level weapons/items and get back in the fight somewhat at least. you can become king of the hill yourself in the blink of an eye. thats just how it happens in this game. i see so many reviews of people ing about this game. i have had many unique experiences. Ive never played a game where i felt happy disappointed adrenaline pumped and paranoid all in the same day. You always have a decision to make trusting other players you intersect with. you never know if this person will become your friend on steam 10 years from now or if theyll shoot you and take all your stuff. Preemptive strikes can either get you some good loot or can off some kid and get him to go get his team nearby and stomp you and your base out. So you need to choose your battles. Maybe not kill everyone but detect when someones going to do something and react first. always be ready to kill someone man. It's like life. you take risks and hope for the best outcome. you get maimed you revise your tactics and try again. This game might not be for everyone MAYBE. BUT!!if you go on youtube and watch a bunch of videos on this game for months like i did before you buy it you will know whether this game is for you or not. This game will some people off if they fail to see the bigger picture of it's intention. I have to admit though I've never been i have felt this short lived disappointment/frustration yes. But it wears off and i keep playing compulsively like im a teenager again. I'm happy for anyone who can learn to appreciate this game and accept that yes it can suck but ask yourself what you're doing wrong if your whole experience of the game has been negative and figure out how to change it. watch videos of ""salty rust kids"" and building/raid guides. find an item read up on it online. like many games rust is its own world and its like learning a new language. it is the world we live in but people dont hold back on being amusing irritating or just plain psychopathic. Bad day at work? make some 10 year old beg for their back and laugh at them. GOod day at work? go farm and make some trades joke with some people. Put on some thick skin and just raise hell. thats all else i can really tell you. Next to warcraft in it's prime battlefield games and a handful of other games this is one of the best games i believe has ever existed. Like any game there could always be something added to it that isnt and maybe never will be. Theres always room for improvement in any game but look...theres a reason people play this game for 7k hours. ill leave it at that. hopefully people read this long scatterbrained but i think informative post put in a detailed way i dont see a lot of reviews do",Rust

2016-09-08,0,0,433,True,Recommended,Started on the XP System update. Coming from ARK Survival Evolved what that game does wrong this one does it absolutely right. There's no HUGE gap between veteran and starter players (a TREX vs a Crossbow low tier vs high tier damage etc) meaning you can get on a server and start raiding in a few hours instead of spending your playtime grinding. The farming/pickup rates are far more generous meaning you will actually feel like you've made some progress which also makes a vanilla solo run feasible.Basically it's a survival game that allows hardcore and casual players to cohexist. You can play this as casually as an fps and still make meaningful progress which saves you a lot of time for your other daily activities. It's not exhausting for the common player.Lastly and in comparison to ARK PvP in rust is all about your ability as a player rather than seeing which flying dinosaur has more health in a world where guns are useless and an individual is meaningless.It has a long way to go but its foundation is pretty solid.,Rust

I realize I suck at pvp so I went to modded servers (helps a lot) to connect to 1v1 or pvp to improve your aim and how the gunds and bow/crossbows works I enjoy this game and they are making this game for realistic I like the new ceiling light system instead of using low grade fuel.

2017-03-09,0,0,515,False,Recommended,Rust Review I bought this game in Early Access almost a year ago. Since then the development of the game has been astounding. Performance used to be terrible and certain aspects of the game were broken. Now performance has increased greatly and the game has increased in quality as well. Positives This game has an awesome atmosphere. It really makes you feel like you are there. There is something cool about meeting strangers and building a community or just trading or talking. It really makes the game that much better. Progression feels good. Whether you make your first gun or your first base. It feels good. Complaints You need a good/great pc to run this. Because of issues and graphics this game needs a beefy pc to get any fps. The majority of the community will KOS. So if you plan to play I recommend you get some friends first. There are still issues with the game. It isn't polished and perfect so don't buy it for that. Should I buy it? I would say yes. It's a wonderful game that has provided thousands of hours of enjoyment to many people. It's a little rough around the edges but I enjoyed every hour that I put into it,Rust

2018-11-22,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,This game has great potential it feels like but the garbage community ruins everything. There's essentially no way to get setup on a server everyone is out to kill on sight to defend themselves.

2018-11-22,0,0,175,False,Not Recommended,This game ing sucks. I used to play it for a bit but the toxicity levels are just to high. It's literally the worst game on the planet with people roof camping KOS killing new spawns camping random spots. Ark is a way better game than this pile of I honestly hate this it's just like KNOCK KNOCK whos there ITS US THE ING DOORCAMPERS *10 hours later they still sit out there not even a joke*. This game back in the good times when you walked around talked no shooting on sight and only wanted to find friends took a turn because oh no here comes the Cs go playerbase which is abousutely toxic af. If we had to take a moment to classify this game it would be abousute Yes I may be salty but to be salty about people who just ing kill you the moment you spawn should be acceptable in any form. Rust is a great game without the playerbase. But to be honest the rust playerbase is an entire thing on it's own. People from several toxic games Cs go WoW CoD and many more just came and rolled in. Those games are entirely about PvP and in the first few years rust had little PvP that was the best times indeed and then the s came and ruined it all. They all formed something called the Rust Community the abousute worst thing to ever see. They took toxic inspiration from others and they took rage to another level. (lol imma feckin hypocrite) This game is not worth buying at all. Your braincells will die you will lose hope. GET MAD GET ANGRY I DONT WANT THESE DAMN LEMONS.

Its only game that i played that much and i hope ill be able to double or triple the time i played in this game because yes its toxic when cheaters are in server or when 20ppl zergs lives next to u or their are alot of roof campers or doorcampers but this game is not only about pvping you can roleplay and a lot of ppl what i experienced last 300h starting too help more nakeds and specialy new players that ofc tell that thet new. Anywats i think that its the best survival game out rn because every wipe (every month or week) theres new map over 2yrs of playing never been in same map same with the day cycles every day in rust is different everyone does different things every day in rust. And yes iknow that those 100h of start in rust gonna be hell but that feeling when u done the wipe and didnt get raided u still have shed loads of loot its the best feeling and even better when u make tons of plays or even just meeting new ppl that are friendly. Even those that angry on me when i raided them they were friendly and we exanged the xmas gifts and still played they tried to raid me i defended sucesfully they still been friendly didnt talk trash on me. Over all i think that things like that bit of comunity that is friendly and even roplays makes this game worth my time and that feeling of pleasure when u complete wipe or make really good play anyways i think this game is best out in survival comunity REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,Rust

2018-11-16,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT GET ME WRONG!!! Rust's concept is great I personally love online co op open world survival games. However the horrible optimization drives me away from this game.I love the gameplay everything is great getting geared is a long but rewarding quest. The graphics look really fresh.All the other stuff is horrible though whenever I access my build menu (Q) and click on an item to craft it lags my game so hard for 0.5 1 second. This might not sound like a lot but this happens every time no matter what I do. This may be the fact that my 1060 6gb is the only thing not sufficient for the (recommended) settings for the game but if I have an i7 8700 and 16gb of RAM and the game runs at 65 80 FPS average (1080p) this really should not be happening.I also have completely random lag spikes for 1 2 seconds during game with no warning and for no particular reason and of course this pushes me away from the game.All in all I recommend this game to everyone that has recommended settings however that one component you don't have on there can cuck you (in my speculations).,Rust

2017-08-29,0,0,1350,False,Not Recommended,Now that i have 1k plus hours in this game i feel obliged to write a review Therefore i will try my best to describe what this game is at its core and why it is on a steep downward trend.I bought rust on June 17th 2016 And it was a really buggy and unfinsihed game but a really fun one it had alot of depth within the crafting and the pvp aspects. In my opinion xp was the best system for rust because it was a linear system in which one doesnt level up by being with a clan and having them do everything for them (like it is now) you had to actually farm and do things in the game that would contribute to your personal level And even if 1 person grinded really hard for 1 day they most likely would have rockets or c4 mabye ak but no raiding materials in which most of this game is dependant on that depth in raiding and pvp. And from that change from xp to components it wasnt about skill anymore it was about how much manpower you could muster and the chinese dominated this (for some reason i actually dont know why) in turn from that alot of those clans (in rust we call them zergs most of the time) they would cheat and from that more people feel inclined to cheat from that to counter them and from them countering the cheaters they kill more people and they feel inclined to cheat and the cycle repeats. And from that a toxic community forms not from social contact but from who can horde the most stuff and have the biggest base or the biggest zerg. The developers of this game are blissfully blind of what is actually happening in their game which is really saddening because rust used to be my favorite game of all time but this rapidly changed with the updates they have been releasing. These updates have the intentions of the people AWFULLY wrong and in turn the player base it turning against the company FacePunch studio's for not listening to the consumer feed back and doing whatever the they want with the game. A great expample of this is the boat update in this update they added boats in which you can go on the water and get items this is all fine and dandy but they have no clue what the community wants everyone on reddit has ben BEGGING for a change to pvp and the guns in the game. But no they want to add boats hot air balloons electricity and a lot of other t no one asked for. Which in turn made the community even more toxic and making everyone not trust facepunch. Which is making me turn my review against this game i give this game a 4/10 it is painfully average because facepunch has their fingers up their not changing what the entire community really wants in this game.Helk please,Rust

2015-06-06,0,0,1748,False,Recommended,So i have a love hate relationship with rust i've had some of the greatest moments i've ever had in gaming but also some of the worst. I've had wipes where i was raided 8 times in one week and others where i only died 5 times and dominated an entire official server. I've been playing this game over the course of 6 years and i've seen it from the days where you were hitting zombies with a hatchet on hapis to where we are today. Unfortunately rust in its current state well it's very time consuming almost too time consuming. I can't say i was a fan of the upkeep update because well your base decaying with the fact you also fall asleep in game when you log off just kind of forces you to play almost everyday. You constantly have to worry about losing everything. You will find yourself at work thinking about how your base is holding up. It's just really obnoxious and i know some people will say that oh hey why don't you play on a 2x server and to that i say it ruins the balance. People get explosives and very high tear way too quick and since there's only so much space in a tc you bases defence is weakened while your enemies offense is doubled which is problematic. I think that the tc should at the very least have more space so if you slapped by real life you can just grind a bunch and fill your tc to hold you over for like 3 days and maybe have the space in your tc scale with the size of the building so it's still going to be expensive to upkeep if its too big but you can keep is up for 72 hours since people get busy and can't be on every day to grind. Another big thing is give people at the low tear more options to kill heavily geared opponents. The thing is if it's 1 or maybe two heavily gear guys you can take them out with a pipe if your really smart about your positioning and if they come to you. The only other option that comes to mind is if you use a crossy and three stone spears which if you have never tried it is a load of fun to use. It's really effective though because you can headshot with the crossbow and then follow up with three spears to the head and kill well anything. The problem is that well you have the groups of five patrolling with ak and road sign and if they are even a challenge for one dude with metal armor and an ak. It would be nice if there was some sort of very high skill weapon that has the potential to kill opponents who are well equipped if you play your cards right and the pipe is not adequate for killing five men unless they ar absolute garbage but at that point you could probably kill them with a sword. My proposal is that you add a musket that take a long time to reload has a slow moving projectile with a lot of bullet drop and damage drop off is expensive to shoot as well but can one shot head shot anyone within let's say 30 meters. So you would be able to kill five armored men but you would have to use very good positioning maybe set up some traps and have cover to reload and retreat while also not missing a single shot but it could be done. Also it might be a good idea to lower the price of the bolty because it's really difficult to justify making one of your using a rifle body you would use for an ak and of course the L96 is just better than it so the bolty either needs a damage buff or price cut honestly it's would be a cool high end mid tear if maybe it didn't cost a rifle body but it did cost a bunch of hqm springs and pipes like a more expensive version of the pump. Also something i've always wanted to see in this game is a high end semi auto maybe an fal since that is what i would consider one of the best survival rifles and its would have m249 damage in a semi auto package maybe it would be op idk but i love the fal and i want to see it in game. Anyway i've gone off on a tangent. Something important to take into account is this game has a very toxic player base not all of them are bad but most are but you can usually find a decent crew to run with if you look hard enough. Basically don't take anything to heart in this game people will be cruel and they dont give a about you if you react more they will probably stick around and try to torture you so sometimes it's best to just let it go and stay quite. Me personally i like to hold grudges at least for that wipe sometimes i'll make a list and if your on it i will kos and you will be a prime target for raids and i might partake in casualy hunting you like an animal for fun(please don't take that out of context because it looks really bad but it's just a game). Basically this is a hardcore survival experience that is best played with friends solo is brutal and not for those who can't handle abuse. It's a game where the highs are super high and the lows will have you contemplating why you ever bothered picking this game up. One thing worth noting is that these devs are some of the best i've ever seen i love how devoted they are to this game and it's insane that they have kept up with this weekly updates for all these years seriously facepunch thank you for your hard work you have made an amazing and it's sure to get better. You have given me some really awesome experiences with this game and even though im taking a break from it for now it's one that i will never forget. To anyone considering this game i would say it's worth a buy on sale mainly since your either going to love it or hate but it's worth the experience try and see if you can survive a wipe i'd love to hear how it went.,Rust

This game is absolutely addicting and highly thrilling once you get into it.

2018-02-08,0,0,1744,False,Recommended,Rust was the highlight of my year for 2016 2017 and the beginning of 2018. I have spent 1.7k hours on this game coming home after school at 4 00 in the afternoon and binge playing Rust well into early the next morning with all my friends. Though I never was and still am not extremely skilled at the game the game offers a variety of options to make your experience great. Primarily Rust is a sandbox where you can do pretty much anything the majority of it offers combat/pvp which when playing with friends involves high levels of communication &amp strategy while other parts of it offer building crafting farming etc. The game is 100% a lot better when you have a group of friends to play it with as it will make the experience a lot more fun. I would highly recommend this game to any of my friends.A couple negative points about the game though which I do want to throw in for anybody that may be considering to purchase the game. Toxic Playerbase the community/playerbase of Rust is extremely toxic and not friendly or helpful to newcomers. If you look at a community like Greekgodx Ice Poseidon or Sodapoppin it is a mixture of all three communities combined I know that isn't good The majority of toxicity is caused by salty 12 year olds who aren't able to handle the aspects of this rage inducing game. Cheaters the community does have a notable amount of cheaters though I haven't played in a good 4 months the game had a lot of cheaters back in early/mid 2017 which did cause a lot of issues and made the game not enjoyable to play anymore. This game is very rage inducing so to work hard to put up a base farm materials and craft gear and to have it taken by a cheater doesn't sink in that well.,Rust

2015-08-31,0,0,177,True,Recommended,Honestly this game is great. shooting building and a heirarchy of power.The only thing that i am getting angry about is the stupid things the developers keep doing. I find it annoying that when the devs leave something out e.g. you can use ladders to scale to loot rooms and weaker points (great raiding tactics) the deleted that. I hate them for that after all the intellegent raider's hard work all they can do is make raiding boring slow and dumb. they also removed normal stairs many people used this to hide their loot from raiders. I mean COME ON i work hard with other raiders and builders to create this handy tactic and they delete it?!?I must say that from my point of view (i am a raider) this is a crime. People work hard on learning new interesting ways to raid bases and 'whoops!' sorry its gone. I also think that the developers should spend more time trying to fix the fact that deers and boars can walk through rocks and walls. But instead the focus their interests on making the game boring. Can you see where this is going? they are making the game soooo boooring...Another nasty thing about this game is the fact that the combat system is THE WORST. it is completely useless. recoil on guns make it better to use that useless bolt action rifle the stupid bow or just waste ammo with a rocket launcher. I think this is why raiders dont do frontal assaults as they just get mowed down in thin corridors. What i am trying to tell you (or the devs) is that this comabt system is HORRIBLE because of the extreme recoil on every singe gun. so much recoil that when i got my hands on a newly added machine gun 5 bullets got me to face the ceiling. wow. that didnt end well i might have had to retreat and lick my wounds for tomorrow.But other than that it is pretty good. Stashes was a good way to hide loot put a secret loot room under your foundation and place secret stashes next to the containers? nice. And the game isnt going to be boring for a long time that time being when you are just hitting rocks and slapping wood because the game has made raiding impossible. and i think that that is why this game is so populare raiding. so many good times... so funny... If they keep on ruining raiding however i am going to ask for a refund.Also (just saying) this game is full of Russians. and although theey are nice when they ARENT raiding you there is that 1 in 1000 that decides to shoot you when you are trying to be kind. But who can blame him? he cant speak english so there is no way he can understand us. 6/10. stop ruining raiding.,Rust

2018-09-04,0,0,1292,False,Recommended,Rust is kind of glitchy and has high pc requirements to run imo. Be careful about the people you trust because they can easily betray you or inside your clan and steal everything. Don't let random people join you... don't expect people to help either.The developers continue to add new content which was recently the cargo ship and hot air ballon. The cargo is buggy. The air balloon has some glitches. Other than that the point is that they add new things every 2 weeks or so with the updates. My advice is to find a server that you enjoy the most. Modded servers are easier to navigate as a new player because they give more loot faster and you can learn faster by progressing faster throughout the wipe.Don't forget to honey comb with triangles. Lock your boxes. Lock your doors. Spread your loot out. Build stable/sturdy houses. Enjoy the game. Don't get tilted and if you do take a break. ) The community is toxic on some servers and better on others. Every wipe is different. Find friends to play with. Of all the hours I've spent playing Rust I have only encountered one clan that has super obvious hackers (ESP). Other than that this game is amazing and the developers do a good job of adding new content. &lt 3 Highly recommend.,Rust

You can make a garden build a quarry destroying a neighbor's house if you want crafting weapons bombs and even destroy a helicopter. The graphics are wonderful you get into the role of bald and start running like you're a headless chicken. The adrenaline that you feel while you steal a house and feel much attention is called unique. The game is in early access and that's good because every month add new things that help the game content and make it more entertaining. I played quite this game and I can say that in the future will be a work of art and if you play it you'll regret it.For me it is a 10/10By the way skin color your pen*s size and size of your bo*bs in case of female depend on your steam id so good luck with that ROFL..,Rust

Majority of the buildings you need to get food and scrap etc are populated with at least one or two camping there waitng to gank you while you loot.

2018-06-15,0,0,1673,False,Recommended,If you want a post apoc survival game with resource gathering building pvp than this is the best value for money game you can buy. Most people who play it have thousands of hours because of the amount of fun you can have from playing this game. Rust just like its theme is unforgiving. you risk everything just to try to survive and thrive. There is a very steep learning curve but the more you watch videos of the game and practicing different servers you will become better at the game with experience. Make friends or play with friends. You will have a much better chance of surviving and winning fights/raids against other groups. place lots of sleeping bags around it makes it easier to get back to your body WHEN you die. because you WILL die..... Alot. Cheers. p.s. dont trust anyone and remember to always shut your doors.,Rust
2018-11-16,0,0,837,False,Recommended,Updates are nice for sure.

2018-11-16,0,0,212,False,Recommended,Probably one of the most frustrating games you'll ever play especially as a solo player but there is just something about this game that draws you to come back even though you've been beaten down time after time you can't help but love this game and once you really start to get the hang of the game like me you will probably sink hundreds of hours into the game within a week or two.To start things off with the most satisfying and rewarding part of the entire game The exhilerating combat situations you end up in this game are what makes it so fun and is what makes it so replayable. Getting a sweet sweet bow headshot is beyond satisfying especially once you've mastered it you feel like an absolute god. Also using spear and other weapon combos are also needed to be used very strategically to pay off as the enemy could easily just pick up your weapon and leave you defenceless which is yet another combat mechanism to master in order for you to have the quickest most fun start. Not to say that you need to be a PVP god to enjoy the game it's still very enjoyable taking your time with gathering your loot then going out to battle this is especially recommended to newer players if you aren't comfortable or used to the combat yet. But a word of warning if you are going into your first server as a solo and don't want to be thrown straight into the line of fire I'd recommend joining a solo only server as no group limit servers could have several roofcampers or even zergs.Next off the farming aspect of the game is somewhat boring at the start mainly because of how slow the rock farms and that nodes don't always spawn near you so you may have a hard time getting arrows or stronger tools. But other than that farming is very simple and no bs. If you manage to come across an edible plant or hemp you can plant them outside your base for easy food (be warned that people can steal or even break your crops). There isn't really anything else to be said about farming other than to watch your back because some people like to roam around and kill farmers for easy loot!Another aspect you'll want to know about is how to get loot like the ak47's that everyone desires or the m249! Generally you'll be finding all of the top range loot in big monuments that require puzzles to be solved in order to find the loot or even fighting off scientists with guns. You'll need keycards to do these puzzles which are found in lesser monuments but they shouldn't be too hard to find. There are several types of crates in rust which all contain different rarities of items. There are Basic crates Tool Boxes Food Crates Military Crates and elite loot crates which have the best loot but require alot of grinding to get to but hey RNG can sometimes send you straight to top dog in a matter of minutes! If you are a new player you could just set your self up to a small monument like gas station or mining outpost which shouldn't be too crowded but can still supply you with basic loot like revolvers or shotguns. Most experienced players will prefer to setup up next to the most populated monuments to find alot of pvp or loot nearby and will also try to set up next to a small recycling monument to easily get scrap from spare components.Finally building and Crafting. In rust you can create a building plan and a hammer which will let you make your very own base building a simple base is self explanatory however to protect your base from raiders and campers you may want to add some more complex features to your base e.g an airlock (2 or more doors facing each other so you can trap or stop players from entering your base) honeycombing(triangular reinforcements around your base so enemies raiding you will have to blow through several walls rather than just one. Also with the hammer you can upgrade your base using different materials each making your base significantly stronger. There is twig wood stone sheet metal and armoured. A good rule to go by is to never leave your base at twig level (remember you foundation!) because at twig level anyone can come along with any item (even a rock) and just knock it down. Also while we are on the topic of building I'll mention the Tool Cupboard sometimes referred to as TC the tool cupboard will claim a small area around it than only you can build on so you can't be griefed or so other people can't build on your stuff! However unless the TC is locked or hid behind walls and a door than anyone can authorise themselves to it and build all over your property also if they have authorisation of your TC they can unauthorise anyone on it so you'll no longer be able to build there. So now crafting crafting in itself is pretty simple and won't take long to get the hold of however there may be a few things your are not going to understand like Blueprints and workbenches. So some items in Rust aren't immediatley craftable so in order to craft them you'll first need to find one of the item learn it on a research table using scrap and then most likely have to use a workbench to craft that item and the higher tier the item is the higher tier workbench you will need.Thank you for reading my review obviously there is a lot more to rust than what I have stated and it is an absolute blast to play and I can honestly recommend it to anyone it is one of the most addicting thrilling games I have ever played. Good Luck in Rust &lt 3,Rust

2018-11-22,0,0,541,False,Recommended,One of the best games I've ever played the experiences you make are unique and are in some ways a reflex of what the real world has to offer.

With no plans of stopping the game has a lot of great things to come!,Rust
2018-11-22,0,0,279,False,Recommended,Played since the very first game released and onto this version. I'll always remember the horrid screams of terror from people getting hacked to pieces by scavengers the ominous threats of slaughter between factions times long before the appearance of road sign armour where having full radiation gear meant you were a demigod but could easily be dethroned by the knock of a single arrow from a man you never saw coming.No matter the playstyle the behaviour the morals and lack thereof you practice in Rust you'll always find two things 1 There will always be noobies who have died a hundred times before learning any basic skills2 There will always be the one guy you wish you never metNo matter what happens treat your fellow players like your kin and you'll always have fun. (Smashing the corpses of your enemies is fun too)Every update brings something new even if it is a small bit of glitch fixing or big releases like new items or even map updates RUST always makes me giddy whenever I see the download pending and even more when I launch the game (And it crashes and takes 20 years to load in to a server)Love it forever,Rust

I have almost 4000 hours in it and can't seem to take a break away from it. Love it! The spawn kills are still savage but once you get a hang of it you survive those kills. You can't really just build a base and think you won't be raided. You have to plan it just right and defend it too during raids thus keeping you active in the game. Not gonna lie I get tilted at the game too but it's just another love hate relationship. I would totally recommend this game to a friend.,Rust

2017-02-25,0,0,220,False,Not Recommended,I have almost 200 hours in this game. I don't recommend it.They fixed all the funny bugs like bears walking through the ground they continue to make changes some of which are useful and cool (ie adding content like new guns and armor and plants and monuments) but most changes make pointless changes to mechanics fixing problems no one had or making the game unbalanced till those changes were reverted a couple of updates later. The community is a toxic cesspool anyone thats friendly is probably terrible and going to be dead weight everyone else is a and wants your blood the moment you respawn. Its a horrible unless you know at least 5 people to play with at least two of which much be online 100% of the time. It lags like a on community servers and the official servers are the worst for cancerous players and being harassed by large groups of people. The randomly generated maps are very samey and uniform. They're always familiar. The map generator probably took two weeks to write using some Perlin noise and a random walk that makes rivers and it showsIf you manage to make a base somewhere away from other players you're still forced to move around and forage and most likely come into contact with other players due to the fact that animals are extremely sparse so you'll have to make a trip to one of the premade monuments whenever they respawn food and items. Likely to find that it was cleared out by a clan 5 minutes ago and they're still hanging around or that its being scouted out by someone who has been playing since day one of the server wipe and has all the best gear already. Add on top of this the poor optimisation that comes from being a Unity game that is completely remade every 3 months.Actual game would be pretty ok if the community wasn't absolute trash and if the devs made actual improvements for each new version instead of wanking in a corner and calling the pathetic dribbles on the wall a game.,Rust

For newer players I recommend you to start in modded servers so you can get the rust experience without grinding for 15 hours in 1 session.So after all I have gained a lot of friends in this game and has a good and bad community. You can meet salty 45 year olds or toxic 10 year olds or.... cheaters. That is the worst part of this game. If you can find a good server with good admins that is the cream of the crop. I really recommend this game to people that have friends that play this game so they can learn things quickly... If ANYONE needs help.

The only way to make it in Rust now is you have to have no life be part of a clan or zerg and play on the same server ever wipe and be the first to join after the wipe. I really wish I could get back into this game but with all these reasons it just is not fun you rarley fight because one bullet and you loose 12+ hours of progress. So I rate this game a 9/10 before the cupboards and now I rate this game 3.5/10 not fun not worth the money and not worth wasting your life.,Rust

Me and a friend found someone near our base who was extremely friendly and even joined our Discord and we eventually told him the codes to our base. The next morning the codes were changed on our base and he had left the Discord. TL DR don't play this game unless you're willing to suffer to become better and learn.,Rust

2018-11-24,0,0,2315,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I now have over 2 000 hours in Rust I have been playing this game for over 3 years I have enjoyied the game for a long time and it still keeps me entertained. The game does have a big learning curve in which i think the devs are working on a turtorial to help with that but its best to play with a friend for at least when your starting out to help teach you how things work or watch a lot of youtube videos. Even when you know how to play well the game will be better with friends or a clan because more people can get more things done and its a overall better experience. The game is really diverse and thats what keeps me playing every time I log on I know unique things and encounters with other players will happen that i've never seen before so it keeps the game fresh. Also every time a server wipes there is never a repeated map so it is always changing and keeping the content new and interesting. This game can support multiple play styles but it can be fustrating and rage endusing when your learning the game as mostly everyone will kill you. P.S. Don't trust anyone in game.,Rust

Start off with a rock make your way up through simple weapons and tools by harvesting and woodcutting/mining resources all the way to the most advanced of tools/structures and weapons for you to craft and build.A serious time killer you can never go wrong purchasing this game! All that and a whole lot more for only $20!Edit Price changed to $34.99 since I wrote this review due to the fact that it came out of Early Access still makes for an amazing game definitely worth the price.

The community has gotten way too toxic. Killing fresh spawns is now a sport for the unskilled PvP players. The dev team tried to help nakeds by putting a sash on the ones that have gear on them so you can identify someone who has gear and is naked but it hasnt helped any. Joined a server today in hopes to enjoy some rust like I once had. As soon as I was spawned in I was instantly met with a swift death by some kid screaming racist remarks ""I am killing all those that dont look like me."" I miss the days of meeting someone random teaming up and raiding a base that the players are online to defend themselves. Now its players in global chat asking for help to raid a base that has ""tons of loot"" while not one player is online to defend it. If you're a new player to rust and just recently purchased the game I feel sorry for you because you wont get a great experience because of the egdelords and reddit kids who now plague every server.

2019-01-15,0,0,41,False,Recommended,"This is my review so far having played 22.4 hours as a noob.I like this game alot. I think it has alot of potential. I read somewhere that it is still a game in development so I hope this review is at least read even if discarded.I think Rust is one of the most intriguing survial games I have come across so far. On the main servers there really is no forgiveness and at first this seemed insanely harsh especially due to the griefers.I met some people instantly even when I was completely naked and almost had nothing just take me out for ""fun's sake?""Okay I kind of get it. This is a brutal world even though I don't know if there is any story here. Nature mixed with the modern and everyone is hunting each other. Really feels like there should be a main lore here.Anyway I spent about three or four days getting enough materials to start a new base. On the second night I had been successfully farming hemp and collecting in the wild to make a full cloth armor set as well as a decent spear.That same night I saw some guy collecting stuff near my tree and I killed him. I got a number of supplies and added it to my small boxes.I had enough materials to provide protection of my base for a number of days so I really started feeling I would develop my small home to at least stone and possibly a metal door before I had any trouble.Boy I was wrong. Final night I was alive. I heard someone approach. I took out the metal blade I had made from some previous looted metal fragments and wood I had gathered and made what I thought was at least a starter decent metal blade.I had some cloth armor on at this point but not fully clothed because I had been killed by a pig after two or three strikes even after I thought I hit it twice with a wooden bow. I died the previous day to that pig so I lost my full set.This last night I readied my blade and had my door closed though I knew it was weak.In a few moments this guy blew up one of my stone walls or still remaining wooden ones with guns or explosives not sure.However then as I stayed quiet getting ready for him to approach he fires some shots sounding like they were from an AK and boom just like that I died. I didn't even hit him once.My bag was so close though I instantly respawned. This time again naked and just having a rock. I hit him once with the rock I think and ""boom"" I was hit again from some fire from his gun.To be fair I had killed a guy the previous night naked with very little and now this guy had hunted me.Fair and Square and he is going to get all of my loot.However I had just felt like I was begining to develop and since stone doesn't seem as common as wood it's not even that super fast to be able to upgrade to stone walls at least and or a foundation within the first few days and just like that all of your hard work can be gone and you start out again with almost nothing.I get this is part of the game and I don't see this changing where just like that ""boom your gone""However I do feel that the developers want to attract more people and I feel there are alot of players that would seriously hate having to grind even this basic stuff out and just in a heartbeat lose everything after taking so much time and resources to develop even minimal protection and progress.I am not going to advocate that pvp servers should be gone. That would ruin the point of the game as a survival one.I do question though if at least some specific servers should be dedicated pve ones or at least safe within certain specific territories.With the world that exists so far I don't think that would be a huge stretch.Not everyone wants to be forced to join a clan or group up to survive.It should be possible at least on some servers that certain zones allow the player to reach at least a certain level of development on their own before being killed orat least allow the player to live within certain small areas of the game where they can not be harrassed at all if they don't want to be bothered.This worked with wow and I don't think it's that bad of an idea.Then if that player chooses to go out into the wider world that isn't protected they are agreeing on taking their chances possibly for higher rewards to entice.I would like to see this game grow but right now considering gamers in a general basis and not just hardcore Rust Fans I feel if the dev's would like this game to grow more it should at least have a bit more dedicated servers to being pve or noob friendly.",Rust

2018-11-24,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Rust certainly has its pros and cons. It's definatly not worth the current price point I bought it during early access for pretty cheap. It's not at all suited for single player. For sure it needs to be played on multi person servers or with friends on a private server. It's pretty simple in regards to gameplay. The challenges come from the threat of other people and thats pretty much it. At least in games like ARK and 7 Days there's those other danger elements that make it more playable alone. The modded servers can be pretty fun. The official servers are completely toxic and are unfortunately the only way to get achievements. If you have other friends who play then its worth getting on sale. If its just you and you're not comfortable playing on multi person servers alone then I suggest looking for something else.,Rust
2017-11-23,0,0,976,False,Recommended,Rust I mean.... what more can I say?!!!!No game will push you to such a high level of anxiety desire mistrust and anger. You'll spend days making an awesome base gathering wicked loot then get raided killed and griefed.... and then want to do it again.No game requires as high and huge a learning curve as Rust where after 1000 hours of gameplay you MIGHT not be considered a noob. But you'll love the journey all the way.And with such a huge following community and highly present developers Rust is always growing and offers a wide variety of game styles and servers for everyone to enjoy and train on. The game is ever growing with constant updates adding more content to increase the replayability.Tthis game is MORE than worth the 20 it cost me (when it was EA),Rust

Me personally just hit 1k hours and i still feel new. Some say its because rust doesnt have a good intro into getting u started but thats the reason why we play. You play how you play. U can get guns by killing someone or grinding to fine them. You can choose to grind on wipe or wait and snowball. Play solo or with 20.

We would call it YGDALNRALWMI for short.First love this game it's as addictive as Minecraft or 7DTD combined with the added bonus of you constantly being hunted by real people not AI. Highly encourage anyone purchasing this game to hit YouTube and watch some of the community ""get started"" videos. If you watch the vids you'll be frustrated for the first two hours. If you don't then you'll be frustrated for many many more.Casual gameply will require some hours. You can't launch the game play for 10 minutes and quit long play sessions are about the only real way to make progress.Once you get the hang of the gameplay and get yourself a cabinet established the game will change a bit. Oh you still die a lot but you'll get the hang of venturing out scavenging/mining resources and returning to base to stash your loot. When you choose a server look for one with a very recent reset or everyone you meet will have machine guns. I found one with a reset two weeks prior and even that was a little brutal but I'm working my way up.The only downside is the long loadtime especially the first time you play a server. The load times are definitely better on subsequent plays but that first one is brutal. Very fun game happy I stumbled onto it. I can see spending hundreds of hours in Rust.",Rust
2018-11-27,0,0,290,False,Not Recommended,"This game was ""officially"" released solely for the purpose of revenue. Wolves still bite you wile facing the opposite direction. lots of cheats and admins only on community servers (if that). the community is full of kids who aren't even supposed to have the game and constant racism and general hate fills the chats. My first experience on the Official Hapis server was like this farmed for 2 hours built base out of stone made furnace made sheet metal doors (including airlock) made boxes logged off next day gathered resources for about 2 hours but log off because work for a living log back on next day find my doors destroyed and new door with key lock stuck inside cant break out leave server. My second experience i decided to go on a smaller server as to decrease the likelyhood of me being griefed as well as hopefully find a community of newer players to trade with and overall have an enjoyable experience play for 4 days over break making a large house and trade with a few players log on fifth day died by (Chinese characters) while offline spawn nearby and head back to base completely intact no doors broken hmmm go inside go through 6 airlocks closing doors behind me and find my inner lootroom stairs destroyed as well as TC everything else fine including walls get shot in back by (same Chinese characters) return again only to see them seal the base off just so i cant use it they leave I give up on game.Overall the game can be fun but playing something for a few days straight only to have some cheater log on and ruin it all as well as monthly wipes is not my idea of fun i would not recommend the experience to anyone. They need to change some things to make the players work together or focus on another foe altogether or have some in game punishment for griefing or destroying people unprovoked such as a heli and group of scientists. until then this game is a pointless grind.",Rust
2018-11-24,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,First impressions are it would be an amazing game but as usual the kiddies who really should not really be playing this sort of game just have to go and ruin it for everybody with their toxic attitudes. It's a shame there are not any servers that implement an age verification system as i imagine playing this on a server with mature people would be an amazing experience.I also wonder if it was created as some kind of social experiment. It has the potential to change you into some kind of sociopath. When i started playing my mindset was 'I could never loot items that someone else has worked hard to gather' half hour in am desperately hungry and thirsty find a dead body with some food and water on them i loot it and feel bad about it. Another half hour goes by and i am killing and looting people without a care in the world.Update being new i did not know about 'server wipes' so basically once a month all the materials you gather the base you build the weapons and armor you craft as well as everything else you manage to gather gets wiped so every month you have to start all over again. Sorry but that makes this the most pointless waste of time/effort game ever.,Rust

""Oh you don't get to choose in real life so you don't get to choose here"" Because in real life I gather wood by hitting a tree wtih a rock after I arrive with nothing but a rock and a torch ........this isn't real life so why deny me a little customisation.Secondly the game makes it needlessly annoying to gather resources. Wood is fine enough stones can only be gathered by finding the small stone clusters on the ground or the minable stones from the very few rocks out of the very many textured rocky areas in the land that you need to get to grips with fast. Most of the time you will be running about trying to find these...then need to worry about your hunger levels which start off drastically low and continue to drop as you run about making a race of who can find the first canned food or chocolate and actually be able to concentrate on normal resources.But it doesn't stop there oh no if you want to build anything and have it last more than a few hours....enjoy stuffing your cupboards full of more resources more running about trying to find stone and other such just to maintain what you have done.Unless you have a lot of friends with you working to help you with this skip it.",Rust

2016-06-25,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,"This game is horrible in its current state. my first life I spawn in and go to a tree when i hear over the voice chat ""start chopping that tree down before i add another death to your usless account peasant"". He then forced me into becoming a slave and joining his already growing slave labor force. I had 2 other people helping me get wood for theses people with guns. then after we got them a couple thousand wood. they lined us up and shot us. By this point I was a lightly salted but I respawn. I go towards some trees and start to get wood I craft a few basic tools from the wood and rocks near by. then i start to get hit i turn around and there is a bear. ""I can take this bear down"" I think so I attack it with my spear. It kills me in 2 seconds. By this point I've moved past lightly salted and more into the salt induced coma. i ask in the chat after i respawn ""does anyone want to team up?"" I rappidly get a responce telling me to kill myself and respawn at the sleeping bag they've made for me. i knew it was a troll but i had nothing to lose so i killed myself. I then respawned in a walled in space with a door and no roof with 5 other people. all we had was the starting rock. then we hear ""who ever survives gets to join us kill each other"" then out of no where they all started to beat each other with rocks. i died again and waited the the required time before respawning in the sleeping bag. I respawn in and its night and they are all gone and sleeping. so i walk over to get my revenge and kill 2 of them in their sleep before being killed. then they destroyed my sleeping bag so i couldn't do it again. after that I still havent returned to this excuse of a game.0/10 would play ""Click the respawn button every 30seconds"" game again",Rust

2018-07-16,0,0,1829,False,Recommended,"Great game fun concept and difficulty is just right it's not too easy when you begin making you work to learn and understand the game further progression allows you to understand more of the mechanics of the game and learn how to speed up the process of starting.Basics for starting off Get off the beach preferably into a thicker forest a place that offers protection and gets you out of the main eye sight of looted players begin by collecting Hemp and Wood and the ocassional stone by this time you need to begin thinking about water and food I'd say hunting is your best bet however the more you feel comfortable then I'd say go ahead and walk into a gas station or supermarket. (Fair warning this one is risky) From this look on the map and try to find the best place with easy water access don't worry about food as you can always plant food or hunt either work and if worse comes to worse and you live near enough to clean drinking water just eat other humans...Simply put the game is hard however slowly becomes easier as you get better towards the game and allows you to open up a great game with friends. BUGS There are a few simple bugs that occur killing an animal on a foundation usually glitches the animal through the floor making it impossible to loot or harvest.If you purchase any skins either from the direct store or from the Market you might get the ""no icon"" bug where it either has no icon in your inventory or has a massive bugges icon.The game also needs some optimization increases personally I don't get many FPS realted issues I can pull just about 60fps at a stable rate but I hear and see a lot of people with the issues.Other then that the game is cleanly made and as already stated brilliant!I love the many differences between textures the attention to detail and the fact no map is the same it gives the game a load of replayability.NOTE Don't play on Community Servers unless incredibly popular most community servers wipe every 4 days due to the fact thier population drops so fast so to get it back up they wipe I'd say go for either an incredibly popular community server or join an offical.Good luck!Still going strong!",Rust

If you like killing and trolling rust has now joined the ranks of sooo many game developers catering to one architype player. I recently revisited rust to find many advancements (visuals / stability) but severe gameplay regression. Rather than moving forward with what rust was originally and building upon it It has gone in reverse and has become the empty shell it is today. Whether or not this is developer resources limitation or lack of vision Rust is no longer the really fun and full of potential game I originally purchased....,Rust

I started on Offical and didn't like the game that much but i kept playing and found a server I liked which really got me into the game. I think it's an amazing game but it does have its down sides. It has a very toxic community but you can run into some really chill and nice people. All I would say to a noob is ""Just keep playing don't worry about dying don't get upset if you get raided and be ready to deal with a toxic community."" Rust in my opionion is better with friends or a clan. The game takes allot of time to get good at and learn recole patterns but when you do I insure you that it'll be worth your money.",Rust

This is a type of game where its kill or be killed if your nice you better watch your back because over 89% of players here haven't been around since the good days of where you could walk up to sombody and say hello now adays nobody would really talk to you. This is a game when you can get drain out the first few 100rds of hours and still not even have a base down once and you might think it is a game because it is but the amount of fun it was with friends was great i am giving this a bad review because this game is made for groups and non aint social people aren't gonna make it here and its funny because you can't even go around talking to people without getting killed.

2018-11-24,0,0,734,False,Recommended,For people who want a quick anwser well there is no really quick anwser because everyone is different but go try it out it's performace is great and graphics are beautiful but be aware that a lot of people are really unfriendly...(Sadly it has become like this before it was a very friendly community now it's hard to find people who are just nice)And now i have played this game for a very long time i even played it cracked but i always knew that i will buy this game even if it is to support it and so i did.But the problem i have with this game is that a lot of people are very unfriendly they don't even let you build anything camp even sometimes trashtalk you...I would highly suggest to ignore those people and if you can have friends playing with you so you will have a higher chance of survival.And then there is the modded servers which are fine but it killed my motivation to play proper vanilla so if you can stay away from it unless you are just fine with playing both.And again i'm not saying that modded servers are bad it's that you get everything really fast and you just don't have any other reason to play really just pvp.And talking about PVP youtubers of rust kinda ruined it with their 'Raid Cams' everyone wanted to be like those clans and missed a very important thing it's a game and people want to have fun and not be sniped from a tower or camped at a spawn.So if you can deal with these problems you are good to go but before that i just want to say that developers are doing a great job of keeping this game alive and fresh i just hope people start changing for the better!Good luck and remmember to have fun!,Rust

2014-06-24,0,0,2235,True,Recommended,Fun to play with friends but dont trust anyone. No one is really friendly...Edit I'm 2000+ hours in and my honest advice/opinion to anyone looking to play this amazing game is the following. You will need to have no social life. The game takes a ton of hours just to get to a point where you feel you have some sort of level playing field with large clans that basicly have 6 10 people. The blueprint grind on this game is hectic. Especially if you play solo on a heavy populated server. (Low pop servers tend to die out quick and get really boring) Watch youtube movies on how to build a proper base otherwise you get raided instantly and you're immediately discouraged from playing the game again. Best server configuration in my opinion is 2 week wipe. (and 2x resource gathering if available ) The grouping system that's been recently introduced has made the solo gameplay really difficult. So I suggest making friends in game and use the system to your advantage.Besides that the game is really fun. During your wipe you'll experience up's and down's. Killing a semi geared guy with a bow and grabing his loot will give you such a rush but minutes later you'll find yourself raided and lose all of it.Nature of the game so don't get attached to anything you make or loot.,Rust

2017-12-29,0,0,2293,False,Recommended,Just over 2k hours. There is strength in numbers this is a game that heavily favours larger groups. Generally the larger your group the further you'll progress. It's extremely unforgivng you can lose 100+ hours of progress in a matter of minutes. This game is best with friends but VERY challenging as a solo. Great game overall best devs of any game I've played.,Rust
2018-12-19,0,0,63,False,Not Recommended,The game could be fun. But the community just sucks. Mostly stupid people who either kill you instantly after respawn or chatter the out of you with stupid talk.I know that this is not a problem of the game itself but it essentially makes the game unplayable unless you become one of those people by yourself. Which is not an option for me.,Rust
2018-12-19,0,0,155,False,Not Recommended,"This is a game that in regular gameplay requires dedication at the cost of corruption.You build a base and spend hours building it up and someone can undo your progress swiftly with a raid. In fact most raids are offline because you weren't on. You have to invest more time to prevent a raid by gathering materials and resources at the cost of losing more progress because of it. The problem is there's no such thing as an ""unraidable base"" because of two things. C4 and ladders. C4 is expensive but it can make short work of external walls and ceilings. Next are ladders. You can place ladders and twig on buildings without build permission so nothing stops you from filling gaps with twig or entering your base at practically any floor because of ladders. Because you can basically always get raided and because a lot is at stake people tend to take it personally. I'm not sure if it just attracts toxicity but people tend to get absolutely I'm fine if people say things in a jokingly hostile manner like opening fire on a building saying ""FBI OPEN UP"" but the people wandering around who kill at random do it mostly for protection as opposed to ""I have a voice in my head. It says I need to harvest you for your flesh"" that's a chaotic violence that's more fun.In terms of irregular gameplay such as Deathmatch servers and modded the stakes are lowered and your progress is not at as much risk because resources gains are higher or there are restrictions preventing you from losing as much. They reduce the burden of being on as much as possible because radiation and decay are reduced or removed and make it more casual so if you have a life you can spend more time with it than worrying about the responsibilities of having to log in a lot or else risk losing your hard work from building. You can't really put it down unless you're fine with putting it down for a while. Or pick a day on a server that wipes and when it wipes retire for a while. Though wipes itself is flawed because you lose all your progress sometimes not including blueprints but with the addition of multiple new researchable items like electronics which are already expensive it raises the stakes even more and make the cost of actually using them where they're worth it is higher. You need to be dedicated and spend a lot of time while be willing to lose that progress to people who are ether faceless or toxic.",Rust
2018-12-19,0,0,122,False,Recommended,One of the best games however you have to be one hell of a sometimes. Rust is one of those games that you'll never forget i've made countless memories and each one i can recall with ease. The game is so good because of how random one minute you could be holding a bow in some leather ponchos and the next you'll be in a hazmat suit and an AK 47 in your hand. Just give it a go but you will need a good pc to run though. Enjoy ),Rust

2018-12-20,0,0,887,False,Recommended,"Rust is a beautifully made game. The landscapes are detailed the monuments are unique and thought out and all of the building materials items and weapons really fit together in this game well. The sound is awesome hearing the chopper in the distance makes you prepare hearing a sachel raid will bring you in for a closer look and hearing the distinct sound of an AK or M249 will make you want to go jump into the action. No other game has made me use my headset as much every footstep matters. All the amazing content being considered it is the lack of content that really defines this game in my mind. It is a very well done open world concept i especially like the procedural maps each wipe keeping things fresh and exciting. What you do where you build how you interact with people is all up to you and makes for a different experience almost every time you turn it on. There is a lot of reviews and comments about a ""toxic community"" but there are plenty of servers to consider to help filter your experience. You can go to a map with 200 people running around on it and get killed around every corner or go to a map with 20 and have mixed to even more positive interaction with people. All this being said it is a pvp game and one should expect to be shot at or raided it is simply part of what this game is. I've only been playing a couple of months but the extra content that has been added including balloons and electricity in that time has all been very cool and interesting. The APC heli and cargo ship are challenging yet excellent ways to get high level items and even more fun when others arrive to take whats yours! The game has it's bugs snags crashes hackers (which i did not experience) and im sure these things will continue to be fixed and optimized but the overall game as a whole is very good in my opinion.",Rust

2018-11-23,0,0,524,False,Recommended,An open world multiplayer survival game sporting monthly updates that are sure to keep you playing in the next wipe. This game is unique in its wipe mechanic meaning that on the first Thursday of every month when the update hits every server and map are reset completely and players start from ground zero once again. This ensures that everyone has a fighting chance in this game and you won't have to worry about going against players with endgame content while you yourself have but a stone spear while keeping the game feeling fresh.I would highly recommend this fun yet challenging game for anyone looking for an online survival experience!

Do rage quit it helps to get back on track again after time!Kill or be Killed! Do Not trust anyone at all. you'll be tempted with lots of offers from players. complying to ""follow me I have an AK for you"" basically you're digging your own grave..Trust me I know.Don't be greedy when looting at high risk level in a second of thought you're dead treasure and a nakie at the beach!Expect to get base raided take a deep breath no need to rush. plan your strategy on how you could handle it as a base owner while enemy's digging your base. you have more attempts to kill the enemy once and for all is a victory! while 1 mistake costs your base!Finally don't get rusted!",Rust

2018-11-09,0,0,145,False,Recommended,Rust is a great game that I have thoroughly enjoyed playing over the last three months since i have purchased it however there are some aspects of the game that are very irritating as well as some information on the store page that is quite misleading to say the least.Lets begin with the positives. The game is very fun to play particularly if you have another friend or two to play it with. The community is also not too bad not the worst or best that i have ever seen. However be careful of who you trust in this game cause not everyone is friendly but there is the odd few who you can trust and maybe join forces with. When you get started in this game there really is no limit to what you can do.The negatives that i have is the crappy optimisation of the game more specifically the fact that the game is plagued with a memory leak that eats up all of my 8gb ddr3 RAM making multitasking on my pc an impossibility so checking discord is a no can do unless of course you want to wait forever and risk crashing the game. This RAM issue is very common and leads me onto my second point which is the minimum system specs that facepunch has advertised for rust. More specifically the RAM requirement which states 8GB but not whether you should have DDR3 or 4. I can answer that question very easily it CANNOT RUN on 8GB DDR3 it has been a pain in the for me running this game and apart from chopping wood mining and crafting anything else is verging unplayable especially when there is such a heavy emphasis on combat in this game so you can't really play the game if every time somebody shoots you your game becomes a power point presentation. I can however run on 8GB DDR4 ram according to my friend so if you have that no problem however i would severely recommend upgrading your ram and/ or mobo (if cpu needs replacing).In conclusion i like this game it is really really fun (when it works) however i regret buying it without looking into it more or upgrading my specs beforehand and honestly i would like them to make the game more reliable especially for the money that you have to pay for it now.,Rust

2018-11-24,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,"Do you have a job college or school to attend? Do you have a life that exists beyond the confines of your bedroom? Do you have an obligation to leave the house at all? Then Rust isn't for you.Doing anything is a long and tedious process building your first base will likely take you a couple of hours. You need to have a good chunk of time to invest in just getting set up in whatever server you choose to join but rest assured that if you have anything at all dragging you away from the PC you'll be back at square one when you return.In order to have a base that you can realistically leave overnight without getting raided it needs to be stone/metal with perimeter walls. This takes HOURS of grinding. Your simple wooden shack might survive without getting blown to kingdom come but only if you're really lucky. If you do manage to survive and over time upgrade your base to something a little more robust than a pile of planks then you'll get to experience the joy of raiding.In between chopping down trees foraging for hemp/mushrooms and mining stone you might have crafted yourself a nice little crude arsenal of spears arrows and hatchets. No doubt you'll be feeling proud about this and certainly more secure knowing that you're armed. You might even feel like you're ready for a little PVP... Spoiler you're not . You will get absolutely f*cking shredded as soon as you come into contact with anyone who isn't a naked. You might think that you can band together with others and face the harshness of the Rust world in solidarity with another mortal but you'll be lucky if you encounter someone who isn't going to kill you steal your loot or flat out ignore you. So then as a new starter ""raiding"" for you will consist solely of wandering the map areas digging through boxes for scrap and cowering in fear whenever you hear another player approach knowing he's going to be fully armoured and sporting an SMG at the very minimum.No matter how much time you've invested in scouring the empty parts of the map for items you'll never be as well equipped as the kids who've been grinding all their waking hours since the last server wipe. Even if the server was only wiped a couple of days ago there'll already be monumental stone and metal bases guarded by turrets. The only way you can get ahead in this game or indeed have any kind of fun playing at an even level is if you and at least two friends can devote HOURS a day every day to grinding and maintaining your base. When I bought this game I was led to believe it was at heart a survival game that rewards co operation and skilful play. The reality is that it's essentially Minecraft with nudity. From the tedious crafting to the aimless gameplay and the autistic shut in playerbase this game apes Mojang's virtual lego in almost every manner except it fails to provide the player with the choice to actually do something else with their time.Frankly the only other thing I can think of that requires this degree of effort and commitment whilst being equally tedious is a full time job. And just in case you have trouble choosing between Rust or a job remember that at least the job pays you.",Rust

2018-11-10,0,0,148,False,Recommended,Amazing game with a dev team that listens to the community most if not all of the time still needs a bit of polish but the hunting and building feels rewarding and if you are in pvp the raiding feels like you accomplished something (which you usually did assuming you did get through) All in all a great game.,Rust

2018-11-09,0,0,1287,False,Recommended,Overall good game a lot of optimization issues but is getting better over time a lot more new content is being added recently. The final question is would I recommend you this game ? Yes although it has problems it has an experience that no other game can give you and amazing memory s with such a diverse community. though a quite a toxic community you can help fix it by being a good sport if you lose cause this game is a learning experience make it a good learning experience even though at times it will be sad when you lose everything but with sad there will be 10x the amount of good times. With that said I recommend this game to anyone that needs that extra push to get it.,Rust
2018-11-09,0,0,368,False,Recommended,Rust is a survival pvp game. You start off with a rock and a torch. You must gather recoreasores to make a base and soon make guns. During gathering you may in counter other players they could be friendly what is rare or the could be hostile what is common. Before I bought rust I got alot of bad results from others I doubted buying rust after that. But now I'm here givin a review and recommending that you guys get the game.

2018-12-20,0,0,352,False,Recommended,Amazing Game Graphics are beautiful mechanics are great and the building exploring and grinding is all really good. The only con about this game doesn't have anything to do with the game itself. The community is garbage people killing you on sight and even before you get the chance to hit a single tree. Get a few friends together build yourself up quickly and have a great time. Solo playing is by far the worst thing to do,Rust
2018-08-10,0,0,1584,False,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game to players who do not have friends that want to play with them and players who do not have over 15 hours a day to put into this game going offline for the smallest amount of time is almost certain for an offline raid at the hands of a bigger group who does not sleep modded is a bit more forgiving but does not yield a true rust experience as vanilla does. building is too complicated for new players so they are easy targets for SOME of the toxic community to screw over and take everything they have built up over the multiple hours they have built up. the game used to be better with offline raids only happening 2 3 days into the wipe which is enough time for anyplayer to get a good experience out of the wipe it's enough time for them to experience everything in the game and have fun whilst doing so. Now you can spend 5 6 hours just focusing on building a base and when you log off you can check for big bases around you might not see any but whilst your asleep another group will have stayed up all night building a bigger base than you and then raid you before you can even wake up the next morning. Rust is not worth the $50 Aus to not be able to properly play vanilla if you do not have 15+ hours on your hands each day and a group to work with the only servers that will yield fun and satisfaction will be those that are modded modded is not worth $50,Rust

2018-10-25,0,0,1041,False,Recommended,Well here we go i started playing Rust when it was still in early access that said it's fair to say i saw a lot of changes through my time playing this game. What is Rust? Rust is a survival game that let's you farm hunt animals build a base and interact with other players that are doing the same thing. I would like to explain how a wipe is played in rust in 3 sectionsWipe A period of time which you play before the server restarts and everyone starts fresh without any bases etc...Early game You first spawn on the beach and with a rock you work your way up to your first base that's usually takes an hour or so depends on what server you play and how lucky are you on the position you spawn. In the early game you will use a bow or a crossbow to protect yourself from other players or animals when you will fell confident enough you will start going to rad towns to loot from boxes and pvp. But the most important thing will always be resources.Mid game You start to get better weapons and you have a good amount of resources to work with your main objective is to get c4 and AK crafted as soon as possible to give you the edge in the pvp's. You will also start hearing explosions of satchels that are going off it gives you the chills if you are going to be the next target.Late game You have all the gear you want you also have the best weapons out there just pvp every time you see someone you feel confident enough to take him out you start raiding the big bases with rockets and c4 if the defenders are online the experience is soooo much better.The game is fun if you play with a group of 3 or 4 you will have tons of fun.PROS The graphics are good maybe not optimized for every graphics card there is but still very enjoyable graphics.Fun to play with friends but you can always play solo if that's your thing.You have so many weapons to choose from so you can pick your style of pvp.The system of crafting and farming is easy to learn and if you don't have the components for the item you want to craft there is always trading with other people that's why there is a server chat.You can make so many different bases layouts it's kinda insane )The devs are very interactive with the community and are also featuring the content creators that are making Rust videos.There are skins for the weapons and also updates every 2 weeks.THE GAME WILL NEVER BE P2W the game is about skill.CONS The community is really toxic.If you don't have a decent internet connection you will not be able to play on the official servers if the closest is still far away from you.ZERGS i have so many complaints about this but i will keep it simple. Zergs are usually 10 or more man groups that usually get the best weapons first and just on the smaller groups that are just starting to get to mid game and you can't really win with 4 friends versus 15 man groups in a small area and if they decide to raid you your base is gone the biggest problem of Rust is toxic zergs and zergs in generally if you ask anyone about zergs everyone will tell you the same thing over and over again. Also i heard of 30 man zergs but never actually seen one on the servers i was playing.I don't play Rust anymore because i lost the hype for playing it and the new updates are not for me liked the old Rust better but that's my opinion. But i will recommend the game to people who like this type of games. There is a ton of gameplay to learn from and also to see how the game actually looks like. The game is a solid 8/10 for me.Gl and HF in the next wipe guys ),Rust

2017-06-14,0,0,1013,False,Recommended,I Billy Herrington stand here today humbled by the task before us mindful of the sacrifices borne by our Nico Nico ancestors.We are in the midst of a crisis. Nico Nico Douga is at war against a far reaching storm of disturbance and deletion. Nico Nico's economy is badly weakened a consequence of carelessness and irresponsibility on the part of acknowledgement but also on the collective failure to make hard choices and to prepare for a new MAD age.Today I say to you that the challenges are real and they are many. They will not be easily met or in a short span of time but know this Nico Nico they will be met. In reaffirming the greatness of our site we understand that greatness is never given our journey has never been one of shortcuts. It has not been for the faint hearted or who seek the fleshly pleasures. Rather it has been the risk takers the wasted genii the creators of MAD things. For us they toiled in sweatshops endured the lash of the spanking. Time and again these men struggled and sacrificed so that we might ... LIVE BETTER.We remain the most powerful site on the Internet our minds no less inventive and services no less needed than they were last week or yesterday or the day before the day after tomorrow. Starting today we must pull up our pants dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking Nico Nico Douga.Now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions who suggest our server system cannot tolerate too many movies. Their memories are short for they have forgotten what Nico Nico already has done what free men can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose.And so to all the people who are watching this video from the grandest cities to the small villages where IKZO was born know that Nico Nico is a friend to every man who seeks the future of love and peace. Now we will begin to responsibly leave authorized common materials to Nico Nico people and forge a hard earned peace in this MAD world.What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. This is the price and the promise of Nico NiCommons citizenship. Nico Nico Douga in the face of common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words WE CAN.Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested by DOS attacks when we were refused by YouTube that we did not turn back nor did we falter and we carried forth that great gift of freedom be delivered and safely to future generations.Thank you. God bless and God bless Nico Nico Douga.,Rust
2017-10-26,0,0,1865,False,Recommended,This game is by far the funnest game i have ever played! I dont know how i didnt quit playing when i was new to the game i basically only played solo and would constantly get stomped on but as i got better and better i found it harder and harder to stop playing! this game is great and i would 100% recommend it to anyone especially if they have someone else to play it with. the best thing about this game is the endless possibilitys and how different it is every time i play! if i were to play fortnite 100 times it would be basically the same every time i played but if i play rust for 100 wipes every wipe is different one wipe i might make a shop and a hotel and then the next i might research AK and dominate military tunnels ect. what im trying to say is this game (even though it might make you want to quit at first) is the greatest game ive ever played. &lt 3,Rust

Set aside the toxic community and the raging kids and it's a really good game I'd recommend starting out and checking out either battle ground rust servers or building servers to get the hang of the game I'd also try to make some friends either in game or get some real friends to get it. The game experience is very enjoyable and the concept is simple but friend's make it 10x better.

But with all great things there is downsides firstly The community It may be one of the most toxic peice of communties i have ever come across. Secondly It's extremely hard to play solo you'll often find yourself being teamed up on and being killed by groups of three plus you'll constantly be raided but if you persist it'll be rewarding.,Rust

2015-07-04,0,0,352,False,Not Recommended,I reviewed this game in 2015. I played it maybe 20 hours and I gave it a negative review because logging on every day getting raided while at work wasn't fun. Gave it a go in the following years and more seriously here lately. To be honest I only have 350 hours in the game and learned a great deal. But messuring my disapointment vs fun disapointment always seem to win out. Working all weekened to make supplies to raid and getting head shot before you get to use them. Logging in and finding your base has been raided and taken over. Honestly I can get over it and move forward. All apart of learning. But what I can't get past is the scrap grind only to be met with a reset later. All my time is focused on grinding luckyt to get a decent gun which is short lived on how long you can have it before your killed so you never get the exprience to use it correctly. Mean while I could play any FPS game and just be given what is needed to have fun. If I wanted to play a build game I could play something like minecraft and login to all my stuff the very next day. So I find myself asking why don't I just do that? That's exactly what I do each year I try it. See you late 2019 and well see where it's at.,Rust

2018-11-02,0,0,425,False,Not Recommended,While Rust can be fun it is so poorly optimized that it sometimes won't even connect you to a server.

I run an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM a 1080 and basically everything else that was top line quality back in 2016/2017 in addition to having WiFi speeds of 200 MB down. I can get 120 frames on max settings in PUBG easily but in this game I struggle to consistently hit 100 and average somewhere around 80 fps and this is not even at max graphics.

2017-06-23,0,0,596,False,Not Recommended,After starting rust shortly after the component system was introduced this was one of the best games i'd ever played. It was fun and I didn't have to spend all week playing to have fun. After the blueprint system was introduced it is nearly impossible to join a server and stand a fair chance. You will be fighting guys with AKs with your crossbow. Nearly all weapons are locked behind RNG of trying to find the right item to research or blueprint. The scrap system is incredible unbalanced requiring an unimaginable amount of time required to gather enough to even make a high enough tier workbench to even craft weapons. With no balance against clans on offical servers you will spend a lot of your time dying to not more skilled players but trihard teenagers with better gear and more teammates than you. The game requires all of your time to keep any decent sized base up for any long period of time and weapons are not satisfying to use with the exception of the bow and crossbow and a few of the higher tier weapons. This game is not fun solo and you better pray your group is skilled enough to survive. I cannot recommend this game with its current blueprint system.,Rust
